1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.220
So what I want to do today,

2
00:00:02.221 --> 00:00:02.521
again,

3
00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:04.800
this is a parallel holding pattern lecture.

4
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.940
I'm going to talk about absolute rule and this parallels what's you're reading.

5
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:10.470
It's just to make clear,

6
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.131
uh,

7
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:15.150
with some emphasis about the importance of the development of,

8
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.010
of absolute rule.

9
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.221
Now,

10
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:18.930
one of the points I made last week,

11
00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:20.040
for those of you who were here,

12
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.550
uh,

13
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.600
I is that,

14
00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:21.751
you know,

15
00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:24.390
one of the themes that ties European history together and,

16
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.081
uh,

17
00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:25.621
is,

18
00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:26.220
uh,

19
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.791
uh,

20
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:27.401
the growth of,

21
00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:30.060
of the modern state of state making is,

22
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:33.750
tends to be an awkward expression or term that is used by,

23
00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:34.210
uh,

24
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.310
uh,

25
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.280
by historians.

26
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.060
Um,

27
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.880
and if you look at the way states are,

28
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.780
uh,

29
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.961
uh,

30
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:40.980
in Europe now,

31
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:42.990
whether it'd be relatively decentralized,

32
00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:43.441
such as,

33
00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:43.821
as,

34
00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:47.790
as Great Britain or extraordinarily centralized as,

35
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:48.271
uh,

36
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:49.104
my France,

37
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.770
uh,

38
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.001
the,

39
00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:52.590
the origins of the modern state,

40
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.250
uh,

41
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.030
must impart,

42
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.350
be seen in this kind of remarkable period of,

43
00:00:57.351 --> 00:00:59.370
of a European history,

44
00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.911
uh,

45
00:00:59.911 --> 00:01:04.911
from the early 17th century through the middle of the 18th century.

46
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:06.450
Now,

47
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.330
there were a,

48
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.060
we have a process in late medieval Europe of the consolidation of,

49
00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:12.451
of,

50
00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:13.020
uh,

51
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.700
of territorial monarchies.

52
00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:14.911
I mean,

53
00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:16.440
you did have monarchies like Spain,

54
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.280
England,

55
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.821
and France.

56
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:18.181
Namely,

57
00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:19.014
those were the,

58
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.150
the three most important ones that,

59
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:22.830
that in which rulers consolidated,

60
00:01:22.831 --> 00:01:25.800
brushed to claimants to power aside and,

61
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.460
uh,

62
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.400
consolidated,

63
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.320
consolidated,

64
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.040
uh,

65
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.670
their,

66
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.881
uh,

67
00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:30.750
their rule.

68
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.920
But the period of absolute rule really a comes,

69
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:35.480
uh,

70
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.610
uh,

71
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.310
begins really in the mid 17th century,

72
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.971
uh,

73
00:01:38.971 --> 00:01:43.971
and is to be found in those states that had specific kinds of,

74
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.001
of,

75
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:46.230
of social structures.

76
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.890
And this is a point we'll come back to a particularly when we're talking about,

77
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.200
uh,

78
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.600
the two most important states,

79
00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:52.051
two of the,

80
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:56.520
of the great powers of the period that did not have absolute a rule.

81
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.121
Uh,

82
00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:59.280
and in which in the case of of England,

83
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.000
uh,

84
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.900
the civil war was,

85
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:02.130
was largely fought,

86
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.650
eh,

87
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.900
to have to great extent anyway,

88
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.640
trying to prevent England,

89
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:06.180
I think.

90
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.920
Which monarchy from taking on characteristics of those absolute,

91
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:13.800
those emerging absolute states on the continent.

92
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.520
And I'll talk next Wednesday about English and British slash.

93
00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:19.080
British cause Britain doesn't exist.

94
00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:20.130
Those 1707,

95
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.790
uh,

96
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.790
self identity and how not being an absolute state is part of what a emerged in

97
00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:29.550
the sense of being British and being Dutch.

98
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.473
Certainly,

99
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.740
arguably even more,

100
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.430
uh,

101
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.290
had had to do a with that because of the proximity of,

102
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:38.430
of the direct threat to the Dutch by,

103
00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:39.000
uh,

104
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.480
uh,

105
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.921
by the,

106
00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:41.010
the megalomaniac,

107
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.360
uh,

108
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.970
uh,

109
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.160
Louis the 14th who a modestly referred to himself as,

110
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.460
as,

111
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.550
as the sun king.

112
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.750
Um,

113
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.910
so between 1650,

114
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.660
uh,

115
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.340
and 1750,

116
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.320
and it says right out of what you're reading,

117
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:56.190
uh,

118
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.820
the rulers of continental Europe of the biggest states extended their power.

119
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.630
Um,

120
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.670
and so there were two aspects of this.

121
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.850
One is they extend their ability to extract resources out of their own

122
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.720
populations.

123
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.860
And second,

124
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.460
uh,

125
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.120
they,

126
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.780
uh,

127
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.770
they worked to,

128
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.220
uh,

129
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.220
increase their dynastic holdings at the expense of their neighbors munching

130
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:23.290
smaller states,

131
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.830
uh,

132
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.830
or in a by marriages or by wars against their big arrivals.

133
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.131
I mean,

134
00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:32.860
one of the most interesting examples of that is the 30 years' war,

135
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:36.130
which starts before this course and ends before this course were really with the

136
00:03:36.131 --> 00:03:37.180
beginning of this core 16,

137
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:37.780
18,

138
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.351
16,

139
00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:38.831
48,

140
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:40.510
which I'm going to come back to a little bit,

141
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.921
uh,

142
00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:41.061
in,

143
00:03:41.061 --> 00:03:41.861
in a while,

144
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:43.510
is that what begins as,

145
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:44.440
uh,

146
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.741
as,

147
00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:45.011
as,

148
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:49.060
as a religious war between Protestants and Catholics,

149
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.020
uh,

150
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.201
uh,

151
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:54.100
ends up being a dynastic struggle between two Catholic powers,

152
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.960
consolidating their authority over their own peoples and expanding their

153
00:03:58.961 --> 00:04:00.160
dynastic domains,

154
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.540
thus Austria,

155
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.230
uh,

156
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.063
and uh,

157
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.791
and France.

158
00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:06.490
And so that tells you that's an important point because it tells you what really

159
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:08.590
the big picture is going to,

160
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.410
um,

161
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:10.720
is going to emerge.

162
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.030
And so when we're talking about the growth of absolute rule,

163
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.770
we're talking about France.

164
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.590
That is,

165
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.940
you know,

166
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.650
the sun king pressure,

167
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.480
particularly Frederick the great,

168
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.120
uh,

169
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.210
about whom you can read Russia,

170
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.811
Peter,

171
00:04:22.811 --> 00:04:24.730
the grade about whom I will,

172
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:25.020
um,

173
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.290
have,

174
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.280
have something to say in a week or two.

175
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:27.771
I don't know.

176
00:04:27.771 --> 00:04:29.230
When Austria,

177
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.320
aforementioned and Sweden and Sweden kind of disappears from the great power

178
00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:36.004
stage,

179
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.580
uh,

180
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.400
when they're defeated by Peter,

181
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.160
the great,

182
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.431
uh,

183
00:04:39.431 --> 00:04:39.731
in,

184
00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:40.300
when is it?

185
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.920
1709.

186
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.410
Now what did it mean to be an absolute ruler?

187
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.040
What it meant was that in principle,

188
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.700
uh,

189
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.440
your power was a greater than,

190
00:04:52.441 --> 00:04:52.730
uh,

191
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.090
than any challenge that could come from,

192
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.660
you know,

193
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.493
those,

194
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.490
those underlings,

195
00:04:57.491 --> 00:05:02.230
those craven reptiles and your imagination over whom you ruled.

196
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.890
Um,

197
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.460
but there's a balance to it that,

198
00:05:04.461 --> 00:05:04.761
that I'll,

199
00:05:04.761 --> 00:05:05.594
I'll discuss,

200
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.830
uh,

201
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:06.760
in a while.

202
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.740
Um,

203
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.440
uh,

204
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.921
and so there,

205
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:09.081
there,

206
00:05:09.081 --> 00:05:12.490
there isn't really can't be a challenge to them from the state,

207
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:13.300
uh,

208
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.421
uh,

209
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:14.380
themselves.

210
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.560
And so they make their personal or dynastic rule absolute based on loyalty to

211
00:05:20.681 --> 00:05:22.930
them as individuals.

212
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.740
Uh,

213
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.210
and not to,

214
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.571
uh,

215
00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:28.390
the state has some sort of abstraction.

216
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.961
Of course,

217
00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:32.950
one of the interesting things that we'll hear about a in a couple of days is the

218
00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:36.190
fact that that British national identity,

219
00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:40.000
which is formed precociously early in European history,

220
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.910
uh,

221
00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.410
a arguably in the 17th century and,

222
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.150
and suffer elites perhaps even before,

223
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.070
uh,

224
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.350
uh,

225
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.880
has this sort of constitutional balance between the rights of parliament,

226
00:05:51.881 --> 00:05:52.720
victorious in the,

227
00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:53.261
in the,

228
00:05:53.261 --> 00:05:54.910
in the English civil war,

229
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.361
uh,

230
00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:57.220
and loyalty to,

231
00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:57.800
uh,

232
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.840
to the monarchy now.

233
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:00.380
Um,

234
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.990
so absolute rulers assert their,

235
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.550
their right to make laws to reclaim,

236
00:06:07.551 --> 00:06:09.470
to announce laws with a wave of their,

237
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:10.011
of their,

238
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:10.260
uh,

239
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.820
uh,

240
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:11.900
a chubby hands,

241
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.530
uh,

242
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.360
to levy taxes,

243
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.260
uh,

244
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.890
and,

245
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:16.101
uh,

246
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:20.750
to appoint Fischels who will carry out their will.

247
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.590
So,

248
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.771
I mean,

249
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:25.040
it's possible to talk about the bureaucratization of medieval states if you

250
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:25.431
want,

251
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:26.040
but it's still,

252
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.010
it's when you look at the long range,

253
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.370
a growth of bureaucracies as part of government,

254
00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:32.780
as part of state formation.

255
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:33.730
That's why,

256
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:34.220
uh,

257
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.491
uh,

258
00:06:34.491 --> 00:06:34.731
you know,

259
00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:34.901
the,

260
00:06:34.901 --> 00:06:38.180
the growth of these bureaucracies is one of the characteristics of these

261
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:40.880
absolute states in all of these,

262
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.260
these big time,

263
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:42.670
uh,

264
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:43.010
uh,

265
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.843
powers.

266
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.780
Um,

267
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:45.561
and so,

268
00:06:45.561 --> 00:06:46.070
uh,

269
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.371
uh,

270
00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:47.510
what they do is,

271
00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:47.871
is,

272
00:06:47.871 --> 00:06:48.051
well,

273
00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:49.070
let me give you a couple of examples.

274
00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:49.461
I mean,

275
00:06:49.461 --> 00:06:54.200
for one more thing absolute monarchs don't want is they don't want impediments

276
00:06:54.201 --> 00:06:55.610
to their personal rule.

277
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:55.971
Now,

278
00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:58.670
what was the kind of an impediment to their personal rule?

279
00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:59.900
One would be handsy.

280
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.910
What would be the municipal privileges?

281
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.751
For example,

282
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:04.790
in the German port towns,

283
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.400
uh,

284
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:05.601
you know,

285
00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:07.790
Lubeck and Homburg and the others,

286
00:07:07.791 --> 00:07:09.560
they formed this Hanseatic League,

287
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.900
uh,

288
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.820
and Germany,

289
00:07:10.821 --> 00:07:13.010
remote remains decentralized.

290
00:07:13.011 --> 00:07:14.290
There's all sorts of states.

291
00:07:14.291 --> 00:07:15.620
Some are more powerful than others,

292
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.700
but Germany is not unified until 1871.

293
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:20.630
Um,

294
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:21.381
but if you go to,

295
00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:22.310
if you think of Spain,

296
00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:24.710
if you need to be hitchhiking through Spain or something like that,

297
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:24.841
or,

298
00:07:24.841 --> 00:07:25.420
or,

299
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:25.760
uh,

300
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.220
or through the south of France or Europe passes,

301
00:07:28.221 --> 00:07:29.510
and if you go to a town like Aviva,

302
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.680
a in Spain,

303
00:07:30.681 --> 00:07:30.831
I mean,

304
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:32.330
I realized one of the most fantastic,

305
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:33.140
uh,

306
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:33.291
you know,

307
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:35.540
fortified wall towns in,

308
00:07:35.541 --> 00:07:35.790
in,

309
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:36.090
in,

310
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:36.921
in Europe,

311
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:39.170
or if you're going to need him in the south of France and new,

312
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.560
you'll see boulevards that people raise motorcycles around all the time.

313
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.520
We'll keep you up all night.

314
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:44.120
Uh,

315
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.020
there are no walls there anymore because the king had them knocked down.

316
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.480
And so what happens with miscible privileges,

317
00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:52.520
towns that had been this full privileges,

318
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:52.941
uh,

319
00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:53.870
these are,

320
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.670
uh,

321
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:59.330
roaded and then virtually eliminated by powerful potentates.

322
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:04.040
In the case of Neem and I am a e which was a Protestant town,

323
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.390
they knocked down the wall.

324
00:08:05.391 --> 00:08:06.320
So the Protestants have,

325
00:08:06.321 --> 00:08:10.760
nene could not defend themselves against this all conquering Catholic monarch.

326
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.640
And so municipal privileges,

327
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.410
walls were put up for a variety of reasons around towns.

328
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:15.891
You know,

329
00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:17.300
playing for example,

330
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:17.840
you know,

331
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.501
Dubrovnik,

332
00:08:18.501 --> 00:08:19.730
one of my favorite cities in Europe,

333
00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:21.740
Dubrovnik had these magnificent walls.

334
00:08:21.741 --> 00:08:25.130
You can walk all the way round and they have a quarantine house where they would

335
00:08:25.131 --> 00:08:29.000
put people who are travelers arriving there because walls kept out plagues

336
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:30.043
walls.

337
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:30.800
Uh,

338
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.311
keep out,

339
00:08:31.311 --> 00:08:32.240
Matt said to him,

340
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:32.720
you know,

341
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.710
evil doers,

342
00:08:33.711 --> 00:08:33.831
I,

343
00:08:33.831 --> 00:08:35.840
they keep out bandits and things like that.

344
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.630
And the doors literally slam shut at night.

345
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:43.810
There was a case of a very minor insurrection in an obscure Italian city in,

346
00:08:43.871 --> 00:08:44.660
in the,

347
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:44.841
uh,

348
00:08:44.841 --> 00:08:45.470
18,

349
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:45.800
uh,

350
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.150
in 1848 where the,

351
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:47.481
the,

352
00:08:47.481 --> 00:08:47.691
the,

353
00:08:47.691 --> 00:08:49.550
the people of the town literally locked,

354
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.210
uh,

355
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.130
the rule out of the town.

356
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:52.731
Now,

357
00:08:52.731 --> 00:08:52.971
what,

358
00:08:52.971 --> 00:08:53.300
what,

359
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:53.541
uh,

360
00:08:53.541 --> 00:08:54.560
in Italy remains,

361
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:55.771
you know,

362
00:08:55.771 --> 00:09:00.771
the tradition of these central of these decentralized city states that were the

363
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:02.040
heart of the renaissance,

364
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:05.460
Italy is not unified to the extent it was ever been unified,

365
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.851
uh,

366
00:09:05.851 --> 00:09:06.870
until the 18,

367
00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:08.490
16 and 1870s.

368
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.270
So,

369
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:09.540
uh,

370
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:09.831
what,

371
00:09:09.831 --> 00:09:10.230
what the,

372
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.700
what these kings do,

373
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.061
uh,

374
00:09:12.061 --> 00:09:13.040
these kings and that,

375
00:09:13.041 --> 00:09:13.261
you know,

376
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:13.621
these,

377
00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:14.131
these,

378
00:09:14.131 --> 00:09:14.580
uh,

379
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.000
uh,

380
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.650
and in Queens is they,

381
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:17.340
uh,

382
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:17.921
they,

383
00:09:17.921 --> 00:09:17.960
uh,

384
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.370
get rid of these impediments to their,

385
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:20.730
uh,

386
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.563
to their,

387
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:21.931
uh,

388
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:22.860
to their authority.

389
00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:24.840
I even take the word Burger,

390
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.880
a burger or bourgeois.

391
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.730
Bourgeois is the French word is more of a cultural sense,

392
00:09:29.731 --> 00:09:31.470
but also as a class sense,

393
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:36.680
a bourgeois or a burger with somebody who lived in a city and was a,

394
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:41.930
and w w assume that some of the justice that was levied against him or her,

395
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.531
uh,

396
00:09:43.531 --> 00:09:44.360
would be,

397
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:44.730
uh,

398
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:45.451
the result of,

399
00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:45.810
of,

400
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:49.500
of decisions taken locally and now big time.

401
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.680
A big powerful absolute monarchs don't want that.

402
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:56.040
And so part of the whole process is the elimination of these,

403
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.551
uh,

404
00:09:56.551 --> 00:09:57.570
these municipal,

405
00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:57.990
uh,

406
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.860
privileges.

407
00:09:59.070 --> 00:09:59.640
Um,

408
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.630
and so,

409
00:10:00.631 --> 00:10:01.290
uh,

410
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:01.681
uh,

411
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:06.681
and replacing municipal officials to make a long story short with people that

412
00:10:07.081 --> 00:10:07.740
they have,

413
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:08.290
uh,

414
00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:08.630
uh,

415
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:12.450
appointed and they eliminate the one privilege above all that they want to,

416
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.340
the big guys want to get rid of is the,

417
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.160
is,

418
00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.220
is the right to not be taxed.

419
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.380
Peak is part of being an absolute ruler,

420
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.920
uh,

421
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.860
is being able to levy taxes against,

422
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:23.071
uh,

423
00:10:23.071 --> 00:10:23.910
against those,

424
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.530
uh,

425
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:26.220
of those people who have the,

426
00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.400
the joy or the extreme misfortune of living,

427
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:29.761
uh,

428
00:10:29.761 --> 00:10:30.450
in,

429
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:30.781
uh,

430
00:10:30.781 --> 00:10:32.670
in those domains.

431
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:35.190
And more about that later.

432
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:35.671
But,

433
00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:40.671
so what happens with all of this is that absolute rule impinges directly on the

434
00:10:41.011 --> 00:10:42.570
lives of ordinary people,

435
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:47.750
more than then kingly or Queen Lee or princely or Archbishop Lee Power had,

436
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:50.010
uh,

437
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.250
had intruded on the lives of ordinary people,

438
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.670
uh,

439
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:54.503
before that.

440
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.290
And so,

441
00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:55.531
I mean,

442
00:10:55.531 --> 00:11:00.030
these rulers have a course of ability in trading.

443
00:11:00.031 --> 00:11:04.620
I'll come back to this large standing armies that will be arriving,

444
00:11:04.621 --> 00:11:05.490
not immediately.

445
00:11:05.491 --> 00:11:09.060
They're not arriving by train or being Hilo Copter and in at some dissident

446
00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:09.571
command,

447
00:11:09.571 --> 00:11:10.920
but they will get there.

448
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:11.821
If there's trouble,

449
00:11:11.821 --> 00:11:13.290
they will arrive and they will get,

450
00:11:13.291 --> 00:11:17.790
they'll get there and they will enforce the will of the monarch.

451
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.170
Uh,

452
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:18.721
and we'll see.

453
00:11:18.721 --> 00:11:22.410
The statistics are really just fascinating about how big these armies,

454
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:23.100
uh,

455
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:23.933
become.

456
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:24.720
Um,

457
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.440
and so the argument that I'm going to make drawing upon again,

458
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.070
Ted Rab Theater rebs,

459
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:30.870
uh,

460
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:32.200
he's not the only one who made this argument,

461
00:11:32.201 --> 00:11:33.650
but he's made that more clearly than that.

462
00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:34.650
And most people,

463
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.450
absolutism may be seen as a,

464
00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.480
as an attempt to reassert a public order and coerce of state authority after

465
00:11:45.811 --> 00:11:48.690
this period of utter turmoil.

466
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:50.550
The English civil war,

467
00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:52.050
the,

468
00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:52.620
uh,

469
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:53.080
the,

470
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.930
the 30 years' war in which parts of central Europe,

471
00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:58.120
a quarter of the population disappeared,

472
00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:59.050
were killed,

473
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.380
murdered in ways that I will unfortunately show you in a while.

474
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:03.160
Uh,

475
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:03.993
and um,

476
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.530
more than this,

477
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:06.240
uh,

478
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:06.490
what,

479
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:09.670
what happens is that these,

480
00:12:09.671 --> 00:12:09.851
that,

481
00:12:09.851 --> 00:12:14.851
that the nobles who in all these countries going back to the medieval period had

482
00:12:16.091 --> 00:12:20.610
had privileges that they were asserting visa vi their monarchs.

483
00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.060
They will say,

484
00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:22.780
ah,

485
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:27.780
we will agree to be junior partners and absolutism in exchange for the

486
00:12:29.951 --> 00:12:32.050
protection that you,

487
00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:37.051
the big guy and your armies can provide us so that we don't have to lie awake

488
00:12:39.371 --> 00:12:44.320
wondering who is coming up the path to the big house.

489
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.700
Is it peasants who are going to come and assert,

490
00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:49.660
uh,

491
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:49.771
you know,

492
00:12:49.771 --> 00:12:51.910
the rights of the poor against us.

493
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:56.940
And at a time of insurrections in a popular insurrections and all sorts of

494
00:12:57.431 --> 00:12:57.941
countries,

495
00:12:57.941 --> 00:13:02.470
think of all the instructions of all the people that followed faults as ours to

496
00:13:02.471 --> 00:13:03.520
other slaughter and,

497
00:13:03.521 --> 00:13:04.354
and Russia,

498
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:05.140
uh,

499
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:05.441
that,

500
00:13:05.441 --> 00:13:06.340
that the Nobel say,

501
00:13:06.341 --> 00:13:06.891
all right,

502
00:13:06.891 --> 00:13:10.210
we agree to be junior partners and absolute rule,

503
00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:10.810
uh,

504
00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:15.810
in exchange to recognize in your supreme authority over us and exchange for the

505
00:13:17.651 --> 00:13:19.720
protection of that,

506
00:13:19.721 --> 00:13:21.670
that you will afford us.

507
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:22.570
You know,

508
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.340
private armies are disappearing.

509
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.590
The armies of the state,

510
00:13:26.591 --> 00:13:28.060
or as you'll see in a while are,

511
00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:28.450
are,

512
00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:29.380
are growing.

513
00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:30.940
And Moreover,

514
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:31.833
you,

515
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.141
oh,

516
00:13:32.141 --> 00:13:33.130
big guy,

517
00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:34.451
you will,

518
00:13:34.451 --> 00:13:35.950
will assert our pro,

519
00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:36.870
our own privileges.

520
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.970
You will recognize our privileges as nobles.

521
00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:41.920
And so it's a trade off,

522
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.080
but an absolute states,

523
00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:49.680
there's no doubt who rules and who helps rule.

524
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.610
And so I an absolute states,

525
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:55.300
uh,

526
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:55.571
you know,

527
00:13:55.571 --> 00:14:00.010
big noble families are very happy to send a their offspring,

528
00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:00.670
uh,

529
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.640
to become a commanders in the army and navy are,

530
00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:04.870
they never do a damn thing,

531
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:05.560
uh,

532
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.040
or to become big bishops like Talia Hall,

533
00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.280
who was a teenage bishop,

534
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.090
uh,

535
00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:10.301
you know,

536
00:14:10.301 --> 00:14:10.960
literally,

537
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.590
uh,

538
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.970
uh,

539
00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:12.581
and,

540
00:14:12.581 --> 00:14:14.080
and to profit from,

541
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:14.680
uh,

542
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.280
from,

543
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:15.610
uh,

544
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.790
from the state while recognizing that the,

545
00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:20.170
that the big guy,

546
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.710
the king and the queen have absolute authority over them.

547
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:25.263
Now,

548
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.920
the classic case of course,

549
00:14:26.921 --> 00:14:27.850
Louis the 14th,

550
00:14:27.851 --> 00:14:28.070
I mean,

551
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:29.350
you can read about now,

552
00:14:29.351 --> 00:14:30.131
Louis the 14th,

553
00:14:30.131 --> 00:14:31.540
when he was a kid,

554
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.060
he was about 12 or 13 years old.

555
00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.290
He lived in Paris.

556
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:36.680
He lived,

557
00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:36.910
uh,

558
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.320
in the [inaudible] palace,

559
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.740
which was burned along the cen,

560
00:14:39.741 --> 00:14:40.870
which is burned in 18,

561
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:41.471
uh,

562
00:14:41.471 --> 00:14:43.690
1871 during the commune.

563
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:49.230
And there was a huge old insurrection called the phone for,

564
00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:54.810
and the IA phoned a kind of a slingshot that Paris street urchins used to use

565
00:14:54.981 --> 00:14:55.131
to,

566
00:14:55.131 --> 00:14:55.341
you know,

567
00:14:55.341 --> 00:14:58.550
shoot fancy people with rocks as they rode their carriages,

568
00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.260
uh,

569
00:14:59.260 --> 00:14:59.510
uh,

570
00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.040
through the muddy streets of Paris.

571
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:05.510
And it's a noble insurrection against royal authority.

572
00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:05.811
And,

573
00:15:05.811 --> 00:15:07.940
and in ovanion central France,

574
00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:10.820
you have people rising up against their lords thing.

575
00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:11.391
Hell with you.

576
00:15:11.391 --> 00:15:12.440
We're not going to pay anymore.

577
00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.930
And when he's a boy in,

578
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.960
he hears the crowd shouting outside of the royal palace in Paris and it scares

579
00:15:20.301 --> 00:15:21.134
the hell out of them.

580
00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.160
And at one time they burst into his bedroom and he's a little guy.

581
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.230
And when he,

582
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:31.160
when Royal Authority conquers these rebels,

583
00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:31.821
the phone,

584
00:15:31.821 --> 00:15:32.510
Duh,

585
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:33.750
you don't have to memorize that,

586
00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:36.250
but the F R and d when it's good that,

587
00:15:36.251 --> 00:15:36.440
you know,

588
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.330
for cocktail party conversation or something like that,

589
00:15:38.331 --> 00:15:38.870
but it's uh,

590
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:39.703
it's important.

591
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.810
He makes them literally,

592
00:15:41.811 --> 00:15:42.740
he's a bigger guy.

593
00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:45.650
Then they literally come and they bowed down and they,

594
00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:50.700
they swear allegiance to him in exchange for protection and the recognition of,

595
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:53.290
uh,

596
00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:53.680
uh,

597
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.740
of their privileges as nobles is titled,

598
00:15:57.741 --> 00:15:58.574
Nobles.

599
00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.520
And so that's really that finding moment in,

600
00:16:01.521 --> 00:16:02.150
in,

601
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:03.530
in absolute rule.

602
00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:04.400
And so what does,

603
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.110
what does Louis the 14th do?

604
00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:06.830
Well,

605
00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:11.060
he goes out and built Versailles and he only goes back to Paris,

606
00:16:11.061 --> 00:16:12.530
I think three times ever.

607
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.940
He doesn't like Paris and Versailles is only 18 kilometers away.

608
00:16:16.941 --> 00:16:19.250
It's about 11 or 12 miles away.

609
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.230
The women of Paris in October,

610
00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:25.100
many of them are walk devel sy to bring the king back to Paris.

611
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.110
And after that he's essentially,

612
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:30.290
well put it kind of ridiculous like toast and French toast,

613
00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:31.010
uh,

614
00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:31.221
when,

615
00:16:31.221 --> 00:16:32.180
when that happens.

616
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.760
But so he builds this big week,

617
00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.420
I've called it a noble theme park,

618
00:16:35.421 --> 00:16:36.254
basically,

619
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.960
uh,

620
00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.520
Advil sign.

621
00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.160
It's not the most interesting of the chateau at all.

622
00:16:40.161 --> 00:16:41.660
The most interesting as Volvo v COMP,

623
00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:42.071
which is,

624
00:16:42.071 --> 00:16:42.411
is,

625
00:16:42.411 --> 00:16:42.920
uh,

626
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:43.700
uh,

627
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:44.533
southeast of,

628
00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:44.811
uh,

629
00:16:44.811 --> 00:16:45.680
of Paris.

630
00:16:45.681 --> 00:16:49.070
But it's a big sort of sprawling of gardens everywhere.

631
00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.740
10,000 nobles live there.

632
00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:52.753
How boring.

633
00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:54.890
But the point was that they could,

634
00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:57.530
they could be watched that they're not gonna,

635
00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:58.010
you know,

636
00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:00.650
they can chase each other's wives and mistresses around,

637
00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:01.440
uh,

638
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.470
and they can eat big drunk in meals.

639
00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.670
The Chateau was so big that when it is,

640
00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:06.351
freezes,

641
00:17:06.351 --> 00:17:06.770
they,

642
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:06.921
they,

643
00:17:06.921 --> 00:17:07.100
you know,

644
00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:07.821
they would walk,

645
00:17:07.821 --> 00:17:10.280
they were trying to get to the bathroom and most of them never made it and sort

646
00:17:10.281 --> 00:17:11.930
of peed on these long corridors.

647
00:17:11.931 --> 00:17:12.021
It,

648
00:17:12.021 --> 00:17:16.340
some of you have seen in the wine would freeze on the way from the kitchen to a,

649
00:17:16.341 --> 00:17:17.174
it has said,

650
00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:17.630
uh,

651
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.901
uh,

652
00:17:17.901 --> 00:17:18.291
to,

653
00:17:18.291 --> 00:17:18.730
uh,

654
00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:19.010
you know,

655
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:19.251
to the,

656
00:17:19.251 --> 00:17:20.630
the big dining hall.

657
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.290
Uh,

658
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:26.000
but he has 10,000 of these dudes and dudettes is there that he's going to watch

659
00:17:26.001 --> 00:17:27.690
over so that they can,

660
00:17:27.691 --> 00:17:30.980
they can conspire against each other and they can hit on each other's wives and

661
00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:31.460
mistresses.

662
00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.510
He could give one damn,

663
00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:33.230
but,

664
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:34.820
but he can control them there.

665
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.360
And he knew he only goes back to Paris three times ever.

666
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:39.051
All the time.

667
00:17:39.051 --> 00:17:40.410
He's expanding his own part,

668
00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.330
personal power,

669
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:42.470
visa vi the,

670
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:43.130
uh,

671
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.080
his own population and,

672
00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:45.321
you know,

673
00:17:45.321 --> 00:17:48.110
conquering a Alsace and parts of the hand and,

674
00:17:48.111 --> 00:17:48.421
and,

675
00:17:48.421 --> 00:17:48.681
and,

676
00:17:48.681 --> 00:17:49.110
uh,

677
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.261
you know,

678
00:17:49.261 --> 00:17:50.850
going to these navigable,

679
00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:51.420
you know,

680
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.560
natural frontiers.

681
00:17:52.561 --> 00:17:53.191
I'm an employee in thought,

682
00:17:53.191 --> 00:17:55.110
the natural for tier with the Pacific Ocean.

683
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:55.890
Uh,

684
00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:56.131
you know,

685
00:17:56.131 --> 00:17:57.300
that would be another story.

686
00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:57.691
But,

687
00:17:57.691 --> 00:17:58.110
but,

688
00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.910
but so this is what,

689
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:00.721
in a nutshell,

690
00:18:00.721 --> 00:18:02.520
kind of what absolute TISM was.

691
00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:03.371
But Let,

692
00:18:03.371 --> 00:18:06.600
let me say two things now after having said that,

693
00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:08.220
that,

694
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:08.880
um,

695
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.870
there were,

696
00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:12.960
there are doctrines and you can read about this stuff even mean Jesus obvious,

697
00:18:12.961 --> 00:18:13.290
but,

698
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:14.550
but there were doctrines of,

699
00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.820
of absolutism that originated with jurists early.

700
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.001
I mean,

701
00:18:18.001 --> 00:18:19.650
so this was out there.

702
00:18:19.651 --> 00:18:24.651
There was a theoretical conceptual framework for having a king or queen having

703
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.063
absolute,

704
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.341
uh,

705
00:18:26.341 --> 00:18:27.210
powers.

706
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.313
Um,

707
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:28.860
and,

708
00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:29.560
um,

709
00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:29.730
the,

710
00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:29.900
the,

711
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:34.900
even the development of this theory of absolute rule is in response to,

712
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:35.521
uh,

713
00:18:35.521 --> 00:18:39.380
the rise of these territorial states like Spain and France and,

714
00:18:39.381 --> 00:18:40.390
and well Russia,

715
00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:40.620
uh,

716
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:41.453
later.

717
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.390
Uh,

718
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:43.140
uh,

719
00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:43.621
and,

720
00:18:43.621 --> 00:18:44.160
uh,

721
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:44.611
so,

722
00:18:44.611 --> 00:18:44.781
uh,

723
00:18:44.781 --> 00:18:45.960
Francis is a good example.

724
00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:46.681
I quote in here,

725
00:18:46.681 --> 00:18:49.140
a guy who croaks before this course starts,

726
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:49.710
but as you want,

727
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:50.760
we'll go down a,

728
00:18:50.761 --> 00:18:50.941
B,

729
00:18:50.941 --> 00:18:51.031
O,

730
00:18:51.031 --> 00:18:51.271
d,

731
00:18:51.271 --> 00:18:51.840
I.

732
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.501
N he says,

733
00:18:52.501 --> 00:18:57.501
seeing that nothing upon earth is greater or a higher next unto God than The

734
00:18:57.751 --> 00:19:00.120
Majesty of kings and sovereign princes.

735
00:19:00.121 --> 00:19:02.220
He wrote in six books of the republic.

736
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.820
The principal point of Sovereign Majesty and absolute power was to consist

737
00:19:05.821 --> 00:19:07.410
principally and giving laws,

738
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:13.220
dictating laws onto the subjects in general without their consent.

739
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:15.360
So for absolute rulers,

740
00:19:15.361 --> 00:19:15.820
I mean the,

741
00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.910
the link to religion you can read about,

742
00:19:17.911 --> 00:19:21.630
but there's always the sense that he or she is doing God's will,

743
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.380
uh,

744
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.110
by,

745
00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:26.070
by exploiting exploiting ordinary peasants,

746
00:19:26.071 --> 00:19:27.090
ordinary people,

747
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.040
and conquering other territories.

748
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:29.540
But,

749
00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.800
but there's a theoretical framework that,

750
00:19:31.801 --> 00:19:32.191
that,

751
00:19:32.191 --> 00:19:32.570
uh,

752
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:33.830
well in and we'll catch up with,

753
00:19:33.831 --> 00:19:34.050
with,

754
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:35.040
with a French monarchs,

755
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.351
uh,

756
00:19:35.351 --> 00:19:36.184
among others,

757
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:36.690
uh,

758
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:37.380
later,

759
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:37.471
uh,

760
00:19:37.471 --> 00:19:37.681
that,

761
00:19:37.681 --> 00:19:37.801
that,

762
00:19:37.801 --> 00:19:38.700
that father,

763
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:40.830
the ruler must be a father,

764
00:19:40.831 --> 00:19:42.300
a benevolent figure.

765
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.231
I mean,

766
00:19:43.231 --> 00:19:44.340
as I said in some contexts,

767
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:45.720
La last time,

768
00:19:45.721 --> 00:19:45.901
I mean,

769
00:19:45.901 --> 00:19:48.420
how many Russian peasants died in the 1890s thinking,

770
00:19:48.421 --> 00:19:48.961
oh my God,

771
00:19:48.961 --> 00:19:50.640
if this is our only knew that were starving,

772
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.460
how angry he would be with his officials.

773
00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:54.533
Well,

774
00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:58.650
if he could have given one damn how many millions of them died,

775
00:19:58.651 --> 00:19:59.910
but this was the images that,

776
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:00.540
that,

777
00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.160
that the big person is there to,

778
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:02.820
uh,

779
00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:03.780
to protect you,

780
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.690
uh,

781
00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:06.080
and uh,

782
00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:09.240
and that his glory is your glory.

783
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.350
Um,

784
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:15.350
but along with this conceptual framework provided by none other than Thomas

785
00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:16.891
Hobbs,

786
00:20:16.891 --> 00:20:17.131
you know,

787
00:20:17.131 --> 00:20:17.281
in,

788
00:20:17.281 --> 00:20:17.720
in,

789
00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.970
in England who had lived through the English civil war and thought that you

790
00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:22.200
shouldn't mess around with these,

791
00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.460
this writes business,

792
00:20:23.461 --> 00:20:25.380
you need some sort of big powerful,

793
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:25.791
uh,

794
00:20:25.791 --> 00:20:26.611
a monarch there.

795
00:20:26.611 --> 00:20:29.100
But there was a sense inherent in all of this,

796
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.860
and this will be important to try to understand the French revolution that

797
00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:33.960
Rochelle phone says,

798
00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:39.210
that there's a difference between absolutism and despotism.

799
00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.930
And that even conceptually,

800
00:20:42.931 --> 00:20:43.764
theoretically,

801
00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.760
that if the monarch goes too far against the weight of the past,

802
00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.500
that there is inherent in this,

803
00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:01.740
the idea that he or she might will go.

804
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:03.963
And of course,

805
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:07.810
you can imagine the thoughts of Louis the 16th as they were cutting back his

806
00:21:07.811 --> 00:21:08.644
hair,

807
00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:09.070
uh,

808
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:13.600
to await the fall of the Guillotine on the 21st of January [inaudible] 17,

809
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:15.100
a 93,

810
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:15.911
uh,

811
00:21:15.911 --> 00:21:16.744
and in the,

812
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.350
in the cafe and the Swa,

813
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.770
the bars of Paris,

814
00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.000
which there are many,

815
00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:22.451
many,

816
00:21:22.451 --> 00:21:23.284
many,

817
00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:23.860
uh,

818
00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:24.220
halfway.

819
00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.050
So in 1789 when,

820
00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:30.280
when ordinary people are drinking to the third estate and talking about

821
00:21:30.281 --> 00:21:35.281
despotism and finding examples from what they saw around them as represented

822
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:37.090
despotic behavior,

823
00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:42.190
that line had clearly been crossed and helps explain why it was that at a,

824
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:46.210
in a country in which there weren't 10 people who wanted republican 1789,

825
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.940
it was possible to imagine a life without a king.

826
00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:49.810
You know,

827
00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.010
imagine that.

828
00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:52.320
So,

829
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:52.730
uh,

830
00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:52.970
that,

831
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:53.561
that is,

832
00:21:53.561 --> 00:21:55.720
that's there as well.

833
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:57.050
Now,

834
00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:57.221
okay,

835
00:21:57.221 --> 00:21:58.630
let's character old Jesus.

836
00:21:58.631 --> 00:21:59.464
We've got to move here.

837
00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:00.200
Um,

838
00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:00.970
um,

839
00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:02.980
let's characterize a absolute role.

840
00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:03.311
Now,

841
00:22:03.311 --> 00:22:06.520
you did have in many of these countries,

842
00:22:06.521 --> 00:22:08.290
diets or parliaments,

843
00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.040
uh,

844
00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.660
some representative body,

845
00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:11.831
but again,

846
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:13.360
the king doesn't have to call them.

847
00:22:13.361 --> 00:22:14.410
In the case of France,

848
00:22:14.411 --> 00:22:14.741
again,

849
00:22:14.741 --> 00:22:15.640
since we're talking so much about,

850
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:16.930
about Louis the 14th,

851
00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:17.560
uh,

852
00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.750
they call this the state's general,

853
00:22:19.751 --> 00:22:23.500
which is to represent all of the provinces after the execution.

854
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:25.000
After the assassination of,

855
00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.310
of a Henry the fourth,

856
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:27.821
uh,

857
00:22:27.821 --> 00:22:28.601
in 16,

858
00:22:28.601 --> 00:22:29.470
10 or 16,

859
00:22:29.471 --> 00:22:30.100
12 weeks,

860
00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:30.761
appropriately enough,

861
00:22:30.761 --> 00:22:33.100
he stabbed to death in a traffic jam in Paris.

862
00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:35.140
When his carriage gets blocked in the middle,

863
00:22:35.141 --> 00:22:36.400
in the center of Paris,

864
00:22:36.401 --> 00:22:36.580
in,

865
00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:38.170
in this mad monk,

866
00:22:38.171 --> 00:22:38.680
uh,

867
00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:38.920
uh,

868
00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.540
sticks a big knife into them.

869
00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:41.171
Uh,

870
00:22:41.171 --> 00:22:42.970
and so they call the estates general then,

871
00:22:42.971 --> 00:22:47.530
but the king never calls it again until 1789.

872
00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.410
So you have these diets and have these parliaments.

873
00:22:50.411 --> 00:22:52.870
But one of the characteristics of absolute rule,

874
00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:53.590
uh,

875
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.180
is that you don't have to,

876
00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.340
don't have to call these,

877
00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.150
uh,

878
00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:00.580
these bodies because the king is the big person.

879
00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:01.241
Now,

880
00:23:01.241 --> 00:23:02.310
in the case of England,

881
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.250
one of the causes,

882
00:23:03.251 --> 00:23:04.170
English civil wars,

883
00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:04.931
the refusal of,

884
00:23:04.931 --> 00:23:05.590
of,

885
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:06.490
of uh,

886
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:06.971
uh,

887
00:23:06.971 --> 00:23:11.710
the kings to pay to pay any attention to recognize the rights of parliament that

888
00:23:11.711 --> 00:23:14.020
people in the British imaginary and the British,

889
00:23:14.021 --> 00:23:14.510
uh,

890
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:15.970
a collective memory,

891
00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:16.451
uh,

892
00:23:16.451 --> 00:23:18.310
believe started on June 15th,

893
00:23:18.311 --> 00:23:19.091
which my birthday,

894
00:23:19.091 --> 00:23:19.901
1215,

895
00:23:19.901 --> 00:23:21.040
though I wasn't born yet.

896
00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:22.030
And in 1215,

897
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:22.750
uh,

898
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:22.991
and,

899
00:23:22.991 --> 00:23:23.520
and so this,

900
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:23.640
the,

901
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.250
the idea of the free born English Person Englishman is what they would have said

902
00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:31.660
in those days meant that parlors rights of parliament had to be respected.

903
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:33.370
And when it looks like they're going,

904
00:23:33.371 --> 00:23:35.020
are they English kings are going to turn,

905
00:23:35.021 --> 00:23:35.530
uh,

906
00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:36.100
uh,

907
00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:36.551
uh,

908
00:23:36.551 --> 00:23:38.080
are going to restore Catholicism.

909
00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:40.180
At least have lots of paintings of swooning,

910
00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:43.120
cherubs and Cupid's and broke,

911
00:23:43.121 --> 00:23:43.640
uh,

912
00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.050
uh,

913
00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:44.230
uh,

914
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:45.620
broke Italian in,

915
00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:45.891
in,

916
00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:46.281
in,

917
00:23:46.281 --> 00:23:46.790
uh,

918
00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:47.480
uh,

919
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:47.961
in Windsor,

920
00:23:47.961 --> 00:23:49.400
in London and these other places.

921
00:23:49.401 --> 00:23:51.350
Well then you've got a revolution.

922
00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:52.250
So,

923
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:53.000
um,

924
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.610
absolute rulers didn't really have to pay,

925
00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:56.610
uh,

926
00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:58.550
it didn't have to pay attention to these assemblies.

927
00:23:58.551 --> 00:24:00.230
The best example I can think of off hand,

928
00:24:00.231 --> 00:24:01.070
I should let this weight,

929
00:24:01.071 --> 00:24:01.460
but,

930
00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:01.761
but,

931
00:24:01.761 --> 00:24:02.060
uh,

932
00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:02.361
Peter,

933
00:24:02.361 --> 00:24:06.530
the great czar of the Russians who may or may not have beaten his son to death,

934
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.120
at least ordered them tortured.

935
00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:08.720
Uh,

936
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.750
Peter the grade was a huge sort of power forward size guy.

937
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.180
Uh,

938
00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:13.420
at a time when people were,

939
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:13.850
were,

940
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:14.900
were very small.

941
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.180
He had this thing called the drunk and assembly,

942
00:24:17.181 --> 00:24:21.410
which was in a way kind of a mockery of parliamentary representations where his

943
00:24:21.411 --> 00:24:24.320
cronies would come and just get wasted.

944
00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:25.440
Uh,

945
00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:25.700
and,

946
00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.260
and would make all sorts of sort of,

947
00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:27.461
you know,

948
00:24:27.461 --> 00:24:30.320
flamboyant proclamations that seemed to represent what,

949
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.680
you know,

950
00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.880
what a real part of it would do.

951
00:24:31.881 --> 00:24:32.660
But in fact,

952
00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:36.500
Peter the great listen to whom he wanted to and ignored the others and sometimes

953
00:24:36.501 --> 00:24:40.070
have them killed if you had to or if he thought that's what he should do because

954
00:24:40.071 --> 00:24:43.730
there wasn't any sort of challenge to his authority and that my friends is part

955
00:24:43.731 --> 00:24:44.390
of,

956
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.840
uh,

957
00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:45.770
part of what it meant.

958
00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:46.701
So,

959
00:24:46.701 --> 00:24:47.534
um,

960
00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.920
so already sent mentioned about how in a Jew nobles become partners,

961
00:24:51.921 --> 00:24:53.270
junior partners in absolutism.

962
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:53.560
That's it.

963
00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.291
Not a bad phrase,

964
00:24:54.291 --> 00:24:55.820
junior partners and absolutism.

965
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:57.500
So what happens,

966
00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:02.710
two ways of measuring how this happened and what difference it made is to,

967
00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.870
is to realize that return to what I said earlier is that,

968
00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:06.470
you know,

969
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:08.840
big state structures involve bureaucracies.

970
00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:14.170
And so the king's representatives go out in the name of the king and they give

971
00:25:15.561 --> 00:25:17.450
out justice or the lack of justice,

972
00:25:17.451 --> 00:25:17.681
or they,

973
00:25:17.681 --> 00:25:18.000
they,

974
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:18.440
they,

975
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.110
they send armies in or taxes or this set of stuff.

976
00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:22.040
Um,

977
00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.730
now the renaissance city states in Italy had relative hit and we had relatively

978
00:25:25.731 --> 00:25:27.410
efficient administrations to be sure,

979
00:25:27.411 --> 00:25:31.670
but these are royal bureaucracies that expand dramatically in size.

980
00:25:31.671 --> 00:25:36.671
And even though decentralized England expands is bureaucracy and collected taxes

981
00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:40.970
much more efficiently than a across the channel they did in France,

982
00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:41.600
uh,

983
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.140
there,

984
00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:42.860
uh,

985
00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:43.280
you know,

986
00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.490
they were state making involve more officials there.

987
00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.170
So in order to raise money,

988
00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.540
you have to enforce taxes.

989
00:25:50.541 --> 00:25:54.710
So you may form some taxes out to somebody who will keep as much of the cut as

990
00:25:54.711 --> 00:25:57.530
they can possibly steal or to make money.

991
00:25:57.531 --> 00:26:00.970
You'll sell noble titles and this gets the French kings in into,

992
00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:01.820
uh,

993
00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:02.091
uh,

994
00:26:02.091 --> 00:26:04.370
into trouble or you sell monopolies.

995
00:26:04.371 --> 00:26:05.500
And the Peter of the grade,

996
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:06.200
uh,

997
00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.033
uh,

998
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:09.620
had a monopoly on dice cause people gambled a lot.

999
00:26:09.621 --> 00:26:10.790
The nobles gambled all the time.

1000
00:26:10.791 --> 00:26:13.070
You could gamble serfs real people,

1001
00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:13.821
you could gamble them,

1002
00:26:13.821 --> 00:26:15.230
you can lose them with a bad hand.

1003
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:16.360
Uh,

1004
00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:16.640
this,

1005
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:16.870
you know,

1006
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:17.703
this was Russia,

1007
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:18.350
uh,

1008
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.680
and,

1009
00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:18.941
and,

1010
00:26:18.941 --> 00:26:19.461
and so the,

1011
00:26:19.461 --> 00:26:21.890
the monopoly on dice he sells,

1012
00:26:21.891 --> 00:26:23.390
he sells them monopoly on salt.

1013
00:26:23.391 --> 00:26:27.080
And salt was a big commodity y'all up for obviously for storing meet and that

1014
00:26:27.081 --> 00:26:29.480
monopoly is sold in various places.

1015
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:30.260
Um,

1016
00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:31.970
and so these officials,

1017
00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:32.540
uh,

1018
00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:32.760
you know,

1019
00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:36.110
nobles get these kinds of official Rarey they can rake it in,

1020
00:26:36.111 --> 00:26:37.210
get these titles of,

1021
00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.480
and they are representing the king.

1022
00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.510
They're governors are intendance to call them in France.

1023
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:42.230
Uh,

1024
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.741
and,

1025
00:26:42.741 --> 00:26:43.200
uh,

1026
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:43.630
um,

1027
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:43.931
the,

1028
00:26:43.931 --> 00:26:45.960
the expand the numbers of,

1029
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:48.120
of officials that dramatically,

1030
00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.530
um,

1031
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:51.660
now and then there's warfare.

1032
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:57.210
There was nothing more symptomatic of the growth of absolute rule.

1033
00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:58.100
Then,

1034
00:26:58.100 --> 00:26:58.500
uh,

1035
00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.970
the growth of powerful armies.

1036
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:00.511
Again,

1037
00:27:00.511 --> 00:27:01.680
when you're traveling around Europe,

1038
00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:02.910
if you're lucky to do that,

1039
00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:03.330
uh,

1040
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:05.910
you'll see these big fortified towns.

1041
00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:06.331
Uh,

1042
00:27:06.331 --> 00:27:07.260
in the case of France,

1043
00:27:07.261 --> 00:27:07.930
again,

1044
00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:08.130
uh,

1045
00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:12.260
they are the work of a brilliant military engineer called verbal Va.

1046
00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:16.660
You Ban and you go to a place like [inaudible] or Leila or Mommy D.

1047
00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:16.830
I mean,

1048
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:17.760
they're all over the place.

1049
00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:23.060
And these are fortress like defenses in an age of essentially defensive warfare.

1050
00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:27.630
But if you're going to have a big old fort and you're going to have lots of

1051
00:27:27.631 --> 00:27:30.060
Canon that you hope to use against your craven,

1052
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.670
a reptile enemies that would want to get in your way,

1053
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.350
you're going to have people to try out the cannon.

1054
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.080
You have to have people who live in these fortifications.

1055
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:41.370
So the size of these armies for these megalomaniac wars,

1056
00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.050
these dynastic wars,

1057
00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:43.500
uh,

1058
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.490
between Austria and,

1059
00:27:44.491 --> 00:27:44.880
and,

1060
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:45.713
and uh,

1061
00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:45.991
uh,

1062
00:27:45.991 --> 00:27:46.561
France.

1063
00:27:46.561 --> 00:27:48.090
And then they changed partners,

1064
00:27:48.091 --> 00:27:48.270
uh,

1065
00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:50.310
in 1756 and all of this business,

1066
00:27:50.311 --> 00:27:51.600
you can read about that.

1067
00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:53.850
But the big story is huge,

1068
00:27:53.851 --> 00:27:54.421
huge,

1069
00:27:54.421 --> 00:27:56.100
huge amount of,

1070
00:27:56.101 --> 00:27:56.790
um,

1071
00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:57.271
of,

1072
00:27:57.271 --> 00:27:57.820
um,

1073
00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:58.653
of troops.

1074
00:27:58.790 --> 00:27:58.980
Uh,

1075
00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:00.180
during the 16th century,

1076
00:28:00.181 --> 00:28:04.440
the peacetime armies of the continental powers were about 10 to 20,000 soldiers,

1077
00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:05.251
very,

1078
00:28:05.251 --> 00:28:06.084
very little.

1079
00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:07.281
By the 16,

1080
00:28:07.281 --> 00:28:07.980
nineties,

1081
00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.050
150,000 soldiers,

1082
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.370
the French army,

1083
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.350
which was then in 69,

1084
00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.270
he's 180,000 people.

1085
00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:17.500
That's twice Michigan Football Stadium.

1086
00:28:17.501 --> 00:28:20.070
If you imagine stadium packed with soldiers and all that,

1087
00:28:20.071 --> 00:28:20.491
how boring.

1088
00:28:20.491 --> 00:28:21.140
But anyway,

1089
00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.490
I had rose to 350,000 soldiers,

1090
00:28:23.491 --> 00:28:24.270
the largest in,

1091
00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:25.290
in Europe.

1092
00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.670
And I think I have in this edition of a table the size of European armies,

1093
00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:31.040
a half for Pyre,

1094
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:31.890
1690,

1095
00:28:31.891 --> 00:28:32.880
50,000,

1096
00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:33.781
17,

1097
00:28:33.781 --> 00:28:34.620
56,

1098
00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.270
200,000.

1099
00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:37.710
A polyglot army too,

1100
00:28:37.711 --> 00:28:39.480
because of all the different nationalities,

1101
00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.730
Prussia identified with,

1102
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:42.180
uh,

1103
00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:42.930
the Yonkers,

1104
00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:45.540
the nobles of who were army officers,

1105
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:50.220
the dueling scars that they had at Bismark would have in a unified Germany.

1106
00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:50.720
Uh,

1107
00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:55.720
a mere 30,000 people in (690) 190-5000 people during the seven years' war in

1108
00:28:58.741 --> 00:28:59.710
1789,

1109
00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.520
190,000 in 18,

1110
00:29:02.521 --> 00:29:03.270
12,

1111
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:04.530
as they're fighting Napoleon,

1112
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.540
270,000 people.

1113
00:29:06.541 --> 00:29:11.541
And this isn't a state that barely extends beyond a Brandenburg and Pomerania a

1114
00:29:12.091 --> 00:29:13.650
in a what now is,

1115
00:29:13.651 --> 00:29:15.600
is a western Poland and,

1116
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:16.260
uh,

1117
00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:16.980
and um,

1118
00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:17.940
and still pressure,

1119
00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:18.600
uh,

1120
00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.310
in the unified Germany.

1121
00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:21.373
Um,

1122
00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:25.280
even Sweden a hundred at the time of the battle of Poltava this,

1123
00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:25.861
they'll forget it,

1124
00:29:25.861 --> 00:29:27.060
but in 1709,

1125
00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:27.131
oh,

1126
00:29:27.131 --> 00:29:27.661
don't forget it,

1127
00:29:27.661 --> 00:29:28.410
but you know,

1128
00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:29.010
read about it.

1129
00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:30.000
1709,

1130
00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:30.240
uh,

1131
00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.860
that's when Sweden loses to Russia.

1132
00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.710
The Swedish army was 110,000 people.

1133
00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:35.551
Soldiers.

1134
00:29:35.551 --> 00:29:36.384
That's an awful lot.

1135
00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:38.190
So that's one of the things that happens.

1136
00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:38.641
Uh,

1137
00:29:38.641 --> 00:29:40.440
the modern state in a,

1138
00:29:40.441 --> 00:29:41.280
an action,

1139
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:42.040
uh,

1140
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.080
the absolute state in action is the army.

1141
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.460
And,

1142
00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:48.340
and even in peacetime military expenditures take up almost half of the budget of

1143
00:29:48.341 --> 00:29:49.600
any European state.

1144
00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:50.950
And in times of war,

1145
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.060
80%.

1146
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:53.500
Now,

1147
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.640
having said all that,

1148
00:29:54.641 --> 00:29:55.474
let me just,

1149
00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:56.403
oops.

1150
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.750
Oops.

1151
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:57.070
Oops.

1152
00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:57.760
Okay.

1153
00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.530
I'll try and try to turn this baby on

1154
00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:00.570
that.

1155
00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:01.403
Go on.

1156
00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:03.371
Well,

1157
00:30:03.371 --> 00:30:04.204
isn't that go on.

1158
00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.273
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1159
00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:08.970
<v 0>I got a backup.</v>

1160
00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:09.101
Oh,

1161
00:30:09.101 --> 00:30:10.120
I got to put this thing down.

1162
00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:10.983
That's it.

1163
00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:13.413
Yeah.

1164
00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:14.051
And again,

1165
00:30:14.051 --> 00:30:16.240
these just illustrate my point,

1166
00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:16.930
uh,

1167
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:18.940
which is about why,

1168
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:19.541
you know,

1169
00:30:19.541 --> 00:30:23.890
why did nobles and even other people agree to all of this?

1170
00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:24.701
Why do,

1171
00:30:24.701 --> 00:30:25.270
why do,

1172
00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:25.691
I mean,

1173
00:30:25.691 --> 00:30:25.991
you know,

1174
00:30:25.991 --> 00:30:26.250
if,

1175
00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:27.250
if they're being exploited,

1176
00:30:27.251 --> 00:30:28.061
if you've got big army,

1177
00:30:28.061 --> 00:30:31.270
it's like going to crush them like grapes if they get in the way.

1178
00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:31.990
Uh,

1179
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.201
but,

1180
00:30:32.201 --> 00:30:32.920
but yet,

1181
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.610
one argument that can be made is that things were so terrible and so out of

1182
00:30:36.611 --> 00:30:37.480
control,

1183
00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:38.230
uh,

1184
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:40.240
in the earlier period of that,

1185
00:30:40.241 --> 00:30:43.750
the strengthening of the state is something that people saw as,

1186
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.410
as,

1187
00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:45.400
as beneficial.

1188
00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:45.941
I mean you'd get a,

1189
00:30:45.941 --> 00:30:47.080
Hobbs is over the top.

1190
00:30:47.081 --> 00:30:51.720
I mean Hobbs wants to sort of dictatorship to keep people from brawling in the,

1191
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.200
in the state of nature.

1192
00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:53.800
And again,

1193
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:57.340
the elite in Britain was scared cause you've got all these ranter groups and

1194
00:30:57.341 --> 00:30:59.200
levelers and people believe that,

1195
00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:02.260
that everybody ought to have the right to vote where they have property or not.

1196
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.000
And people that believe in the right of women.

1197
00:31:04.001 --> 00:31:05.050
I mean this was pretty scary.

1198
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:05.710
Uh,

1199
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:06.281
and so,

1200
00:31:06.281 --> 00:31:06.521
you know,

1201
00:31:06.521 --> 00:31:07.450
people like Hobbes thought,

1202
00:31:07.451 --> 00:31:08.590
well we need a really strong state,

1203
00:31:08.591 --> 00:31:09.660
but that's not the outcome of the,

1204
00:31:09.661 --> 00:31:12.130
of the English civil war.

1205
00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.080
But how did this work in,

1206
00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:14.800
um,

1207
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.570
in other places?

1208
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:17.770
Now I'm,

1209
00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:23.430
no theater wraps argument is basically that the terrible wars of religion,

1210
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:24.140
uh,

1211
00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.230
that had ripped central Europe apart.

1212
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.170
Uh,

1213
00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:27.710
uh,

1214
00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:29.860
in the middle of the 19th century,

1215
00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:30.670
uh,

1216
00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:33.640
led people to look for the kinds of,

1217
00:31:33.641 --> 00:31:34.060
of,

1218
00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:34.810
of uh,

1219
00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:39.810
safety provided by a strong a ruler.

1220
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.660
A,

1221
00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:41.790
that what had begun,

1222
00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:47.020
and we'll see this in a minute as a war between Protestants and Catholics,

1223
00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:51.310
a war that began in Prague when somebody gets definitive fenestrated,

1224
00:31:51.311 --> 00:31:52.030
which is a,

1225
00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:54.610
is a fancy word for throwing somebody out of a window,

1226
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:55.480
uh,

1227
00:31:55.480 --> 00:32:00.480
that this ended up being a war fought by just vicious mercenaries who

1228
00:32:01.211 --> 00:32:03.250
slaughtered the populations,

1229
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:04.060
uh,

1230
00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:05.380
of central Europe.

1231
00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.110
It didn't matter if they were Protestants or Catholics or anything else,

1232
00:32:08.111 --> 00:32:09.280
they simply killed them.

1233
00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.061
Uh,

1234
00:32:10.061 --> 00:32:15.061
and that this terrified elites in much of Europe and had the same equivalent of

1235
00:32:16.151 --> 00:32:19.500
what the fund did for scaring a elites,

1236
00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:20.350
uh,

1237
00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:21.820
in France.

1238
00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:22.600
Um,

1239
00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.201
and that,

1240
00:32:23.201 --> 00:32:23.411
I mean,

1241
00:32:23.411 --> 00:32:24.760
one of the arguments that he makes,

1242
00:32:24.761 --> 00:32:28.000
and I can't make it as strongly because I don't know enough about the scientific

1243
00:32:28.001 --> 00:32:28.834
revolution,

1244
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:31.240
what I know about is what you were kind enough to,

1245
00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:32.050
uh,

1246
00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:32.621
to read.

1247
00:32:32.621 --> 00:32:35.050
And it was hard to piece all this stuff together.

1248
00:32:35.051 --> 00:32:40.051
But there is this sort of sense of uncertainty that you see in a,

1249
00:32:40.251 --> 00:32:40.641
you know,

1250
00:32:40.641 --> 00:32:40.911
in,

1251
00:32:40.911 --> 00:32:44.480
in someone like the Kath who finally just goes back to basics and say,

1252
00:32:44.481 --> 00:32:44.631
well,

1253
00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:44.890
you know,

1254
00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:45.410
here,

1255
00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:45.800
you know,

1256
00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:46.440
I think,

1257
00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:46.780
no,

1258
00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:47.391
you're therefore,

1259
00:32:47.391 --> 00:32:47.811
I am.

1260
00:32:47.811 --> 00:32:47.991
I mean,

1261
00:32:47.991 --> 00:32:48.824
here I am.

1262
00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:49.360
Uh,

1263
00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:49.570
and,

1264
00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:53.400
and the go from there to a methodology of,

1265
00:32:53.401 --> 00:32:55.310
of science and methodology of,

1266
00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:55.900
of,

1267
00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:56.120
of,

1268
00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.050
of trying to,

1269
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:57.620
you know,

1270
00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:00.470
trying to study things in a rational way to,

1271
00:33:00.471 --> 00:33:01.010
to,

1272
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:01.400
uh,

1273
00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.050
to get rid of the kinds of,

1274
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.200
of blind faith that that seemed to have led to this,

1275
00:33:06.201 --> 00:33:06.640
this,

1276
00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:09.920
this is utter catastrophe of mass slaughter,

1277
00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:10.520
uh,

1278
00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.210
in Europe.

1279
00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:13.220
And so there's signs all over the place,

1280
00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:13.850
uh,

1281
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:15.050
that this has happened.

1282
00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:18.950
I think therefore I am.

1283
00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:19.730
Um,

1284
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:22.460
and there is a return to these kinds of,

1285
00:33:22.461 --> 00:33:25.910
of a theoretical defenses of,

1286
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:28.400
of absolutism that even preceded,

1287
00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:29.090
uh,

1288
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:31.160
the growth of the absolute state.

1289
00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:31.970
Uh,

1290
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:32.560
as,

1291
00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.393
um,

1292
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:36.200
as I've described it now,

1293
00:33:36.201 --> 00:33:41.201
absolutism did not simply just emerge out of this turmoil is that already

1294
00:33:41.871 --> 00:33:42.471
suggested.

1295
00:33:42.471 --> 00:33:43.370
And I would assist upon,

1296
00:33:43.371 --> 00:33:44.630
insist upon this again,

1297
00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:45.051
uh,

1298
00:33:45.051 --> 00:33:50.051
that the consolidation of territorial rulers had already given the basis to an

1299
00:33:50.211 --> 00:33:53.660
expanding more formalized state structure.

1300
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.470
Uh,

1301
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:55.303
even in,

1302
00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:55.880
uh,

1303
00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.200
even in England,

1304
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.900
uh,

1305
00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:58.130
that,

1306
00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:58.560
that this,

1307
00:33:58.560 --> 00:33:59.510
this is for sure.

1308
00:33:59.511 --> 00:34:01.820
It all just doesn't start like that.

1309
00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:02.100
Uh,

1310
00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:02.311
Louis,

1311
00:34:02.311 --> 00:34:06.110
the 14th verse proceeded in number by read the 13th,

1312
00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:07.400
and Louis the 13th,

1313
00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:08.030
uh,

1314
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:09.020
helps expand,

1315
00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:09.390
uh,

1316
00:34:09.390 --> 00:34:11.960
the compelling course of structures of,

1317
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.561
of,

1318
00:34:12.561 --> 00:34:14.240
of the French state.

1319
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:15.283
But yet,

1320
00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:16.850
yet when you look at all of this,

1321
00:34:16.851 --> 00:34:17.571
you can see that the,

1322
00:34:17.571 --> 00:34:19.970
the kind of chaos is the political upheaval,

1323
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:20.840
upheavals,

1324
00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:21.620
uh,

1325
00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:22.400
uh,

1326
00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:26.420
finds in a response and the growth of central government authority and the

1327
00:34:26.421 --> 00:34:27.650
growth of bureaucracies.

1328
00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:29.450
And it wasn't only in Sweden,

1329
00:34:29.451 --> 00:34:30.081
Austria,

1330
00:34:30.081 --> 00:34:30.680
Russia,

1331
00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:31.221
France,

1332
00:34:31.221 --> 00:34:32.030
et cetera.

1333
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:34.910
We found this even in smaller states like Virgin Berg,

1334
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.320
a state in Germany,

1335
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:36.921
which was,

1336
00:34:36.921 --> 00:34:37.050
uh,

1337
00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:37.360
you know,

1338
00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:37.610
uh,

1339
00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:39.530
sort of middle sized state.

1340
00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:43.670
Even there you see the same phenomenon on a very lower,

1341
00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:45.020
smaller level.

1342
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:48.530
It leaves the leaves in terms of deaths of the size of the state,

1343
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:49.820
where people are giving up,

1344
00:34:49.821 --> 00:34:51.350
willing to compromise on their,

1345
00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:55.520
their privileges in order for the protection of the ruler of earth and Berg who

1346
00:34:55.521 --> 00:34:58.250
would never be confused with Louis the 14th or Peter the Great.

1347
00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:01.940
But so this is really becomes a sort of European wide phenomenon and you can,

1348
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:06.440
you can apply this also to the glorious revolution in England as well.

1349
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.250
When people are,

1350
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:07.550
you know,

1351
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:09.290
they're happy to have a monarch back,

1352
00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:09.980
uh,

1353
00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:12.860
who's going to reassert control.

1354
00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:13.281
Uh,

1355
00:35:13.281 --> 00:35:14.080
and in the case of,

1356
00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:14.571
of England,

1357
00:35:14.571 --> 00:35:17.660
they're very happy to have a wide arc back who was not threatening to turn,

1358
00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:17.900
uh,

1359
00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:19.220
England again into,

1360
00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:20.050
into a,

1361
00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:20.883
a Catholic,

1362
00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:22.310
a Catholic state.

1363
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:23.690
So this is the sort of,

1364
00:35:23.691 --> 00:35:24.320
um,

1365
00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:24.610
uh,

1366
00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:24.961
the,

1367
00:35:24.961 --> 00:35:25.641
the sort of,

1368
00:35:25.641 --> 00:35:26.081
uh,

1369
00:35:26.081 --> 00:35:26.481
uh,

1370
00:35:26.481 --> 00:35:27.314
argument,

1371
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:27.920
uh,

1372
00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:28.730
that,

1373
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:29.061
uh,

1374
00:35:29.061 --> 00:35:29.371
that,

1375
00:35:29.371 --> 00:35:32.540
that you can make even in a state that had a constitutional monarch,

1376
00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:32.931
uh,

1377
00:35:32.931 --> 00:35:33.770
such as,

1378
00:35:33.771 --> 00:35:34.280
um,

1379
00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:34.640
uh,

1380
00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:35.473
such as England.

1381
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:35.721
Now,

1382
00:35:35.721 --> 00:35:39.000
let me just give you a couple of examples of what one can mean here.

1383
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:39.541
And again,

1384
00:35:39.541 --> 00:35:39.811
these are,

1385
00:35:39.811 --> 00:35:41.640
these are painters that you may have come across,

1386
00:35:41.641 --> 00:35:43.890
and it doesn't matter if you've never heard of them or if you never think of

1387
00:35:43.891 --> 00:35:44.724
them again,

1388
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:45.060
but,

1389
00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:45.510
but,

1390
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.980
uh,

1391
00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:47.160
[inaudible] the famous,

1392
00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:47.770
uh,

1393
00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:48.603
uh,

1394
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:49.380
Tieszen,

1395
00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:50.000
uh,

1396
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:50.400
uh,

1397
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:55.380
this is his picture of Charles the fifth at a battle in Germany in 1648.

1398
00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:59.430
And this is a pretty dramatic representation of war.

1399
00:35:59.610 --> 00:35:59.851
I mean,

1400
00:35:59.851 --> 00:36:01.860
this is like the hood is a clean Eastwood,

1401
00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:02.490
uh,

1402
00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:02.851
the good,

1403
00:36:02.851 --> 00:36:03.211
the bad,

1404
00:36:03.211 --> 00:36:03.841
and the ugly.

1405
00:36:03.841 --> 00:36:04.021
I mean,

1406
00:36:04.021 --> 00:36:04.501
this is a guy,

1407
00:36:04.501 --> 00:36:05.400
he's armored up.

1408
00:36:05.401 --> 00:36:06.450
He's ready to go.

1409
00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:08.640
He's somebody to be emulated,

1410
00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:09.480
uh,

1411
00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:09.691
uh,

1412
00:36:09.691 --> 00:36:10.560
from the point of view,

1413
00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:11.100
uh,

1414
00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:11.730
of,

1415
00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:11.971
uh,

1416
00:36:11.971 --> 00:36:13.440
of the viewer.

1417
00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:14.160
Um,

1418
00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:14.993
and,

1419
00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:15.923
uh,

1420
00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:17.000
but in,

1421
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:17.880
at the same time,

1422
00:36:17.881 --> 00:36:18.061
I mean,

1423
00:36:18.061 --> 00:36:19.020
this is slightly earlier.

1424
00:36:19.021 --> 00:36:19.950
This is a painting.

1425
00:36:19.951 --> 00:36:21.180
Thanks Dan.

1426
00:36:21.181 --> 00:36:22.014
This is a painting of,

1427
00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:22.520
of,

1428
00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:22.920
uh,

1429
00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:23.340
of,

1430
00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:23.760
uh,

1431
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.170
uh,

1432
00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:24.920
[inaudible],

1433
00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:25.370
uh,

1434
00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:25.601
uh,

1435
00:36:25.601 --> 00:36:26.670
of the elder,

1436
00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:27.121
uh,

1437
00:36:27.121 --> 00:36:27.411
and,

1438
00:36:27.411 --> 00:36:27.631
and,

1439
00:36:27.631 --> 00:36:28.650
and the first is,

1440
00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.011
is,

1441
00:36:29.011 --> 00:36:29.490
uh,

1442
00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:29.581
uh,

1443
00:36:29.581 --> 00:36:31.530
the triumph of the triumph of death.

1444
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:32.340
Uh,

1445
00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.550
where you see a,

1446
00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:33.750
you know,

1447
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:34.521
what happens in,

1448
00:36:34.521 --> 00:36:37.950
in real battle when people are just sort of slaughtered and the commanders are

1449
00:36:37.951 --> 00:36:39.240
off of the safe distance.

1450
00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.230
Uh,

1451
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:41.760
and you know,

1452
00:36:41.761 --> 00:36:43.380
here again the massacre of the innocence.

1453
00:36:43.381 --> 00:36:44.161
We're villagers,

1454
00:36:44.161 --> 00:36:46.140
villagers or just being executed,

1455
00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:46.500
uh,

1456
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:47.220
because,

1457
00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:47.670
uh,

1458
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.941
uh,

1459
00:36:47.941 --> 00:36:48.191
their,

1460
00:36:48.191 --> 00:36:48.651
their,

1461
00:36:48.651 --> 00:36:49.250
their,

1462
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:49.920
um,

1463
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:50.940
and the massacre,

1464
00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:51.330
uh,

1465
00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:51.690
the,

1466
00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:52.800
the triumph of death,

1467
00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:53.460
uh,

1468
00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:54.000
you know,

1469
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:54.833
uh,

1470
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:59.010
the dialogue of the mathematician a pascal is quoted by Rab,

1471
00:36:59.011 --> 00:37:00.720
why are you killing me for your own benefit?

1472
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:04.410
I am an armed why you do not live on the other side of the water?

1473
00:37:04.411 --> 00:37:04.831
My friend,

1474
00:37:04.831 --> 00:37:05.640
if you lived on this,

1475
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:05.791
uh,

1476
00:37:05.791 --> 00:37:07.500
on this side I should be a murderer.

1477
00:37:07.501 --> 00:37:08.820
But since you live on the other side,

1478
00:37:08.821 --> 00:37:10.800
I'm a brave man and it is right,

1479
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:11.160
uh,

1480
00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.480
that I kill you.

1481
00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:13.171
Uh,

1482
00:37:13.171 --> 00:37:13.681
and you know,

1483
00:37:13.681 --> 00:37:16.440
when the Swedes get into the act is to Alvis Adolphus,

1484
00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:17.130
uh,

1485
00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:17.510
uh,

1486
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.671
you know,

1487
00:37:17.671 --> 00:37:19.770
brings this huge old Swedish army down and,

1488
00:37:19.771 --> 00:37:20.491
and you know,

1489
00:37:20.491 --> 00:37:21.840
they do a lot of damage to,

1490
00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:22.590
uh,

1491
00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:24.420
and people are absolutely,

1492
00:37:24.421 --> 00:37:25.170
uh,

1493
00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:25.500
uh,

1494
00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:26.340
being devastated.

1495
00:37:26.341 --> 00:37:29.730
Here's a Rubens of the horror of war.

1496
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:34.230
Now there's a reason why the first attempt to even write about international law

1497
00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:35.460
comes at this period.

1498
00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:36.120
Uh,

1499
00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:36.421
again,

1500
00:37:36.421 --> 00:37:37.231
this is before the chorus,

1501
00:37:37.231 --> 00:37:38.740
but why not Hugo Gross?

1502
00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:39.480
[inaudible],

1503
00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:39.781
g,

1504
00:37:39.781 --> 00:37:40.081
r.

1505
00:37:40.081 --> 00:37:40.291
O,

1506
00:37:40.291 --> 00:37:40.681
t.

1507
00:37:40.681 --> 00:37:41.370
I.

1508
00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:41.370
U.

1509
00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:43.320
S he writes the Law of war and peace.

1510
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:45.750
He publishes it in 1625.

1511
00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:48.450
The goal was to stop stuff like this,

1512
00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:53.220
to try to create a legal framework in which states could resolve their kind of,

1513
00:37:53.221 --> 00:37:56.250
of differences with all kind of butchering each other.

1514
00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:57.210
Uh,

1515
00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:58.043
and uh,

1516
00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:00.000
so there we go.

1517
00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:00.930
Um,

1518
00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:01.680
but it,

1519
00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.000
you know,

1520
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.530
someone here in Warren piece of battle is,

1521
00:38:04.531 --> 00:38:08.430
is slowly being relegated to the background.

1522
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:11.020
But let me give you another example of what people would,

1523
00:38:11.021 --> 00:38:11.191
you know,

1524
00:38:11.191 --> 00:38:12.660
here's a Hispanic famous painter,

1525
00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:13.441
a Spanish painter.

1526
00:38:13.441 --> 00:38:13.711
Again,

1527
00:38:13.711 --> 00:38:14.544
don't worry about it.

1528
00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:16.350
Of Alaska's a who died in,

1529
00:38:16.351 --> 00:38:16.651
in,

1530
00:38:16.651 --> 00:38:17.380
in uh,

1531
00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.330
what a 16,

1532
00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:19.051
16,

1533
00:38:19.051 --> 00:38:19.884
10 I think.

1534
00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:20.520
Yeah,

1535
00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.161
I think he died,

1536
00:38:21.161 --> 00:38:21.541
says no,

1537
00:38:21.541 --> 00:38:22.231
1660,

1538
00:38:22.231 --> 00:38:22.800
sorry.

1539
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.630
This is his portrait of Mars.

1540
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:27.120
Now Mars is the god of war.

1541
00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:27.391
Now,

1542
00:38:27.391 --> 00:38:31.440
how different that is than the portrait of teach the of Charles that you saw by

1543
00:38:31.441 --> 00:38:32.250
Titian.

1544
00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:32.990
Now here,

1545
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.180
you know,

1546
00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:34.560
this guy looks like a kind of a,

1547
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:35.500
you know,

1548
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:38.230
an overweight NFL player who hasn't really got ready for the,

1549
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.651
you know,

1550
00:38:38.651 --> 00:38:39.580
for the drill.

1551
00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:39.911
I,

1552
00:38:39.911 --> 00:38:40.201
he,

1553
00:38:40.201 --> 00:38:41.290
he's very human.

1554
00:38:41.291 --> 00:38:44.830
There's nothing sir admirable about them as this war is being dissed by those

1555
00:38:44.831 --> 00:38:47.440
people that just so tired of the killing.

1556
00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.130
Uh,

1557
00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:49.930
and Mars has this sort of human,

1558
00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:50.470
you know,

1559
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:53.920
flabby torso that's not unsympathetic,

1560
00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.660
but it's a different portrayal of wars.

1561
00:38:55.661 --> 00:38:56.930
If people are getting tired of though of,

1562
00:38:56.931 --> 00:38:57.130
of,

1563
00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:58.840
of the whole damn thing,

1564
00:38:58.841 --> 00:38:59.680
he's doll,

1565
00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:00.910
he's uncouth.

1566
00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:01.690
Uh,

1567
00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:03.310
and he's extremely,

1568
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.850
uh,

1569
00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:04.690
a human.

1570
00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:05.650
Now,

1571
00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:06.161
one of the,

1572
00:39:06.161 --> 00:39:06.401
you know,

1573
00:39:06.401 --> 00:39:07.540
the reasons why,

1574
00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:08.543
um,

1575
00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:08.980
you know,

1576
00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:09.640
why,

1577
00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:10.300
uh,

1578
00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:11.140
people would,

1579
00:39:11.141 --> 00:39:11.590
I mean,

1580
00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:14.800
it's unthinkable for someone like me or for probably most of you to imagine,

1581
00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:15.310
you know,

1582
00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:17.380
giving up your rights to kind of,

1583
00:39:17.381 --> 00:39:17.621
you know,

1584
00:39:17.621 --> 00:39:20.650
to kind of absolute rule that we seem to be in a situation like that where this

1585
00:39:20.651 --> 00:39:21.484
happened quite a lot,

1586
00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:21.880
uh,

1587
00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:22.271
recently,

1588
00:39:22.271 --> 00:39:23.081
even in his own country.

1589
00:39:23.081 --> 00:39:23.380
But,

1590
00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:23.950
uh,

1591
00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:24.490
um,

1592
00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:24.740
the,

1593
00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:24.951
the,

1594
00:39:24.951 --> 00:39:28.330
these are just illustrations that come out of the 30 years' war,

1595
00:39:28.331 --> 00:39:30.130
which were what people are trying to put behind them.

1596
00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:30.730
This is by a,

1597
00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:31.563
this is a French,

1598
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:32.800
uh,

1599
00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:34.480
paint or draw or lithographer,

1600
00:39:34.481 --> 00:39:34.960
uh,

1601
00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.310
called Ashoka Carlo.

1602
00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:37.180
Uh,

1603
00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:37.660
and,

1604
00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:38.050
uh,

1605
00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:41.110
these are just many ways that people died during,

1606
00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:41.650
uh,

1607
00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:43.450
during the 30 years' war.

1608
00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:44.110
Uh,

1609
00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:44.781
this is simply,

1610
00:39:44.781 --> 00:39:46.150
and this is the execution.

1611
00:39:46.151 --> 00:39:46.301
I mean,

1612
00:39:46.301 --> 00:39:47.134
you don't even need that,

1613
00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:48.730
the formal titles of these,

1614
00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.050
but these get around,

1615
00:39:50.051 --> 00:39:50.231
I mean,

1616
00:39:50.231 --> 00:39:51.580
peddlers who had these big,

1617
00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:56.480
big leather bags that would go around Europe and sell things like pins and,

1618
00:39:56.670 --> 00:40:01.000
and miraculous images of the Virgin Mary and the stories of saints and all this

1619
00:40:01.001 --> 00:40:01.631
kind of stuff.

1620
00:40:01.631 --> 00:40:05.260
And Joan of arc or a Robin Hood and the case of England,

1621
00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:06.070
uh,

1622
00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:06.311
you know,

1623
00:40:06.311 --> 00:40:08.170
part of it become part of the collective memory.

1624
00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:11.920
So these kinds of images do get around of the horrors of war,

1625
00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:12.910
uh,

1626
00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:13.451
uh,

1627
00:40:13.451 --> 00:40:13.841
that,

1628
00:40:13.841 --> 00:40:14.271
that the,

1629
00:40:14.271 --> 00:40:16.120
the misfortunes and the horrors of war,

1630
00:40:16.121 --> 00:40:18.910
which is basically what he calls us entire series.

1631
00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:22.420
And here's those peoples are sitting around watching this execution.

1632
00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:23.420
Uh,

1633
00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:26.380
is this somebody being tortured at the stake for merely existing,

1634
00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:27.401
uh,

1635
00:40:27.401 --> 00:40:27.671
for,

1636
00:40:27.671 --> 00:40:27.911
you know,

1637
00:40:27.911 --> 00:40:28.601
for having that,

1638
00:40:28.601 --> 00:40:29.170
uh,

1639
00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:29.261
uh,

1640
00:40:29.261 --> 00:40:31.250
confessed to being a protestant or a Catholic or,

1641
00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:31.760
or,

1642
00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:32.471
or whatever.

1643
00:40:32.471 --> 00:40:32.621
You know,

1644
00:40:32.621 --> 00:40:34.330
I'll tell you in the south of France near where we live,

1645
00:40:34.331 --> 00:40:34.930
there's this,

1646
00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:37.960
when there are a lot of resistance in World War II against the Germans,

1647
00:40:37.961 --> 00:40:41.260
there's some Protestant villages there that were noteworthy for the resistance.

1648
00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:42.700
A lot of Catholics resisted to.

1649
00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:45.460
But one of the interesting things about some of the villages that I know down

1650
00:40:45.461 --> 00:40:49.240
there is that there were a big mission crosses that were put out after the wars

1651
00:40:49.241 --> 00:40:54.070
of religion and these that were sort of symbols of conquest by the all Catholic

1652
00:40:54.071 --> 00:40:54.820
king.

1653
00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:55.001
Uh,

1654
00:40:55.001 --> 00:40:57.970
and those is it in the collective memory that people remember three centuries

1655
00:40:57.971 --> 00:41:01.530
later that the Catholic church was identified at least a hierarchy with,

1656
00:41:01.531 --> 00:41:03.430
with the Vichy regime and World War II.

1657
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:03.790
You know,

1658
00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:04.010
it's,

1659
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:04.470
it's,

1660
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:05.201
that's interesting,

1661
00:41:05.201 --> 00:41:06.034
fascinating.

1662
00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:06.431
70.

1663
00:41:06.431 --> 00:41:06.761
But anyway,

1664
00:41:06.761 --> 00:41:06.950
this,

1665
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:07.561
this poor guy,

1666
00:41:07.561 --> 00:41:09.010
he's not doing real well up there and it,

1667
00:41:09.011 --> 00:41:09.460
you know,

1668
00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:11.590
becomes a sort of big spectacle.

1669
00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.233
And here are some,

1670
00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:16.030
these are dying soldiers along the side of the road.

1671
00:41:16.031 --> 00:41:17.440
It's sort of a sympathetic look at,

1672
00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:18.303
that's the name of this,

1673
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:18.820
uh,

1674
00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:19.653
of these,

1675
00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:19.991
uh,

1676
00:41:19.991 --> 00:41:22.150
expiring dudes there.

1677
00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:25.090
And here's the attack on a stage coach.

1678
00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:25.481
I mean,

1679
00:41:25.481 --> 00:41:26.050
the point of this,

1680
00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:27.100
it didn't matter who you were,

1681
00:41:27.101 --> 00:41:28.540
if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time,

1682
00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:29.520
you were,

1683
00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:29.980
uh,

1684
00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:33.890
you were a history that was all and there was new ways to be killed.

1685
00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:34.071
I mean,

1686
00:41:34.071 --> 00:41:35.300
certainly in Europe,

1687
00:41:35.301 --> 00:41:39.440
not until the massacre of the Armenians in 1895,

1688
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:40.460
um,

1689
00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:43.700
and arguably some Napoleonic atrocities in an appointment armies,

1690
00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:44.600
atrocities in,

1691
00:41:44.601 --> 00:41:46.850
in Palestine or in a,

1692
00:41:46.851 --> 00:41:49.310
in the southern of Italy or in Spain as well.

1693
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:51.320
But there was nothing like this,

1694
00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.070
uh,

1695
00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:52.520
uh,

1696
00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:55.010
really including world war one,

1697
00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:58.160
including some of the worst atrocities that were of world war one.

1698
00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:02.610
There was nothing like this again until World War Two.

1699
00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:03.321
Uh,

1700
00:42:03.321 --> 00:42:04.400
and of course,

1701
00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:05.150
of course,

1702
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.630
Bosnia,

1703
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:06.231
which at the point,

1704
00:42:06.231 --> 00:42:08.480
the point is that this is why lots of people thought,

1705
00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:08.990
you know,

1706
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:10.890
I don't like this guy come in and sending people around,

1707
00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:11.780
taking my taxes.

1708
00:42:11.781 --> 00:42:12.141
But you know,

1709
00:42:12.141 --> 00:42:13.210
I don't want to get off by,

1710
00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:14.280
by some routers.

1711
00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:14.771
Are you,

1712
00:42:14.771 --> 00:42:16.250
can you hang 'em high?

1713
00:42:16.251 --> 00:42:16.731
You'd hang on,

1714
00:42:16.731 --> 00:42:17.181
hang them all.

1715
00:42:17.181 --> 00:42:17.990
Hi.

1716
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.171
I mean,

1717
00:42:18.171 --> 00:42:19.590
these were real ways that people were,

1718
00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:20.030
were,

1719
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.863
were executed.

1720
00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:21.710
<v 2>Uh,</v>

1721
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:22.620
and uh,

1722
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.780
uh,

1723
00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:24.111
just,

1724
00:42:24.111 --> 00:42:24.620
you know,

1725
00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:25.370
steaks,

1726
00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:27.950
massacres and this sort of business.

1727
00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:29.190
Uh,

1728
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:30.800
there's a convent,

1729
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:32.930
a church that's going to go,

1730
00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:33.180
uh,

1731
00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:34.013
if the Catholic church,

1732
00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:34.863
I can tell from the,

1733
00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:35.570
from the top,

1734
00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:37.280
<v 0>maybe these are Protestant mercenaries.</v>

1735
00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.160
It didn't matter because the Protestant armies had Catholic mercenaries and the

1736
00:42:40.161 --> 00:42:44.300
Catholic army said Protestant mercenaries and everybody held head Dalmatians,

1737
00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:47.150
people from the donation coast and Swiss,

1738
00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:48.620
you have to imagine a time in Switzerland.

1739
00:42:48.621 --> 00:42:49.880
It wasn't extremely wealthy.

1740
00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:50.840
Uh,

1741
00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:51.111
I,

1742
00:42:51.111 --> 00:42:52.340
and what we're Swiss were great,

1743
00:42:52.341 --> 00:42:52.550
you know,

1744
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:53.630
famous mercenaries,

1745
00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:55.580
a fighting in these armies.

1746
00:42:55.581 --> 00:42:55.941
And again,

1747
00:42:55.941 --> 00:42:56.451
the Swedish,

1748
00:42:56.451 --> 00:43:01.130
the Swedish cocktail was sort of suffocating people by stuffing manure down

1749
00:43:01.131 --> 00:43:02.360
their throat until they died.

1750
00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:03.050
Uh,

1751
00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:03.650
you know,

1752
00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:03.740
uh,

1753
00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:04.221
this,

1754
00:43:04.221 --> 00:43:04.611
this,

1755
00:43:04.611 --> 00:43:04.970
uh,

1756
00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:05.151
you know,

1757
00:43:05.151 --> 00:43:06.500
this was a nasty time.

1758
00:43:06.501 --> 00:43:06.651
This,

1759
00:43:06.651 --> 00:43:07.610
I guess this is what,

1760
00:43:07.611 --> 00:43:08.060
uh,

1761
00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:08.290
you know,

1762
00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:11.030
Hobbs met by nasty short and brutish or whatever the,

1763
00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:11.811
the fourth was,

1764
00:43:11.811 --> 00:43:13.460
I don't remember about what life was,

1765
00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:13.851
uh,

1766
00:43:13.851 --> 00:43:14.930
in the third years war.

1767
00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:17.330
That was the way it was.

1768
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:18.470
Now,

1769
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:19.790
out of all of this,

1770
00:43:19.791 --> 00:43:21.020
again to repeat,

1771
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.850
uh,

1772
00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:26.850
we are not making the argument that the 30 years' war itself led to absolute

1773
00:43:27.891 --> 00:43:29.090
rule that,

1774
00:43:29.091 --> 00:43:33.110
that the growth of state structures can be seen in the beginning,

1775
00:43:33.111 --> 00:43:36.620
in the late medieval period with the consolidation of these territorial

1776
00:43:36.621 --> 00:43:37.454
monarchs,

1777
00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:38.210
uh,

1778
00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:39.050
monarchies.

1779
00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:39.410
Uh,

1780
00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:42.440
they were already bureaucrats representing the royal will.

1781
00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:42.711
Uh,

1782
00:43:42.711 --> 00:43:44.330
there were already armies,

1783
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:45.050
uh,

1784
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:49.460
but many of us particularly to we were bureaucracies and,

1785
00:43:49.461 --> 00:43:49.941
and,

1786
00:43:49.941 --> 00:43:50.360
uh,

1787
00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.170
um,

1788
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:56.170
and standing powerful standing military forces are characteristics of modern

1789
00:43:56.571 --> 00:43:57.380
states.

1790
00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:57.860
Uh,

1791
00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:02.860
and to try to explain why was that absolute rule came to Europe at the time it

1792
00:44:03.861 --> 00:44:04.570
did.

1793
00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:04.640
Uh,

1794
00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.860
one has to not only look at the particular,

1795
00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:07.963
uh,

1796
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:09.920
particular structures of,

1797
00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:10.240
uh,

1798
00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:10.971
of states,

1799
00:44:10.971 --> 00:44:11.980
but when it has to look at,

1800
00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:13.350
at the overview and,

1801
00:44:13.351 --> 00:44:14.150
and this year,

1802
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.331
you know,

1803
00:44:14.331 --> 00:44:16.160
the horror of it all.

1804
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:16.881
Uh,

1805
00:44:16.881 --> 00:44:17.631
and you know,

1806
00:44:17.631 --> 00:44:21.380
the boy King Louis the 14th hearing the crowd shouting outside of his,

1807
00:44:21.381 --> 00:44:22.010
uh,

1808
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:22.550
uh,

1809
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.851
you know,

1810
00:44:22.851 --> 00:44:27.350
shouting outside of his room and he goes out to various size or creates this

1811
00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.290
noble theme park and it's over.

1812
00:44:29.291 --> 00:44:29.460
They,

1813
00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:30.560
you'll with Disney for,

1814
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:31.550
for,

1815
00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:32.520
we can watch these,

1816
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:36.570
these nobles and they agree to be junior partners of absolute rule.

1817
00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:37.230
Uh,

1818
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:38.520
and they weren't the only ones.

1819
00:44:38.521 --> 00:44:38.700
And,

1820
00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:41.400
and the great power struggles of the 18th century,

1821
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:41.971
uh,

1822
00:44:41.971 --> 00:44:43.230
would be very different than the,

1823
00:44:43.231 --> 00:44:44.050
than these,

1824
00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:44.520
uh,

1825
00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.890
this blood letting of civilians that it proceeded.

1826
00:44:46.891 --> 00:44:50.790
They professional kinds of armies and all of that.

1827
00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:51.990
But those are more themes,

1828
00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:52.470
uh,

1829
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:53.090
for,

1830
00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:53.220
uh,

1831
00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:54.090
future lectures.

1832
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:54.481
Now,

1833
00:44:54.481 --> 00:44:56.970
Wednesday I'm going to talk about exceptions to absolutism.

1834
00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:02.120
What the Dutch and what the English had in common that gave them very different

1835
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:03.383
outcomes,

1836
00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:04.500
political outcomes.

1837
00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:05.790
And that's important too,

1838
00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:09.930
in the emergence of the country in which many of you live.

1839
00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:11.190
See Ya.
