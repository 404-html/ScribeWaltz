WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.930
This is the beginning of the,
the French part of,
of the course,

2
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:08.190
because today I'm going to talk about,
uh,
the enlightenment and a,

3
00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:12.840
the sort of the cultural concomitants of the French revolution,
I,

4
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.890
and sort of how people began to imagine an alternative sear or an alternate,

5
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.080
a sense of,
of sovereignty in the nation.

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.830
And then you're in for trade on Monday cause I had one of the only bootleg

7
00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:29.400
copies of,
uh,
uh,
the,

8
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.420
the live speech and then the execution of Louis the 16th.

9
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:34.290
So I'm going to play that.

10
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:38.730
And also the death of citizen Mohan in the bathtub at the hands of Charlotte

11
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:41.820
called day.
Uh,
and so that'll be on,
on Monday.

12
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:43.830
And then I'll talk about inevitably,

13
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.750
but I don't particularly like him on Napoleon on a I on Wednesday.

14
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.640
Uh,
so the next three times for about labelle fos,
but because the revolution is,

15
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.410
is terribly important,
uh,
and uh,
indeed,
uh,
you know,

16
00:00:58.411 --> 00:01:02.610
in lots of ways,
in many places as well.
We're doing.
So what,

17
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:05.910
I'm going to start,
I'm going to do three things today.

18
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:08.790
I'm going to first talk about four things.
First,

19
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:13.791
just your basic outline of what difference the enlightenment made a followed by,

20
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.510
uh,
uh,
with reference to my,

21
00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:21.050
a good friend Bob Darwin's work.
Uh,

22
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.930
the social history of ideas and look at sort of surprising ways that

23
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:27.680
enlightenment influence,
uh,
was felt,
uh,

24
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.290
and not talking about the big time people like Lou,
so,
and Voltaire,

25
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.120
but the Grub Street hacks.

26
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.560
And then I'm going to talk a little bit about the public sphere.
Uh,

27
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.880
taking two examples.

28
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:42.690
One from the work of David Bell and one from the work of Sarah Mazda,
uh,

29
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.010
in which you can see the sort of emergence of,

30
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.230
uh,
of this possibly different way of viewing sovereignty,

31
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:55.830
it residing in the nation and not in,
in,
in a king.

32
00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.080
And then look again at what kind of,
what difference,
uh,
in a very strange way,

33
00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:04.320
the enlightenment I made in all of this.
So first to kind of classic,

34
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.290
a classic stuff just to review,
uh,
for you.
Um,

35
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.990
if you had to summarize six ways that enlightenment mattered,

36
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.850
uh,
you might indeed list them like this.
Uh,
first of all,
uh,

37
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.950
without question,
enlightenment thought,

38
00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:23.330
although the enlightenment thinkers disagreed on many things and,

39
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.500
and a few were atheists,
but not many,

40
00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:29.520
but most were deist and believe that God was sort of everywhere.
Um,

41
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.260
the enlightenment did weaken the hold of traditional religion,

42
00:02:34.261 --> 00:02:38.730
particularly the role of the Catholic Church as,
as a,
as a public institution.

43
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.520
Uh,
in France of course,
if you read in high school French or,
or whatever,
uh,

44
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.570
wherever a candied,
uh,
which is blatantly a,
uh,
uh,

45
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.200
anti a religious of Voltaire,
you'll see the most extreme example of that.
Uh,

46
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:56.020
secondly,
and related to this,
um,
it,
it,
the,

47
00:02:56.021 --> 00:02:59.650
the Lightbend thinkers taught a secular code of ethics,
uh,

48
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.720
one that was a divorced from a religious beliefs,
uh,

49
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:08.890
that they were engaged with humanity.
They loved humanity.

50
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:10.460
They thought people were basically good and not,

51
00:03:10.461 --> 00:03:13.250
and this shouldn't be just a valley of tears,
uh,

52
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.730
awaiting eternal life and went out,
uh,
to,
uh,
make,
uh,

53
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.520
such claims.
Third is that they developed a,
a critical spirit,
uh,

54
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.650
of analysis,

55
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.710
not to s not to accept routine tradition sort of passed out path.

56
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.580
A truth that were passed down from generation to generation.
Uh,

57
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.360
particularly those passed down by,
um,
uh,
by religious,

58
00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:41.290
a religious establishment and not to accept routine,
uh,

59
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:46.060
a tradition.
I'm such,
for example,
a routine hierarchies,

60
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.720
uh,
uh,
that,
and this was part of,
of their,
uh,

61
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.200
of their spirit of analysis.
Fourth,

62
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:58.150
they were curious about history and believed they believed in progress.
Um,

63
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.760
and they were convinced that,
that,
that,
uh,

64
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.780
that France had a special role to play in this.
And to be sure the enlightenment,

65
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.940
uh,
was to be found in many places in,
in,
in Europe,
uh,
and in,

66
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.480
uh,
uh,
the United States,
and it will,
it became the United States.
Uh,

67
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:15.360
but nonetheless,
uh,

68
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.660
Paris particularly played a central role in that,
um,

69
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.870
fifth that they differentiated absolutism from despotism.

70
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.710
And in order to understand,
you know,
what happens in this,

71
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.770
a remarkable series of events,
uh,

72
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.750
in a 1789 and in subsequent years,
uh,

73
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.950
as I said before,

74
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:39.160
there weren't 10 people in France who consider themselves Republicans,
uh,

75
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:43.510
that is wanted Republican's 1789.
And how it was that,
uh,
uh,

76
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.130
two or three years later,
well,
in 1793,
I became an easy,
uh,

77
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:53.131
for the majority of the population to imagine a life without any king at all.

78
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.800
And sixth,
uh,
that,
and here's the role of,

79
00:04:56.801 --> 00:05:00.340
of the kind of the Grub street hacks of the kind of third division of,
of,
uh,

80
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.330
of enlightenment thinkers that we'll talk about it in just a few minutes.
Uh,

81
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.870
they,

82
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.870
they heap abuse against what they consider to be an unearned,

83
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.890
unjustified privilege.
Uh,
and,
uh,
how can we put this disrespected,

84
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.540
uh,
the monarchy.
Uh,
and indeed,
uh,
the nobles who,
uh,

85
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.790
who hung around,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
the king,
uh,
so,
uh,

86
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.850
one can say in hindsight because we know what happened next,
uh,

87
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.560
that the enlightenment helped,
uh,
prepare,
uh,
other way for,

88
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:33.750
uh,
uh,

89
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.760
the French revolution and that the French Revolution Transferred Power

90
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.970
Transferred Authority to people who were very influenced by the enlightenment.

91
00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:43.840
The classic example,

92
00:05:43.841 --> 00:05:46.960
which I will give it because I enjoy talking about him so much and he has an

93
00:05:46.961 --> 00:05:49.790
important as Mexico million,
uh,
Hovis piano,
uh,

94
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.920
who in many ways was a child of the philosophic as you know,
the philosophic,

95
00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:56.890
which is such an important word.
I in French,
it became a word in English,

96
00:05:56.891 --> 00:06:01.730
the philosophic,
a word,
the thinkers of the enlightenment and hubs.
Pierre,
uh,

97
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:05.560
born in a house in the northern part of France.
And now what is the product?

98
00:06:05.561 --> 00:06:10.490
[inaudible],
uh,
was very much influenced by enlightenment thought I,

99
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:11.750
and,
uh,
the,

100
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.620
as the 12 of the committee of public safety sat around that big green table

101
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.880
making decisions that affected the lives of,
of lots of people in France.
Uh,

102
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.980
enlightenment influence,
uh,
is,
was certainly there.
Now the enlightenment,

103
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.300
you know,
stretched across frontiers.
Uh,
and if you,
if you do,

104
00:06:29.301 --> 00:06:32.320
I think there's a map in the second edition of the book that you're kind of the

105
00:06:32.321 --> 00:06:35.260
reading it that shows the,
uh,
uh,
how many,
uh,
where,

106
00:06:35.261 --> 00:06:38.630
where you could find copies of Djo,
hose,
famous encyclopedia,

107
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.080
and you could find it in South Africa.
You could find it in,
in,
in Moscow,

108
00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:46.010
you could find it in Philadelphia,
you could find it in New York.
Uh,

109
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.600
you could find it in,
in,
in paypal,
Rome.
You can find it all over the place.
Um,

110
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.230
but one thing that's,
that,
that's,
that's interesting is,
is that,
uh,
you know,

111
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.720
20 or 30 years ago,

112
00:06:56.721 --> 00:06:59.660
so what I was sort of starting out and when people did what they used to call

113
00:06:59.661 --> 00:07:03.770
intellectual history,
intellectual history was sort of the big ideas.

114
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.880
When you call it the kind of via Reggea of history where you've got one idea

115
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.340
sort of,
uh,
moving along and it sort of hooks up with another idea.
And then a,

116
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.390
then a third idea comes as a result of that idea.
And,
uh,

117
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.360
it's rather like traditional art history where you try to decide or discover

118
00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:24.870
where it is that a,
you know,
Pizarro got his red ochre as a color or,
uh,

119
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.690
uh,
or where,
uh,
it was such a,
such a broke painter.
Uh,
uh,

120
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.150
got the idea of painting a,
a cherubs in,
in a certain way.

121
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.980
Now in the very early seventies,
my,
uh,
my,
uh,
colleague,
uh,

122
00:07:36.981 --> 00:07:40.520
retired a long time and greatest story in Peter Gay coined the phrase,

123
00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:45.290
the social history of ideas,
that ideas to have a history.
I mean,
who,

124
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.520
who,
who understood,
who sold,
who read Voltaire,

125
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.780
who read the Encyclopedia of Djo Ho,
uh,

126
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:58.790
how do we know how these ideas were used?
And so,
uh,

127
00:07:58.791 --> 00:08:02.690
he called for the social history of ideas and a number of people,

128
00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:06.010
including Bob Darton,
who's now at Harvard,
but I taught at Princeton for,

129
00:08:06.011 --> 00:08:09.140
for decades,
and who turned out really the finest historians of,

130
00:08:09.141 --> 00:08:13.070
of old regime France,
uh,
took this very seriously.
So did my,

131
00:08:13.071 --> 00:08:17.300
another friend of mine,
Daniel,
Shh,
uh,
who,
uh,
did,
uh,

132
00:08:17.301 --> 00:08:21.710
work on the academy,
which I'll discuss in a while.
So they began to look at,

133
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.710
you know,
how did enlightenment ideas get around?
I mean,

134
00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:29.450
how did copies of Candide,
which was illegal in France,
censored?

135
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.200
How did these,
these things turn up in,
in France?
Um,

136
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:38.570
so let me just say a couple things about this.
Enlightenment ideas,

137
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:43.140
uh,
really came into,
uh,

138
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:47.700
elite,
elite,
popular opinion in,

139
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:49.670
in what we call the public sphere.

140
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.810
That is people who are interested in ideas and people who became interested in

141
00:08:53.811 --> 00:08:58.470
politics in really three major ways in France.
Uh,
and,

142
00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.980
and their,
their equivalent of these and other places.
The,
the Scottish example,

143
00:09:01.981 --> 00:09:04.050
because the Scottish enlightenment is very important.
I mean,

144
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:06.840
you can read about it in the book.
Uh,
will,
uh,

145
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:11.710
one of these will be quite clear there first,
uh,
through academies,
uh,

146
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:15.420
Academy,
an academy a is not a university.

147
00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:19.020
It has nothing to do with the university academy and they still exist.

148
00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:22.630
I'm a member of one of these academy and obscure winning the Owl Dash,
uh,
uh,

149
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.460
in academy.
It was a group of sort of,
of Aryeh dights,
uh,

150
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:31.060
sometimes including clergy,
many nobles,
uh,
many kinds of,
you know,

151
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.740
bourgeois people of education who,
uh,
uh,

152
00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:37.450
the population that was literate increases in,

153
00:09:37.451 --> 00:09:42.450
in western Europe a decidedly,
uh,
uh,
in the 18th century.

154
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:47.020
And they would get together and they discuss ideas and they had contests,
uh,

155
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.480
where people who wanted to make them a little money would answer a question,
uh,

156
00:09:51.481 --> 00:09:54.720
put out by the academy and they would write,
uh,

157
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:57.070
write responses to questions about,
you know,

158
00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:01.140
about science and about religion and,
and about ideas,

159
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:05.250
big time ideas or it was piano who wins one of these contests.

160
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:09.390
And these academy meet in,
in,
in smaller rooms than uh,
than this.

161
00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:14.260
But they discuss ideas.
And so I mean there with these ideas about,
you know,
of,

162
00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:19.200
of,
of sort of that are putting in Sharp,
uh,
analysis,

163
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:21.750
a reevaluation.
The role of the church I was institution,

164
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:25.680
they have to get around some way.
People have to know,
you know,
know about them.

165
00:10:25.681 --> 00:10:27.420
And the academy is one way that this happened.

166
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.380
A second one moving to number three are masonic lodges.

167
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.920
A masonic lodge is still exists.
There's one,
I don't know if it's still active,

168
00:10:34.921 --> 00:10:37.830
but there's a big masonic building out on Whitney on the right.

169
00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:40.410
I think it became an insurance building.
And one of the,
you know,

170
00:10:40.411 --> 00:10:44.490
the horrors of my seventh grade life was having to be dragged off to the dancing

171
00:10:44.491 --> 00:10:48.630
school in Portland,
Oregon,
which meant it,
you know,
in a large building,

172
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:53.110
which was a masonic lodge.
Now Masonic Masonic Lodges Begin in,
in,

173
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.780
in Scotland and,
and they are secular secularizing,
uh,

174
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.440
institutions that,
that,
that the members,
you know,
uh,
you know,

175
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.240
mostly all agree that agreed in the 18th century that the Church has public
role,

176
00:11:06.241 --> 00:11:09.120
institution role is,
is,
is to too important.

177
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:13.920
So masonic lodges talk about these ideas as well.
They talk about who,

178
00:11:13.921 --> 00:11:16.950
so Ddo Montez too,
and all of these people.

179
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:20.820
And so this is a second way in which,
uh,
these,
uh,
uh,

180
00:11:20.821 --> 00:11:23.850
these ideas get out.
And the third is the subtle.

181
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:26.730
There's another French word that's so important to became an English word.

182
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:31.380
[inaudible] was a gathering of,
of,
of pretty elite people,

183
00:11:31.381 --> 00:11:34.380
but interested in the life of the mind.
They met in,

184
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:39.080
they were hosted by hostesses.
Again,
the role of women in the lightening.

185
00:11:39.081 --> 00:11:41.920
And I give you in the book the example of Madame,
you'll Fra,
uh,

186
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.970
which was the classic one,
but people would come together to eat,

187
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:49.920
to drink and discuss ideas.
Uh,
you know,
when British guests came to,
uh,

188
00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.620
uh,
uh,
Paris,
the salon,
and they said,
well,
all they do is and drink.

189
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:56.710
They spent all their time eating and drinking and they don't discuss ideas that

190
00:11:56.711 --> 00:11:58.390
much,
but in fact they did.

191
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.230
And they're still a wonderful place in Paris called the,
uh,
pilot high Allah,

192
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.191
or you couldn't go.

193
00:12:03.191 --> 00:12:06.540
And on very hot days in the 18th century and the 17th seventies,

194
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.190
you can imagine people meeting,

195
00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:12.950
they're talking about the ideas of young enlightenment,
hot shots,
uh,

196
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:17.830
those people who have become part of the Canon,
you know,
of,
of Western,
uh,

197
00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:20.300
of Western civilization.
Uh,

198
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.740
and so this is another way where these ideas get up,
get along.

199
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:28.390
And so young would be philosophic on the make coming up from the provinces,

200
00:12:28.391 --> 00:12:32.470
what they want to just be introduced to one of these hostesses so that they will

201
00:12:32.471 --> 00:12:36.550
be invited to trot out their intellectual wares at one of these gatherings.

202
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:41.590
So these are concrete examples of the way that these ideas got around and people

203
00:12:41.591 --> 00:12:44.530
didn't pay any attention to this before about 30,
35 years ago.

204
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.420
Daniel hoelschers book on the academy,

205
00:12:46.421 --> 00:12:50.070
two volumes to huge volumes not translated are really,
you know,

206
00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.860
are really marvelous,
uh,
in,
in all of that.

207
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:58.020
So that's something to keep in mind.
Now.
Um,
now the,

208
00:12:58.021 --> 00:13:00.520
the high enlightenment really,
you know,

209
00:13:00.521 --> 00:13:04.670
really ends in 1778 traditionally that's a textbook kind of a,

210
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:08.890
but it doesn't matter because that's when Voltaire and his great enemy who so

211
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.430
both die.
Now after that,

212
00:13:12.431 --> 00:13:17.110
there are no more multiple Jews are Voltaire's.
Uh,
or you know,
the,
the big,

213
00:13:17.111 --> 00:13:21.610
the big time,
the all stars of,
of,
of,
of the philosophic.
There aren't anymore.

214
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
But there is this next generation of would be Phyllis off people who could think

215
00:13:27.461 --> 00:13:31.330
and who could write and who want to hit the big time.
And they,

216
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.210
they see the Voltaire made big bucks,
big frank,
big free fall,

217
00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:39.790
a big lever,
uh,
uh,
writing.
And they want to be like him.

218
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.810
They want to be be like Voltaire,
or they want to be like,
who is,

219
00:13:43.811 --> 00:13:46.540
so his arch enemy paced around his,

220
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:50.960
his little farm called [inaudible] met and sub wild outside of Shambo.

221
00:13:50.961 --> 00:13:54.330
He and who hated Russo.
He hated Voltaire.
They really couldn't,

222
00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.520
couldn't stand each other,
but he also hit the big time.

223
00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:02.680
And so what the Grub Street hacks Grub street refers to,
you know,

224
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:07.000
so,
uh,
uh,
I don't know if it's a real street or imaginary street in London where,

225
00:14:07.001 --> 00:14:10.810
where lots of would be writers and writers who are peddling their wares hung

226
00:14:10.811 --> 00:14:13.060
around these grub street hacks.

227
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:17.140
The third division of people who want to have the kind of entry in the Sutton on

228
00:14:17.141 --> 00:14:21.970
life to,
um,
to put forth their ideas.

229
00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.660
Uh,
they live on the top floor of where the poorest people live.

230
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.420
They're dodging their,
their landlords all the time.

231
00:14:28.421 --> 00:14:29.470
They don't have enough money to pay.

232
00:14:29.471 --> 00:14:32.950
A lot of them live in Paris right around now that you're Odl,

233
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:36.530
it doesn't matter if you know,
or the oil,
but they live,
uh,
right around,
uh,
uh,

234
00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:40.940
that part in the Latin quarter.
But more in,
in,
in,
uh,
what now is the sixth,
uh,

235
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.830
on these small,
uh,
and they,
right.
But what do they write about?

236
00:14:44.831 --> 00:14:47.470
They need to make money.
So,
uh,
the,
the,
the,
the,

237
00:14:47.471 --> 00:14:50.290
the big news here as Darton discovered is that they write,

238
00:14:50.291 --> 00:14:54.620
they write pornography.
They,
right,
I go scatological for pornography.

239
00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.280
They write what they call in French Lee better.
They were,

240
00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:01.580
they write a broad sides really denouncing,
uh,
uh,

241
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.290
denouncing the royal family,

242
00:15:03.291 --> 00:15:06.620
denouncing the queen above all in delicately called the Austrian horror.

243
00:15:06.621 --> 00:15:11.390
By here many detractors who are omnipresent,
uh,
uh,

244
00:15:11.391 --> 00:15:12.890
and,
uh,
uh,

245
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:17.450
they write against what they think is unearned privilege,

246
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.530
the kind of censorship that they see as keeping them from hitting the big time.

247
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:23.840
And so when the point of,
of,
of,

248
00:15:23.841 --> 00:15:28.310
of Darwin's many wonderful books is that in the long run are these people were

249
00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:32.780
the Grub Street hacks,
uh,
Voltaire denigrated in them as the Kenai,

250
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:37.430
the rabble,
the scribblers jealous,
eager,

251
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.860
anxious,
hungry,

252
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:45.670
is that their attacks on the regime and against the unearned privilege as they

253
00:15:46.641 --> 00:15:51.641
saw it helps a road belief in the monarchy and help suggest that the monarchy

254
00:15:53.841 --> 00:15:57.920
itself and the people hanging around the monarchy had Versailles are,

255
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.380
is lapsing into despotism.

256
00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:05.780
So they do make a difference.
Now,
let me give you an example.

257
00:16:05.781 --> 00:16:10.160
This is sort of a classic one.
Imagine you're a bookseller in Poitier.

258
00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.930
Poitier is a very nice town,

259
00:16:11.931 --> 00:16:16.931
full of lovely old Romanesque churches in sort of the central western France.

260
00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.133
[inaudible].

261
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:25.300
You are writing to Switzerland to order books that you want to sell to people

262
00:16:27.081 --> 00:16:31.310
who have ordered books,
for example.
Uh,
and he writes the following letter.

263
00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:35.080
Here's a short list of philosophical books.
You know,

264
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.230
books written by the philosophic that I want to order.

265
00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.720
Please send the invoice in advance.

266
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:47.200
They include Venus in the cloister or the nun in the nightgown Christianity.

267
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.340
Uh,
unveiled that could be that,
you know,
the subtitle to memories,

268
00:16:52.341 --> 00:16:55.650
the memories of a diamond.
Now my keys at the pump,
uh,

269
00:16:56.030 --> 00:17:00.290
inquiry on the origins of Oriental despotism,
the system of nature,

270
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:04.100
Teresa,
the philosopher,
Margo,
the camp follower.

271
00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:09.140
Now this is not exactly the stuff of Dj Ddo Voltaire who so,

272
00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.270
and,
and these other people,

273
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.840
but yet those who penned such things,

274
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:19.250
imagine that they were Phyllis off and wanted to have the same kind of impact

275
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:24.260
that,
uh,
uh,
that,
that Voltaire and the others,
uh,
had.
These were the,

276
00:17:24.261 --> 00:17:28.700
those are the kind I either kind of rabble of,
uh,
of Grub street.

277
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:33.080
Now,
why was he writing Switzerland,
uh,
to begin with?
And again,
this is the,

278
00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:36.500
this is again the question of how do these ideas get around.
Now,

279
00:17:36.501 --> 00:17:39.860
one of the things that the GRUB street hacks didn't like is that you've got

280
00:17:39.861 --> 00:17:40.694
sensors,

281
00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:44.360
you've got paid sensors who worked for the government who says this can't be

282
00:17:44.361 --> 00:17:48.440
published,
or Ah,
you shouldn't have published that baby.
That wasn't a good idea.

283
00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:49.260
Um,

284
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:54.260
and so the result is it because in a system in which privilege of which

285
00:17:54.961 --> 00:17:59.961
monopolies of which guilds controlled the production and distribution of almost

286
00:18:00.031 --> 00:18:05.031
everything that book selling and book printing or monopolies controlled by the

287
00:18:05.071 --> 00:18:09.900
state.
So you can't just,
if you're a Parisian printer,
you know,

288
00:18:09.901 --> 00:18:13.590
unless you're risking being thrown in the slammer,
the,
you know,
in the slammer,

289
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:18.090
uh,
you,
uh,
and that's not a real word in French.
And I was like,
uh,
you,
uh,

290
00:18:18.091 --> 00:18:22.890
you know,
you,
you,
you,
you can't print this stuff out.
Uh,
in,
uh,
in Paris,

291
00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:27.750
so much of a,
of the enlightenment literature is published in,

292
00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:28.890
you'll not be shocked to know,

293
00:18:28.891 --> 00:18:33.690
you already know this in Amsterdam or in Lusail in Brussels and the southern

294
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:38.730
Netherlands or in Switzerland.
And Bob Darren,
when he was a young,

295
00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.300
a young professor before the young graduate student,

296
00:18:42.301 --> 00:18:44.860
he hit the Jackpot because he gets a lot of the stuff was,

297
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:48.120
it was pretty early on in Switzerland in new Chatel.

298
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:51.540
And he got ahold of the Archives of this printing company.

299
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:56.600
So he was able to do the social history of ideas,
who bought what.

300
00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:00.940
Oh by the way,
how do you get,
before there was Ryan Air,
uh,

301
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:02.040
or any of these places,

302
00:19:02.041 --> 00:19:07.041
how do you get all of this stuff from Switzerland where there are big mountains

303
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:12.180
into France?
How do you get it to Poitier?
How do you get it there?

304
00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:16.560
So again,
you have to look at the way that this stuff was distributed,

305
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.840
the ideas we've already seen,
how they were distributed,

306
00:19:18.841 --> 00:19:22.620
but how literally you get these,
these books,
these Bukana,
these pamphlets.

307
00:19:22.621 --> 00:19:27.590
He's brochure from Switzerland or the equivalent from Amsterdam or Brucello.

308
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.970
That's easier.
A flat country is a little different than mountains,
uh,

309
00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:35.370
into France.
Well,
uh,
in France,
as in the German states,

310
00:19:35.371 --> 00:19:38.780
as in Italy,
they were peddlers.
They were peddlers and what they went,

311
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:41.670
they would go on the road and they had,
you know,
like a medicine ball and a gym.

312
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:46.590
They'd have these huge leather bags and they'd be stuffed with all sorts of

313
00:19:46.591 --> 00:19:48.480
things.
Pens and pins.

314
00:19:48.481 --> 00:19:52.610
And I think I mentioned this in another context and you know,
uh,
religious,
uh,

315
00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.520
literature,

316
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:58.140
but also a hidden at the bottom beneath the religious literature.

317
00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:02.670
Uh,
they are,
are smuggling into France,

318
00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:07.650
enlightenment literature and they have drop off,
drop,
drop,
drop off points.

319
00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:11.190
Uh,
they go over the [inaudible] mountains that's not so easy to do.

320
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:15.990
And they take them to a city like shore mall in the east or Mez or a Nazi,

321
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:18.300
and then somebody else carries this stuff all the way.

322
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.160
So avoiding the police around Paris,
the,

323
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.450
the gendarmerie either Maasho say as they were called then it doesn't matter

324
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:27.720
that this stuff,
Venus,
the,
you know,
the camp follower,

325
00:20:27.721 --> 00:20:31.410
Margo of the camp follower ends up pleasing this,
this,
uh,
you know,

326
00:20:31.411 --> 00:20:36.270
drooling guy in,
in,
in Poitier who can buy it from his bookstore.
Um,

327
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.260
so,
uh,
the,
so I mean,
so when you can really follow,

328
00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:42.330
not only need arose encyclopedia,

329
00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:46.170
and how do we know where Dee Dee orocecal PD ended up,
by the way?
Well,

330
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.230
for example,
a people who leave wills,
you know,
uh,

331
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.600
well that's how we know about literature in the 19th century because people

332
00:20:52.601 --> 00:20:56.980
wouldn't have the libraries I in in a states would be,
it would be detailed.

333
00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.800
So we know what books people had.
Now in the 18th century,

334
00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:03.250
we have a tremendous proliferation of ideas of reading,

335
00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:07.600
of literacy and have ways of discussing these ideas.

336
00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:10.390
I've already mentioned three of them there,
but if you look at the case of,
of,

337
00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:12.940
of Britain,
you've got the coffee house,

338
00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:17.620
coffee houses follow the mania of coffee and coffee comes from where the

339
00:21:17.621 --> 00:21:21.950
colonies.
So coffee houses,
you know,
are part of,
uh,

340
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:26.230
this sort of globalization of the economy,
but also the globalization of ideas.

341
00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:31.420
So this stuff all kind of fits together.
Uh,
so again,
uh,
the,
the,

342
00:21:31.421 --> 00:21:34.020
the,
these Voltaire and Russo and Montas,

343
00:21:34.021 --> 00:21:38.360
you and de Novo and the others would be just horrified to think that anybody in

344
00:21:38.361 --> 00:21:42.910
intellectual,
we mentioned some of these grubs treat hacks along with them.
Uh,

345
00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.570
because they didn't accept them and nor were they have the same quality at all.

346
00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:50.440
Some of these guys,
by the way,
there's one who I mentioned the book,
a guy called,

347
00:21:50.441 --> 00:21:53.860
we sold B R I s.
S OT,
uh,
uh,

348
00:21:53.861 --> 00:21:56.960
who becomes an important leader of a faction in the revolution called digital

349
00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:01.890
down from around Boldo who are against the Jacco van.
More about that later.
Bri.

350
00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.720
Bri.
So is broke.
How's he going to pay the landlord?

351
00:22:04.721 --> 00:22:08.740
He has no idea where is he going to get his next drink.
So what's he do?

352
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:13.180
He worked for the police.
He works as,
as police informer on the other.

353
00:22:13.181 --> 00:22:17.320
Phyllis would be philosophically,
I'm the GRUB street hacks.
How do we know this?

354
00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:22.410
Darren found the dossier in which Reso is being paid off by these people.

355
00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:23.141
How other,

356
00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:26.160
what are other ways that we know how many of these characters there were there

357
00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:29.800
about two or 300?
I don't remember exactly why.
Cause they want money.

358
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.780
So the on one hand they say,
oh,
I don't like this.

359
00:22:31.781 --> 00:22:33.370
Censorship is keep keeping people,

360
00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.760
keeping people from recognizing my true genius or their hand.

361
00:22:36.761 --> 00:22:40.600
They write little sniffling letters saying I am a writer and a very good one.

362
00:22:40.601 --> 00:22:42.910
Indeed.
And therefore I mirror at a state pension.

363
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:47.680
So they write these letters to various,
the equivalent of ministries saying,

364
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:51.710
please give me some money because I am a,
I am a really wonderful writer and,

365
00:22:51.711 --> 00:22:55.420
and instead of repressing my work,
you should be saluting my genius.

366
00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.950
And so they write no clammy,
uh,
uh,
letters like that,

367
00:22:59.951 --> 00:23:04.570
that you find in the archives.
So we piece this stuff together,
uh,
gradually.

368
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:09.720
So let me just a race over here and just give you just an example of where is

369
00:23:10.151 --> 00:23:14.890
this stuff.
All right,
here.
Here we go.

370
00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.950
What would Voltaire think of this?
Um,

371
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:22.990
here is a one of these pamphlets that's denouncing the high livers that,

372
00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:25.450
uh,
uh,
out at Versailles,

373
00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:29.440
the public has worn that an epidemic disease is raging among the girls of the

374
00:23:29.441 --> 00:23:30.790
opera,
uh,

375
00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:34.630
that has begun to reach the ladies of the court and that has been communicated

376
00:23:34.631 --> 00:23:38.050
to their lackeys.
This disease elongates,
the face,

377
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.640
destroys the complexion,

378
00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:44.140
reduces the weight and causes horrible ravages where it becomes situated.

379
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:47.600
There are ladies teeth,
others without eyebrows,

380
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:51.760
and some are now completely paralyzed.
So people want to know what is it,

381
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:55.190
what's obviously have an year old disease.
And he's obviously exaggerating,

382
00:23:55.191 --> 00:23:58.630
you know,
the,
uh,
don't,
who knows?
I mean,
I don't know,
but,
but,
uh,
uh,
uh,
you know,

383
00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.330
the results of such,
uh,
of such a melody.
But what,

384
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:06.370
what he's doing is he sees Justin that what's really going on at Versailles is

385
00:24:06.561 --> 00:24:08.120
lots of people how to put this politely,

386
00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:10.720
hooking up all over the places at the PTT,
you,

387
00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:13.340
whether dressing up as peasants or whatever.
Uh,

388
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:17.360
and that the result is it is very demeaning for,
uh,

389
00:24:17.361 --> 00:24:20.960
the French state and for the French monarchy.
So does this have an effect?

390
00:24:20.961 --> 00:24:23.740
It does.
It really does.
And it leads,
it,

391
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:28.730
it contributes to what has been called the de sacralization of the French

392
00:24:28.731 --> 00:24:29.564
monarchy.

393
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:34.640
That it's very hard to argue that God has put absolute monarchs on,

394
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.930
uh,
on earth to,
uh,
to make,
bring people better lives.

395
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.680
If you've got these people,
uh,

396
00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:44.750
and no one had ever really ordinary people did not get into Joe Tsai unless they

397
00:24:44.751 --> 00:24:45.584
were among the know,

398
00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:50.650
the 15,000 lackeys working their lackeys would be the term given by the people

399
00:24:50.871 --> 00:24:55.190
who employ them.
Uh,
you,
you know,
you didn't know.
So you had to surmise,

400
00:24:55.191 --> 00:24:56.720
you had to guess what was going on.

401
00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:00.320
And I'll give you a couple of examples in a while and I better hurry up and do

402
00:25:00.321 --> 00:25:03.680
this,
uh,
in which you can kind of see how this works.

403
00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.960
I'll give you a kind of a spectacularly interesting example.
He's,
I think so,
uh,

404
00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:10.920
at the end,
no,
by the way,
just as an aside and w,
uh,

405
00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:15.620
during the French revolution,
you know,
Louis the 16th size to get the hell out.

406
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:20.780
And so he and Marie Antoinette improbably dress themselves up as sort of a

407
00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.380
ordinary people.
Uh,
and you know,

408
00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.160
they're not people who have to set the alarm clock.

409
00:25:25.161 --> 00:25:27.610
Usually they get up at three in the morning and they get into this.

410
00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:32.090
This large carriage has been stuck stuffed with silver and flog off and all

411
00:25:32.091 --> 00:25:33.080
sorts of other things.

412
00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:36.500
And they hightail it toward what is now the Belgian frontier.

413
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:38.690
But they get further and further behind.

414
00:25:38.691 --> 00:25:40.550
You can read about this when you get to that chapter.
It's a,

415
00:25:40.551 --> 00:25:41.720
it's an interesting story.

416
00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:46.250
And finally they get recognize.
Uh,

417
00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:50.180
she is not a governance.
She is the queen.
Uh,

418
00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:54.290
and one of the people that first,
uh,
realizes this,

419
00:25:54.291 --> 00:25:58.430
the king has actually caught a glimpse of the king himself by looking through

420
00:25:58.431 --> 00:26:02.750
the fence at just sigh at the time of a wedding and he sees the king.

421
00:26:02.751 --> 00:26:03.620
There aren't photographs,

422
00:26:03.621 --> 00:26:07.460
but he recognizes the king's nose and he gets done as knees and said,

423
00:26:07.461 --> 00:26:10.850
[inaudible] you are the king and this guy can no longer pretend that he's Amir

424
00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:15.110
hanger on with it,
you know,
uh,
uh,
assisting a Russian bareness.
Uh,

425
00:26:15.111 --> 00:26:19.850
and it's all over.
But the shouting I at that point.
Um,

426
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.110
so,
uh,

427
00:26:21.111 --> 00:26:26.111
what these people do is they helped break down the sense of automatic respect

428
00:26:28.731 --> 00:26:30.590
for the monarchy as an institution.

429
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:35.200
And of course the fact that they can't stand a Marie Antoinette,
uh,

430
00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.240
who rightly or wrongly is accused of all sorts of things.

431
00:26:38.241 --> 00:26:40.970
Now this is a racing ahead of the story,
but,
uh,
uh,

432
00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:46.030
Louis 16th was a big time cuckolded guy because his wife was seriously sleeping

433
00:26:47.131 --> 00:26:48.660
around while he was putting a,

434
00:26:48.661 --> 00:26:51.120
taking to get apart and putting back together clocks,

435
00:26:51.121 --> 00:26:55.890
which he liked to do a in the big house when his wife is,
is,

436
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.790
you know,
out in the bushes.
Uh,
and to put,
you know,
crew crudely,
oh,

437
00:26:59.791 --> 00:27:03.540
I forgot this is being held by some,
but anyway,
uh,
I take that back.

438
00:27:03.541 --> 00:27:07.380
He race had fleas anyway.
Anyway,
so,
uh,
uh,

439
00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:12.240
but what these people do is over the long run,
this helps a road,
uh,
you know,

440
00:27:12.241 --> 00:27:16.020
respect for the monarchy and helps us explain why it was an in 1789,

441
00:27:16.021 --> 00:27:21.021
you can imagine a world without a king and a world without a queen.

442
00:27:21.721 --> 00:27:26.550
And when they bring them back,
they bring the old boy and his wife back from,
uh,

443
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:29.040
from violin,
which is in the northeast of France.

444
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:33.690
That national guard turns their backs and serious disrespect to the character

445
00:27:33.691 --> 00:27:37.850
and they hold their guns upside down.
And at that point,
you know,
he,

446
00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:42.520
he Lafonda I call it the end of the green beans as the French say for it,

447
00:27:42.521 --> 00:27:43.320
for the king.

448
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:48.320
But this process started earlier and let me and the third string hacks of the

449
00:27:48.361 --> 00:27:49.730
enlightenment had something to do with it.

450
00:27:49.731 --> 00:27:53.790
And let me give you a couple of examples,
uh,
also from,
from,
from other friends,

451
00:27:53.791 --> 00:27:58.791
but really good serious work been done in the last 20 or 25 years.

452
00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:04.380
Now let me,
um,
uh,
rocketing right along here.
Um,

453
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:09.770
let me give you another example of this,

454
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:15.710
the relationship of the public sphere to imagining a new source of sovereignty

455
00:28:18.631 --> 00:28:23.070
that is the nation.
And to give you an example of how that works.

456
00:28:23.071 --> 00:28:25.830
And this comes from the work of David Bell,

457
00:28:25.831 --> 00:28:29.800
who was my colleague and still very dear friend who teaches at Johns Hopkins.
Um,

458
00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:34.080
and from,
from his work on lawyers,

459
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:39.110
uh,
in the 18th century.
So we'll see.
Give an example how,
sort of,

460
00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:43.340
how this fits together now.
Um,

461
00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:48.150
it also see it fits into enlightenment stuff because if,

462
00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:52.830
if the enlightenment literature was censored and,
and sometimes hard to get,

463
00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:57.490
uh,
to get ahold of though the encyclopedia was tolerated and not tolerated,

464
00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:02.400
tolerated again,
um,
what,
uh,
Bell's work on,

465
00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:02.791
uh,

466
00:29:02.791 --> 00:29:07.791
on lawyers demonstrates is the way in which lawyers and legal briefs help get

467
00:29:09.721 --> 00:29:12.150
these ideas around as well.

468
00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:17.400
Because you could not censor legal briefs to give you just an aside.

469
00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.870
Uh,
they don't worry about this.
Now,
uh,
in the case of imperial Russia,
uh,

470
00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.880
in the late 19th century,

471
00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:27.720
where there you had the big time censorship by the police,
uh,
in fact,

472
00:29:27.721 --> 00:29:31.860
when there were these trials that were political trials,
uh,
uh,
lots of what,
what,

473
00:29:31.861 --> 00:29:34.830
what was said in the courtroom got around as well,

474
00:29:34.831 --> 00:29:39.090
and couldn't really be censored,
uh,
in a way that ordinary p,
uh,

475
00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:42.310
publications could.
And so you had the same sort of effect there.

476
00:29:42.311 --> 00:29:45.250
So let me give you a couple examples.
So they're,
they're,

477
00:29:45.251 --> 00:29:48.420
they're complicated example,
but just don't worry about them.
Um,

478
00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:53.470
the first would be from a,
this very strange,
not really heresy called,

479
00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:58.540
uh,
but,
uh,
yeah,
I guess the Catholic Church considered a heresy called Jansenism.

480
00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:01.390
I remember once coming in and do the equivalent of this lecture and having to

481
00:30:01.391 --> 00:30:05.650
look at my own book for a good definition of Jansenism that I must've found once

482
00:30:05.651 --> 00:30:09.370
because it's so obscure.
Uh,
there was a,
a bishop who didn't think he was obscure,

483
00:30:09.371 --> 00:30:11.800
but a Belgian bishop,
uh,
uh,

484
00:30:11.801 --> 00:30:15.270
who got called Janssen and cause y'all saw,
uh,

485
00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:19.690
who thought that the Catholic church is becoming too overmighty and full of big

486
00:30:19.691 --> 00:30:24.280
time broke masses and huge expenses for archbishops who were doing a damn thing.

487
00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.290
And so he,
he,
uh,

488
00:30:26.291 --> 00:30:30.610
I imagined another kind of religion that became very ascetic where it became

489
00:30:30.611 --> 00:30:33.550
sort of like they were called somebody once called them Calvinists who went to

490
00:30:33.551 --> 00:30:36.430
mass,
uh,
where they were still Catholic,

491
00:30:36.431 --> 00:30:40.750
but they didn't believe in this or a high broke,
uh,
church.
And Janssen is him,

492
00:30:40.751 --> 00:30:43.570
you know,
it's about in 17,
15 or so,

493
00:30:43.571 --> 00:30:47.890
and then it comes back in the 1760s or 17,
seventies.
Um,

494
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:51.910
and it's extremely boring stuff now.
Louis the 14th,
and think it was boring,

495
00:30:51.911 --> 00:30:56.911
he sent out the troops to burn down Jansen's Abby's the big was called Paul Ohio

496
00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:01.320
outside of Paris because he thought that this was a threat to,
uh,

497
00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:05.160
to the gala can church was with,
which is sort of the alliance of,
of,
of,

498
00:31:05.161 --> 00:31:09.100
of the Catholic Church,
uh,
with,
with the monarchy in France.

499
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.510
And so rather like Carthage,

500
00:31:10.511 --> 00:31:13.680
they were supposed to plow salt into the land and all of this miss,
so they,

501
00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:18.280
the business,
but they,
so they wage war on these chances,
just,
uh,
people,
um,

502
00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:21.400
and um,
who were rather like Calvin has done many ways.

503
00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:23.920
But the only point of that is that,

504
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:28.950
that there are lawyers who begin to defend the Jansen this and begin to see the

505
00:31:29.771 --> 00:31:33.370
actions of the King Visa,
visa vi,

506
00:31:33.371 --> 00:31:37.370
this persecuted religious minority as desk Spotify.

507
00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.560
And so when lawyers are publishing legal briefs,

508
00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.680
and there's enough references in the book so you can put this together.

509
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:48.520
But I just want you to see the point when they begin to publish legal briefs

510
00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:53.230
defending the Jansenists against these kinds of attacks,

511
00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:58.210
these are published in by thousands of them and they can't be censored.

512
00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:02.740
And they begin to suggest at a time in the 19 in the 18th century,

513
00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.940
particularly after mid century when we can already begin to speak of French

514
00:32:06.941 --> 00:32:11.170
nationalism,
at least among the elite at the time of the seven years war,

515
00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:15.550
1756,
1763 that's the seven years' war,
uh,

516
00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:20.670
that it begins to suggest two things that monarchies can behave despotically

517
00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:24.910
going beyond the limits of absolute rule,

518
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:29.960
the accepted limits of absolute rule,
uh,
and that,
that the,

519
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.450
that the nation,

520
00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:36.310
this idea of the nation is being betrayed by bad governments.

521
00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:39.710
And if this doesn't sound like the French revolution,

522
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:44.630
then nothing else will cause.
Those are very important defining moments.
Now,

523
00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:49.280
the same thing happens also in the 1760s and seventies,

524
00:32:49.281 --> 00:32:49.791
seventies,

525
00:32:49.791 --> 00:32:54.320
which various attempts to liberalize the French economy that I described in the

526
00:32:54.321 --> 00:32:57.010
book.
Um,
and uh,

527
00:32:57.770 --> 00:32:59.930
the king's attempt to dispense with parliaments,

528
00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.390
the part of the mall which were worse,

529
00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:05.720
really a noble law courts that were provincial.
You can read about this,

530
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:10.870
but the same thing happens and this is the point is that these lawyers begin

531
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:16.630
turning out these legal briefs that imply two things,

532
00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:19.191
the same.

533
00:33:19.191 --> 00:33:24.191
Two things that absolute monarchy is risking,

534
00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:29.420
stepping over the lines of the acceptable and behaving and despotic way.

535
00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:35.680
And that there is something called the nation in which nobody ever imagined that

536
00:33:35.961 --> 00:33:37.850
classes were all equal.

537
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:42.020
The discourse of Liberty Fraternity equality is a hell of a long way away,

538
00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.200
but that the rights of the nation,

539
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.860
traditional rights of the nation are dying.

540
00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:53.890
Being betrayed by the monarchy and the things ain't so good at Versailles.

541
00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:58.370
And so again,

542
00:33:58.371 --> 00:34:03.371
trying to look ahead and see what happens in 1788 and above all 70 89,

543
00:34:04.311 --> 00:34:06.640
which he doesn't want to,
I'm not a big guy on dates and the history,

544
00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:09.320
you have to remember all these dates,
but 1789,

545
00:34:09.321 --> 00:34:14.090
like 1914 or late 1917,
that's a big one.
That's a big one.

546
00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:19.580
Uh,
but in order to also understand the emergence of a radical republic and the

547
00:34:19.581 --> 00:34:22.340
execution of the king,
uh,

548
00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:27.490
one has to see that the nation becomes invested with a sense of moral quality.

549
00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.210
That is,
that makes it,

550
00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:38.570
it makes it not impossible to imagine a world without kings.

551
00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:42.980
And so lawyers who are called barristers,
uh,

552
00:34:42.981 --> 00:34:47.900
play a major role in all of this.

553
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:49.401
Now again,

554
00:34:49.401 --> 00:34:54.050
this has to be seen in the context of a century in which more and more people

555
00:34:54.051 --> 00:34:57.960
can read.
Now the,
the literacy rate in,
in,

556
00:34:57.961 --> 00:35:02.660
in a country like France is still well below 50%.
Maybe it's a 40,
45%,

557
00:35:02.661 --> 00:35:07.610
something like that more men could read than women.
But,
uh,
uh,

558
00:35:07.611 --> 00:35:12.170
literacy not only literacy increases among,
among the elite,

559
00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:16.460
but the amount of things that are published and the amount of newspapers that

560
00:35:16.461 --> 00:35:20.940
are published,
uh,
uh,
that this expands dramatically.
Uh,

561
00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:24.500
uh,
a point of reference would be in,
in,
in England,

562
00:35:24.501 --> 00:35:26.840
and you can read it in Britain,
you can read about this,
but,
uh,

563
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:30.350
the campaign of John Wilkes who was sort of a,
you know,

564
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:33.950
have a rascally character,
uh,
but,
uh,

565
00:35:33.951 --> 00:35:38.951
Wilkes and the number 45 becomes virtually illegal because 45 was the number of,

566
00:35:40.201 --> 00:35:43.350
of,
of,
of a newspaper,
uh,
in which,
uh,

567
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:46.950
Wilkes essentially and its supporters call out the English,

568
00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:50.280
the British political system.
And so,
uh,
again,

569
00:35:50.281 --> 00:35:53.700
we're talking mostly about western Europe and literacy is much higher and the

570
00:35:53.701 --> 00:35:57.680
Netherlands and the,
and in northern France and in northern Italy and,
and,

571
00:35:57.681 --> 00:36:01.620
and in England,
uh,
uh,
then,
then in other places.

572
00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:06.600
But this is part of this cultural revolution that it's important to see the role

573
00:36:06.601 --> 00:36:09.060
of this because,
you know,
Orthodox Marxist interpretation,

574
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.780
you had to have the ever rising bourgeoisie was either rising in the 14th

575
00:36:12.781 --> 00:36:13.111
century.

576
00:36:13.111 --> 00:36:16.320
There they are again in the 16th century there like some sort of runaway,

577
00:36:16.321 --> 00:36:19.890
a bread or something like that in the 19th century.
There they are,

578
00:36:19.891 --> 00:36:23.240
the bourgeois century.
I'll give a lecture on the bourgeoisie,
uh,

579
00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:25.380
cause they do indeed rice.
But nonetheless,
you know,

580
00:36:25.381 --> 00:36:28.920
it kind of class analysis can't be completely thrown out.

581
00:36:28.921 --> 00:36:31.660
And me classes did exist and people had a sense of themselves as,

582
00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:35.760
as being members of a,
of a social class.
I mean that's the way that it's not,

583
00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:39.500
you know,
it was not immutable.
These boundaries were more fluid in a Britain,

584
00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:43.410
in other places,
but,
but still is important.
But now for the last 30 years,

585
00:36:43.411 --> 00:36:46.650
people had paid more attention to kind of the cultural competence of

586
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.480
concomitants of revolution and,

587
00:36:49.481 --> 00:36:53.920
and what difference enlightenment ideas made and what difference to you and the

588
00:36:53.921 --> 00:36:57.060
emergence of a sense of the nation.
Uh,

589
00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.520
and the infusion of,
you know,

590
00:36:59.521 --> 00:37:02.400
of politics with a sense of right and wrong and morality is that,
you know,

591
00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:05.130
it's an important part of,
uh,
uh,
an important part of all this.

592
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:10.260
So let me in the last 12,
12 minutes and 30 seconds that,
that are,
uh,
that I,

593
00:37:10.261 --> 00:37:13.690
that I have today.
Let me give you another example,
um,

594
00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:19.740
uh,
of this,
and this is,
uh,
uh,
I think that,
you know,
a fascinating,

595
00:37:19.741 --> 00:37:24.430
um,
uh,
uh,
let me find it so fascinating.
I can't find it,
but let me,
uh,

596
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:28.740
uh,
give me an example and this drawing upon an excellent book by Sarah Mazda.

597
00:37:28.741 --> 00:37:31.030
It's a very well known episode,
uh,

598
00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:36.050
but it shows you what kind of ties together the sense of the nation along with

599
00:37:36.481 --> 00:37:40.290
the impact of the sort of third string of enlight you're third generation of

600
00:37:40.291 --> 00:37:45.291
enlightenment hacks after 1778 to understand their role in the erosion of,

601
00:37:46.621 --> 00:37:50.400
uh,
of a,
a sense of,
of,
uh,
uh,
that,

602
00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:55.430
that the monarchy was immutable in representing the rights of a nation even as

603
00:37:55.561 --> 00:38:00.480
that's construct was just coming into,
in,
in,
into being,
um,
and,

604
00:38:00.481 --> 00:38:04.500
and that in this book called,
uh,
uh,
uh,
what's it called?

605
00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:09.480
Public life private affairs is,
I,
I'm bad on titles.
Maza takes a couple of,

606
00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:12.240
of costs.
The lab costs,
the lab would be like,

607
00:38:12.241 --> 00:38:16.350
one of the things that you find in the tabloids in Britain or the u s one of

608
00:38:16.351 --> 00:38:20.490
these sort of,
I mean,
I don't read,
I don't read that stuff,
so I really don't,

609
00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.320
can't give it a good example.
But you know,

610
00:38:22.321 --> 00:38:26.130
one of these actors and actresses you always seen see running around or
whatever.

611
00:38:26.131 --> 00:38:29.940
This,
this person is a Brittany Spears or something like that.
A singer,
actress.

612
00:38:29.941 --> 00:38:32.760
I don't know what she does,
but,
but anyway,
uh,
uh,
but you know,

613
00:38:32.761 --> 00:38:37.060
something like that,
that people focus their attention on these people.

614
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:41.650
Uh,
and they sort of dominate,
if you will,
this serve sort of a,

615
00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:44.950
almost an insane comparison,
but the public sphere,
uh,

616
00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:49.770
in that they're in the news all the time.
And so,
um,
what,
uh,

617
00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:53.200
Mazda did about the same time that David Bell was working on,

618
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:58.180
on the role of lawyers in the 18th century is that she took a couple of these

619
00:38:58.181 --> 00:38:59.680
examples,
uh,

620
00:38:59.681 --> 00:39:04.681
and shows the way in which a private affairs that were,

621
00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:09.550
you know,
kind of sleazy and,
and not too cool,
but were sensational,

622
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:14.560
uh,
help bring these threads together and,
uh,
uh,

623
00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:19.480
contribute to erode,
uh,
uh,
the prestige of a,

624
00:39:19.481 --> 00:39:24.130
of,
of,
of the monarchy.
Now.
Um,
and this fits into,

625
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:28.670
uh,
the sense that have already given you that was extremely,
uh,

626
00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.210
pervasive particularly around Paris,

627
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:36.100
is that a lot of the things that were adverse side weren't so good.
Uh,
and that,

628
00:39:36.101 --> 00:39:40.420
you know,
that the 10,000 nobles who were clustered around,
uh,

629
00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:44.920
uh,
Louis,
the 16th,
uh,
and particularly his wife,
uh,

630
00:39:44.921 --> 00:39:48.370
were undermining the authority and the prestige of the monarchy and that wasn't

631
00:39:48.371 --> 00:39:52.790
a good thing.
Um,
so an incident called the,
the,

632
00:39:52.791 --> 00:39:57.730
the diamond necklace affair is illustrative and mildly amusing.

633
00:39:57.731 --> 00:40:02.720
Not more than that.
It also involves this Palais Royale,
uh,
uh,

634
00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:07.750
plus,
uh,
in Paris before a woman called John.
This sound funny me,

635
00:40:07.751 --> 00:40:11.770
the name,
it doesn't matter at all.
Uh,
was a,
a poor,

636
00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:17.470
poor,
noble.
Uh,
she'd claimed a cent from the royal family.
Uh,

637
00:40:17.471 --> 00:40:21.280
she had a pretty good education.
She had the important protectors,

638
00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:26.240
and so she marries an ops officer of rather dubious,
a noble title,
uh,

639
00:40:26.241 --> 00:40:30.820
who had called,
uh,
quite forgettable,
aided and Mackie did a Mutt.
Um,

640
00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:35.740
he met the 50 year old cardinal called Louis Daryl Hall,

641
00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:39.430
whose name I should have put on their R,
O,
h.
N,

642
00:40:39.431 --> 00:40:43.970
who was from a very famous old family called wrong suebies.

643
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:47.240
The National Archives used to be,
uh,
in other,

644
00:40:47.241 --> 00:40:50.110
adjacent to it and this fabulous old who,
God.

645
00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.980
Why don't they ever have things that work in here?
It's just unbelievable.
Anyway,

646
00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:58.960
I can't find the right with a family called the Ra.
Suebies.
Slu.

647
00:40:58.961 --> 00:41:03.670
B.
I.
S.
E.
There's this fitness.
Wonderful,
wonderful,
uh,
uh,
um,

648
00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:08.170
well palace,
really chateau in the,
my hae a w which is still there.

649
00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:12.910
And this cardinal,
um,
is,
is on the make a,
he's very wealthy.

650
00:41:12.911 --> 00:41:15.340
He's a cardinal.
That's why he's wealthy.
He's wealthy because he's,

651
00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:19.870
because he's a cardinal,
he's also,
um,
he thinks he snubbed the queen.

652
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:25.630
He wants to be,
uh,
one of the people who help make important decisions.

653
00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:29.470
Uh,
but,
um,
he thinks he's alienated the Queen,

654
00:41:29.471 --> 00:41:32.380
that this is standing between him and,
uh,

655
00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:35.910
and the power that he thinks he should have.
He writes,

656
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:41.360
he writes missives to the queen begging her to forgive him.

657
00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:45.710
Um,
and uh,
he's met this Guy Della Moat,

658
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:50.670
and they begin sending forged replies from the Queen that suggests that,
uh,

659
00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.360
uh,
you know,
the queen now is listening and maybe,
you know,

660
00:41:53.361 --> 00:41:57.140
all is forgiven is going to be okay.
Um,
so,
um,

661
00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:02.030
they have this idea.
Um,
they,
uh,

662
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:07.960
there's a famous jewel that had 647 flawless gems worth one and a half million

663
00:42:08.271 --> 00:42:13.220
pounds,
uh,
which is a whole lot of money,
uh,
in those days.
And still now,

664
00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:13.940
uh,

665
00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:18.940
Louis the 15th had commissioned it for one of his mistresses and then back down

666
00:42:19.311 --> 00:42:23.480
because it was too expensive.
Um,
in 1788,

667
00:42:23.481 --> 00:42:26.930
the necklace was offered to Louis the 16th for Marie Antoinette,

668
00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:32.050
but he turned it down saying the realm needs more ships than it does more

669
00:42:32.631 --> 00:42:36.920
jewels,
which was reasonably reasonable.
Uh,
enough.

670
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:40.070
Now they con this,
this,
uh,
uh,

671
00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:43.470
this old fairly horny cardinal to,
uh,

672
00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:46.310
in to think into showing up at dusk,
at,
at,

673
00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:51.140
at the poly Royale and introducing him to the queen herself,

674
00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:55.730
whom I guess he'd met once,
but it's dusk and his eyesight isn't that good.

675
00:42:56.030 --> 00:43:00.420
And so what they do is they find this prostitute of which there are about 25,000

676
00:43:00.421 --> 00:43:04.970
and in Paris at any one time,
uh,
who looks vaguely like Marie Antoinette.

677
00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:06.373
And so this,

678
00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:11.390
this cardinal do all sinks that his ship has come in,

679
00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:15.980
that everything is going to be,
um,
uh,
is going to be okay.

680
00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:20.660
And this purchase order has been forged,
supposedly signed by the Queen,

681
00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:24.590
and the real jewels are,
are delivered.
And then of course,

682
00:43:24.591 --> 00:43:29.070
it's broken up into pieces and sold on the street for,
you know,
for Zillions,
uh,

683
00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:33.080
uh,
uh,
frank sold on the black market in,
uh,
in London.

684
00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:35.090
And in Paris.

685
00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:38.180
But there's a problem here because the word gets out what has happened,

686
00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:42.080
and dual Raul who has really been made a fool,
there's this no doubt about it,

687
00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:47.440
but it's more serious than that because what he has done is he has taken a,

688
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:50.840
he could be accused of Lez mushy stay,

689
00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:53.540
which is just the ultimate kind of insult,

690
00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:57.650
a plotting against the queen by identifying her,

691
00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:02.690
a prostitute as the queen herself.
And so,

692
00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:06.660
uh,
the monarchy,
to make it very long story short,
the monarchy,
you know,

693
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:08.270
humiliated by all of this.

694
00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:12.330
The cardinal is saying mass in his fancy robes,
uh,

695
00:44:12.331 --> 00:44:15.650
in some cathedral probably signed you Stosh but I'm not sure.

696
00:44:15.651 --> 00:44:18.320
It might've been know to dom.
I don't know.
Uh,
what was tiny.

697
00:44:18.321 --> 00:44:22.760
Stacia isn't a cathedral.
But anyway,
he's in his,
his robes.
And so that they,

698
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:24.170
the police come in and they arrest him.

699
00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:29.990
And so what happens then is they put him on trial.
Uh,
and so,

700
00:44:29.991 --> 00:44:30.560
uh,

701
00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:35.430
now he not a terribly lovable guy or not,

702
00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:40.290
uh,
uh,
someone to be very much admired,
but by an incredible series of,

703
00:44:40.291 --> 00:44:42.510
of,
of not incredible.
Uh,
a serious,

704
00:44:42.511 --> 00:44:45.660
but by almost logical playing out of what I've been saying,

705
00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:51.530
he did lawyers who defend him and the crowds who salute him portray him as a

706
00:44:53.551 --> 00:44:58.551
victim of a regime that is crossing the line between absolutism despotism that

707
00:45:00.871 --> 00:45:04.980
he is a cardinal and he becomes the darling of the people.
And of course,

708
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:09.190
poor old Jong,
the,
you know,
the,
the,
uh,
this noble,
I mean,
they,

709
00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:12.840
she and her boyfriend get branded and their senators sent off to the galleries,

710
00:45:12.841 --> 00:45:17.520
et Cetera,
et cetera.
Uh,
uh,
predictably enough,
but,
uh,

711
00:45:17.521 --> 00:45:20.160
the part,
uh,
of Paris a quits,

712
00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:24.090
the good cardinal and he emerges from,
uh,

713
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:27.870
the Palace of justice or from the part of the mall still now on the,

714
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:31.380
that I the same,
the largest of the them three,

715
00:45:31.381 --> 00:45:36.381
but now two islands in the sin to a popular acclaim saying that he,

716
00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:37.531
that,

717
00:45:37.531 --> 00:45:42.531
that justice and the interests of the nation have been served by his acquittal.

718
00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:48.120
So what this sleazy,
uh,
incident does unsavory incident,
uh,

719
00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:51.960
does is it can,
it helps erode a,

720
00:45:51.961 --> 00:45:56.100
it helps continue the decentralization of the French monarchy.

721
00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:57.271
And again,

722
00:45:57.271 --> 00:46:02.100
lawyers and the people who see themselves as representing the interests of the

723
00:46:02.101 --> 00:46:06.590
French nation are in their own imaginary and,

724
00:46:06.591 --> 00:46:10.270
and their own mental construction.
And in,
uh,
in the eyes of,

725
00:46:10.271 --> 00:46:11.580
of people who follows these,

726
00:46:11.581 --> 00:46:15.600
these events in legal briefs and in newspapers,

727
00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:20.580
the guy he's acquitted,
he seen as,
as,
as somebody who,

728
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:20.970
uh,

729
00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:25.970
had been done wrong to buy a monarchy that has gone too far and that exactly,

730
00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:31.200
not much more than a year later is what it's going to play out in the French

731
00:46:31.201 --> 00:46:35.280
revolution itself.
So to conclude,

732
00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:38.250
Voltaire get Home Montesquieu who you've been reading,

733
00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:42.290
and these folks have big time impact on,

734
00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:45.150
on the way we look at the world around us.
Uh,

735
00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:49.220
and they had an impact on those people who would,
would,

736
00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:54.230
would become the organizers of the revolution and indeed are the leaders of

737
00:46:54.421 --> 00:46:59.310
France,
uh,
and their children,
their successors in the 19th century.

738
00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:04.620
But lawyers,
uh,
uh,
part of this sort of culture of,
of,
of,

739
00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:08.910
uh,
increased,
uh,
uh,
public sphere,
uh,

740
00:47:08.911 --> 00:47:10.740
that was western Europe in particular,

741
00:47:10.741 --> 00:47:15.210
but also parts of the rest of Europe too in the 18th century.
Uh,

742
00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:18.510
had a,
had a role in all of this,
uh,

743
00:47:18.511 --> 00:47:22.710
and that bias by 1789,
not in any kind of inevitable process.

744
00:47:22.711 --> 00:47:24.240
A revolution was not inevitable,

745
00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:28.980
but the sense that the monarchy had gone too far and that there was something,

746
00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:32.300
the nation out there,
ah Hah,
uh,

747
00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:35.480
was in the public sphere.
And the results of,

748
00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:40.240
of all this would be there to see in,
in 1789.

749
00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:44.290
Now I have a good weekend,
and on Monday,
uh,
you're going to hear it.

750
00:47:44.291 --> 00:47:49.090
The execution of the king,
the death of citizen Maha in his bathtub.

751
00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:53.260
And then I hope to make clear why some people supported the revolution and

752
00:47:53.261 --> 00:47:57.190
others didn't.
And what difference it all made.
So have a great weekend.
See you.
