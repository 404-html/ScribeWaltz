1
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.140
I'm going to talk about some of my favorite people today.

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:05.150
Uh,

3
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.560
over the weekend I was at a memorial service and,

4
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:07.940
uh,

5
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:08.660
uh,

6
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.850
a conference in honor of my late mentor,

7
00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:11.951
I,

8
00:00:11.951 --> 00:00:14.370
the great historian and sociologist Charles Tilly.

9
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.560
And when I first knew him,

10
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:18.270
which was a long time ago,

11
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.960
uh,

12
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.280
he was working on a,

13
00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:21.420
on collective violence.

14
00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:26.010
He's someone in his career who published literally 51 books over 600 articles,

15
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.690
but above all was a generous mentor to a whole bunch of people,

16
00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:32.610
including yours truly.

17
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.590
But he was working on collective violence.

18
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.160
And,

19
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.993
um,

20
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.560
he once told me,

21
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.371
in fact,

22
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.910
I couldn't find exactly where he wrote this if he did.

23
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.253
Um,

24
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.580
he once told me,

25
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:45.720
and I mentioned this the first day,

26
00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:50.721
but that it's bitter hard to write the history of remainders.

27
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.490
And so some of the people that I'm going to talk about today didn't see

28
00:00:56.491 --> 00:00:58.290
themselves as remainders in history,

29
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.790
but there are people who didn't quite fit in and,

30
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:03.121
and,

31
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:03.690
and,

32
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.290
um,

33
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.290
we're really overwhelmed and ultimately defeated by the economic and social and

34
00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:12.390
political processes.

35
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.520
And if one of the themes of this course,

36
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.990
and if any course really,

37
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:18.440
I suppose in the deals with the modern,

38
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.270
uh,

39
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.670
a world experience,

40
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.911
uh,

41
00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:22.050
even in,

42
00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:24.090
especially in this day as of globalization,

43
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.721
Oh,

44
00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:25.351
is that,

45
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:30.060
that dynamic dual of a capitalism or large scale economic change,

46
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.510
uh,

47
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.470
and the state,

48
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.951
uh,

49
00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:34.050
you're going to see that today in,

50
00:01:34.051 --> 00:01:35.520
in some of the folks that I'm,

51
00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:36.180
uh,

52
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.380
I'm talking about.

53
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.890
And I once used the example of trying to get you to imagine,

54
00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:43.261
you know,

55
00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:48.261
parachuting over the European continent over very slow descent and the,

56
00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:51.900
let's say now from maybe Oh,

57
00:01:51.901 --> 00:01:53.670
mid 16th century,

58
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.580
until mid 19th century.

59
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.960
And if,

60
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.650
um,

61
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.650
you could see every incident of collective violence,

62
00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:06.120
of political protest,

63
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.150
popular protest that occurred,

64
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.171
uh,

65
00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:10.900
and,

66
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.860
and all protest is ultimately a political,

67
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.790
uh,

68
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.720
by far the most prevalent would have been the grain riot.

69
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.990
And this itself is terribly significant.

70
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.240
And so as his disappearance,

71
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.910
given what I've just said about,

72
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.470
about the state and large scale economic change,

73
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.290
another way to imagine this is if you had,

74
00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:34.860
um,

75
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.390
a Richter scale,

76
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.380
uh,

77
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.130
that,

78
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.311
you know,

79
00:02:38.311 --> 00:02:43.311
that move or that registered every incident of collective violence until he and

80
00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:45.330
his whole team,

81
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.021
uh,

82
00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:49.860
we're counting up every single incident of collective violence that they could

83
00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:51.930
find in Europe between,

84
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.930
uh,

85
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:53.340
uh,

86
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.860
really mid 18th century.

87
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:59.710
And in terms of his study or even earlier than that in 1936 and would come to

88
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:03.100
the same conclusion that you would wear you floating over,

89
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.760
uh,

90
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.100
this great continent for that period of time.

91
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.090
And so what I'm going to do today is it sort of a trilogy talk about,

92
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.990
um,

93
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.051
uh,

94
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:12.040
three things,

95
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.730
uh,

96
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.040
first grain riots and they're all related.

97
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.713
Second,

98
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.580
the swing movement,

99
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.460
Captain Swing drawing on the book,

100
00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:23.080
a classic book a long time ago of,

101
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:27.100
of Eric Cobb's bomb and George were day to truly great historians along with

102
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:28.570
Tilly and third,

103
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:29.800
talk about something that I did.

104
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:30.420
Uh,

105
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.253
uh,

106
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.650
uh,

107
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.600
talk about the demos l of the Ahi Edge.

108
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.940
And I'll make that clear in a while.

109
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.400
But all three fit together,

110
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.650
I think very nicely.

111
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:42.520
And,

112
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.641
uh,

113
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:47.230
one of the underlying themes which you'll see is that that popular protest and

114
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.710
collective violence attached to popular protest,

115
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.300
uh,

116
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.540
is not random,

117
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:53.111
uh,

118
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:53.944
or,

119
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.873
uh,

120
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.420
well,

121
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.230
it's spontaneous,

122
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.340
can be spontaneous,

123
00:03:57.341 --> 00:04:01.750
but it's not illogical that there's a logic to popular protest,

124
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.351
uh,

125
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:03.580
right through the ages,

126
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.690
uh,

127
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.180
in the early modern period as well as in the 19th century.

128
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:07.990
And that,

129
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.470
uh,

130
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.040
that ordinary people put forth their demands,

131
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.910
uh,

132
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.640
by protesting and in doing so hope to,

133
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:16.560
to,

134
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.050
uh,

135
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.130
to affect change,

136
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:18.311
to,

137
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:23.311
to appeal to authorities who hopefully will do the right thing and often imagine

138
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.770
a world in the past where,

139
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.993
um,

140
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.870
where we're a sense of justice prevailed.

141
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.151
And in terms of,

142
00:04:33.151 --> 00:04:33.941
of grain riots,

143
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:37.570
I'll talk about the just price because they talked about it.

144
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.711
Um,

145
00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:40.060
so having said that,

146
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.250
let me enter the world of,

147
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.180
of,

148
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.350
of grain riots.

149
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.083
Um,

150
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.890
give you some examples.

151
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.930
This is from Spain,

152
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.730
1856 with the pretext of the high price of bread and for lack of work,

153
00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.540
uh,

154
00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.051
the workers.

155
00:04:58.051 --> 00:04:59.560
I've followed the lead and uh,

156
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.190
and Burgos rose and burn flower stores,

157
00:05:02.191 --> 00:05:04.140
mills in inspection offices,

158
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.950
the civil,

159
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.500
the civil governor intervene to put down the rising,

160
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.130
but the rebels overwhelmed him and attack the chiefs of his forces.

161
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.600
The sacking and burning continued most likely as a consequence of the spreading

162
00:05:15.601 --> 00:05:19.380
of news of the incident disturbance is also spread to the countryside and to

163
00:05:19.381 --> 00:05:20.310
other cities.

164
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.030
The governor of Palencia tried to hold back the uprising and his city,

165
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.380
but he had to retreat before a hissing crowd and Ben Avant Day,

166
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.750
uh,

167
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.510
Rio Seco and along the Casti,

168
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.160
um,

169
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.993
a canal.

170
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.020
The disorders reoccurred.

171
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.360
Yeah,

172
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.620
the characteristics of the old type of rebellion aimed at spectators and

173
00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:40.290
hoarders among whom the Ma,

174
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.510
the masters of workshops were counted in their hatred.

175
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.460
The insurgents set fire to shops and store houses with the cry of chief Brett

176
00:05:48.461 --> 00:05:49.330
cheap bread,

177
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.260
cheap bread,

178
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.820
and attack the boats that serve for the transport of grain as well as putting

179
00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:55.870
the torch to grain.

180
00:05:55.871 --> 00:05:58.460
Not yet harvested in the fields.

181
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.940
If you back up almost a century ago in France,

182
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:02.840
if you look at the memo,

183
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.100
the memoirs of,

184
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:04.934
of uh,

185
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:05.411
of a,

186
00:06:05.411 --> 00:06:06.560
a royal official,

187
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.520
um,

188
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.940
if,

189
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.540
if for May 3rd eye in the seven in 1775,

190
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.040
the musketeers who had been worn the day before,

191
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.320
hurry to the markets,

192
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.220
the fleeing rioters overturned baskets full of bread and block the way to the

193
00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:20.054
horses.

194
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.470
It was 9:00 AM the watch was supposed to be getting its orders at that hour.

195
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.490
And the people that are already gone to the bakers and sees the bread they found

196
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:29.450
in the shops,

197
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.330
the pit that pillage had a special character.

198
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.450
People did it without violence.

199
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.070
The shops of the bakers were emptied and those of the pastry makers and the

200
00:06:40.071 --> 00:06:43.340
dealers and other foods which were equally exposed,

201
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.560
we're left untouched.

202
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.000
Um,

203
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.430
or 1816 in England,

204
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:50.570
east Anglia,

205
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.470
um,

206
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.460
in early summer,

207
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.533
uh,

208
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.830
surprise came that the agricultural laborers who will come back to hear about in

209
00:06:57.831 --> 00:07:01.850
a little while of east Anglia had come out and revolt conditions had worsened

210
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:06.410
since the end of the Napoleonic war and riots and disturbances were everywhere,

211
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.861
uh,

212
00:07:06.861 --> 00:07:08.000
in the towns,

213
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.433
um,

214
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:10.431
well,

215
00:07:10.431 --> 00:07:10.731
et Cetera,

216
00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:11.540
et cetera.

217
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.570
The point is that I,

218
00:07:12.571 --> 00:07:13.610
I could give you,

219
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:14.100
uh,

220
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:19.100
examples from virtually every country over a very long period of time.

221
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.010
And the grain riot would,

222
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:22.550
um,

223
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:23.383
would dominate.

224
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.400
Now if you took just,

225
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:25.671
well,

226
00:07:25.671 --> 00:07:26.001
if you take,

227
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:28.040
if you take this is France based,

228
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:29.510
but it's true of almost everywhere.

229
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.260
Uh,

230
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:30.621
and again,

231
00:07:30.621 --> 00:07:31.760
do not write this down.

232
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.010
Men Fight for food in the following years,

233
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:34.844
particularly,

234
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:35.830
they come in waves.

235
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:36.770
1693,

236
00:07:36.771 --> 00:07:37.341
94,

237
00:07:37.341 --> 00:07:37.941
98,

238
00:07:37.941 --> 00:07:38.740
seven,

239
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:39.471
10 oh nine,

240
00:07:39.471 --> 00:07:40.221
10 17,

241
00:07:40.221 --> 00:07:40.701
28,

242
00:07:40.701 --> 00:07:41.511
1739,

243
00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:42.410
40 49,

244
00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:43.430
50 to 68,

245
00:07:43.431 --> 00:07:45.350
70 1775,

246
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:45.980
big one.

247
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:50.980
1785 1788 899399181118 21816181718 291830183940 84647185354 and then never

248
00:08:00.351 --> 00:08:01.184
again.

249
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.560
I never again,

250
00:08:03.561 --> 00:08:05.000
I mean in France,

251
00:08:05.001 --> 00:08:05.834
never again.

252
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:11.230
And slowly the grain riot disappears as a form of political protest of

253
00:08:14.421 --> 00:08:19.421
collective violence or collective nonviolence depending on the case.

254
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:20.713
And so that's,

255
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.500
that's the big question is you know what,

256
00:08:23.501 --> 00:08:24.890
what's going on here.

257
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:25.131
You know,

258
00:08:25.131 --> 00:08:28.870
popular protest is a way of finding out what's going on when you look at all

259
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:29.723
this stuff.

260
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.610
And why do the grain riots disappear as a form of collective violence?

261
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.833
Why?

262
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.820
Here's a placard that is a,

263
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:38.031
you know,

264
00:08:38.031 --> 00:08:43.031
a poster scrawled in the town of [inaudible] in the west of France in 1709,

265
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:44.930
uh,

266
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.220
we are dying of hunger.

267
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:51.280
We must absolutely order you to set prices on bread and grain or else we will

268
00:08:51.291 --> 00:08:54.170
break from our homes like enraged lions,

269
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:55.920
weapons in one hand,

270
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.510
fire in the other.

271
00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.130
Arson fire,

272
00:08:59.131 --> 00:08:59.621
by the way,

273
00:08:59.621 --> 00:08:59.891
is,

274
00:08:59.891 --> 00:09:00.011
is,

275
00:09:00.011 --> 00:09:02.400
is one of those with my friend Jim Scott at Yale,

276
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.030
uh,

277
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.500
calls weapons of the weak,

278
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:05.520
uh,

279
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:05.701
uh,

280
00:09:05.701 --> 00:09:05.941
you know,

281
00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:08.880
just a match to a harvest or to a roof.

282
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:09.511
A show me,

283
00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:09.810
yeah.

284
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:10.560
Uh,

285
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:10.801
you know,

286
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:10.921
of,

287
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:11.221
of a,

288
00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:12.750
of a thatched cottage,

289
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.500
uh,

290
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:13.951
can,

291
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:14.370
uh,

292
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.860
can do some serious mischief,

293
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:18.900
but what they want to do,

294
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.340
these grain rioters,

295
00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.870
very ordinary people,

296
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.150
men and particularly women.

297
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:24.721
Remember,

298
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:28.620
women are responsible for the household economy and also young people.

299
00:09:28.621 --> 00:09:29.580
And also children.

300
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.690
What they want to do is they're putting forth claims.

301
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.880
They want the government,

302
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.261
the monarchies,

303
00:09:37.261 --> 00:09:38.011
the administrators,

304
00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:38.844
the officials,

305
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:40.343
the aunt on dawn,

306
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.183
the governors,

307
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:42.391
the rural,

308
00:09:42.391 --> 00:09:47.391
the sheriffs in England to set the price of bread as Maximillian of hope was

309
00:09:49.171 --> 00:09:49.800
piano.

310
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.420
And there's Jacobi.

311
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:51.420
I had wanted them to,

312
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:52.943
why?

313
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:58.070
To set the price of bread to keep the price of bread low so that everybody would

314
00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:01.020
have access to,

315
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:01.850
uh,

316
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:02.041
uh,

317
00:10:02.041 --> 00:10:03.030
to buying bread.

318
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:03.541
Now,

319
00:10:03.541 --> 00:10:04.980
bread represent bread.

320
00:10:04.981 --> 00:10:06.330
Literally that commodity,

321
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.010
whether dark bread in the,

322
00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:08.230
in,

323
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.230
in the poor regions of central Europe,

324
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:10.800
uh,

325
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.390
or in the south of France or in parts of Spain and southern Italy or white

326
00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:15.751
bread,

327
00:10:15.751 --> 00:10:18.270
which is more associated with more prosperous peasants,

328
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.600
represented more than half of,

329
00:10:22.601 --> 00:10:24.450
of the expenses of ordinary people,

330
00:10:24.451 --> 00:10:26.010
not just food but bread.

331
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.200
So bread is what people,

332
00:10:28.201 --> 00:10:30.480
a black bread where the poorer areas,

333
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.433
white bread,

334
00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:32.250
uh,

335
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.350
the wealthier areas to make a generalization,

336
00:10:34.351 --> 00:10:35.670
there are all different kinds of bread.

337
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.110
Um,

338
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.090
and so well,

339
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.490
here's how I can approach this in the town of on the edge,

340
00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:41.970
uh,

341
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:42.810
which is in,

342
00:10:42.811 --> 00:10:45.660
in well Onia that is in that what's now eastern Belgium,

343
00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:46.330
uh,

344
00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:47.300
Les [inaudible],

345
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.770
a famous words cork like other things.

346
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:50.783
Um,

347
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.120
and now part of the rust belt of,

348
00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.330
of eastern Belgium,

349
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:58.080
they had a municipal statute that is a municipal regulation,

350
00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:58.651
uh,

351
00:10:58.651 --> 00:11:00.420
from about the 14th century.

352
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:03.240
The date 1317 sticks in my mind somewhere.

353
00:11:03.241 --> 00:11:04.560
I must've read that decades ago.

354
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:10.100
And it said that on market day that merchants would not be allowed from other

355
00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:11.941
places,

356
00:11:11.941 --> 00:11:16.710
would not be allowed in to buy grain until the third day of the market.

357
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:18.061
And by the way,

358
00:11:18.061 --> 00:11:19.140
the term for merchants,

359
00:11:19.141 --> 00:11:21.290
they use where own grocer,

360
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.820
which has a sense in French of people who would make themselves fat on closer,

361
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:28.230
um,

362
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.681
why?

363
00:11:28.681 --> 00:11:32.250
Because they could afford to buy bread at the price that nobody else could

364
00:11:32.251 --> 00:11:36.360
afford and they wouldn't be allowed until the third day of the market.

365
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:37.860
But of course,

366
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:38.730
uh,

367
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.940
that's not what happens through most of European history.

368
00:11:41.941 --> 00:11:44.100
And so the pressure from these crowds,

369
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:49.250
the logic of these crowds is too forced municipal authorities in the name of

370
00:11:49.921 --> 00:11:50.360
order,

371
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.750
but perhaps who knows,

372
00:11:51.751 --> 00:11:56.740
and the name of justice to set a price of bread so that everybody could have a

373
00:11:56.741 --> 00:11:57.574
shot at it.

374
00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:58.451
Now,

375
00:11:58.451 --> 00:11:59.740
with some wag ones put,

376
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:00.311
you know,

377
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:02.230
criticizing this kind of social history.

378
00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:02.441
Well,

379
00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:06.760
it's pretty obvious that grain riots occur on market days,

380
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:07.661
uh,

381
00:12:07.661 --> 00:12:12.661
in areas in which there is grain being exported out of a region.

382
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.260
But that is precisely the point.

383
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:16.610
And so the,

384
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.970
the peasants don't,

385
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:20.000
and or towns,

386
00:12:20.001 --> 00:12:21.700
people don't riot.

387
00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:23.200
Ordinary people don't riot,

388
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:23.980
uh,

389
00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:25.010
necessarily when,

390
00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:25.180
you know,

391
00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.790
the price of grain reaches its absolute maximum.

392
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:28.541
But when they,

393
00:12:28.541 --> 00:12:30.520
when they riot is they,

394
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.460
they riot the seas grain,

395
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.840
uh,

396
00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:39.730
or they pillage shops at the moment when particularly when they see grain being

397
00:12:39.731 --> 00:12:42.280
taken out of the community,

398
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.700
removed from their sense of moral authority over something upon which they

399
00:12:50.531 --> 00:12:51.364
depend,

400
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.820
uh,

401
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:52.653
to live.

402
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.130
And so,

403
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:54.880
uh,

404
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.140
women as I said before,

405
00:12:56.141 --> 00:12:57.190
played a major part,

406
00:12:57.191 --> 00:12:58.660
the major role in grain rights.

407
00:12:58.661 --> 00:12:58.871
Why?

408
00:12:58.871 --> 00:13:00.850
Because they're responsible for the household economy.

409
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.330
And so right through this whole period,

410
00:13:04.331 --> 00:13:05.560
there's a familiar scenario.

411
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:07.893
People,

412
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.540
uh,

413
00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:11.020
poor into town for market day,

414
00:13:11.021 --> 00:13:13.920
they see the stage coaches to did the Jones,

415
00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:18.400
the wagons carding the gray in a way and they stop,

416
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.200
they stop.

417
00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:25.480
And it's the same format everywhere is if you had some sort of internet or CNN

418
00:13:25.481 --> 00:13:28.480
or some thing like that telling people here's how you grain riot.

419
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:33.720
But they don't rip off the grain and they don't rip off is the one example that

420
00:13:33.721 --> 00:13:34.390
I gave you.

421
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:36.520
Fancy pastries and stuff like that.

422
00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:42.420
They take the grain often to a communal piece of property such as the Commons or

423
00:13:44.981 --> 00:13:45.814
a municipal,

424
00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:46.820
the well or,

425
00:13:46.821 --> 00:13:47.000
or,

426
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:47.833
or the,

427
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:48.641
the shed.

428
00:13:48.641 --> 00:13:48.821
The,

429
00:13:48.821 --> 00:13:49.300
the,

430
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:49.601
uh,

431
00:13:49.601 --> 00:13:50.051
I mean the,

432
00:13:50.051 --> 00:13:51.040
the covered market.

433
00:13:51.041 --> 00:13:51.200
I mean,

434
00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.690
somebody was fantastic examples,

435
00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:53.271
you know,

436
00:13:53.271 --> 00:13:53.440
uh,

437
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:53.630
are,

438
00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:54.580
are in the south of France,

439
00:13:54.581 --> 00:13:55.750
but all sorts of places too.

440
00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:01.080
And they sell the grain to ordinary people at what they consider to be the just

441
00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:04.893
price.

442
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.400
And they use that expression to just price.

443
00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:14.850
And there's a sense of moral outrage that some forces they can't control are

444
00:14:17.261 --> 00:14:21.340
taking away what they need to survive.

445
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:24.940
1789 a year.

446
00:14:24.941 --> 00:14:25.774
You know,

447
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.891
what's the,

448
00:14:26.891 --> 00:14:28.990
what's the big collective action in Paris?

449
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.120
It's the seizing of the busty of course.

450
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:36.580
But above all is the attack on the customs barriers.

451
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:40.780
The tax offices that ring Paris,

452
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.240
which forced the price of food,

453
00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:44.890
grain bread,

454
00:14:44.891 --> 00:14:45.880
everything up higher.

455
00:14:45.881 --> 00:14:50.881
They attack them as a symbol of what they consider to be an unfair economy

456
00:14:52.161 --> 00:14:56.600
that's depriving them of the right to have enough to eat.

457
00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.753
Now,

458
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:00.890
so these,

459
00:15:00.891 --> 00:15:02.030
but these wagons,

460
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:02.391
you know,

461
00:15:02.391 --> 00:15:04.220
that are carrying grain away.

462
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.470
Who's in these wagons?

463
00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.540
Who are these folks and where are they doing?

464
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.501
Well,

465
00:15:09.501 --> 00:15:10.550
their merchants.

466
00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.750
And they know that if they can take them and they're buying up grain,

467
00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.100
where are they taking the grain?

468
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.570
They're taking it to Berlin or they're taking it to Stuttgart where they're

469
00:15:20.571 --> 00:15:25.400
taking it to Munich or to Milan or to Paris or Lee.

470
00:15:25.401 --> 00:15:26.120
Y'All.

471
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:26.953
Why?

472
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:31.940
Because that grain will command even a higher price there when you've got all

473
00:15:31.941 --> 00:15:32.774
these people.

474
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:37.520
And what is the interest of monarchies and other forms of,

475
00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:38.060
of,

476
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:38.930
of tyranny,

477
00:15:38.931 --> 00:15:39.764
if you will.

478
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.680
It's the ancestors to feed the city's first.

479
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.440
And so the growth of cities,

480
00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.110
the growth of bureaucracies of the state,

481
00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.000
the growth of garrisons,

482
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:51.440
we have to be fed,

483
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.990
increases the pressure on,

484
00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.093
uh,

485
00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:55.790
on,

486
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:56.211
uh,

487
00:15:56.211 --> 00:15:58.880
on grain in times of,

488
00:15:59.050 --> 00:15:59.260
of,

489
00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:03.110
of harvest failure and grain riots.

490
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:03.501
You know,

491
00:16:03.501 --> 00:16:04.790
not only are the timing is,

492
00:16:04.791 --> 00:16:05.031
you know,

493
00:16:05.031 --> 00:16:06.680
market's wood grain is leaving the town,

494
00:16:06.681 --> 00:16:07.161
but of course,

495
00:16:07.161 --> 00:16:12.161
obviously the subtext is that at times of these cyclical harvest failures,

496
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:14.690
the harvest fails.

497
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.250
Credit is withdrawn.

498
00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.180
Uh,

499
00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:20.330
the price of bread goes up and the riots start.

500
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:21.920
And if you look at where the riots started,

501
00:16:21.921 --> 00:16:23.480
any of these countries that I've talked about,

502
00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.050
uh,

503
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:24.800
they are,

504
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.800
it's in response to these two grain being taken out of rural regions and being

505
00:16:31.071 --> 00:16:33.500
taken to cities to get higher prices.

506
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:35.390
So you've got the merchant on the wagon to,

507
00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:36.860
and you probably got his driver,

508
00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.150
but who else do you have?

509
00:16:38.151 --> 00:16:39.020
They're increasingly,

510
00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:40.161
well,

511
00:16:40.161 --> 00:16:40.970
you've got,

512
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:42.990
you've got the Gardasil Vila in,

513
00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:44.810
in Spain are,

514
00:16:44.811 --> 00:16:45.410
you've got to,

515
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:46.070
you've got the,

516
00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:46.480
uh,

517
00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:46.610
you know,

518
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:48.260
various police in the Italian,

519
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:49.160
uh,

520
00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:49.920
states are,

521
00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:50.710
you've got the,

522
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:51.080
uh,

523
00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.450
tough hardened a Berlin police or the,

524
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:54.260
uh,

525
00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:54.891
uh,

526
00:16:54.891 --> 00:16:55.131
you know,

527
00:16:55.131 --> 00:16:58.850
the Prussian army or you've got the gendarme or the mile she'll say is they

528
00:16:58.851 --> 00:16:59.250
called them.

529
00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:00.280
I show mommy show,

530
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:01.820
say as they called them in the 18th century.

531
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.950
Or there's gendarme in the 19th century.

532
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.001
So here again,

533
00:17:05.001 --> 00:17:10.001
here's a way of looking at this theme of the state and capitalism or on the

534
00:17:10.971 --> 00:17:15.971
wagon here you've got the merchant and you've got the police guarding him.

535
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:20.810
That's the dynamic dual of change over the long run.

536
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:24.710
So you know,

537
00:17:24.711 --> 00:17:24.801
the,

538
00:17:24.801 --> 00:17:25.790
to be sure people who per,

539
00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.800
who have big plots of land,

540
00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:28.550
uh,

541
00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:31.910
in Pomerania a or in northern Italy,

542
00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:32.400
uh,

543
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.350
or in the bullets,

544
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:34.040
uh,

545
00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:34.351
you know,

546
00:17:34.351 --> 00:17:34.491
uh,

547
00:17:34.491 --> 00:17:37.370
the south of Paris or on shots or someplace like that.

548
00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.060
Uh,

549
00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:38.241
you know,

550
00:17:38.241 --> 00:17:39.170
these are big,

551
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:40.140
you know,

552
00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:40.591
these people are,

553
00:17:40.591 --> 00:17:41.820
I'm not out grain rioting.

554
00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:42.680
What,

555
00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.400
what are they doing?

556
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.233
They're hoarding.

557
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.120
They're waiting till the price of grain even goes higher.

558
00:17:47.121 --> 00:17:52.121
And that's why form of popular of collective action in all throughout this whole

559
00:17:52.501 --> 00:17:53.250
period,

560
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:54.480
our tax on hoarders,

561
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:55.980
you know,

562
00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:56.940
1789,

563
00:17:56.941 --> 00:17:57.990
you read about it in the book,

564
00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.310
the famine plot,

565
00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.440
the idea that somehow,

566
00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:01.700
you know,

567
00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.770
that wealthy aristocrats or trying to starve out the poor to get their way,

568
00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:09.960
and then a hoarder's have a huge just sacks of grain,

569
00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:15.050
which they often did in their chateaus and that they're calling it from the

570
00:18:15.601 --> 00:18:16.434
market.

571
00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:17.850
And Laissez Faire says,

572
00:18:17.851 --> 00:18:19.470
let the market decide the price will,

573
00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:19.711
okay,

574
00:18:19.711 --> 00:18:20.970
let's keep that stuff back.

575
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.490
People go hungry too damn bad for them.

576
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:24.630
They should have more money

577
00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:28.500
over and over and over again.

578
00:18:28.501 --> 00:18:29.940
In all of these places.

579
00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.920
The grain riot is,

580
00:18:31.921 --> 00:18:34.340
that is the most important form of,

581
00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.150
of collective violence,

582
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:38.550
of popular protest.

583
00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:42.510
And then it just disappears.

584
00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:43.681
Again.

585
00:18:43.681 --> 00:18:44.820
France is the most studied,

586
00:18:44.821 --> 00:18:47.010
but it disappears earlier in Britain.

587
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:47.880
You'll,

588
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:48.900
you'll know why already,

589
00:18:48.901 --> 00:18:49.734
you already know.

590
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.210
I'll tell you again in a minute.

591
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:53.130
Ain't no peasants left in Britain.

592
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.870
<v 1>Okay.</v>

593
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:56.461
<v 0>When France,</v>

594
00:18:56.461 --> 00:18:58.530
the last wave is 1855.

595
00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:02.100
Now there are protests at the end of the 19th century against the high cost of

596
00:19:02.101 --> 00:19:02.934
food.

597
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:03.880
Uh,

598
00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.230
the,

599
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.441
the,

600
00:19:04.441 --> 00:19:05.041
these are,

601
00:19:05.041 --> 00:19:05.690
you know,

602
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:06.980
one shouldn't imagine when people,

603
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:07.260
I don't know,

604
00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.560
surrounding the stop and shop with a blocking it with,

605
00:19:10.561 --> 00:19:10.861
with,

606
00:19:10.861 --> 00:19:11.400
uh,

607
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:11.970
uh,

608
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:12.150
you know,

609
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:12.411
with,

610
00:19:12.411 --> 00:19:14.410
with their little pushcarts that they're,

611
00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:14.600
they're,

612
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.200
they're putting their frozen food into.

613
00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:16.740
Uh,

614
00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.150
but there are the equivalent of a,

615
00:19:18.151 --> 00:19:18.751
of that.

616
00:19:18.751 --> 00:19:18.931
I mean,

617
00:19:18.931 --> 00:19:21.510
there are protests against the high cost of food and food still.

618
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:22.200
Uh,

619
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.880
W is an important dynamic in,

620
00:19:23.881 --> 00:19:24.021
in,

621
00:19:24.021 --> 00:19:24.811
in protest.

622
00:19:24.811 --> 00:19:25.471
And we'll work to,

623
00:19:25.471 --> 00:19:26.131
for example,

624
00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:26.341
you know,

625
00:19:26.341 --> 00:19:27.210
irritation about,

626
00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:28.010
about,

627
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.400
uh,

628
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:28.560
the,

629
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.940
the rich doing even better than,

630
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:30.480
than,

631
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.210
than ever.

632
00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:32.430
And in rationing,

633
00:19:32.431 --> 00:19:34.050
rationing cards and all that business,

634
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.030
but the food,

635
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:36.541
but the grain,

636
00:19:36.541 --> 00:19:41.541
right simply disappears as a form of popular protest in Europe period.

637
00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:45.360
It doesn't mean that bread wouldn't be terribly important.

638
00:19:45.361 --> 00:19:47.640
And in the Russian revolution it does.

639
00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:48.661
And there are,

640
00:19:48.661 --> 00:19:48.901
you know,

641
00:19:48.901 --> 00:19:50.280
there are riots in,

642
00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.600
in Russia,

643
00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:52.200
uh,

644
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:52.340
uh,

645
00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:52.531
you know,

646
00:19:52.531 --> 00:19:53.191
against the height,

647
00:19:53.191 --> 00:19:54.024
high price of,

648
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:54.451
of,

649
00:19:54.451 --> 00:19:54.870
uh,

650
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:55.351
of bread.

651
00:19:55.351 --> 00:19:57.750
But the classic from Western Europe,

652
00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.000
beginning of Western Europe and moving east,

653
00:20:00.001 --> 00:20:00.900
the classic,

654
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:06.800
just the quintessentially popular domain of protest,

655
00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.380
expression of popular protest just disappears.

656
00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:11.410
Period.

657
00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:12.243
Plot,

658
00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:16.170
why the battle's been won,

659
00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.173
the merchants,

660
00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:21.323
the police,

661
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:22.380
the gendarme,

662
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.513
the troops,

663
00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:24.900
they've already there.

664
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:25.901
And,

665
00:20:25.901 --> 00:20:26.011
and,

666
00:20:26.011 --> 00:20:26.311
and,

667
00:20:26.311 --> 00:20:27.360
and beginning again,

668
00:20:27.361 --> 00:20:28.560
West Eastern Europe,

669
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.110
you've got the d population of,

670
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.230
of marginal rural property,

671
00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:34.980
uh,

672
00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:36.600
marginal rural lands,

673
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:37.350
uh,

674
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:38.970
people can't make it any more,

675
00:20:38.971 --> 00:20:41.220
producing little bits of this and that.

676
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.450
And they,

677
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:42.600
uh,

678
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.480
pledge themselves in to the new urban,

679
00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:46.373
emerging new,

680
00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:47.110
or not new,

681
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:49.840
but a ever increasing urban world.

682
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:50.201
Uh,

683
00:20:50.201 --> 00:20:52.750
in order to find a find work.

684
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.720
And so if you look at what people protest over,

685
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.651
we can see that,

686
00:20:56.651 --> 00:20:56.980
you know,

687
00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.960
you can see this big economic change.

688
00:20:58.961 --> 00:20:59.141
I mean,

689
00:20:59.141 --> 00:21:02.830
the 19th century just transforms the way people live this of sure as the 19th

690
00:21:02.831 --> 00:21:03.081
century.

691
00:21:03.081 --> 00:21:04.840
It didn't invent consumer culture.

692
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.950
We already know Yonda reasons just published within the last month or two or

693
00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.281
just to,

694
00:21:09.281 --> 00:21:09.491
you know,

695
00:21:09.491 --> 00:21:10.390
a brilliant book about,

696
00:21:10.391 --> 00:21:13.060
about showing that that ordinary families,

697
00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:13.560
uh,

698
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:13.960
uh,

699
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.170
made all sorts of sacrifices to try to improve their lives beginning in the

700
00:21:17.171 --> 00:21:17.860
middle of the,

701
00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.240
of the 17th century,

702
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.880
participating in this consumer culture,

703
00:21:21.881 --> 00:21:22.571
buying soap,

704
00:21:22.571 --> 00:21:23.420
buying forks and,

705
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:24.400
and that kind of thing.

706
00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:24.910
Uh,

707
00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:25.780
but these big,

708
00:21:25.781 --> 00:21:27.490
big time economic changes,

709
00:21:27.491 --> 00:21:28.780
the 19th century is really,

710
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:29.620
uh,

711
00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:29.831
uh,

712
00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:30.081
is,

713
00:21:30.081 --> 00:21:31.600
is the crucial period in the whole thing.

714
00:21:31.601 --> 00:21:34.420
And the disappearance of the grain riot as a form of,

715
00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.230
uh,

716
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.570
popular protest is just,

717
00:21:37.571 --> 00:21:37.751
you know,

718
00:21:37.751 --> 00:21:38.680
a fantastic,

719
00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:39.670
uh,

720
00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:43.030
a demonstration of that fact.

721
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:43.451
You know,

722
00:21:43.451 --> 00:21:45.170
you don't want to complicate the thing or,

723
00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:45.580
or,

724
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.520
or really undermine the validity of what I was said by imagining.

725
00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:48.881
Say,

726
00:21:48.881 --> 00:21:49.181
well,

727
00:21:49.181 --> 00:21:50.140
that's all pre modern.

728
00:21:50.141 --> 00:21:50.291
You know,

729
00:21:50.291 --> 00:21:53.560
this kind of protest and we've got our modern protests and you know,

730
00:21:53.561 --> 00:21:55.210
it's an more strikes and all that.

731
00:21:55.211 --> 00:21:57.120
It's true that they're more strikes and strikes become,

732
00:21:57.121 --> 00:21:57.420
uh,

733
00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:57.580
you know,

734
00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.100
another sort of classic form of political protest.

735
00:22:00.101 --> 00:22:00.580
But,

736
00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:01.030
uh,

737
00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:04.080
but the world of the 19th century was changing and,

738
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:04.690
uh,

739
00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:05.441
uh,

740
00:22:05.441 --> 00:22:05.651
you know,

741
00:22:05.651 --> 00:22:07.300
the big losers in all of this of course,

742
00:22:07.301 --> 00:22:09.190
are a rural people,

743
00:22:09.191 --> 00:22:10.060
rural labors,

744
00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:10.690
uh,

745
00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:12.400
peasants who simply couldn't make a go,

746
00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:12.941
uh,

747
00:22:12.941 --> 00:22:13.920
and uh,

748
00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:14.700
and,

749
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:14.860
uh,

750
00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.090
their world is transformed.

751
00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.510
That's the part one of this trilogy.

752
00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:21.813
Secondly,

753
00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:22.391
and I'll,

754
00:22:22.391 --> 00:22:24.820
let's look at the swing movement.

755
00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:27.190
These next two things I'm going to talk about.

756
00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:28.210
Um,

757
00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:28.630
yeah,

758
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.841
yeah,

759
00:22:28.841 --> 00:22:28.991
yeah,

760
00:22:28.991 --> 00:22:29.500
yeah.

761
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:29.980
Our,

762
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:30.370
uh,

763
00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:31.990
take place really at the same time.

764
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.540
And that's not a coincidence.

765
00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.250
It's not a coincidence at all.

766
00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:38.920
The first story is that of captain swing.

767
00:22:38.921 --> 00:22:41.730
I alluded to this the very first day if those who were here,

768
00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:42.953
um,

769
00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.050
was,

770
00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:44.441
uh,

771
00:22:44.441 --> 00:22:44.771
18,

772
00:22:44.771 --> 00:22:45.431
29,

773
00:22:45.431 --> 00:22:47.020
really 1830,

774
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.870
uh,

775
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:49.330
those are the big years.

776
00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:51.460
And then the demo is out of the Ahi Edge,

777
00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:52.780
um,

778
00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.190
comes to just the same time.

779
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.050
There are similar,

780
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:56.711
fascinating.

781
00:22:56.711 --> 00:22:57.700
I think they're fascinating.

782
00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:58.600
I hope you will too.

783
00:22:58.960 --> 00:22:59.321
Uh,

784
00:22:59.321 --> 00:23:02.830
and they have so much in common with each other and what I've just been talking

785
00:23:02.831 --> 00:23:03.664
about.

786
00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:06.910
It's not about winners and losers in the brave new economy of,

787
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:07.721
of,

788
00:23:07.721 --> 00:23:08.320
uh,

789
00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:12.700
of a high powered capitalism and all its incarnations,

790
00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:13.421
uh,

791
00:23:13.421 --> 00:23:13.771
in,

792
00:23:13.771 --> 00:23:14.441
in Europe,

793
00:23:14.441 --> 00:23:15.400
big and small.

794
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:16.450
Uh,

795
00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:17.051
but it's,

796
00:23:17.051 --> 00:23:17.501
it's,

797
00:23:17.501 --> 00:23:17.950
um,

798
00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:19.360
we see the faces,

799
00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:20.283
uh,

800
00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:24.430
the remainders of this kind of economic change.

801
00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:25.991
And again,

802
00:23:25.991 --> 00:23:30.991
this is the people who worked on captain swing or George Rudy and a and Eric

803
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:33.880
Hobsbawm.

804
00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:34.713
Um,

805
00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:36.783
how to put this

806
00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:39.340
in.

807
00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:43.870
There was a real person called Ned Lud in about 18,

808
00:23:43.871 --> 00:23:44.471
16,

809
00:23:44.471 --> 00:23:47.630
18 in there in England.

810
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:48.830
Uh,

811
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:52.820
Lud the word English word Luddite is someone who is a machine breaker.

812
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:55.700
Luddism is machine breaking.

813
00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.870
You break the machines because machines are putting you out of work.

814
00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.420
You're a handloom weaver,

815
00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:07.850
famous cases in Silesian in Germany and then machine is there.

816
00:24:07.851 --> 00:24:11.230
Glassworks later in the century.

817
00:24:11.231 --> 00:24:11.851
Things I taught,

818
00:24:11.851 --> 00:24:13.130
I've talked about last time.

819
00:24:13.131 --> 00:24:14.090
We're putting them out of work.

820
00:24:14.091 --> 00:24:16.550
And Ned Lud busted up machines.

821
00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.540
He broke the machine.

822
00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:20.721
18,

823
00:24:20.721 --> 00:24:21.650
29.

824
00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.610
Awful economic year everywhere in Europe,

825
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.460
freezing winter hunger,

826
00:24:28.461 --> 00:24:31.310
real hunger in Britain.

827
00:24:31.311 --> 00:24:32.960
That's my example from Britain,

828
00:24:32.961 --> 00:24:33.501
from England,

829
00:24:33.501 --> 00:24:35.420
specifically from the south of England.

830
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:36.740
Even more specifically,

831
00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:42.410
they found people who are starved to death in the fields with only dandelions in

832
00:24:42.411 --> 00:24:44.780
their stomachs with nothing else to eat.

833
00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:51.910
If you were a freshman or a German or an Italian,

834
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:58.810
say northern Italian and you went to England in 1829 or 1830 if you did the

835
00:25:00.261 --> 00:25:02.480
reverse of the Arthur Young track,

836
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:05.630
Arthur Young was always wandering through France and discovering people he

837
00:25:05.631 --> 00:25:10.370
thought were 65 or 70 turned out there were 29 there were so battered and beaten

838
00:25:10.371 --> 00:25:12.020
down by by hardship.

839
00:25:12.021 --> 00:25:16.280
They're famous case of a woman he met in Sham Fanya near ass of the of that

840
00:25:16.281 --> 00:25:17.114
case.

841
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:22.040
Arthur Young saw all of these peasants in Europe,

842
00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:27.740
but the counterpart of Arthur Young people from the continent going to England,

843
00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.860
we're amazed there weren't any more pessimists,

844
00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.230
virtually no peasants.

845
00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:35.930
If you'd find a peasant as a small property owner,

846
00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.770
existentially committed to the land that's a little bit overly fancy,

847
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.980
but dependent upon a small piece of land,

848
00:25:42.981 --> 00:25:44.810
a low power to tear off a piece of land,

849
00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:45.171
uh,

850
00:25:45.171 --> 00:25:46.040
for uh,

851
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:47.150
family survival.

852
00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:48.470
The household economy.

853
00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:49.250
Um,

854
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:49.730
there,

855
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:51.860
there weren't any more peasants left in England.

856
00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:52.971
What there were,

857
00:25:52.971 --> 00:25:54.350
where you had gentry,

858
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:59.480
you had big property owners who are masters of all that they saw before them in

859
00:25:59.481 --> 00:26:01.490
the portraits they had painted of themselves.

860
00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:03.110
You had gentry,

861
00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:06.830
you had yeoman who were smaller versions of gentry.

862
00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:08.053
Uh,

863
00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:08.960
you had,

864
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.081
uh,

865
00:26:09.081 --> 00:26:09.320
you know,

866
00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:13.040
property owners or middle rank pop property owners and this sort of thing.

867
00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.140
You had wealthy people from the city buying,

868
00:26:15.141 --> 00:26:17.270
wanting to live in an aristocratic way.

869
00:26:17.271 --> 00:26:19.070
Blang as much land as they could take.

870
00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:22.820
There was no place in Europe in which such a small percentage of the population

871
00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.110
owns so much of the land.

872
00:26:24.111 --> 00:26:26.260
That's still true today in,

873
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:27.110
in Britain.

874
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:28.220
Still true today.

875
00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:29.630
But there weren't any peasants.

876
00:26:29.631 --> 00:26:30.464
Why?

877
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.230
Because the big fish had eaten the smaller fish.

878
00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.590
And because beginning of the 16th century,

879
00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:38.300
the enclosure movement,

880
00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.740
which you've read about,

881
00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:44.770
I think the enclosure movement meant that basically no surprise the big guys get

882
00:26:45.241 --> 00:26:46.260
the law on their side.

883
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:51.240
Parliament passes thousands of acts of enclosure,

884
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:56.270
which allow people to enclose and divide up the common land and the big fish eat

885
00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:58.380
the smaller fish.

886
00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.360
And the peasantry is basically uh,

887
00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:01.531
uh,

888
00:27:01.531 --> 00:27:02.071
destroyed.

889
00:27:02.071 --> 00:27:02.791
And so what you have,

890
00:27:02.791 --> 00:27:03.481
as I said before,

891
00:27:03.481 --> 00:27:04.890
in another context in England,

892
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:07.110
you've got all sorts of textile workers.

893
00:27:07.111 --> 00:27:12.111
You've got all sorts of governances and domestic workers and you have hundreds

894
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.310
of thousands,

895
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:16.680
millions of agricultural laborers.

896
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.590
You have agricultural laborers and other countries too.

897
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:22.410
But you also have small property owners.

898
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:24.510
Hardly any of those folks left in England.

899
00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.630
So to return to the story in 1829,

900
00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:35.150
they start ordinary people start participating in protest and collective action

901
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:42.350
and they start threatening and indeed smashing and burning threshing machines.

902
00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.310
Why threshing machines?

903
00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:51.240
Cause threshing machines are taking their work.

904
00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:52.141
What they,

905
00:27:52.141 --> 00:27:53.820
the way they survived was during harvest.

906
00:27:53.821 --> 00:27:54.870
They go from place to place,

907
00:27:54.871 --> 00:27:58.050
working the way people still doing the wine harvest and south of France,

908
00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.300
uh,

909
00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.320
working from place to place,

910
00:28:01.321 --> 00:28:02.640
bringing in the harvest,

911
00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:05.280
prosperous agricultural land in the south of England.

912
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.690
This is how they get by.

913
00:28:06.691 --> 00:28:08.070
They don't live very well.

914
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:09.300
They don't do very well,

915
00:28:09.301 --> 00:28:10.111
but they're large.

916
00:28:10.111 --> 00:28:10.944
They're fed.

917
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.540
They have a crummy place to sleep,

918
00:28:12.541 --> 00:28:13.770
but they can do okay.

919
00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.780
But then the big guys,

920
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:16.800
the big farmers,

921
00:28:16.801 --> 00:28:17.640
they start,

922
00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.680
they start buying threshing machines.

923
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:22.180
So the threshing machines do the work in these people.

924
00:28:22.181 --> 00:28:24.510
So the next time the guys come along,

925
00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.061
you know,

926
00:28:25.061 --> 00:28:26.250
I'm into groups of 10,

927
00:28:26.251 --> 00:28:26.581
20,

928
00:28:26.581 --> 00:28:27.990
30 families,

929
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.130
pals,

930
00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:29.850
friends,

931
00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:30.661
they come around and say,

932
00:28:30.661 --> 00:28:30.991
well look,

933
00:28:30.991 --> 00:28:31.321
you know,

934
00:28:31.321 --> 00:28:32.154
uh,

935
00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:33.323
it's harvest time.

936
00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:34.590
Here we are.

937
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:36.810
Nuvola uh,

938
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:37.601
sorry,

939
00:28:37.601 --> 00:28:38.434
old chap.

940
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:39.833
We don't need you.

941
00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:41.431
Maybe a couple of you,

942
00:28:41.431 --> 00:28:42.264
but we don't need you.

943
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:43.950
We've got these machines.

944
00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:46.500
They do the job that you used to do.

945
00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.460
We don't have a problem with them working hard all the time.

946
00:28:50.461 --> 00:28:52.260
The machines work all the time at our command.

947
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.353
Sia

948
00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:57.243
Are they mad?

949
00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.410
They're furious and they start burning these machines.

950
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:05.730
They start smashing down the gates and going in and burning these machines.

951
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:08.190
And then they started to find,

952
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.530
they started to find,

953
00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:11.760
uh,

954
00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:15.570
posters that had been written scrawled posters,

955
00:29:15.571 --> 00:29:18.450
sometimes barely literate cause this when that wasn't illiterate literate

956
00:29:18.451 --> 00:29:19.284
population.

957
00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:24.420
And they begin to talk about a mythical like figure like Ned Lud except this

958
00:29:24.421 --> 00:29:27.740
wasn't a real one and my favor,

959
00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:28.821
I just,

960
00:29:28.821 --> 00:29:32.430
former girlfriend longtime ago it mighty Michigan and we were going to write a

961
00:29:32.431 --> 00:29:33.810
screenplay about this.

962
00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.753
We never did.

963
00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.400
One of them has said that,

964
00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:40.383
they all said like,

965
00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:43.120
if you don't rid of the threshing machine,

966
00:29:43.121 --> 00:29:44.500
your agony will begin.

967
00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.340
We will destroy your machines,

968
00:29:48.341 --> 00:29:49.540
we will burn you out.

969
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:55.110
But the best that I ever saw was revenge for the is on the wing from thy

970
00:29:58.471 --> 00:30:03.471
determined captain swing who was captain swing.

971
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:07.350
He was a sense of popular justice.

972
00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:11.520
He was what used to be called the moral economy.

973
00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.560
He did not exist.

974
00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:14.911
He should have.

975
00:30:14.911 --> 00:30:15.620
He's still,

976
00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:16.920
he's still should exist.

977
00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.530
He did not exist.

978
00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:24.670
But captain swing gave this kind of paramilitary sense too.

979
00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:25.990
We are many.

980
00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:28.030
We are correct.

981
00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:29.380
We are right.

982
00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.161
We have God.

983
00:30:30.161 --> 00:30:31.030
On our side,

984
00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:34.840
we are organized and we will win.

985
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:39.940
The subtext is that maybe we let her negotiate and see,

986
00:30:39.941 --> 00:30:41.680
maybe you keep few machines around,

987
00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:43.900
but we want our jobs back.

988
00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:46.120
So captain swing,

989
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:48.700
he was everywhere.

990
00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:49.900
He was in Kent,

991
00:30:49.901 --> 00:30:50.601
he was in Cambridge.

992
00:30:50.601 --> 00:30:51.434
Cambridgeshire,

993
00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:52.420
he was in Devon,

994
00:30:52.421 --> 00:30:53.620
he was in wheelchair.

995
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:55.270
He didn't exist,

996
00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:57.790
but he was everywhere,

997
00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:01.300
at least in the popular imagination.

998
00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.113
By the way,

999
00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:08.870
the captain swing folks had some allies and they were the small,

1000
00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:13.380
smaller farmers who couldn't afford the big time threshing machines.

1001
00:31:13.381 --> 00:31:13.771
And they thought,

1002
00:31:13.771 --> 00:31:13.951
well,

1003
00:31:13.951 --> 00:31:14.101
you know,

1004
00:31:14.101 --> 00:31:14.934
maybe if they,

1005
00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.980
if they burn the machines of my,

1006
00:31:16.981 --> 00:31:17.490
uh,

1007
00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:18.180
uh,

1008
00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.350
ravenous neighbor,

1009
00:31:19.351 --> 00:31:20.880
that wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.

1010
00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:26.060
So they get a little kind of moral support from folks like that and they spread

1011
00:31:26.821 --> 00:31:27.640
and they're there.

1012
00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.070
They're in all sorts of places.

1013
00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:30.980
Do they win?

1014
00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:32.323
Are you kidding?

1015
00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.310
They lose.

1016
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:38.250
The sheriff comes and in a country that didn't like that,

1017
00:31:38.251 --> 00:31:39.780
only had a police force starting in 18,

1018
00:31:39.781 --> 00:31:41.400
29 in London,

1019
00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:44.310
that didn't like the idea of uniformed armies.

1020
00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.220
That was something the French and the Spanish had.

1021
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:49.133
Uh,

1022
00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:49.470
they,

1023
00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:49.921
they start,

1024
00:31:49.921 --> 00:31:54.921
they bring their military contingents and they beat the hell out of these people

1025
00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.180
and they put them on trial.

1026
00:31:57.450 --> 00:31:58.740
They hang some of them,

1027
00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.360
not all that money.

1028
00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.900
They send lots of them to where to Tasmania,

1029
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:05.750
that's where they sent them.

1030
00:32:05.751 --> 00:32:06.780
Or to Australia.

1031
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:09.780
We all live in a convent colony,

1032
00:32:09.781 --> 00:32:10.530
as they say,

1033
00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:13.710
sometimes thing in Australia when they really play the palms,

1034
00:32:13.711 --> 00:32:14.730
as they call the British,

1035
00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:16.283
uh,

1036
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:17.460
they send them a long,

1037
00:32:17.461 --> 00:32:19.740
long way and they defeat them.

1038
00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:22.410
It's bitter hard to write the history of remainders.

1039
00:32:22.411 --> 00:32:23.430
It's fun though too.

1040
00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:25.103
It's fun.

1041
00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.960
Captains swing disappears.

1042
00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.130
The big guys win

1043
00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:34.493
enclosure keeps,

1044
00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.150
keeps rolling along.

1045
00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:40.070
Tens of thousands of people are on the road.

1046
00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:40.431
Oh,

1047
00:32:40.431 --> 00:32:41.510
they get a little victory.

1048
00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.200
The poor law of 1832 is probably influenced by,

1049
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.640
by this threat,

1050
00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:52.060
this perceived threat of popular people voting with their feet

1051
00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:54.561
threatening,

1052
00:32:54.561 --> 00:32:59.561
but also negotiating conjolling trying to imagine a time in the past when

1053
00:33:01.311 --> 00:33:03.830
everybody had a shot at doing well enough.

1054
00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:04.581
Same thing.

1055
00:33:04.581 --> 00:33:05.540
That's the grain riots.

1056
00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:10.310
Imagining a time when there was a just price for everything.

1057
00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.250
Captain Swing was really part of that.

1058
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:14.840
Uh,

1059
00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:14.980
you know,

1060
00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:15.800
obviously Aikido,

1061
00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.420
I find what they did thrilling,

1062
00:33:17.421 --> 00:33:18.770
but I probably shouldn't say that.

1063
00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.113
Um,

1064
00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.350
and of course they probably had a lot of time to think about what they did on

1065
00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:23.810
that day,

1066
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:28.810
extraordinarily long a trip to Port Arthur and not the port Arthur in Asia,

1067
00:33:30.531 --> 00:33:32.110
but the port author Arthur in,

1068
00:33:32.111 --> 00:33:32.530
uh,

1069
00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:37.530
in Tasmania a or to what would become new South South Wales or Victoria in

1070
00:33:38.931 --> 00:33:39.764
Australia.

1071
00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:43.010
But Catherine swing a disappeared.

1072
00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.810
He never existed,

1073
00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:46.340
but he sure should have.

1074
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:48.621
Now,

1075
00:33:48.621 --> 00:33:52.280
long time ago when I was starting out,

1076
00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:53.853
um,

1077
00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.370
I was working in the archives,

1078
00:33:55.371 --> 00:33:57.490
invests in a,

1079
00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:57.771
you know,

1080
00:33:57.771 --> 00:33:59.300
in Paris or on the edge of Paris,

1081
00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:00.920
the military archives there,

1082
00:34:00.921 --> 00:34:02.240
and the big chefs would events then,

1083
00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:03.380
and I was working on,

1084
00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:08.380
I was working on other stuff and I kept finding these incidents that were

1085
00:34:09.081 --> 00:34:13.970
occurring at precisely the same time as captain swing 18,

1086
00:34:13.971 --> 00:34:14.601
29,

1087
00:34:14.601 --> 00:34:15.434
1830,

1088
00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.240
not in England,

1089
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:18.590
but in France.

1090
00:34:18.591 --> 00:34:21.530
And I kept finding these reports from,

1091
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:22.070
uh,

1092
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:22.520
uh,

1093
00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:22.960
from a,

1094
00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:23.691
a part of,

1095
00:34:23.691 --> 00:34:24.350
uh,

1096
00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:24.651
oh.

1097
00:34:24.651 --> 00:34:28.580
And I didn't bring a map and I can't draw with a damn either.

1098
00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:29.823
Um,

1099
00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:32.920
yeah.

1100
00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.753
All right.

1101
00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:34.693
Okay.

1102
00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:35.411
Well but,

1103
00:34:35.411 --> 00:34:35.701
but that,

1104
00:34:35.701 --> 00:34:38.340
that the to imagine labelle foss.

1105
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.710
I,

1106
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:39.543
here we go.

1107
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:40.551
Nice.

1108
00:34:40.551 --> 00:34:41.384
Huh?

1109
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:42.380
Um,

1110
00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:43.213
mountains,

1111
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:45.231
mountains,

1112
00:34:45.231 --> 00:34:45.571
pepe,

1113
00:34:45.571 --> 00:34:47.390
annual to lose here.

1114
00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:48.650
Uh,

1115
00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:49.970
Boldo up here.

1116
00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:51.093
What a,

1117
00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:51.900
um,

1118
00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:56.540
I kept finding in a department called the [inaudible] edge mountainous

1119
00:34:56.541 --> 00:34:57.374
department.

1120
00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:59.180
I kept finding these reports,

1121
00:34:59.181 --> 00:35:00.350
the capital of his flaw,

1122
00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:02.030
but that's in the plane kind of,

1123
00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:04.580
and then you go up into the mountains and you've got real serious mountains and

1124
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:07.910
now people drive through those mountains to get down door to buy cheaper posties

1125
00:35:07.911 --> 00:35:09.380
and cigarettes and that kind of thing.

1126
00:35:09.381 --> 00:35:10.131
But it is very,

1127
00:35:10.131 --> 00:35:10.851
very beautiful there.

1128
00:35:10.851 --> 00:35:15.080
It's full also now of people from 1968 and went off and formed communes and the,

1129
00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:15.710
and the,

1130
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:16.521
and the Ahi Edge.

1131
00:35:16.521 --> 00:35:18.560
And sometimes you see some of them staggering around there.

1132
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:21.350
But I kept finding reports of,

1133
00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:22.340
uh,

1134
00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.690
but from the police,

1135
00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:24.200
uh,

1136
00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:29.200
or from the gendarme above all or from mayors saying that men dressed as women

1137
00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.950
were coming down the mountain in the mist and the,

1138
00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:38.730
and the snow.

1139
00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:43.320
Armed with pitchforks armed with rifles.

1140
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:47.490
And we're chasing away two groups of people,

1141
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:49.021
Shop Boone,

1142
00:35:49.021 --> 00:35:49.854
Yay.

1143
00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.000
Who are charcoal burners,

1144
00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:56.780
forest people cutting down trees and forest guards,

1145
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.770
those people guarding the forest

1146
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:02.220
employed by the state,

1147
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:07.020
employed by the rural bourgeoisie or people living in Florida or to news who

1148
00:36:07.021 --> 00:36:09.570
owned a lot of people on a lot of land in the forest.

1149
00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:10.440
Uh,

1150
00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.290
or by uh,

1151
00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:13.030
uh,

1152
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.260
you know,

1153
00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:14.790
by communes if it's forest.

1154
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:15.351
Uh,

1155
00:36:15.351 --> 00:36:20.351
we're a communally owned to try to keep out ordinary people and these people

1156
00:36:21.871 --> 00:36:26.871
were coming down the mountain and taking shots at them and yelling nasty things

1157
00:36:27.961 --> 00:36:28.794
to them,

1158
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:32.940
threatening them with pitch forks and tried to drive them away.

1159
00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:39.440
And then they would find notes saying if the forest guards and the charcoal

1160
00:36:41.161 --> 00:36:42.060
burners come back,

1161
00:36:42.061 --> 00:36:42.571
your agony,

1162
00:36:42.571 --> 00:36:44.790
we'll begin signed.

1163
00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:48.750
Jean Lieutenant of the dem was out,

1164
00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.170
a demo was l and franchise obviously,

1165
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.361
you know,

1166
00:36:51.361 --> 00:36:56.361
a young woman then was added and these became known as the dumb was l of the

1167
00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:57.853
edge.

1168
00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:00.450
So I found so many of these in 18,

1169
00:37:00.451 --> 00:37:01.260
29,

1170
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:02.130
1830,

1171
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:03.690
1831,

1172
00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:05.670
a few in 1848,

1173
00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:09.630
a couple in 1872 and never again,

1174
00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.333
never again.

1175
00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.710
Who are these people and what were they doing?

1176
00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.840
What they wanted.

1177
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:16.381
Again,

1178
00:37:16.381 --> 00:37:17.490
think of captain swing.

1179
00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:18.960
Think of the grain writes.

1180
00:37:18.961 --> 00:37:21.720
What they wanted was the access to the forest.

1181
00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:24.540
They'd always had access to the forest.

1182
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:26.610
It's cold in the [inaudible] edge.

1183
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:30.840
You need wood that's gleaned from the forest to make fires,

1184
00:37:30.841 --> 00:37:31.860
to stay alive.

1185
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:33.870
You need berries,

1186
00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:35.370
roots to eat.

1187
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:39.090
You need places to pasture your animals.

1188
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:40.260
Pigs,

1189
00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:40.870
which you know,

1190
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:44.720
eat right down through the root goats like we have in,

1191
00:37:44.721 --> 00:37:44.991
in,

1192
00:37:44.991 --> 00:37:45.691
in our village,

1193
00:37:45.691 --> 00:37:47.070
in the south and all dash,

1194
00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:48.060
uh,

1195
00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:48.930
or you know,

1196
00:37:48.931 --> 00:37:51.780
sheep if are really rich,

1197
00:37:51.781 --> 00:37:52.561
maybe cows,

1198
00:37:52.561 --> 00:37:54.090
but that didn't happen very much there.

1199
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:54.990
Uh,

1200
00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:56.610
the rich guys will own the cows.

1201
00:37:56.611 --> 00:37:57.151
The peasants didn't,

1202
00:37:57.151 --> 00:38:01.260
knowing the cows they'd always for centuries as they well remembered,

1203
00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:02.880
had access to,

1204
00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.313
to the forest.

1205
00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.140
Why do they lose access to the forest?

1206
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:09.520
They're looking back at an imaginary time and they,

1207
00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:09.721
well,

1208
00:38:09.721 --> 00:38:10.400
it wasn't imaginer.

1209
00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.520
They always had had access.

1210
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:12.750
There was a lots of forests.

1211
00:38:12.751 --> 00:38:13.584
The whole place.

1212
00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:16.740
Deforestation is a big problem in France since the 17th,

1213
00:38:16.741 --> 00:38:17.574
18th century.

1214
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:19.800
But the peer knees have many forests,

1215
00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:20.760
many mountains.

1216
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:22.950
They'd always been able to go there as they wanted.

1217
00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:25.140
They didn't own the forest,

1218
00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:27.030
but use and property.

1219
00:38:27.031 --> 00:38:29.010
We're not categories that were,

1220
00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:30.390
that meant anything to anyone.

1221
00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:32.790
And they're told they can't go there anymore.

1222
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.280
So some of them would go to churches and they're looking for deeds that would

1223
00:38:36.281 --> 00:38:40.780
have given their village people those villages rights to be in the forest

1224
00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:40.781
centuries ago.

1225
00:38:40.781 --> 00:38:41.290
No,

1226
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:42.123
they don't find him.

1227
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:47.380
So why can't think of the forest anymore to pasture they're miserable animals or

1228
00:38:47.381 --> 00:38:49.810
to find something to eat or some fuel.

1229
00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:51.340
Why can't they do that anymore?

1230
00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.313
Uh Ha.

1231
00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:54.670
Talking capitalism in the state,

1232
00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:57.820
the price of wood is increased.

1233
00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:59.950
Why the metallurgical industry,

1234
00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:04.720
what they call catalogs as in Catalonia Forges Frg.

1235
00:39:04.721 --> 00:39:05.051
Yes.

1236
00:39:05.051 --> 00:39:08.110
Forges small metallurgical industries.

1237
00:39:08.111 --> 00:39:09.220
The price of wood goes up.

1238
00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.560
So suddenly the people that own the forest say,

1239
00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:12.633
hey baby,

1240
00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:16.270
we don't want those peasants and their animals in the forest anymore.

1241
00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:19.450
So they started hiring forest guards.

1242
00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:23.780
They started hiring charcoal burners who shoveled?

1243
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:24.190
Yay.

1244
00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:25.750
Who are chopping down the trees.

1245
00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.090
A slicing them up as people still doing this.

1246
00:39:29.091 --> 00:39:32.890
Joha are still doing the black forester or do anywhere that you can think of in

1247
00:39:32.891 --> 00:39:33.724
Europe.

1248
00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.190
In my Oregon I where I'm from,

1249
00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:36.971
uh,

1250
00:39:36.971 --> 00:39:37.630
and uh,

1251
00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:39.070
logging was a good way to make money.

1252
00:39:39.071 --> 00:39:39.510
He and I,

1253
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.881
you know,

1254
00:39:39.881 --> 00:39:40.280
when you're,

1255
00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:40.510
uh,

1256
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:41.051
I never did it,

1257
00:39:41.051 --> 00:39:41.920
but when you're in college,

1258
00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:42.760
um,

1259
00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.800
and so the wood is leaving the forest,

1260
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:48.880
the people are getting even richer and the peasants are idle up.

1261
00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:49.900
Why are they out of luck?

1262
00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:51.231
Because what the,

1263
00:39:51.231 --> 00:39:51.600
the,

1264
00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:51.820
the,

1265
00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:56.820
the big money people do that own the forest is they do exactly what the wealthy

1266
00:39:57.011 --> 00:39:57.201
did.

1267
00:39:57.201 --> 00:39:57.820
An England,

1268
00:39:57.820 --> 00:39:58.660
the big land owners,

1269
00:39:58.661 --> 00:39:59.740
they get the law on their side.

1270
00:39:59.741 --> 00:40:00.574
What a surprise.

1271
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:02.380
They have their lobbyists,

1272
00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:04.360
they get the law on their side.

1273
00:40:04.361 --> 00:40:07.270
They pass a new forest code in 1827

1274
00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:13.770
that keeps basically ordinary people out of the forest to which they had always

1275
00:40:14.741 --> 00:40:15.760
had access.

1276
00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.620
They had always had access.

1277
00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.030
They can't go there anymore.

1278
00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:20.710
They go up there and they find guards,

1279
00:40:20.711 --> 00:40:22.570
they're armed guards,

1280
00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:28.050
but they are many and the guards are few and they scare the hell out of them and

1281
00:40:29.231 --> 00:40:30.400
they drive them away.

1282
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:34.090
They drive them away in the mayors of these little villages.

1283
00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:34.871
My sock was,

1284
00:40:34.871 --> 00:40:36.070
when I love to go places,

1285
00:40:36.071 --> 00:40:36.580
I've written about it.

1286
00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:37.220
Uh,

1287
00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:38.650
a messiah was one in the mirror.

1288
00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:39.520
He's in a difficult position.

1289
00:40:39.521 --> 00:40:42.940
He knows damn well who is causing the troubles,

1290
00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:45.010
the tube in the forest.

1291
00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:46.540
But he's got to live with these people.

1292
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:48.250
So he didn't going to be telling on anybody.

1293
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:50.950
So I followed this through.

1294
00:40:50.951 --> 00:40:51.830
I read this and,

1295
00:40:51.831 --> 00:40:52.664
and uh,

1296
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.480
I wrote,

1297
00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:53.770
you know,

1298
00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:56.890
something about it and it book I did a long time ago called 1830,

1299
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.270
uh,

1300
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.830
in,

1301
00:40:57.830 --> 00:40:59.920
in France edited book.

1302
00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:01.391
So,

1303
00:41:01.391 --> 00:41:02.224
um,

1304
00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:04.420
what happens,

1305
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:07.530
who is Jean Lieutenant of the demo?

1306
00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:09.490
[inaudible] who is she?

1307
00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:09.701
Well,

1308
00:41:09.701 --> 00:41:10.750
she didn't exist either.

1309
00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:13.510
She's exactly like captain swing.

1310
00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:16.060
She says we are many.

1311
00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:17.410
We are right.

1312
00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:20.020
We have justice on our side.

1313
00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:21.191
By the way,

1314
00:41:21.191 --> 00:41:22.510
these people did not speak French.

1315
00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.470
So there it was hard for them to find somebody to write in French.

1316
00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:27.670
You're your agony.

1317
00:41:27.671 --> 00:41:28.600
We'll begin.

1318
00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:29.141
Uh,

1319
00:41:29.141 --> 00:41:30.190
because they don't speak French.

1320
00:41:30.191 --> 00:41:30.461
They spoke,

1321
00:41:30.461 --> 00:41:31.630
they spoke Patois.

1322
00:41:31.631 --> 00:41:32.920
That's very much influenced by,

1323
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:33.351
by,

1324
00:41:33.351 --> 00:41:34.190
by Spanish,

1325
00:41:34.191 --> 00:41:35.600
that that's not even really like the,

1326
00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:35.970
uh,

1327
00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:36.651
like a,

1328
00:41:36.651 --> 00:41:36.870
uh,

1329
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:37.120
you know,

1330
00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:37.953
cut to allow,

1331
00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:38.450
uh,

1332
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:40.190
or certainly nothing to do with Bosc,

1333
00:41:40.191 --> 00:41:43.970
which has done anything to do with anything except vaguely Hungarian and finish.

1334
00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:44.900
Um,

1335
00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:47.570
and so they write these things and then they say that gene,

1336
00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.490
that the tenor of the demo was hell,

1337
00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:54.320
we'll toast you one day if you don't leave the forest and what they want.

1338
00:41:54.321 --> 00:41:54.681
Of course,

1339
00:41:54.681 --> 00:41:58.310
if they want the government to return and restore their rights in the forest,

1340
00:41:58.311 --> 00:41:59.091
does the government do that?

1341
00:41:59.091 --> 00:41:59.870
Are you kidding?

1342
00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:00.830
Of course they don't.

1343
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:02.660
Now 1830 comes along,

1344
00:42:02.661 --> 00:42:03.494
revolution,

1345
00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:04.251
liberty,

1346
00:42:04.251 --> 00:42:04.791
fraternity,

1347
00:42:04.791 --> 00:42:05.624
equality,

1348
00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:06.171
red,

1349
00:42:06.171 --> 00:42:06.441
white,

1350
00:42:06.441 --> 00:42:07.274
and blue.

1351
00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.330
So what do they do?

1352
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:09.283
They say,

1353
00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.273
well,

1354
00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:12.890
what's this liberty must mean that we can ever force back,

1355
00:42:12.891 --> 00:42:13.724
doesn't it?

1356
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:14.381
So that,

1357
00:42:14.381 --> 00:42:14.571
you know,

1358
00:42:14.571 --> 00:42:19.010
but one of the interesting things about this is they become petitioners just for

1359
00:42:19.011 --> 00:42:19.844
a little bit.

1360
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:22.430
They get people who can write French to petition saying,

1361
00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:22.821
Gee,

1362
00:42:22.821 --> 00:42:26.300
we hear about this liberty in Paris and that's surely is our forest,

1363
00:42:26.301 --> 00:42:27.134
isn't it?

1364
00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:28.671
The government says,

1365
00:42:28.671 --> 00:42:29.031
oh no,

1366
00:42:29.031 --> 00:42:29.181
no,

1367
00:42:29.181 --> 00:42:30.920
the forest code of 1827 is,

1368
00:42:30.921 --> 00:42:32.580
is is ever more in,

1369
00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:32.871
in,

1370
00:42:32.871 --> 00:42:33.470
in,

1371
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:34.131
in use,

1372
00:42:34.131 --> 00:42:35.870
and you can't have access to the forest.

1373
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:37.310
And the forest guards return,

1374
00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.750
the forest guards return to the d to The forest,

1375
00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:47.110
but sort of the demos l and they begin to dress up as women again.

1376
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:52.880
They lose what a surprise there driven away.

1377
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:54.860
Why did they dress up as women?

1378
00:42:56.350 --> 00:42:56.510
Well,

1379
00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:56.931
one thing,

1380
00:42:56.931 --> 00:42:57.830
a disguise,

1381
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.761
you know,

1382
00:42:58.761 --> 00:42:59.180
you,

1383
00:42:59.180 --> 00:42:59.690
you,

1384
00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:00.170
uh,

1385
00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:00.711
one thing they do,

1386
00:43:00.711 --> 00:43:01.120
by the way,

1387
00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.150
the charcoal,

1388
00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:04.460
they as her mocking the charcoal workers also,

1389
00:43:04.461 --> 00:43:08.810
they put charcoal on their face and they were sheets they tried to look like,

1390
00:43:08.811 --> 00:43:09.920
make them look like dresses.

1391
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:11.840
Why is women,

1392
00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:13.213
why is women,

1393
00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:14.870
it's more than a disguise.

1394
00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:15.681
What it is,

1395
00:43:15.681 --> 00:43:17.300
is an enraged carnival.

1396
00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:23.200
If you think of carnival take of Mardi gras in your anywhere in Europe,

1397
00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:24.170
anywhere in,

1398
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:25.130
in Christian Europe,

1399
00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:28.880
what you do during carnival,

1400
00:43:28.881 --> 00:43:30.380
look at the floats in New Orleans.

1401
00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:33.470
Whenever we was getting wasted and dressing up in various things,

1402
00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:34.131
the,

1403
00:43:34.131 --> 00:43:34.480
the,

1404
00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:39.230
the old version of that was that you dressed up like your exploiters.

1405
00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.870
You could the three days or four days,

1406
00:43:41.871 --> 00:43:45.260
you could mock the judge who handed out unfair sentences.

1407
00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:50.380
You could mock the big fat noble who had senior or rights over you.

1408
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:54.230
You could muck the John Dharm who treated you thought,

1409
00:43:54.231 --> 00:43:55.250
treated you badly.

1410
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:56.840
You could pretend it was,

1411
00:43:56.841 --> 00:43:57.140
uh,

1412
00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:57.650
it was,

1413
00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:58.760
it was a carnival,

1414
00:43:58.761 --> 00:44:01.850
but an enraged carnival during carnival.

1415
00:44:01.851 --> 00:44:06.710
You stand the world on its head and what you did in this case,

1416
00:44:06.711 --> 00:44:10.610
as you dressed up as women reversing reality from their point of view,

1417
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:14.280
and this enraged carnival is intended rather like the,

1418
00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:16.250
the shopping environment that should shoot me.

1419
00:44:16.251 --> 00:44:17.600
You can call it an English,

1420
00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:18.051
uh,

1421
00:44:18.051 --> 00:44:18.860
in which you,

1422
00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:19.320
you know,

1423
00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:19.560
you,

1424
00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:22.580
you pound on pots and pans outside.

1425
00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:23.360
Uh,

1426
00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.850
the host of a couple or a woman for example,

1427
00:44:25.851 --> 00:44:27.410
is married somebody from another village.

1428
00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:32.400
You try to set things right again by pounding on calling attention to a misdeed.

1429
00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:35.520
This violated the communal sense of justice.

1430
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:37.440
And that's what these people are doing there.

1431
00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:38.640
There were there saying,

1432
00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:39.900
respect us,

1433
00:44:39.901 --> 00:44:41.130
respect justice.

1434
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.050
And so they're dressing up like women.

1435
00:44:43.051 --> 00:44:45.830
They're standing in the world on his head and it's an enraged,

1436
00:44:45.831 --> 00:44:47.340
deadly serious carnival,

1437
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.571
you know,

1438
00:44:48.571 --> 00:44:48.781
they'll,

1439
00:44:48.781 --> 00:44:50.850
they'll shoot at these people and you know,

1440
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:53.100
beat the hell out of them when they catch them.

1441
00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:56.260
And so that's so Zhan the,

1442
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.491
the,

1443
00:44:56.491 --> 00:45:01.491
the lieutenant of the dumb was l represents justice and this kind of acting out

1444
00:45:03.661 --> 00:45:05.490
of this enraged carnival.

1445
00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:08.850
So it's more than a disguise,

1446
00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:10.711
but they don't,

1447
00:45:10.711 --> 00:45:12.600
when captain swing doesn't win,

1448
00:45:12.601 --> 00:45:14.550
either they're arrested,

1449
00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:16.200
they're put on trial,

1450
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:19.350
some of them are put in the slammer in jail,

1451
00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:21.360
but they,

1452
00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:22.650
in the end,

1453
00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:23.340
uh,

1454
00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:23.731
you know,

1455
00:45:23.731 --> 00:45:26.160
if they come back in 1830 and of 1830,

1456
00:45:26.161 --> 00:45:27.090
1831,

1457
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.691
so many,

1458
00:45:27.691 --> 00:45:28.381
1832,

1459
00:45:28.381 --> 00:45:29.220
if I remember right,

1460
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:30.840
1848,

1461
00:45:30.841 --> 00:45:31.674
they're back.

1462
00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:34.410
1872 but then never again.

1463
00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:35.551
And the,

1464
00:45:35.551 --> 00:45:36.200
the Ahi,

1465
00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:41.200
she has a department depopulate rapidly in the second half of the 19th century.

1466
00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:45.390
These people can't make it in the forest anymore.

1467
00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:47.880
They can't go into the forest anymore.

1468
00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:50.820
They can't survive with a little plots of land.

1469
00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:52.530
And so they bail up,

1470
00:45:52.531 --> 00:45:54.540
they get out and their great,

1471
00:45:54.541 --> 00:45:54.871
great,

1472
00:45:54.871 --> 00:45:56.400
great grandchildren.

1473
00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:57.270
Uh,

1474
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:59.700
many of them work in the [inaudible] and the,

1475
00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:00.061
you know,

1476
00:46:00.061 --> 00:46:00.894
the aircraft,

1477
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:01.590
uh,

1478
00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:02.490
factories in,

1479
00:46:02.491 --> 00:46:02.821
in,

1480
00:46:02.821 --> 00:46:03.180
uh,

1481
00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:04.020
in Toulouse,

1482
00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:04.890
uh,

1483
00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:08.850
or go to [inaudible] or go to Paris or ended up go to Azure or end up somewhere

1484
00:46:08.851 --> 00:46:09.684
else.

1485
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:13.530
So the dumb was l like captain swing,

1486
00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:18.840
like these grain rioters in all of these countries in Spain,

1487
00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:20.363
in Britain,

1488
00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:21.810
in Prussia,

1489
00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:23.310
everywhere.

1490
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.000
These are the remnants of what people viewed as a traditional way of doing

1491
00:46:30.391 --> 00:46:34.440
things that at least was infused with a sense of the proper,

1492
00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:38.750
a sense of popular justice and the demos.

1493
00:46:38.751 --> 00:46:40.860
I'll try to stand carnival on in the world,

1494
00:46:40.861 --> 00:46:45.060
on its head during carnival and try to get people to do the right thing,

1495
00:46:45.061 --> 00:46:47.700
to return the forests to them.

1496
00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:49.920
Return the threshing machines,

1497
00:46:49.921 --> 00:46:54.060
get the threshing machines the hell out of the big farms and Kant and other

1498
00:46:54.061 --> 00:46:58.500
places restored grain and bread to a reasonable price.

1499
00:46:58.501 --> 00:47:00.180
So everybody could have a shot at buying some,

1500
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:06.230
but in the end they lose out to this dynamic duo more powerful duel,

1501
00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.120
the state and capitalism.

1502
00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:14.220
It's bitter hard to write the history of remainders.
