1
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:01.561
Okay.

2
00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:06.561
I want today to do the impossible and talk about urbanization and urban growth,

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.680
um,
in 50 minutes,
but it builds on what you're reading.

4
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:14.820
And I'll give the classic example,
which is the greatest project of,

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.320
of intervention,

6
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:21.030
of human intervention or rebuilding that as you're building a Paris by that man

7
00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:25.530
that my late friend Richard Cobb wants distance,
the essay l station,
the Tila.

8
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.150
Um,
but in doing so,
I want to emphasize a couple of points.

9
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.730
One is that the 19th century was a period of phenomenal urban growth and

10
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:40.320
urbanization.
I will distinguish those in a minute.
Um,
and secondly,

11
00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:44.970
that one of the things that emerges out of this urban growth and urbanization,

12
00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:47.100
but particularly the growth of cities,

13
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.430
large and small and medium in the 19th century is an inclusive and in creasing,

14
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.260
uh,
geography of class segregation.
Um,

15
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.640
and the theme of course in Paris as in other cities,
London's a good example is,

16
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:07.500
uh,
a more prosperous west and the Le increasingly less prosperous east.
Uh,

17
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:11.250
but also,
uh,
one of the things that I really enjoyed talking about and trying to,

18
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.650
uh,
help people understand is why it is that European suburbs are not at all like

19
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:18.630
American suburbs.
Uh,

20
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:23.631
why is it that that so people feared by elites were perched on the edge of

21
00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:28.080
European cities,
whether it's Vienna,
whether it's Paris,

22
00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:31.160
where there's lots of other places and not in the center.
Well,

23
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.980
whereas in the United States,
uh,
uh,
you know,
if you think of the,
the,

24
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:39.330
the riots in 1967 before your time,
most of your times,
uh,

25
00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:43.950
in Detroit or Newark or in watts or east la,

26
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.010
I was people in the center with the,
with the,
with the wealthy people in the,
in,

27
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.390
in the periphery,
sort of fearing the,
uh,
the,

28
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.900
the poor people living in the center.

29
00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:59.040
Why is it just completely different?
I remember in,
I dunno,

30
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.330
the 1990s,
early 1990s,
[inaudible] we're doing a book,
I just,

31
00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:06.410
a bunch of essays and France called Bondo,
who's,

32
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.300
which means a red suburbs and I was supposed to write something.

33
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.470
So we're tying to book together.

34
00:02:10.471 --> 00:02:12.420
And it was at this time of the Rodney king trial.

35
00:02:12.421 --> 00:02:15.210
And most of you are not of the trial Rodney King,
but when Rodney King,

36
00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:20.070
who was a Afro American who was beaten up by cops in La and it was filmed by

37
00:02:20.071 --> 00:02:21.240
somebody who just happens to have a,
you know,

38
00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:24.510
a camera and was filming this and there was a big trial,
um,

39
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.330
and the police who beat the hell out of them were acquitted,
you know,

40
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.310
any requested by a white jury,
um,
in the suburbs.
And so I,
and people would,

41
00:02:32.311 --> 00:02:33.930
France couldn't get more of that.
The idea of,

42
00:02:33.931 --> 00:02:38.220
of Sir wealthy people living in the suburbs as opposed to poor people living in

43
00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:42.090
the suburbs in Europe.
Uh,
and so we had to sort of hold the book for,
you know,

44
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.080
for a of a couple of weeks or until I could figure out what,
how to explain this.

45
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.120
Uh,
and so that's one theme also,
uh,
in,

46
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.150
under the rubric of Center and periphery.
And why,

47
00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:54.000
why are European cities different?
Well,

48
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.180
a human intervention has something to do with that in the case of Paris.

49
00:02:57.181 --> 00:02:58.290
And that's fun to talk about.

50
00:02:58.291 --> 00:03:02.590
And so I'm going to do that in the last half of the talk,
but I just,
um,
uh,
uh,

51
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.960
a few points at the beginning and I sent around.

52
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:08.140
I hope that it will reach you something.
I sent out it at a 10,

53
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:10.840
16 on this a class server,

54
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.770
which has the most of these terms on the board.
Okay.
Um,

55
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.120
the 19th century is a period of both urban growth and,
uh,
or urbanization.
What,

56
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:23.890
why are those different?
Urban growth is say,
well,
population of,
uh,
uh,

57
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.080
of,
um,
uh,
in,
in any city population of Vienna,
uh,

58
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.790
it rises from say,
500,000 to a million.

59
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.840
I don't remember the statistics that that is urban growth of Vienna is bigger at

60
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:36.040
the end of the 19th century,

61
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.310
and then it was at the beginning of the 19th century or

62
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.460
any place you want to pick.

63
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.630
But the most important point is that that there's an ink,

64
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.500
there's urbanization in the 19th century.
So you could have urban growth.

65
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:53.920
Absolutely.
Uh,
and d urbanization.

66
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.410
If at the end of any period that you're looking at,

67
00:03:56.411 --> 00:03:59.800
you had more people living in cities,

68
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.620
but they represented a smaller percentage of the population.

69
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:06.250
So you could actually have d urbanization if you had more people living in the

70
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:10.000
countryside at the end of the period,
relatively to those living in the cities.

71
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.350
Um,
so,
uh,
but it depends on how you define what is an urban area.
You know,

72
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:15.340
in the case of France,

73
00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:18.370
which we know where the hell all these great censuses all the time,
um,

74
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.550
in the restoration that is 18,
15,
1830,

75
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.420
as city had 1500 people in it in 80.
I mean,

76
00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:28.410
there's that many people lined up at the Milford Mall when it a war,
you know,

77
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.440
when it opens,
you know,
in this country,
uh,
in 1841,

78
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.410
they start using 2000 people,
uh,

79
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.330
agglomerated that is living in an urban church,
the steeple,

80
00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:42.040
open up the church and look at all the people or whatever.

81
00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:45.340
But you don't need this an urban area.
Um,
you know,
in the United States,

82
00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:49.420
I don't have no idea what they,
they,
they,
uh,
a city a used to be 5,000,

83
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.260
I think it may be 25,000,
something like that.
It doesn't matter what you,

84
00:04:53.261 --> 00:04:57.880
depending on what you call urban,
define as urban,
there's a remarkable increase,

85
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.980
uh,
uh,
in the,
the urban population in the 19th century.

86
00:05:02.981 --> 00:05:07.981
And it's not just big huge cities like Naples or Constantinople or London,

87
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:12.310
which is so enormous compared to Paris compared to anyone,

88
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.740
any cities spatially.
Uh,

89
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.250
but it's also small towns that increased because in size,

90
00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:23.110
because of a industrial commercial,
uh,
administrative functions.

91
00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:25.970
I mean,
so all this is perfectly obvious,
but it's the 19th centuries,

92
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.820
the growth of,
of big,
big cities.
And the first conurbations,

93
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.590
uh,
that is cities that just sort of run into each other,
such as now,
for example,

94
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.790
you know,
Boston to,
to Washington is practically a conurbation and mean.

95
00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:44.050
France would be legal to acquire who bay,
uh,
you know,
in,
in,
uh,

96
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.950
north of England would be Manchester and it's expanding a suburbs.
All right,

97
00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:51.430
that's all perfectly obvious.
Um,
so the next step is to say,
no,

98
00:05:51.431 --> 00:05:53.760
where does the population of of cities come from?

99
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.770
Who are all these people that are increasing the of cities and are part of this

100
00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:01.660
process of,
of,
of,

101
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.610
in a statistical sense of urban growth.

102
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.390
And second point that I'll make is what did people think about this?
I mean,

103
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:10.910
what did they think about these teaming cities?

104
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.900
Teaming was a word that they started to use to describe these cities that seem

105
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:19.700
to be kind of runaway,
runaway cities.
Um,
okay.
First of all,

106
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.270
um,
I'm not going to write this on the board because it's probably it,

107
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.680
but despite the fact that the only mathematical formula that I even know that if

108
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:32.240
you were trying to explain,
uh,
the growth of,
of any city from 0.1 and time,

109
00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:34.080
2.2 in time,
uh,

110
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.030
what you do is simply look at the population of 0.1 in time,
say 18,

111
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.310
11 or something like that.
And then,

112
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.640
and then you try to find out where the population came from.
Uh,

113
00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:46.730
that increased it to point to in time.
Uh,
you know,

114
00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:50.180
if the city reclassified what was considered urban,

115
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:54.200
if they a next it's suburbs,
that's what Leon does in 1852 or Paris,

116
00:06:54.201 --> 00:06:59.090
Dez and 1860 on January 1st or almost anywhere they knew this,
uh,
uh,

117
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.650
then that would be one factor.
Then you would have births minus deaths.
I mean,

118
00:07:03.651 --> 00:07:05.960
do you have a natural increase in population?

119
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:10.460
And then the other thing is in versus out migration.

120
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.920
Do you have more people arriving in this city then leaving it?
I mean,

121
00:07:13.921 --> 00:07:15.740
the people leaving and people arriving all the time.

122
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.070
But if you look at particularly the first half of the 19th century,

123
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.840
to make a generalization,
it was hot in here to make a generalization.
Uh,

124
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.470
more people die in cities than are born there,
uh,

125
00:07:27.471 --> 00:07:29.420
because that he's a very unhealthy places,

126
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.130
which helps create this kind of image of biological sickness that I'll discuss

127
00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:37.700
in a minute.
They'll vote with some conservative commentators from those times.

128
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.970
What do I mean by that?
Well,
the average life expectancy in,

129
00:07:40.971 --> 00:07:44.350
in Manchester counting infant mortality.
So it's a little bit,
uh,

130
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.070
a little bit,
um,
exaggerates,
uh,

131
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:52.910
was about 19 years old,
so you guys would have bought,
had it,
uh,

132
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.410
or leave the,
in the north of France.
It's the same thing that's pretty young,

133
00:07:57.411 --> 00:08:02.210
but that counts life expectancy.
She made it to the ripe old age of say 18,

134
00:08:02.211 --> 00:08:05.470
then your chances of living longer.
We're pretty great.
Uh,

135
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.130
and and you still had places where we have phenomenal,
uh,

136
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.500
still cases that particular in areas where you have all these spinsters uh,

137
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.910
in Brittany and an Ireland,
you know,
of of old women have,

138
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:16.310
who live a very long time.

139
00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:21.140
And of course women lived and still live longer than men.
So,
um,

140
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.260
another reason why you have more people dying in cities are,

141
00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:28.520
among other reasons is,
is infanticide.
Ah,
that Ah,
you know,

142
00:08:28.521 --> 00:08:33.440
foundling homes in these big cities.
You named the big city,
Rome,
Berlin,

143
00:08:33.441 --> 00:08:35.510
anywhere you want Saint Petersburg,
Moscow,

144
00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:39.920
they have huge following homes with thousands and thousands of babies abandoned

145
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:40.790
every year.

146
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:45.860
One third of those babies die before the end of the next year.
All,

147
00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:49.100
you know,
infanticide,
uh,
the church,
which,
which,
you know,

148
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:53.270
obviously opposed as a fantasize and obviously opposes abortion in the 19th

149
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:57.240
century.
Uh,
uh,
what they do is they finally agree to have,

150
00:08:57.241 --> 00:09:02.100
they put in these little things called tour,
t,
u,
t.
O,
u,
r.
S.
A.
They're like,

151
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.450
you know,
this is awful exam,
uh,

152
00:09:03.451 --> 00:09:06.150
example to give and it comes out of an institution that no longer exists,

153
00:09:06.151 --> 00:09:06.990
machine,
city,

154
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.320
but any place that you have those kinds of machines and you put money in and,

155
00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:10.790
and,

156
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:13.950
and you hope that the window is going to turn around and actually give you your

157
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:17.500
m and m's.
Uh,
that's what,
uh,
you know,
if you make a crass example,
that's,

158
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:20.830
that's what,
what are these tours?
Were they in course people do,
uh,
you know,

159
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.420
young women,
uh,

160
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:27.420
usually unmarried or uncoupled women to abandon their babies instead of exposing

161
00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:30.460
them and having them die,
but falling homes so that you,
you,

162
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.450
you put your baby in this,
you ring the Bell,
you put it in the baby.

163
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:34.650
And this little thing that turns around.

164
00:09:34.651 --> 00:09:37.680
And then the good sister comes and takes the baby and the foundling home.

165
00:09:37.681 --> 00:09:39.630
And if all goes well,
the baby will be there in a year,

166
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.540
but one third of them are not there in a year.
So you've got a lot of people,

167
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:46.230
a lot of babies who die.
Uh,
and this increases the mortality rate.

168
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:49.650
Then you've also got a lot of old people who come into the cities and young

169
00:09:49.651 --> 00:09:54.000
people to beg,
seeking those last vestiges of charity,
you know,

170
00:09:54.001 --> 00:09:57.880
who are clutching at passers by as they will,
as they go to church.
Uh,

171
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.420
and who some people give their money and most of the people don't give them

172
00:10:00.421 --> 00:10:04.560
money.
Often they form part of the community,
which is obviously a case here.
Uh,

173
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:09.720
you know,
a,
a,
you know,
a Yale,
uh,
and uh,
uh,

174
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.480
of course a lot of them,
the older people die and they fight it.
The,
you don't,

175
00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:15.730
a policeman going on his rounds in any city in Milan or Turin anyway,

176
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.150
and we're going to find dead people the next morning.
So you've got,

177
00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:20.070
you've got more people die in cities than are born.

178
00:10:20.071 --> 00:10:23.610
They're really in most places,
way into the 19th century.

179
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:28.730
So the point is obviously that it's immigration immigration that brings,

180
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.650
that causes urbanization and urban growth.

181
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:39.960
Massive immigration,
usually from the hinterland.
That is the,

182
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.510
you know,
the region around,
uh,
uh,

183
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:48.180
around cities.
I've been in the case of,
of,
of Berlin,
I mean,
Norman germ,

184
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.320
northern Germans from brand new Burger Pomerania,
many,
many polls.
Uh,

185
00:10:52.321 --> 00:10:56.220
moving into Berlin,
uh,
uh,
very poor people moving into Berlin.

186
00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.190
And the case of Paris,
it's a people who come into,

187
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.520
into Paris or from Normandy or from shampoo,
Tanya,
you know,
or,

188
00:11:02.521 --> 00:11:05.640
or from central France where a lot of them are seasonal migrants and they ended

189
00:11:05.641 --> 00:11:08.370
up living there permanently.
And the 1880s,

190
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:12.640
you've got a huge wave of Breton's from Brittany who don't speak French.
Uh,

191
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:15.030
and if you go to the station and won't Parnoss,

192
00:11:15.031 --> 00:11:18.300
you'll see a lot of the cafes around won't Parnoss are named after Bretton
towns.

193
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.500
I love you.
In December,
you look,
I live in the north.
Uh,

194
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:25.290
and when you still today at that station Montparnasse you'll see the first thing

195
00:11:25.291 --> 00:11:27.810
you see when you get off a train,
there was a sign for the assistance,

196
00:11:27.811 --> 00:11:32.730
public assistance for Breton's and it's in the station and won't Parnass.
Uh,

197
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:33.571
and this is certainly true.

198
00:11:33.571 --> 00:11:37.110
A Maasais the population or mouth say it includes lots of people from the south

199
00:11:37.111 --> 00:11:41.790
of France,
from provost,
but also who Italians.
Uh,
so this is very obvious.

200
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.091
You know,

201
00:11:42.091 --> 00:11:45.630
cattle lands who move into the people are moving to Barcelona are far more

202
00:11:45.631 --> 00:11:50.580
likely to be cut to la.
Then the RB gets to a deletion or Castilian or something.

203
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.710
This is all obvious.
There's no surprises there.
But the,

204
00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:58.720
the image that people had all of this rapid migration into cities of poor people

205
00:12:01.151 --> 00:12:02.530
because most people who went,

206
00:12:02.531 --> 00:12:06.760
the majority people who move to these cities are poor her than the people that

207
00:12:06.761 --> 00:12:10.600
are already there.
This was in the case of the 1950s and sixties.

208
00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:13.990
And most of these cities,
it's not the case,
the 1950s and sixties,

209
00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:17.500
sort of young professional couples who get enough money to come to rent an

210
00:12:17.501 --> 00:12:18.311
apartment in London,

211
00:12:18.311 --> 00:12:22.510
good luck or to buy an apartment in London or in Berlin or someplace else or

212
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:27.100
Munich.
Uh,
eh,
but in the 19th century,
you have waves of poor people,

213
00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:30.160
the kinds of people you've seen before who are coming to work as domestic

214
00:12:30.161 --> 00:12:33.490
servants,
uh,
coming to work as,
as,
as day laborers.

215
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:37.210
In the case of London coming to work on the teaming,
there's that word again,

216
00:12:37.211 --> 00:12:42.070
docs of the Thames River as London is that imperial city looking out on his fast

217
00:12:42.071 --> 00:12:44.380
empire.
Interesting thing about London,

218
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:47.190
which we had days to talk about this stuff,
but that you,

219
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.410
it's really only in London that you had people of color.

220
00:12:50.411 --> 00:12:53.860
You could find them already by the end of the 19th century,
people coming from,

221
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:57.880
you know,
from India,
from Pakistan,
what,
what would become Pakistan,
uh,

222
00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.990
people coming from the Caribbean.
Uh,
where is it in,
in,

223
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.310
in other cities?
Uh,
uh,
uh,
you simply didn't have that.
I mean,
the number of,
of,
of,

224
00:13:06.311 --> 00:13:09.400
of,
of North Africans coming to Paris is merely a trickle,

225
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.990
a really until after a world war one.
Uh,

226
00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.880
but anyway,
undertone.
So contemporaries had the,

227
00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:20.080
the idea that,
uh,

228
00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:25.030
that what this whole process was,
and I should have written this on the board,

229
00:13:25.031 --> 00:13:28.270
but you can write it down if you would please call the uprooting and hypothesis

230
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.200
they didn't call it that,

231
00:13:29.201 --> 00:13:33.790
that source of social science from the 1960s that these people were uprooted

232
00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:37.870
from those steady rural roots,
uh,
and you know,

233
00:13:37.871 --> 00:13:42.610
of organized religion and from family support and they're thrown into the

234
00:13:42.611 --> 00:13:46.960
maelstrom under the chaos.
Uh,
uh,
sometimes a creative chaos.

235
00:13:46.961 --> 00:13:50.470
But nonetheless,
perception was a dangerous chaos.

236
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.380
That was urban life.
Uh,

237
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:58.440
and the result of all of this was that revolution becomes seen as,

238
00:13:59.051 --> 00:14:02.620
as an extension of person action.
Um,
in fact,

239
00:14:02.621 --> 00:14:06.300
some of the bad social science from the 1960s and trying to explain,
you know,

240
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:09.160
the riots in Detroit and places like that said,
well,

241
00:14:09.161 --> 00:14:12.490
you've got a lot of poor people coming from,
from Alabama and Arkansas,

242
00:14:12.491 --> 00:14:16.480
which is certainly the case of from the South and North Carolina move up to

243
00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:19.900
Detroit and try to get a job in the factories there.
And that,
wow,

244
00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:21.070
they get to the,
to try,

245
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:26.090
they just freak out because those rural roots have been cut them.

246
00:14:26.141 --> 00:14:30.460
You still see this as various electoral campaigns.
Uh,
even today,
even as I speak,

247
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:34.020
this sort of idea that you'll cosmopolitanism,
you know,

248
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:37.270
which is also also by the way,
and almost every language,
sort of a class,

249
00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:40.660
a sort of a code word for antisemitism.
And when people say,
oh,

250
00:14:40.661 --> 00:14:44.760
cities are so cosmopolitan,
they met,
they are full of Jews.
Uh,

251
00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:48.600
and this of triply true in this or antisemitism and racism of eastern,
uh,

252
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.770
eastern and central Europe.
We had so many,

253
00:14:50.771 --> 00:14:55.570
it's such large Jewish population living in cities like Prague,
Budapest,
Vilnius,

254
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.280
Riga,
uh,
just about anywhere you could name.

255
00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:03.020
And then what with the kind of increase in an ethnic populations with the

256
00:15:03.021 --> 00:15:07.270
Estonian ization of Tallinn or the check is a nation of Prague.

257
00:15:07.271 --> 00:15:11.630
You had fewer Germans and fewer Jews and living in,

258
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:12.770
in those cities,

259
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.640
but you had the server antisemitic discourse that lingers Vienna's the classic

260
00:15:16.641 --> 00:15:17.180
case,

261
00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:21.270
cause Vianna goes from being sort of liberal liberal city in 1850s and sixties.

262
00:15:21.271 --> 00:15:25.190
So sort of the hotbed of antisemitism where the mayor of Vienna at the end of

263
00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:29.630
the 19th century,
a buffoon called Karl Luber says,
I say who's a Jew?

264
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.330
That's one of his more infamous statements.
I say,

265
00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:35.720
declare who's a Jew and who isn't.
And of course,
one wants to understand,

266
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:39.110
understand how out of Hitler I got as antisemitism.

267
00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:41.350
It really comes from World War One,
but,
but the,
the,

268
00:15:41.351 --> 00:15:45.890
the basis was already laid there by growing up in Austria,
I in,
uh,
in,
in,

269
00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:49.970
in the 1890s and the first decade of the 20th century.
So,
anyway,

270
00:15:49.971 --> 00:15:54.320
but if you think about that,
um,
you know,
does it,
does immigration,

271
00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:57.110
this massive immigration necessarily lead to urban chaos?
Well,

272
00:15:57.111 --> 00:15:58.920
the answer is obviously not a,

273
00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:02.600
because we have the effect that now we know a lot about historians and social

274
00:16:02.601 --> 00:16:06.470
scientists and social geographies and geographers and sociologists,

275
00:16:06.471 --> 00:16:11.090
and it's called chain migration.
Take the case of China,
uh,
that,
uh,

276
00:16:11.091 --> 00:16:14.720
people who have studied Beijing,
you know,
discovered a long time ago.
I mean,

277
00:16:14.721 --> 00:16:18.890
I remember this from days when I,
uh,
was studying Chinese history back at,
uh,

278
00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:24.110
a less mighty Michigan than it was before.
Uh,
and,
um,
uh,

279
00:16:24.111 --> 00:16:24.590
you know,
the,

280
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.610
all these people pouring into Beijing and the 19th century where they,
they,

281
00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.130
they formed native places,
associations a way.
Kwan,

282
00:16:31.131 --> 00:16:33.390
I can't remember if something like that was the term.
Um,

283
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:37.310
and so it's obvious you get together with people that you know from your part of

284
00:16:37.311 --> 00:16:41.810
China and they are sort of the intermediary areas between you and the city.

285
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.090
Uh,
the Irish are a classic case.

286
00:16:44.091 --> 00:16:47.130
We already have seen how the original leaders scare the hell out of the iris for

287
00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:52.060
a,
of the Irish because there are Catholic and all that.
Um,
so,
um,
but,

288
00:16:52.061 --> 00:16:55.370
but they don't just pour into Manchester and Liverpool in London and sort of

289
00:16:55.371 --> 00:16:58.190
freak out.
It doesn't work like that at all.
They live with their families,

290
00:16:58.191 --> 00:17:00.410
their families make a little money and say,
why don't you come along?

291
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.620
It's the same thing.
Look at the case of Americans,
uh,
you know,

292
00:17:03.621 --> 00:17:07.190
people coming to the United States at the end of the 19th century,
first of all,

293
00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:10.910
uh,
massively from northern Italy and then the 20th century from southern Italy.

294
00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:14.590
You know,
they send money back all the time,
or they,
they,
uh,
in the,

295
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:17.840
it's very different than the German Germans who came to the United States,

296
00:17:17.841 --> 00:17:19.700
almost never were in contact with their families.
Again,

297
00:17:19.701 --> 00:17:23.030
relatively at same with Swiss,
but the Italians were always stayed in contact.

298
00:17:23.031 --> 00:17:26.720
But in any case,
all of these people,
it's,
it's very sensible.
If you come from,

299
00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:31.280
you know,
California,
it 80,
Yale,
you know,
and you often,

300
00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.080
if there are a couple of high schools in La,

301
00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:36.140
they'd send all of these students to Yale.
And if you're kind of,
you know,

302
00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.870
you're kind of freaking out when you get to you.
I think God,
all these people,

303
00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.410
what,
whatever,
they're also smart or whatever.
Uh,
and then,
you know,

304
00:17:42.411 --> 00:17:44.900
the next thing you do is you go to people that you wouldn't even say hello to in

305
00:17:44.901 --> 00:17:46.940
high school and say,
well,
you know,
why don't we hang out tonight?

306
00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:49.970
Or something like that.
Uh,
and,
and so there,
there Pete,

307
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.070
you find people that come and have origins like you,

308
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.250
geographic or whatever and hang out with them.
It's a logical thing.

309
00:17:56.251 --> 00:17:59.520
It happens every single time.
In the case of people moving to Paris,

310
00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:03.130
Leemoo Zam people from the center part of,
of Paris,
of France called the,

311
00:18:03.131 --> 00:18:04.740
the museum.
Uh,
you know,

312
00:18:04.741 --> 00:18:09.741
they live in certain neighborhoods around the center of Paris in the way that

313
00:18:09.991 --> 00:18:13.800
Breton's lived around the guard.
What became the Garmin Parnass,

314
00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:17.280
the station of mole.
Parnoss so this is chain migration.

315
00:18:17.281 --> 00:18:21.060
You see it in Philadelphia,
you see it in London,
you see it in Moscow,

316
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.600
you see it in Saint Petersburg,
you see it everywhere.

317
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.210
But having said that,
that's not the,

318
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:31.350
that's not the way contemporary is viewed.
This,
um,

319
00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:34.680
just there's just two more.
Okay.

320
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.290
Let me just give you a couple examples of,

321
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.480
of how often well meaning,
but not always.

322
00:18:42.481 --> 00:18:47.481
Contemporaries saw the phenomenon of urbanization and urban growth.

323
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:54.110
Let's listen to a preacher called James Shergold Boon Minister of Saint John's

324
00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:58.590
church in the Paddington district of London.

325
00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:03.710
This is a sermon and when he's talking about cities,
uh,
he's evoking,
uh,

326
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:05.880
um,
Sodom and Gomorrah,

327
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:11.130
the very extent of edifices and the very collection of,
of vast masses of human,

328
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.490
um,
uh,
of,
of human beings onto one spot,

329
00:19:14.491 --> 00:19:18.330
humanity remaining what it is bad is what he means,
uh,

330
00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:22.710
must be fraught with moral infection.
They continually use words like infection,

331
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:26.550
that there's a biological inequality of people,
uh,

332
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:31.670
with each other that poor are biologically less likely to in a world of we're

333
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.850
Darwin.
And Post Darwin and misuse of Darwin is very important,
uh,

334
00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:40.560
to survive the challenges of illness,
of disease and illness.

335
00:19:40.561 --> 00:19:43.620
The cholera carries way poor people more than rich people.
He says,

336
00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:45.450
I have to go back to the good minister.

337
00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.410
Cities are the centers and theaters of human ambition,
human cupidity,

338
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:53.070
human pleasure.
On the one side,
the appetites,
the passions,

339
00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:58.140
the carnal corruptions of man are forced as in a hot bed,
uh,

340
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.370
uh,
into a rank and file luxuriance and countless evils,

341
00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:06.990
which would otherwise have a feeble and difficult existence are struck out into

342
00:20:06.991 --> 00:20:10.590
activity and warm.
This is biological contagion.

343
00:20:10.591 --> 00:20:15.591
This is a disease metaphor constantly by mere contact with each other on the one

344
00:20:17.701 --> 00:20:18.780
side,
on the other side,

345
00:20:18.781 --> 00:20:22.290
many constraints and safeguards are weakened or even withdrawn.

346
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:27.560
This is what I mean by leaving those imaginary rural routes in which solidarity

347
00:20:29.101 --> 00:20:32.330
with considered to be automatic and family support.
So very,

348
00:20:32.331 --> 00:20:35.370
very important in cities.
He goes on,

349
00:20:35.371 --> 00:20:38.370
there is a complication of evils.
Um,

350
00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:42.990
external forces cooperate,
cooperate within word desires.

351
00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:47.500
You can conquer those inward bad desires in the countryside,

352
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:52.650
but all is lost in the demon rum of moral corruption.

353
00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:57.790
That is the reality is from urban life.
Well,
et Cetera,

354
00:20:57.791 --> 00:21:00.790
et cetera.
Um,
search.
Harold Shaw,

355
00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:05.500
who was police chief of Manchester,
describe the residents of industrial cities.

356
00:21:05.501 --> 00:21:10.150
These quotes come from an excellent book by,
um,
uh,
uh,
a guy at,
at,

357
00:21:10.151 --> 00:21:14.880
at Rutgers Camden called a lease.
Um,

358
00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:19.010
who's a wife teaches at Penn.
Uh,
he called,
uh,
the,

359
00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:23.470
the residents of industrial cities such as his own as the debris,
which the vast,

360
00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.970
we're a pool of human affairs has deposited here in one of its Eddie's

361
00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:32.950
associated,
associated but not United contiguous,

362
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:37.600
but not connected.
That's a perfect,
a description of,

363
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:42.460
of the uprooting a hypothesis that there's nothing you can do,

364
00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:47.140
uh,
to save people,
uh,
from,
uh,
their selves.

365
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:51.160
Or to take an example from Paris because I'm going to talk about Paris in
awhile.

366
00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:56.530
Um,
in the 1830s as certain vehicle off to the loo ne quite forgettable,

367
00:21:56.770 --> 00:22:01.060
exclaimed how ugly para seems after one year,
uh,
away.

368
00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:05.200
How one stifled in,
uh,
uh,
these dark damp,

369
00:22:05.201 --> 00:22:08.210
narrow corridors damp.
Again,
that's a tour,

370
00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:11.380
a keyword and all this which we were pleased to call the streets of Paris.

371
00:22:11.381 --> 00:22:15.040
One would think that it was an underground city,
so sluggish in the air.

372
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:18.760
So profound the Obscurity and in thousands of pee in it,

373
00:22:18.761 --> 00:22:21.760
thousands of people live bustle frong in the lick.

374
00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:26.140
Liquid darkness like reptiles in,
uh,

375
00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:30.370
Maher in a marsh,
um,
or Victor Hugo,

376
00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:34.690
a cities like forests have their dens in which hide all the vitalist and most

377
00:22:34.691 --> 00:22:38.080
terrible monsters.
Uh,
well they're all this ferocious,

378
00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:43.220
it couldn't be anymore condemning then a particularly in,
um,

379
00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:47.080
in Germany where the whole sense of,
of Heimat,

380
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:51.880
of having a hometown of,
of being attached to a particular space,
uh,

381
00:22:51.881 --> 00:22:55.060
and all of the corruption that comes from,
from big cities,

382
00:22:55.061 --> 00:22:59.530
and you see this over and over again or take New York.

383
00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:04.300
Here's another reverend,
the Reverend Amery de Mayo who attacked the city.

384
00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:08.110
All the dangers of the town may be summed up here of that here,

385
00:23:08.111 --> 00:23:12.010
withdrawn from the blessed at influence of nature that is out of the country and

386
00:23:12.011 --> 00:23:14.080
set face to face against humanity.

387
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:19.150
Mankind loses his own nature and becomes a new and artificial creature and

388
00:23:19.151 --> 00:23:24.151
unhuman cog in a social machinery that works like fate.

389
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:30.040
Again in Zola,
the theme of faith is terribly,
terribly important of destiny.

390
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:33.530
Along with his,
you'll see along with people that have those,
uh,

391
00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:35.830
or if you read others a lot to have the bad genes,

392
00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:39.500
they've got the drinking genes or,
uh,
or,
or whatever.
Um,

393
00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:44.500
you find all this,
uh,
um,
uh,
appalling stuff.
Um,
or,

394
00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:45.403
um,

395
00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:46.430
<v 1>uh,</v>

396
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:50.240
<v 0>here's another one,
a in a book,
a lecture in Nate in 1844.</v>

397
00:23:50.241 --> 00:23:52.520
And the young Americans,
the city's drain,

398
00:23:52.521 --> 00:23:57.200
the country of the best part of its population,
the far with youth of both sexes.

399
00:23:57.201 --> 00:24:02.201
They go into the town and the country is cultivated by so much inferior class.

400
00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:07.160
Well,
it Cetera,
et cetera.
Um,
that was the image.
And of course,

401
00:24:07.161 --> 00:24:11.420
all of the revolutions,
I have a lot to do with that,

402
00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:14.660
Simon.
I can't find my wand.
Is it up there?

403
00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:22.700
<v 1>Ah,
yes.
It's not blah,</v>

404
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:24.500
blah,
blah.

405
00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:29.420
<v 0>Can you,
can you do it or,
uh,
yeah.
Thanks.
Okay.</v>

406
00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.760
Now let's look at an example of this.
I'm sorry,
I can't click the,

407
00:24:32.761 --> 00:24:34.340
I'm just going to have to wave my hand for Netta.

408
00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.290
Clear something or jump up and down.
Um,

409
00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:40.100
now I want you to look at Paris and thinking about what I've said.
Ah,

410
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:44.090
this is Paris in 1839,
uh,
compared to London,

411
00:24:44.091 --> 00:24:45.500
I didn't have time to talk about this in London.
You can walk,

412
00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:48.800
you can walk miles and you're still staggering around looking for the next tube

413
00:24:48.801 --> 00:24:52.700
stop.
Ah,
cause it's about three times as big,
at least three times as big.

414
00:24:52.701 --> 00:24:56.030
Physically Paris,
1837,
you could walk from the Arc de Triomphe,

415
00:24:56.031 --> 00:25:00.160
which is up on the left to the end in about an hour and a half.
Uh,

416
00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:04.490
and this is before the inner suburbs are a next for tax reasons,

417
00:25:04.491 --> 00:25:08.390
but also for reasons of imposing order on the troublesome periphery.

418
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.660
And this is part of the lecture.
So what you've got is if you don't pair,
so all,

419
00:25:11.661 --> 00:25:14.450
it doesn't matter if you don't know Paris,
here's the garden of Luxembourg.

420
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.820
You've got the two wheeler wreath up along the sand there.

421
00:25:16.821 --> 00:25:19.220
You've got your basic San River,
or you did have three islands.

422
00:25:19.221 --> 00:25:22.040
Now they're about to,
they submitted that one over.
You'll sound that we,

423
00:25:22.041 --> 00:25:25.850
they're just not one of the grace of tourist traps and in a Western
civilization,

424
00:25:25.851 --> 00:25:28.550
but it's still beautiful.
And there are a CTA with old Notredame,

425
00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.670
right in the middle.
You've got an enormous population.

426
00:25:31.671 --> 00:25:33.170
You've got an in the central district,

427
00:25:33.171 --> 00:25:36.800
three times the density of population that you have.

428
00:25:36.801 --> 00:25:40.010
Now why are we have apartment in the Ma?
Hey,
a couple blocks up from,
uh,

429
00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:41.400
from to dom and,
and,

430
00:25:41.401 --> 00:25:45.710
and the density there in 1840s in this neighborhood was called Alfie then.

431
00:25:45.711 --> 00:25:47.540
It was three times what it is now.

432
00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:52.250
So you've got this enormous implosion of people into the center from the

433
00:25:52.251 --> 00:25:53.084
provinces.

434
00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.310
<v 1>Next one,
please</v>

435
00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:57.660
<v 0>hold.
And now this is the reason I put this up here.</v>

436
00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.450
This is the first photo of Paris.

437
00:25:59.451 --> 00:26:03.680
This is what you call the daguerrotype that got Tepe.
And then I can identify,

438
00:26:03.681 --> 00:26:07.150
this is,
I'm sure not the only one,
but this is the,
uh,
the full bull.

439
00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:11.240
Her full boar is an English word too,
as well as French.
It means,
uh,

440
00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:14.720
it's sort of an extension of the town.
It's a difficult etymology.

441
00:26:14.721 --> 00:26:17.870
It doesn't really come from false bull,
but from other things.

442
00:26:17.871 --> 00:26:19.940
It's beyond the walls.
But this is the first one.

443
00:26:19.941 --> 00:26:24.941
This is also from a buddy is about 1837 now all Smollen they all station until

444
00:26:26.301 --> 00:26:29.840
like he built these boulevards that became the staging ground for the so called

445
00:26:29.841 --> 00:26:33.890
belly pork.
But there were also boulevards anywhere like around,

446
00:26:33.891 --> 00:26:34.940
because the boulevards were,

447
00:26:34.941 --> 00:26:38.210
were the walls had once been Vienna is a great example.

448
00:26:38.211 --> 00:26:41.940
The rings around Vienna where the rings that were,
were the,

449
00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:46.290
had been where the walls were that were knocked down as the city city group.

450
00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:49.980
Uh,
in Berlin you find the same thing.
Uh,
next please.

451
00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:52.440
<v 2>MMM,</v>

452
00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:56.070
<v 0>this is cheating.
A little bit unhealthy.
This is just an unhealthy,
this guy,</v>

453
00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.050
this is an 18th century hat.
Look at the guy.

454
00:26:58.051 --> 00:27:00.840
There's a 19th century guy looking for aggressively for the 19th century with

455
00:27:00.841 --> 00:27:03.450
the worst WildFit.
This could be the restoration actually,

456
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:05.940
and he's going to get hit by it's raining,
he says,

457
00:27:05.941 --> 00:27:10.230
but it's not as a chamber pot being dumped on his head.
In the 1860s,

458
00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:12.300
only about 10% of,

459
00:27:12.301 --> 00:27:16.770
of of buildings had water above the second floor.
Next please.

460
00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:19.570
<v 2>Um,
this is</v>

461
00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.750
<v 0>by a guy called Charlotte [inaudible] on it doesn't matter,</v>

462
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:26.980
but the point of this is this a CTA and there is no true dom there before viva

463
00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:30.670
la La Lou,
Duke's big flash,
you know,
aspire on it.

464
00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.640
The point is that before the rebuilding of Paris,

465
00:27:33.641 --> 00:27:38.290
this was among the most densely populated parts of Paris at the end of the

466
00:27:38.291 --> 00:27:40.000
period that is 1870,

467
00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:43.950
it's the least densely populated part of Paris because they bet member of

468
00:27:43.951 --> 00:27:48.100
capitalism in this state,
they build government buildings.
Well,

469
00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:51.220
the hospital,
oh,
tell jurors,
one of them,
the prefecture of police,

470
00:27:51.221 --> 00:27:54.460
which would be have all the fighting around it.
In 1944 in August,

471
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.910
I was built as well.
So,
uh,
these places,
uh,

472
00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:03.700
I disappear.
And the more one of the more important more was here also.

473
00:28:03.701 --> 00:28:05.740
And so that was sort of again,
gave the idea of,

474
00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:09.010
of the disease of the center city.
Next,
please.

475
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:11.910
<v 2>MMM.</v>

476
00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:15.390
<v 0>Name those people.
There we go.
Paris in the left eye.
It,</v>

477
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:20.190
what if the 1850 Paris on the right,
they're all running together.

478
00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:24.780
Uh,
but you see there's a lot more people and you have the growth though that the

479
00:28:24.781 --> 00:28:29.220
filling in of the center and you've got the periphery with the emergence of the

480
00:28:29.221 --> 00:28:33.360
suburbs and it's the suburbs that have increasingly poor people living in them

481
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:36.840
who can't afford to live in the center of Paris.
That's the big difference.

482
00:28:36.841 --> 00:28:41.130
That's a big,
big difference.
You have a customer's barrier around Paris.

483
00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:45.120
Every time you bring things into the city or any other friends that you have to

484
00:28:45.121 --> 00:28:48.030
pay taxes on them.
A six pack of Beer,
you pay a tax,

485
00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:52.110
you have more space outside the city walls.
So that's where you build factories.

486
00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:56.190
You're near the canal into railroads.
So that's where you build factories.

487
00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:01.230
The center city throw with the unwanted industries,
the dirty industries,

488
00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:06.090
soap,
chemicals,
et cetera.
Outside Paris doesn't de industrialized,

489
00:29:06.091 --> 00:29:09.180
you still have the garment industry,
but the dirty industries,

490
00:29:09.181 --> 00:29:13.050
the big industries down on the outside and that's where your labor force lips so

491
00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:16.800
that how different that is than Philadelphia or Detroit where you already had

492
00:29:16.801 --> 00:29:20.610
all this space and you've got the population moving into big central areas and

493
00:29:20.611 --> 00:29:24.870
essentially staying there.
Um,
now to be sure the United States,
we have,
you know,

494
00:29:24.871 --> 00:29:29.400
you have places like a very small part of New Orleans.
You've got San Francisco,

495
00:29:29.401 --> 00:29:31.920
you've got Beacon Hill or you got a Manhattan,

496
00:29:31.921 --> 00:29:35.740
you've got sort of places where you've got a lot of wealthy people living in the

497
00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.421
center city.

498
00:29:36.421 --> 00:29:40.050
But places like Detroit or more are more really common of the American

499
00:29:40.051 --> 00:29:41.770
experience.
Uh,
next please.

500
00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.330
And I can remember when I was a kid,
I was younger than you,

501
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:50.740
I think going to a Yankee Tiger double header in 1967,

502
00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:51.551
uh,

503
00:29:51.551 --> 00:29:56.290
Roy White play third base a and w w we walked out in the city was on fire of

504
00:29:56.291 --> 00:30:00.460
Detroit because of the riots and it's still all burned out there.
And,

505
00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:03.580
uh,
one of the interesting things was Gross Pointe Michigan,

506
00:30:03.581 --> 00:30:06.640
which is a very fancy place.
We heard a lot of students here from gross point,

507
00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:08.950
I'm not,
I'm not dissing Grosse Pointe Michigan,
but they,

508
00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.010
the municipal council try to figure out a way that,

509
00:30:11.011 --> 00:30:12.790
that you couldn't get to gross point from the ceremony.

510
00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:15.820
Detroit unless you had a map,
unless you really knew how to get there,

511
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:17.290
try to keep them.

512
00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.890
That is the poor people of the center from going to the suburbs and the,
and the,

513
00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:21.461
you know,

514
00:30:21.461 --> 00:30:25.210
the upper classes of gross point armed themselves with our hunting rifles.

515
00:30:25.211 --> 00:30:26.320
And you know,
uh,

516
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:30.460
just to ask the constables had in central London in 1848,

517
00:30:30.461 --> 00:30:34.210
I mean that spacial juxtaposition is incredible.
Next,
oh,
here we go.

518
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:38.510
Those were lots of people in the center.
The theme here is overcrowding.
Uh,
the,

519
00:30:38.511 --> 00:30:41.470
the,
the,
here's the market of the innocence.
It was this call.

520
00:30:41.471 --> 00:30:45.910
Now it's down by the form,
the owl.
Lots of people,
uh,
than the big market.

521
00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:49.510
[inaudible] built a would later be torn down,
but lots of people in the middle.

522
00:30:49.511 --> 00:30:54.460
That's a theme.
Next please.
And the root pom in 1860.

523
00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:56.260
Now these are really old medieval buildings.

524
00:30:56.261 --> 00:31:00.250
And of course a lot of them get destroyed by,
by,
by the rebuilding a next please.

525
00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:02.210
Um,

526
00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:05.680
well this is a good one because this is one of the streets that would disappear

527
00:31:05.681 --> 00:31:08.440
and you could say,
well,
what the hell is he talking about?
Where all those people,

528
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:10.180
well,
if you have really good eyes,

529
00:31:10.181 --> 00:31:13.270
you can see that there are a few people here because of these long exposures,

530
00:31:13.271 --> 00:31:14.800
there's actually some people standing there,

531
00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:19.450
but this had already been condemned to be destroyed rather like the root

532
00:31:19.451 --> 00:31:20.201
transmit Anya,

533
00:31:20.201 --> 00:31:23.170
that it had the part of the collective memory of the massacre there.

534
00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.330
What does this in the center,
what's a ditch down?

535
00:31:25.331 --> 00:31:29.410
Which sewage when there were some sewers in Paris,
but it was very unhealthy.

536
00:31:29.411 --> 00:31:31.790
And in these areas,
this is right near the pump.
The,

537
00:31:31.791 --> 00:31:36.640
all that is in the sort of center left,
uh,
uh,
eastern part of Paris,
uh,

538
00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:37.650
that,
that the,
uh,

539
00:31:37.651 --> 00:31:42.651
the people just get destroyed by the Colorado in 1832 and again in 1849 and

540
00:31:44.441 --> 00:31:49.441
again in the 1880s in 1884 fundamental inequality before death of,

541
00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:55.660
of the poor.
Uh,
and so this street,
uh,
this is actually a great photo.

542
00:31:55.661 --> 00:31:58.990
This is by a guy called Sean [inaudible] who went around and took pictures of

543
00:31:58.991 --> 00:32:01.500
these neighborhoods that we're going to disappear.
Don't worry about the names,

544
00:32:01.501 --> 00:32:04.000
so no worry about the streets.
I'm trying just to make a point.

545
00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:06.550
But not everybody lived on those streets.

546
00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:10.840
And the second empire that is 1852 to 1870,
Napoleon,

547
00:32:10.841 --> 00:32:13.440
the third people lived it up and a lot of us,
a lot.

548
00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:17.590
His novels are really kind of amazing about that.
And,
and uh,
uh,

549
00:32:17.591 --> 00:32:21.160
he didn't like a Louis Napoleon too terribly much.
This is living it up in a big,

550
00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:25.480
uh,
you know,
a big banquet and a big hotel already.
You can see the wine glasses.

551
00:32:25.481 --> 00:32:28.930
They're starting to put the wine glasses in,
connection with the food.

552
00:32:28.931 --> 00:32:31.600
That's something really comes in the 19th century.
The idea of having,
you know,

553
00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.930
red wine with cheese.
So you do have white wine with,
with goat's cheese,
but,

554
00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:39.650
but the other,
or having white wine with,
uh,
most with fish and with follow on,

555
00:32:39.651 --> 00:32:43.770
that kind of thing.
And these are long elaborate banquets,

556
00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:45.830
have one course following another.
I mean,

557
00:32:45.831 --> 00:32:48.860
I can hardly condemn that having sat through a few thousand of them myself.

558
00:32:48.861 --> 00:32:52.700
But anyway,
ah,
there we go.
Uh,
fancy people.
Next please.

559
00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:58.400
Um,
now this is the,
this is the,
this is revolution,

560
00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:02.180
uh,
in 1830.
Now the bourgeois guy,

561
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.630
he doesn't belong there because he never went out there.
Anyway,
I'm Marianne.

562
00:33:05.631 --> 00:33:08.150
This is a highly romantic view of death.

563
00:33:08.151 --> 00:33:11.420
Here's your street urchin there who's still fighting the good fight in 1830.

564
00:33:11.421 --> 00:33:15.080
This is delicate as famous liberty leading the people.
Just an enormous,

565
00:33:15.081 --> 00:33:16.490
enormous painting.
Um,

566
00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:19.490
and then these people look like they're kind of play acting.
They're kind of say,

567
00:33:19.491 --> 00:33:22.040
oh,
well I'm dead now.
And then a few minutes later,
I'm going to get in,

568
00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.590
get up again.
This is very romanticized.
Next,

569
00:33:24.591 --> 00:33:28.280
please compare this to methadone.
Yay.

570
00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:31.880
This is a very underappreciated painting.
Again,
the name doesn't matter man.

571
00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:34.400
It meant it meant to him and it does the art people.
But,
uh,

572
00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:38.990
this is called the barricade.
This is only 18 years.
18 years later.

573
00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:43.130
This is 1848.
These has real death.
These are ordinary people.
And again,

574
00:33:43.131 --> 00:33:47.870
look at the gray green,
uh,
the sick quarters.
But,
but this is a,

575
00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:52.430
this is an affectionate look at people who are dying for a good cause in the

576
00:33:52.431 --> 00:33:55.070
center of Paris.
But Louis Napoleon,

577
00:33:55.071 --> 00:33:57.500
Napoleon the third didn't want revolution again.

578
00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.800
And since there were barricades in so many of these revolutions,

579
00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.500
barricades begin on the day of the barricades in Paris.

580
00:34:03.501 --> 00:34:07.970
What's at 1572 or something like that before this course stokes stokes up.
Um,

581
00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:09.830
he said,
let's build the barricades,

582
00:34:09.910 --> 00:34:13.190
the boulevard so wide that you can't build barricades across them.

583
00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:19.030
In 1944 and in 1968,
uh,

584
00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:22.430
barricades were in the same places often where the revolutionary barricades had

585
00:34:22.431 --> 00:34:26.960
been in 1789 a or an 1848 or in 1871.

586
00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:32.300
Next please.
So these guys,
that's the Polian,
that guy with a pen,

587
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:37.460
that's [inaudible] who was born in Paris,
but now station parents.
Uh,

588
00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.660
um,
eh,
that's he,

589
00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:44.420
he's in the middle there and Louis Napoleon flops a map down and it says big

590
00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:49.700
bill,
big boulevards through this teaming city.
Caming used for the third time.

591
00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:53.360
He does it for three reasons.
One,
two,
three,

592
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:57.680
one to bring more air into Paris.

593
00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.700
More boulevards was sewers underneath them.

594
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:05.390
Boulevards mean better transportation,
more light.

595
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:10.700
Secondly,
he does this to increase the flow of capital.

596
00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:14.750
It's not a coincidence that department stores are built on these boulevards and

597
00:35:14.751 --> 00:35:16.130
some of the ones are still there.

598
00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:20.750
The shopkeepers not in your department serves got wiped out and they got really

599
00:35:20.751 --> 00:35:24.650
mad,
very extreme right wing voting at the end of the 19th century.

600
00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:27.920
The ones near the department stores do very,
very well.
And third,

601
00:35:27.921 --> 00:35:30.350
and he says it in his,
in his memoirs,

602
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:34.700
he builds them New Louis Napoleon,
uh,
Oswald's memoirs I'm talking about,

603
00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.830
I wants these built so you can't have barricades.

604
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:42.450
And he builds these boulevards around and through the traditional revolutionary

605
00:35:42.451 --> 00:35:46.170
areas.
And the result is lots of people pack up and they leave.
Next,

606
00:35:46.171 --> 00:35:49.170
we're going to go through the next fairly fairly quick.

607
00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:54.740
So here's Paris 1855 now a the up there are lovely let Omar Mateen there,

608
00:35:57.330 --> 00:36:01.740
which has a godawful church,
uh,
soccer record built on it after 1871,

609
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:06.500
uh,
those were annexed as suburbs in 1860.

610
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:09.720
They were inner suburbs,
uh,
next into Paris.

611
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:14.220
And so this wall here is the limit of Paris today,

612
00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:19.370
but you still have people farming and version these places,
gonadal.
Uh,

613
00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:21.750
but all of that will stop.
And by 1870,

614
00:36:21.751 --> 00:36:25.080
then this is all sort of packed with people and put one of the people were

615
00:36:25.081 --> 00:36:29.270
living in Belvita,
which is on a hill,
uh,
where people who,
uh,

616
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:33.510
many of whom were forced out of the central quarters by higher rents.

617
00:36:33.511 --> 00:36:36.990
And so they are the ones perched on dangerously from the point of view of the

618
00:36:36.991 --> 00:36:39.480
center on the periphery.
And ironically,

619
00:36:39.481 --> 00:36:42.240
as the middle class has moved further and further west,

620
00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.630
they lose their contact with ordinary people.

621
00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:47.850
And for a lot of stuff they're reading is based upon,

622
00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:51.810
they don't really see those people up there.
Maybe they walked down the hill,

623
00:36:51.811 --> 00:36:54.400
they can't afford to take the RMD,

624
00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:58.520
boost a horse drawn carriages to be servants in their houses.
But,
uh,

625
00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:02.590
these spatial things are very interesting and you find them in other cities.
Uh,

626
00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:06.540
two.
So here they take the map and they say,
let's build boulevards.

627
00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.100
And you don't have to know anything about Paris to know that there,

628
00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:13.260
there wasn't any north.
South,
north is up there southwest down toward me,

629
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.630
a thoroughfare,
and they built boulevard San Michelle Boulevard,

630
00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:17.603
[inaudible] boulevard,

631
00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:21.720
send a knee that goes up to the station of the east with the station of the

632
00:37:21.721 --> 00:37:26.090
north,
right to the left.
Uh,
the 12 up here,
uh,
you know,

633
00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:30.480
the boulevard is help create the kind of star notion.
They 12 means star.

634
00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:35.480
It looks like a star around the arc arc de Triomphe and the big grand crossing

635
00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:40.080
that I'll show you in a minute.
That gives you the west East uh,
uh,

636
00:37:40.081 --> 00:37:43.740
access as well as,
as,
as some other ones too.

637
00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:47.280
So they do a lot of building.
They knocked down a whole hill.
Uh,

638
00:37:47.281 --> 00:37:51.660
this is now where the palace of Trocadero is lots of work employing lots of

639
00:37:51.661 --> 00:37:53.610
people.
So the housing workers like them,

640
00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:58.740
1855 let's look at your,
you're walking through the gallery,

641
00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:02.800
the gallery of machines at one of these world fairs because Victoria had had

642
00:38:02.801 --> 00:38:06.270
when an 1851 lunar points got to have them too.
So he has two,

643
00:38:06.271 --> 00:38:09.870
he has one in 1855 and another one in what is at 66 or 67.

644
00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:14.100
So you're walking along here and you can look at paintings or above all,

645
00:38:14.101 --> 00:38:17.400
you could look at machines,
you can look at things that you can buy these.

646
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:19.650
That's the principle of these expositions.

647
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:23.340
Paris is on stage and that's the principle of a department store.

648
00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:28.260
You can walk through a department store and you can buy a,
you know,

649
00:38:28.261 --> 00:38:32.700
49 different kinds of shawls ranging from very cheap ones.
Two,

650
00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.950
uh,
two very expensive ones.
It's the same principle.

651
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:40.210
And so the boulevards are really an extension of,

652
00:38:40.211 --> 00:38:44.700
as my friend Philip Nord once argued and solve a lot of other people of,
uh,

653
00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:49.390
these department stores themselves and they become sort of the staging area for

654
00:38:49.391 --> 00:38:51.460
what became known as the belly pork.

655
00:38:51.461 --> 00:38:54.460
It wasn't so bad battled for people that didn't have any money because those

656
00:38:54.461 --> 00:38:59.140
were hard economic times.
And these department stores still still exist.
I mean,

657
00:38:59.141 --> 00:39:02.710
the bash VA a bit bizarre.
Lotos veto still exists in Paris.

658
00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:06.150
Beaumarchais there's a terrific book on Beaumarchais by Michael Miller on,

659
00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:08.490
on the Beaumarchais.
It's still there.
And,
and,

660
00:39:08.491 --> 00:39:12.880
and Zoloft called them the cathedrals of modernity.
And already in 1850s,

661
00:39:12.881 --> 00:39:16.520
they had singing groups,
uh,
singing Christmas carols at Christmas.
Uh,

662
00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:17.321
people would come,

663
00:39:17.321 --> 00:39:20.020
they couldn't afford to buy anything and just be part of the spectrum.

664
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:24.250
Paris became a spectacle in itself and the boulevards we're part of that.

665
00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:29.050
Um,
and this,
this,
these aren't very good prints but,
but it's called,

666
00:39:29.051 --> 00:39:31.780
this is called the,
he was so important it became to ost man.

667
00:39:31.781 --> 00:39:33.130
Something was to bulldoze it.

668
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:37.810
Maybe to Ma to Mirman something will be to drink a good bottle of coke to Rome.

669
00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:42.280
Maybe one day.
That'll be my,
I'll,
maybe I'll get a French verb.
But anyway,

670
00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:45.660
awesome.
I'm just kidding.
Oh,
smart.
Oh,
that's mine.
Oh,
it was Mondays.

671
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:48.750
That's y'all is to bulldoze something.
Um,

672
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:50.590
and so this is called the Osman his ass.

673
00:39:50.591 --> 00:39:54.160
Y'All have a neighborhood and here these people are getting the equivalent of

674
00:39:54.161 --> 00:39:57.400
about $10 forced out of their houses.
They've got their dog,

675
00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:59.980
they've got everything.
They own their look at the mattress.

676
00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:01.760
Mattress is the last thing you ever pawn.

677
00:40:01.761 --> 00:40:05.560
There's the mattress and they're leaving.
And then the next one please is,

678
00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:10.390
this is called Bozeman part too.
And here you've got your ost money and Vista.

679
00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:15.010
You've got the big boulevards with all of this.
These not then so fancy.
Uh,

680
00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:17.950
um,
uh,
you know,
railings,
balcony railings,

681
00:40:17.951 --> 00:40:20.530
the real fancy ones come later in the third republican.

682
00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:23.980
This is really a San Augustine is a hideous church or some people really like
it.

683
00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:27.570
My different Bob Herbert thinks is not bad,
the art historian,
but this,

684
00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:30.220
this is almost mine,
is that that's you know,
have a corridor,

685
00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:35.050
part two of a neighborhood.
Next please.
And you've got people building.

686
00:40:35.051 --> 00:40:37.000
That's the tour was on shock,
which is still there.

687
00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.690
A lot of these are little teeny people who were from the center part of France

688
00:40:40.691 --> 00:40:43.510
or the builders.
So everybody's aware of this building.

689
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:47.500
And then here you can say,
how are we going to get from 0.1,

690
00:40:47.501 --> 00:40:51.160
which is done by the sin,
the root of Rivoli,
which has been expanded.

691
00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.230
How do you get to this new opera?
They're building?

692
00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:56.740
Well first you tip off your friends.
So they make a lot of money on the deal,

693
00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:00.610
knowing what to sell and what to buy.
And then you take a ruler.

694
00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:03.640
You didn't have to be an architectural genius.
You draw a straight line.

695
00:41:03.641 --> 00:41:07.000
That's what I mean by imperialism of the straight line.
Next please.

696
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:10.510
You're getting to the opera and there you can see it rising up.

697
00:41:10.511 --> 00:41:11.560
Garnez were operate,

698
00:41:11.561 --> 00:41:15.940
rises up out of the smoke or the cloud of destruction.

699
00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:21.280
I'm getting carried away next please.
And there is being built.
Yeah.

700
00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:23.103
And there it is.

701
00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:26.950
You are here looking at what now is the largest concentration of pickpockets in

702
00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:28.310
the western world.
Uh,

703
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:30.700
cause there's an American Express right near there and you see all these

704
00:41:30.701 --> 00:41:32.140
Americans,
they've got their big wall says,

705
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:35.300
where's the American express deer walk right over here.
You know,

706
00:41:35.301 --> 00:41:38.810
their wallets or out of there before they hit the top stair step of the metro

707
00:41:38.811 --> 00:41:43.550
and he,
his baby's gone.
Uh,
anyway,
uh,
uh,
that's the,

708
00:41:43.551 --> 00:41:48.320
well that's,
there we go.
That,
that's the plus one dome down there.
Uh,
next please.

709
00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:53.630
And then there it is in 1900 here again,
imperialism,
a straight line there.

710
00:41:53.631 --> 00:41:56.300
You've got,
uh,
oh,
maybe I'll do a thing on a,

711
00:41:56.850 --> 00:42:00.800
I know blowing up this building here a while ago sometime.

712
00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:04.190
We'll come back to this maybe.
Um,
anyway,
there you go.

713
00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:09.710
Now here's the great crossing in the center of Paris.
This is,

714
00:42:09.711 --> 00:42:14.630
you're crossing from,
uh,
from Ila of CTA here and you're going up.

715
00:42:14.631 --> 00:42:17.030
Here's the Gao.
The less the station to the east there.

716
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:22.180
And this way you're looking down east that there's the tourist on jock and it,

717
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:23.660
but what's the only point is,

718
00:42:23.661 --> 00:42:28.580
is that they expand this down toward Santa Antoine,

719
00:42:28.581 --> 00:42:32.060
the full board San Antwan where the revolutionaries were in 1848 and where they

720
00:42:32.061 --> 00:42:36.110
were an 18th,
I in a 70,
89 and where they were in 1792 as well.

721
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:39.290
And at other times in the French revolution,
1830,
for example,

722
00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:42.080
there are down there.
So that's the big crossing point.

723
00:42:42.081 --> 00:42:46.370
Let it go on the quasi community.
Uh,
and there's the guard,
the less sex.

724
00:42:46.371 --> 00:42:47.720
When I see that station,

725
00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:51.320
it's so sad cause that's where all the people drinking champagne.

726
00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.520
When in 1914 shouting up our bear,

727
00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:59.600
just as in the hope been off in Berlin,
they were shouting,
shouting,
not poppies.

728
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:02.480
And of course they don't come back and it's so many people,
uh,

729
00:43:02.481 --> 00:43:06.730
Jews were deported from here.
If they weren't sent from the golden door to draw.

730
00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:10.940
See,
uh,
if there was on the direct line to Auschwitz or the other deaf camps,

731
00:43:10.941 --> 00:43:12.050
they went through the station,

732
00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:17.380
next arrested by French police making 40 to 1943.

733
00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:22.070
He builds layout the big market.
And I mean,

734
00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:25.960
my friend Vince and Scotty who teach us in here afterwards,
uh,
you know,
he,
he,

735
00:43:25.961 --> 00:43:27.970
he would,
he would do a better job on this.
But,

736
00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:31.130
but I do remember since I was first time I was ever in Paris,
I was,

737
00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:35.880
I was know how old it was,
a older or younger than I once was and uh,

738
00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:38.930
anyway,
than I am now or younger than everything will be or whatever the line is.

739
00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:43.340
Uh,
and I met,
I met somebody on a bus in Germany and she kindly,

740
00:43:43.341 --> 00:43:44.420
she was a sculpture,

741
00:43:44.421 --> 00:43:47.960
so she kindly invited me to stay in her apartment all and up and up.

742
00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:49.410
It wasn't a real problem.
Uh,

743
00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:52.550
but she took me down in the middle of the night to see this place and the see

744
00:43:52.551 --> 00:43:54.140
the restaurants where you could,
you know,

745
00:43:54.141 --> 00:43:57.120
where you'd see this or wealthy people eating.
And the butcher's with their,

746
00:43:57.250 --> 00:44:00.920
their smocks covered with Beaujolais and also with,
with animal blood.

747
00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:03.200
And it was really cool.
And then they tore this down.

748
00:44:03.201 --> 00:44:06.490
They tore it down to build a whole bunch of unsuccessful places and you know,

749
00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:11.120
filthy destruction of a monument.
Uh,
we need Vince here to here to do this.

750
00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:14.510
And people chained themselves to these things says,
can't you leave just one?

751
00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:17.090
So people see you.
People would know what these are like.

752
00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:20.630
Can't you leave just once and know we can make some money here.
We can get in.

753
00:44:20.631 --> 00:44:24.080
You know,
soon we'll have Mcdonald's all over the place.
You know,

754
00:44:24.081 --> 00:44:27.170
we'll make some money and they got rid of them.
None of them left.
It's a tragedy.

755
00:44:27.171 --> 00:44:30.010
But Anyway,
oh,
someone built those.
I'm not a big of a smart guy,
but if you want,

756
00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:32.320
this is right around the corner from us.
But here's a building,
uh,

757
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:34.560
with sort of more third republic.
But this,

758
00:44:34.561 --> 00:44:36.870
these are the buildings that he built along the boulevard is next.

759
00:44:36.871 --> 00:44:40.230
Please got a rocket on if you follow art history,

760
00:44:40.231 --> 00:44:42.750
you know there's everything in this painting by Chi book that shows the

761
00:44:42.751 --> 00:44:46.560
anonymity.
It's called Paris with the effect of rain.

762
00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:50.520
And it's right here on this plots,
which is where two boulevards come together.

763
00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:53.450
And that's part of the thing too,
where you got your basic middleclass,

764
00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:56.550
people that were carrying umbrellas,
they are disconnected.

765
00:44:56.790 --> 00:45:00.570
They would never say hello to each other and they're crossing this intersection

766
00:45:00.571 --> 00:45:04.590
that that becomes part of the heartbeat of urban life or something dramatic like

767
00:45:04.591 --> 00:45:06.150
that.
Next please.
Uh,

768
00:45:06.151 --> 00:45:10.890
and so you've got these boulevards and this already existed because it was where

769
00:45:10.891 --> 00:45:15.000
the walls and once Ben,
this is the boulevard.
Moma next please.

770
00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:19.800
Oh,
math.
They were suppose to be another one there.
Anyway,
no problem.
Am I scrub?

771
00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:24.510
If you are flying around over head,
you would look down here.
Here's no to dom.

772
00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:28.110
There's the all up,
up in that direction.
There's the truth of Sassal piece.

773
00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:32.250
You see the big crossing points,
the big boulevards that have been built.

774
00:45:32.251 --> 00:45:35.210
Here's the big old crossing point there,
the tourist on shock,

775
00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:37.200
Bird's eye view of all of this.

776
00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:41.970
I what I left out was a Bizarro of that was aros image of the exist from that

777
00:45:41.971 --> 00:45:45.820
same point where he painted an impression is painted.
Uh,

778
00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:49.050
because of their interest in light and her first view and all of that.

779
00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:52.080
There's a lot of important pay paintings of this.
So Renoir,
I didn't like,

780
00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:54.300
didn't like these boulevards.
You said they look up,

781
00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:56.790
they're lined up like troops at a review.

782
00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:00.450
And that's the most appropriate image of the centralization of state power.

783
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:01.950
And speaking of state power,

784
00:46:01.951 --> 00:46:06.951
what happens in the Paris commune in 1870 1870 is that he's 71 is that ordinary

785
00:46:07.021 --> 00:46:09.630
people in Paris take arms as you know,

786
00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:12.930
and they build barricades across these places.
Next please.

787
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:19.470
And then the troops of,
of the provisional government from Versailles,

788
00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:22.590
appropriately enough coming and they use the same boulevards,

789
00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:25.230
the extension of the rude Rivoli.

790
00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:30.000
They're loose and Antwan to go and gun down ordinary people.

791
00:46:30.001 --> 00:46:33.120
25,000 of them.
Welcome to the 20th century.

792
00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:37.400
In 1870 when you were guilty for whom you were a party to the moon that they

793
00:46:37.401 --> 00:46:42.270
could,
Pablo Paris,
everybody was guilty,
said a prosecuting attorney next place.

794
00:46:42.271 --> 00:46:46.400
But the spatial aspects of this are important.
This is right.
That's Madeleine.

795
00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:47.730
It's just a lot of destruction.

796
00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:54.450
Here's money watching or his depiction of a woman,
women being shot.

797
00:46:54.451 --> 00:46:58.140
There were these images that are rumors that women incendiaries we're burning

798
00:46:58.141 --> 00:46:59.520
down property,

799
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:03.810
the wealthy buildings of the property that they petro lose the female

800
00:47:03.811 --> 00:47:08.400
incendiaries and Manet did one and sorted Kobe.
Uh,
next please.

801
00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.400
And finally,
that's real death.

802
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:16.500
Those are a rather small people in tiny caskets have just been mowed down

803
00:47:16.501 --> 00:47:20.910
because they who they,
they were,
who they were,

804
00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:24.600
uh,
that is poor and in people's Paris.

805
00:47:24.601 --> 00:47:27.930
And they systematically targeted areas like bell veal because they were

806
00:47:27.931 --> 00:47:29.650
identified with the left.

807
00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:34.180
If we could speed to these next few and then we'll be outta here next please.

808
00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:40.020
Um,
and here again,
those are the boulevards with the old gates.
Now there,

809
00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:43.360
but here,
here's what I mean by left by,
by,
by East West.

810
00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.240
And then in the north western part of Paris,

811
00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:49.570
the sort of people were moving into slightly better buildings and in the

812
00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:53.980
northeast,
uh,
more rural looking ones just on the outside,
the,
the,

813
00:47:53.981 --> 00:47:55.450
the laundry of combat.

814
00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:58.720
We know this after 1900 because there's a reference to the metro in the metro

815
00:47:58.721 --> 00:48:03.040
didn't open till 1900,
so this is probably about 1912 actually there.

816
00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:04.000
So,
uh,

817
00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:09.120
people on the periphery coming into pawn there a pawn their mattresses and

818
00:48:09.821 --> 00:48:13.510
here's the gates when you're outside again,
why all the factories on the outside,

819
00:48:13.511 --> 00:48:15.820
all the ordinary people because life was cheaper out there.

820
00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:19.630
That's why out beyond mole Parnoss or all these cafe areas that are still in

821
00:48:19.631 --> 00:48:20.231
Paris now,

822
00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:23.860
but we're ones out there because it was cheaper to be out there at the end of

823
00:48:23.861 --> 00:48:24.730
her sad,

824
00:48:24.731 --> 00:48:29.731
short drunk in life as your vez in less Hamar goes out to hook on the periphery

825
00:48:29.771 --> 00:48:33.220
on the boulevard that she gets poor in pores or allow us so well the spatial

826
00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:35.650
aware of the spacial concomitants of all of this.

827
00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:40.150
So this is what it was like passing through the barrier and it's outside that

828
00:48:40.151 --> 00:48:41.980
the red belt exists.

829
00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:45.400
It's outside of all of Vienna is a classic example.

830
00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:47.890
In the 1930s you've got the army blasting,

831
00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:53.010
firing cannons against the working class housing perched on the outside of a of

832
00:48:53.411 --> 00:48:57.450
town sire said,
uh,
one of the ministers to Louis Felipe,
those using,

833
00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:00.640
so those are those factories that you're allowing to be built on the,

834
00:49:00.641 --> 00:49:01.990
on that around Paris,

835
00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:07.020
on the outskirts will be the cord that strangles us one day and it's on the

836
00:49:07.181 --> 00:49:12.181
outskirts in these industrial suburbs that had once been producing for you of

837
00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:17.050
Cherries for the urban market and fruit.
But now were there factories,

838
00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:20.050
it's there that the communist party did so well,

839
00:49:20.051 --> 00:49:24.520
the 1920s in 1930s and even beyond it,
because they provided social services,

840
00:49:24.521 --> 00:49:25.480
they defended people,

841
00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:29.680
they'll call the [inaudible] people that they had inappropriate places to live.

842
00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:31.060
And it was so that again,

843
00:49:31.061 --> 00:49:34.930
it was what I mean by center versus periphery and the sense of not belonging to

844
00:49:34.931 --> 00:49:39.520
the center of not belonging to the center see the same thing.

845
00:49:39.521 --> 00:49:44.521
And people living in inside of American cities of not belonging to prosperity

846
00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:49.800
can allow the formation,
can contribute to formation of a cultural associate.

847
00:49:49.801 --> 00:49:54.801
T have kind of a sense of not belonging creates a sense of belonging is we are

848
00:49:54.911 --> 00:49:58.000
rejected but we too can become powerful.

849
00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:01.150
And the spatial aspects of this are terribly,
terribly important.

850
00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:05.680
And look at the riots and in the suburbs and they in a 2005 we don't have time

851
00:50:05.681 --> 00:50:08.590
to talk about that.
But that's a fascinating,
fascinating thing.

852
00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:11.320
Different people who are marginalized by the center,

853
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:15.550
large populations of North Africans and a west Africans and people from the

854
00:50:15.551 --> 00:50:20.140
Caribbean,
but use the same phenomenon.
Center periphery is there.

855
00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:22.540
And last,
and I think I've pulled it off,

856
00:50:23.290 --> 00:50:26.710
if you went westward or this is a,
a Monet,

857
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:30.020
this is one of the many regattas that on,
yeah.
You know,

858
00:50:30.021 --> 00:50:31.580
you went westward for pleasure,

859
00:50:31.581 --> 00:50:34.820
not Eastwood eastward and you went further and further.

860
00:50:34.821 --> 00:50:37.400
So the middleclass is particularly in the western part of Paris,

861
00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:41.120
plant their flag defiantly in Normandy,

862
00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:46.400
in Dover and in Angove and all of these places there.

863
00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.170
Uh,
and is there that,

864
00:50:49.171 --> 00:50:52.880
that the impression is paint the Parisian upper classes,
who,

865
00:50:52.881 --> 00:50:55.100
when you go to Deauville,
you still see all the,

866
00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:59.610
the 75 license plates in the 78 from the Paris region.
Uh,

867
00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:00.860
it's still the place.

868
00:51:00.861 --> 00:51:05.861
So there's a social geography of leisure to that develops a in Paris and as in

869
00:51:07.251 --> 00:51:08.061
these other cities.

870
00:51:08.061 --> 00:51:12.080
And it happens so remarkable in that what was not only the bourgeoise century,

871
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:14.060
not only as rebellious century,

872
00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:19.330
but above all the urban century where the way in which people lived in very

873
00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:23.510
important ways,
uh,
was transformed.
Thank you very much.

874
00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:27.980
Good luck in the midterm.
See Ya.
Next week.
You on Wednesday.
