1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:01.711
Um,

2
00:00:01.711 --> 00:00:05.160
so I guess what I'll do today is talk a little bit about the fall of communism.

3
00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:05.341
It's,

4
00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:06.450
it's hard to believe because,

5
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:07.050
uh,

6
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:07.291
you know,

7
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:08.860
all that happened and now it's already,

8
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.850
next year will be the 20th anniversary of the fall of the wall.

9
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.810
And,

10
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.991
uh,

11
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:13.181
it,

12
00:00:13.181 --> 00:00:13.650
it,

13
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.040
uh,

14
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.251
and,

15
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:16.560
and you guys were not born yet.

16
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:17.920
A few of you are,

17
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.500
some of you were born in 1990.

18
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:20.370
Is that possible?

19
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.230
Were you born in 1990 some of you in 1990 way that,

20
00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:23.340
see,

21
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.540
that's after the wall fell.

22
00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:26.790
I can remember seeing the on TV,

23
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:27.420
the,

24
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.751
you know,

25
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:31.710
the sort of quick trial is to chest cues and them being gunned down in the,

26
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.311
you know,

27
00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:34.410
in the garden behind behind their house.

28
00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:35.760
And they are really a nasty,

29
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.320
nasty pair.

30
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:37.700
But,

31
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.190
um,

32
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.710
the whole thing is now it seems like old history.

33
00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:43.680
So I want to talk a little bit about that and then talk about kind of chow

34
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.060
global challenges and,

35
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.250
and themes that we've talked about.

36
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.731
You know,

37
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:48.470
uh,

38
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.303
now we,

39
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.120
we,

40
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.150
we talk about immigration,

41
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:52.800
we talk more about globalization,

42
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:54.600
but I'll talk a little bit about that too.

43
00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:54.961
So,

44
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:55.700
um,

45
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.010
uh,

46
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.641
let's do that.

47
00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:56.911
And then,

48
00:00:56.911 --> 00:00:57.241
then,

49
00:00:57.241 --> 00:00:57.601
uh,

50
00:00:57.601 --> 00:00:58.360
then we're out.

51
00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.193
We're out of here.

52
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.143
Um,

53
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.943
so,

54
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:02.200
uh,

55
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.681
again,

56
00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:02.960
this is,

57
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.320
it seems like this is history.

58
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:04.951
Some of you here,

59
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:06.360
it's not history at all,

60
00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:10.770
is something that you all we all live through and in a way anticipated and then,

61
00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:11.550
uh,

62
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.150
uh,

63
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.050
saw developing,

64
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:13.351
I mean,

65
00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:16.380
we're in France when all that was happening and just listening on the radio and

66
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:18.840
BBC and all this stuff really quite amazing.

67
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.010
Well,

68
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.843
um,

69
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.810
the big difference,

70
00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:22.740
of course,

71
00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:24.060
that made possible,

72
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.850
uh,

73
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.500
the dramatic dramatic changes that happen in,

74
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.510
in Europe between 1990 and eastern Europe between 1989 in 1992 must begin with

75
00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:35.790
a,

76
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.440
with a guy who,

77
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.980
uh,

78
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:38.191
you know,

79
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:39.410
independent of the fact that,

80
00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:41.430
that the soil system just didn't work.

81
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.930
But with a guy who's,

82
00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:43.764
who's,

83
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.190
who's declining reputation in,

84
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.400
in Russia,

85
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:48.240
uh,

86
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.470
I find just incredible.

87
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.360
And that's Mikhail Gorbachev.

88
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.380
Um,

89
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.740
who,

90
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.980
you know,

91
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.540
it was relegated a few years ago.

92
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:55.380
He actually did.

93
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.240
And TV ad for Burger King,

94
00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.350
uh,

95
00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.741
you know,

96
00:01:58.741 --> 00:01:59.281
at that point,

97
00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:00.550
because he needed the money and,

98
00:02:00.551 --> 00:02:01.860
and his sort of fall,

99
00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:02.730
the fall of his,

100
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.210
of his image in,

101
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.661
in,

102
00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:05.220
uh,

103
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.740
uh,

104
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.301
in,

105
00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:08.280
in the former Soviet Union and Russia.

106
00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:10.710
I find that extraordinarily hard to,

107
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.560
uh,

108
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.790
uh,

109
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.321
to match.

110
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:18.321
And because it made all the difference in the world that when people in Hungary

111
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.793
and in,

112
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.180
in Czechoslovakia,

113
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.060
which then split between the Czech Republic and Slovakia,

114
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.680
uh,

115
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.740
and in Poland where,

116
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.020
and in other places,

117
00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:29.730
but mostly those three places,

118
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.180
when they began to push for reforms and they decided that they wanted to reform

119
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:38.190
communism and they didn't want even communism at all.

120
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.380
The big difference was in 1953 when there were riots in,

121
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.280
uh,

122
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.470
in Berlin and East Berlin.

123
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.191
And I,

124
00:02:47.191 --> 00:02:48.420
and I'm old enough to remember,

125
00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:48.601
you know,

126
00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:50.190
crossing the border,

127
00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:50.790
uh,

128
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.091
uh,

129
00:02:51.091 --> 00:02:53.010
the wall in East Berlin,

130
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.640
you know,

131
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.170
they were squished like grapes.

132
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.530
And in 1968 when,

133
00:02:58.531 --> 00:02:59.364
when Dube,

134
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.220
uh,

135
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.550
who ends up basically what janitorial duties after that,

136
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.200
when do cha dupe check?

137
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.220
Tried to put a human face on communism and reformed communism.

138
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.851
There were,

139
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:10.631
there were as,

140
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:12.010
as the expression goes,

141
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.840
tanks before tea time,

142
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.540
the Soviet tanks rolled in,

143
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.830
um,

144
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:18.520
and,

145
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.520
and squished them to like grapes and they had their martyrs and Wenceslaus

146
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.940
square one guy burned himself to death.

147
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:28.530
And it's still,

148
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.080
uh,

149
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.681
uh,

150
00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:30.610
in protest,

151
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:32.170
it's still a memory,

152
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:32.690
uh,

153
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:33.200
uh,

154
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.520
in bedded in the collective memory of that place.

155
00:03:36.521 --> 00:03:38.050
But there was a big difference.

156
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.311
There was a big,

157
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:44.311
big difference and that Gorbachev made clear that there wouldn't be tanks before

158
00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:45.964
tea time.

159
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.990
And when he went to Berlin and when he went to Prague and his name became a sign

160
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.110
of protest,

161
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:58.510
when they're chanting Gorbey Gorbey,

162
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.040
they're chanting for the demands of,

163
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.040
of reform in their own,

164
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:04.600
in their own states.

165
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.570
And when the various groups had been meeting off and on,

166
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:09.430
particularly in Poland and Hungary,

167
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:10.480
uh,

168
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.160
were,

169
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.650
uh,

170
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.910
were dissidents was most developed and where there was an alternate kind of

171
00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:16.540
sieve,

172
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.840
civic societies or civic space develop,

173
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.890
uh,

174
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.890
the Gore B's name had become symbolic with a possibility of change.

175
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.740
And he made clear that there weren't going to be tank sat in.

176
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.420
And at that point,

177
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:31.631
these,

178
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:33.430
these huge changes were inevitable.

179
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.890
But these changes in,

180
00:04:34.891 --> 00:04:35.170
in,

181
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.730
in,

182
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:36.100
in,

183
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.100
in eastern Europe and the former satellite states really were facilitated,

184
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:42.610
were accentuated,

185
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.000
were made inevitable by the fact that communism didn't work.

186
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:47.230
That's a lie in the Soviet Union,

187
00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:49.210
that the client lines were longer and longer.

188
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.980
There was more a concern,

189
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.960
more attention to consumer goods,

190
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.890
but also that Gorbachev was a very different leader.

191
00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.240
Gorbachev was,

192
00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.630
uh,

193
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.550
was the educated unlike Brezhnev,

194
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.580
her who was as extremely elderly,

195
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:04.600
a predecessor,

196
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.130
he could give a speech without,

197
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.700
uh,

198
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.881
you know,

199
00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:08.260
reading an off note cards.

200
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.381
Well,

201
00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:09.970
Ronald Reagan really couldn't either,

202
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.301
but,

203
00:05:10.301 --> 00:05:10.540
but,

204
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.220
uh,

205
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.620
uh,

206
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.321
Gorbachev would,

207
00:05:12.321 --> 00:05:13.330
was compelling.

208
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.260
He was smart.

209
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:15.370
He was educated.

210
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.960
He understood the system.

211
00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:19.870
He'd come up through the system and he was committed to change.

212
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.400
But until the very end,

213
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:22.870
even when they kind of kidnap him,

214
00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:23.500
not kind of,

215
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.680
they kidnapped him and he's held under house arrest in,

216
00:05:26.681 --> 00:05:27.041
in,

217
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:27.550
uh,

218
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.690
in Crimea.

219
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.050
He stuck until the end with the belief that communism could be reform and that

220
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:36.970
you could put a human face.

221
00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:38.080
Allah Dube check.

222
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.943
He didn't look to Jude.

223
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.240
Jude checked as a model,

224
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.880
but on communism and until the very end,

225
00:05:42.881 --> 00:05:43.031
I mean,

226
00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:43.151
he,

227
00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:44.530
he believed that you could have,

228
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.760
have communism that this good idea gone terribly wrong.

229
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.660
Uh,

230
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.440
that could be,

231
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.430
could be reforma.

232
00:05:51.431 --> 00:05:52.360
So he was very,

233
00:05:52.361 --> 00:05:54.190
very different than his predecessors.

234
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.690
Crew chef has often been,

235
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.340
has been underappreciated.

236
00:05:58.341 --> 00:05:58.521
I mean,

237
00:05:58.521 --> 00:05:58.940
Khrushchev,

238
00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:59.773
after all,

239
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:00.051
you know,

240
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:02.570
did come out against it against Stalinism,

241
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:03.530
uh,

242
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.230
in the famous party congress and,

243
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.411
and,

244
00:06:05.411 --> 00:06:07.250
and all of that and were crucial.

245
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.260
And Khrushchev was a very wily,

246
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.720
a guy who knew a lot about agriculture.

247
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:11.851
And,

248
00:06:11.851 --> 00:06:14.540
and in some ways it was a compelling a character,

249
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.520
but then his disappearance,

250
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.180
uh,

251
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.451
uh,

252
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:19.480
in 1964,

253
00:06:19.481 --> 00:06:20.181
isn't that when crew,

254
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:21.800
chef Louis power in 1964,

255
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.070
he was followed by a couple of really orthodox style Indians,

256
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.000
uh,

257
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.590
and Gorbachev's rise,

258
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.580
uh,

259
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.361
really,

260
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:29.870
uh,

261
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.370
must be seen in that context.

262
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.760
Uh,

263
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.240
Gorbachev was born in southern Russia in 1931.

264
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.560
He worked his way up as you had to in the Party organization,

265
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.750
or you studied law at the University of Moscow and he knew the West and

266
00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:47.240
respected many things about the west.

267
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.380
He also knew,

268
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:48.920
uh,

269
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.360
well how just devastating Stalinism had been for his own country.

270
00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:58.190
Both his grandfathers had been arrested on a false charges when he was a boy.

271
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.080
He was very talented.

272
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:01.760
He knew how to manipulate the system,

273
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.480
and he becomes a secretary of the communist central committee.

274
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:05.990
And,

275
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.260
and,

276
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.030
and like crew chef before,

277
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.450
uh,

278
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:09.110
in his,

279
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.650
uh,

280
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:10.221
origins,

281
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:11.810
he was responsible for,

282
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.831
for Soviet,

283
00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:13.430
uh,

284
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.000
uh,

285
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.720
agriculture,

286
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.710
agriculture.

287
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.020
And unlike his predecessors,

288
00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:19.310
really including crew chef,

289
00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:20.600
he was less as an a phobic.

290
00:07:20.601 --> 00:07:20.921
He did,

291
00:07:20.921 --> 00:07:23.510
he had less of this suspicion of,

292
00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:23.901
of,

293
00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:24.470
uh,

294
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.190
of non Russians in the Soviet Union was dominated by Russia.

295
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:28.790
Uh,

296
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:29.271
let us,

297
00:07:29.271 --> 00:07:29.780
uh,

298
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.350
uh,

299
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.710
uh,

300
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:31.140
leave,

301
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:31.461
uh,

302
00:07:31.461 --> 00:07:33.890
no doubt about that.

303
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:34.760
Um,

304
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.031
and,

305
00:07:35.031 --> 00:07:39.440
and so he believed that the communist dream had been destroyed by Stalin,

306
00:07:39.441 --> 00:07:40.274
Islam,

307
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:45.310
and by the rigidity of the structure and by the inability to enact serious

308
00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:48.470
economic reforms.

309
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:52.250
And the Soviet Union like the other powers,

310
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:52.850
uh,

311
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.980
had simply miserable economies,

312
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.410
miserable economic situations,

313
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:58.251
the satellite,

314
00:07:58.251 --> 00:07:59.360
the European satellites,

315
00:07:59.361 --> 00:07:59.780
uh,

316
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.430
Eastern European satellite states,

317
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:02.200
uh,

318
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.210
in many ways a victimized by unfavorable,

319
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:05.990
uh,

320
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.870
economic arrangements with the Soviet Union who exploited them.

321
00:08:08.871 --> 00:08:09.501
But nonetheless,

322
00:08:09.501 --> 00:08:09.861
they were,

323
00:08:09.861 --> 00:08:10.521
they were able to,

324
00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:10.801
to,

325
00:08:10.801 --> 00:08:11.180
uh,

326
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.500
be kept afloat by,

327
00:08:12.501 --> 00:08:13.070
uh,

328
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.670
uh,

329
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:14.151
by,

330
00:08:14.151 --> 00:08:14.760
uh,

331
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.593
um,

332
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:16.880
by the Soviet Union.

333
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.460
And so he embraces the really only two terms that are,

334
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.860
that I didn't send these out,

335
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:22.700
uh,

336
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.031
uh,

337
00:08:23.031 --> 00:08:23.410
but,

338
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:24.220
uh,

339
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:24.600
to,

340
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.401
to be remembered,

341
00:08:25.401 --> 00:08:27.500
I suppose in one is the policy of liberalization,

342
00:08:27.501 --> 00:08:32.180
which is called glasnost openness in government combined with a greater degree

343
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.280
of free expression.

344
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:36.560
He takes people who were liberals,

345
00:08:36.561 --> 00:08:38.030
who are real reformers,

346
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.500
not just party hacks.

347
00:08:39.501 --> 00:08:42.140
And it gives them positions of responsibility.

348
00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.100
Um,

349
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.180
and he realized that,

350
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:44.541
look,

351
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:46.040
if you live in northern Russia,

352
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.900
you can see finished television.

353
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.650
Uh,

354
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:48.831
you know,

355
00:08:48.831 --> 00:08:50.090
if you live in Astonia,

356
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:50.511
you know,

357
00:08:50.511 --> 00:08:50.811
you can,

358
00:08:50.811 --> 00:08:53.300
where the language is somewhat similar to,

359
00:08:53.301 --> 00:08:55.590
to finish that and most difficult to languages,

360
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:56.330
you can,

361
00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.680
you can see what's going on in these images of,

362
00:08:58.950 --> 00:08:59.340
uh,

363
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.270
as an East Berlin,

364
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:00.921
the images of,

365
00:09:00.921 --> 00:09:01.081
of,

366
00:09:01.081 --> 00:09:01.301
of,

367
00:09:01.301 --> 00:09:02.260
of West Berlin,

368
00:09:02.261 --> 00:09:02.730
and,

369
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:03.210
uh,

370
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:03.391
of,

371
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:04.620
of a different way of life.

372
00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:04.771
And,

373
00:09:04.771 --> 00:09:04.921
and,

374
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:05.181
and it's,

375
00:09:05.181 --> 00:09:09.300
you can't simply pretend that there wasn't a better way of life for many people.

376
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:10.400
Uh,

377
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:10.651
you know,

378
00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:11.520
there are lots of people in the,

379
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:11.701
in,

380
00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:15.060
in the former Soviet Union may have had their doubts within the following 10

381
00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:17.480
years about the kind of runaway bandit capitalism,

382
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.091
you know,

383
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:19.410
high crime capitalism,

384
00:09:19.411 --> 00:09:20.221
the developed in,

385
00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:20.521
in,

386
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:20.980
uh,

387
00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:21.290
in,

388
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.510
in Russia and is victimized Russia and Bulgaria in particular,

389
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:24.960
uh,

390
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.400
and other places as well.

391
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.051
But he,

392
00:09:27.051 --> 00:09:28.530
he spoke openly,

393
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.230
publicly about the failings of the system.

394
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:32.820
And that was the hush hush word.

395
00:09:32.821 --> 00:09:34.680
You didn't talk about the failings of the system.

396
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.500
You're always talking about the radiant future.

397
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.390
Remember the radiant future,

398
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.910
but the future wasn't radio.

399
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.270
There were long lines.

400
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.360
It just simply didn't work.

401
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:46.630
And he realized that,

402
00:09:46.631 --> 00:09:46.861
that,

403
00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:47.041
you know,

404
00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:49.260
if you're going to supply the cities with consumer goods,

405
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.840
you have to return to the free market.

406
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:53.400
You really have to return to the old,

407
00:09:53.401 --> 00:09:53.910
uh,

408
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:54.350
uh,

409
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:54.541
you know,

410
00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:55.860
new economic policy.

411
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:55.981
Well,

412
00:09:55.981 --> 00:09:56.260
you know,

413
00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.500
but you already know about [inaudible] and the early,

414
00:09:58.501 --> 00:09:58.860
uh,

415
00:09:58.860 --> 00:09:59.460
uh,

416
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.380
in the early 1920s.

417
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.010
Um,

418
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:02.611
and he also,

419
00:10:02.611 --> 00:10:04.320
the second is parish troika,

420
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.590
the restructuring of,

421
00:10:05.591 --> 00:10:06.870
of the whole system,

422
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:07.470
uh,

423
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:12.270
with the belief that he had that communism could remain responsible to the

424
00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:13.710
desires of,

425
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.150
of ordinary people,

426
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:17.220
of ordinary people in this,

427
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.260
in the Soviet republic.

428
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:20.460
He said,

429
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:21.450
uh,

430
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.110
and he could toss off a memorable phrases very easily.

431
00:10:25.111 --> 00:10:26.990
He was extremely bright guy.

432
00:10:26.991 --> 00:10:28.290
Still very much alive.

433
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:33.500
We need a revolution of the mind that you had to come to recommence wasn't

434
00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:34.980
whole.

435
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.450
You had to begin from,

436
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:38.700
from the beginning and reconstruct,

437
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:39.270
uh,

438
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:39.990
this,

439
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.381
uh,

440
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:45.381
this reformed communism that would be responsive to ordinary people.

441
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.441
Now,

442
00:10:46.441 --> 00:10:50.040
it didn't work out the way he thought it was going to work out.

443
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.860
The entire system collapsed.

444
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.270
Uh,

445
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.410
and three things,

446
00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.530
three things made this a possible,

447
00:10:58.531 --> 00:11:03.531
the fall of communism in the Soviet Union and in eastern and central Europe.

448
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.930
First within all of these states,

449
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:11.280
but most notably the Baltic states and where people held hands,

450
00:11:11.281 --> 00:11:14.760
they formed a human chain all the way across Lithuania,

451
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:15.833
Latvia,

452
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.740
and Estonia,

453
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:17.730
holding hands,

454
00:11:17.731 --> 00:11:22.731
a human chain across the entire Baltic region that these places had strong

455
00:11:22.801 --> 00:11:27.210
nationalist movements such as the Lithuanian movement that we discussed earlier.

456
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.530
And these continued,

457
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:29.310
uh,

458
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:29.611
but,

459
00:11:29.611 --> 00:11:30.060
but,

460
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:30.420
uh,

461
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.710
also in eastern Europe,

462
00:11:31.711 --> 00:11:33.840
particularly in Hungary,

463
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:34.770
uh,

464
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:36.810
and in Poland,

465
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:37.890
uh,

466
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:38.161
but,

467
00:11:38.161 --> 00:11:39.390
but also in Ukraine,

468
00:11:39.391 --> 00:11:39.691
remember,

469
00:11:39.691 --> 00:11:41.420
Ukraine needs a different language.

470
00:11:41.421 --> 00:11:43.080
It's a related but different language.

471
00:11:43.081 --> 00:11:44.910
There's still huge problems because so many,

472
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:45.660
uh,

473
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.250
Russian still live in Ukraine.

474
00:11:47.251 --> 00:11:47.381
And,

475
00:11:47.381 --> 00:11:47.551
and,

476
00:11:47.551 --> 00:11:47.821
and,

477
00:11:47.821 --> 00:11:50.850
and we don't have time to talk about the ethnic complexities of these region.

478
00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:51.271
I mean,

479
00:11:51.271 --> 00:11:54.040
the Russians who were left in Latvia where there were the greatest,

480
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.540
the more Russians were in Latvia than an Estonia or Lithuania.

481
00:11:58.541 --> 00:11:58.811
I mean,

482
00:11:58.811 --> 00:11:59.970
faced all sorts of,

483
00:11:59.971 --> 00:12:01.030
of discrimination.

484
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:01.420
And,

485
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.320
and this is a problem.

486
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.220
But anyway,

487
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.020
these cultural demands,

488
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:08.710
these nationalistic demands could not be placated by,

489
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:13.711
talk about a reform communism because in the Soviet Union,

490
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:14.620
uh,

491
00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.410
the idea that the republics were equal was a sheer myth.

492
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:18.880
And the idea that,

493
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:19.121
that,

494
00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:22.120
that there would be no tolerance to toleration of,

495
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:22.930
of,

496
00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:23.171
uh,

497
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:24.820
of different ways of looking at the world.

498
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:25.450
Uh,

499
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:26.283
basically,

500
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:27.130
um,

501
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:30.340
there was some showcase a stuff about the flowering of the cultures,

502
00:12:30.341 --> 00:12:31.600
but it was basically myth,

503
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:32.200
uh,

504
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.033
secondly,

505
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:33.371
uh,

506
00:12:33.371 --> 00:12:33.521
in,

507
00:12:33.521 --> 00:12:35.860
in 1989 in these countries,

508
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.200
uh,

509
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.200
amid economic crisis,

510
00:12:38.201 --> 00:12:39.270
the great horrors of,

511
00:12:39.271 --> 00:12:40.330
of deprivation,

512
00:12:40.331 --> 00:12:44.290
the long lines of people wearing thread bare coats,

513
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:44.771
uh,

514
00:12:44.771 --> 00:12:45.940
waiting for trams,

515
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:46.240
uh,

516
00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.073
that were late,

517
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:47.580
uh,

518
00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.300
a reform movement,

519
00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:53.200
a politically democratic movement emerges in all of these states.

520
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.140
Uh,

521
00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.010
in Russia.

522
00:12:55.011 --> 00:12:57.620
It was led by the Nobel prize winning physicist to Andres,

523
00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:58.150
uh,

524
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.370
uh,

525
00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:02.800
a soccer off who would help develop of all things a high hydrogen bomb.

526
00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:03.880
Um,

527
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:08.410
and then whereas the works of social needs and social needs and whose vision you

528
00:13:08.411 --> 00:13:09.244
have to celebrate,

529
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:14.350
you have to separate Solzhenitsyn's a critique of the gulag from his vision of,

530
00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:15.070
I mean,

531
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:16.870
of the return of the czar or whatever,

532
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.410
but social needs and used to run into them here in Sterling Memorial Library.

533
00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.940
He was here for a year or two,

534
00:13:21.941 --> 00:13:23.170
working in the stacks and the,

535
00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:24.221
and the collection there,

536
00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:25.960
but social needs and where's before,

537
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:26.770
uh,

538
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:27.191
his,

539
00:13:27.191 --> 00:13:27.700
his,

540
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:28.300
uh,

541
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.290
his stuff on,

542
00:13:29.291 --> 00:13:29.711
on,

543
00:13:29.711 --> 00:13:30.100
uh,

544
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.490
on the Gulag was passed from hand to hand.

545
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.911
You know,

546
00:13:33.911 --> 00:13:35.200
typescripts past,

547
00:13:35.201 --> 00:13:36.760
secretly from hand to hand.

548
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:37.390
Uh,

549
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:37.691
you,

550
00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:38.650
you could suddenly,

551
00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.190
uh,

552
00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:39.700
uh,

553
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:39.821
uh,

554
00:13:39.821 --> 00:13:40.031
you,

555
00:13:40.031 --> 00:13:40.864
you could read it.

556
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:41.140
Uh,

557
00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.050
you could read the social needs and on a,

558
00:13:44.051 --> 00:13:45.280
what was the increasingly,

559
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:45.611
uh,

560
00:13:45.611 --> 00:13:47.700
no longer hidden secret of,

561
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.910
of the Gulag and what happened to people sent to the Gulag.

562
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:56.470
And so these dissidents begin to reach an increasing audience within all of

563
00:13:56.471 --> 00:13:57.161
these countries,

564
00:13:57.161 --> 00:14:00.790
with all of the Soviet republics and in the United States.

565
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.780
You know,

566
00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:02.740
Gorbachev came to,

567
00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:07.060
comes to Washington DC in the mall and he scares the hell,

568
00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:07.511
uh,

569
00:14:07.511 --> 00:14:09.040
in a country I that had,

570
00:14:09.041 --> 00:14:10.450
had political assassinations.

571
00:14:10.451 --> 00:14:14.230
You will remember this one out of those people who are supposed to protect them

572
00:14:14.231 --> 00:14:15.190
cause he leaves,

573
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:20.320
he leaves the limousine and he'd go plunges into the crowd and gives the Russian

574
00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:23.410
equivalent of a high fives and shake hands with people.

575
00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:25.240
And they were just scared to death.

576
00:14:25.241 --> 00:14:25.421
I mean,

577
00:14:25.421 --> 00:14:26.860
someone's going to blow him away.

578
00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.650
And he charms the Reagans.

579
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:30.460
Uh,

580
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.950
and of course his intellectual capacity was many times,

581
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:33.440
uh,

582
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:33.600
uh,

583
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.433
those folks.

584
00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:34.870
Uh,

585
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:35.980
but I mean he says the interest,

586
00:14:35.981 --> 00:14:36.910
I shouldn't have capacity,

587
00:14:36.911 --> 00:14:37.744
his interest,

588
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.790
but he charms people because he was at,

589
00:14:39.791 --> 00:14:42.670
he was a real live functioning,

590
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:43.180
you know,

591
00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.680
intellectual in politics,

592
00:14:44.681 --> 00:14:45.514
committed,

593
00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.910
obviously committed and putting his reputation and putting the whole,

594
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.530
the whole estate on the line.

595
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.490
And so this was the second thing.

596
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:53.930
And third,

597
00:14:53.931 --> 00:14:56.750
it was the accentuation acceleration of this political,

598
00:14:56.751 --> 00:14:56.960
I mean,

599
00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.220
of this economic crisis,

600
00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:59.990
things weren't getting better.

601
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:01.910
Poland is a great example of that.

602
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:07.180
The reason the solidarity starts in 1980 and in ship yards of Gdansk is bizarre

603
00:15:07.641 --> 00:15:08.181
to go back there.

604
00:15:08.181 --> 00:15:09.110
They're probably going to close.

605
00:15:09.111 --> 00:15:11.150
There's a huge pictures of the pope all over the place,

606
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:14.180
but it's still as a site of memory.

607
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:14.841
Uh,

608
00:15:14.841 --> 00:15:16.160
when you go to Gdansk,

609
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:16.671
uh,

610
00:15:16.671 --> 00:15:21.410
and the reason that solidarity starts with Lech Walesa and not just alone in my

611
00:15:21.411 --> 00:15:26.330
friends in Poland who are a little bit younger than [inaudible] and lots of

612
00:15:26.331 --> 00:15:26.871
other people,

613
00:15:26.871 --> 00:15:30.590
is because there wasn't enough to eat you in a terrible situation.

614
00:15:30.591 --> 00:15:31.660
So they unionized.

615
00:15:31.661 --> 00:15:31.871
I said,

616
00:15:31.871 --> 00:15:35.450
we're going to put forth our claims like unions had done in France and in Italy

617
00:15:35.451 --> 00:15:36.920
and in Spain and other places.

618
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:37.940
Uh,

619
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:38.410
and they,

620
00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:41.840
or as people had wanted to do when the early days of the Soviet regime and they

621
00:15:41.841 --> 00:15:43.220
had been squished like grapes.

622
00:15:43.221 --> 00:15:44.810
Everybody's been squished like grapes,

623
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:49.280
but it be the economic crisis makes these three things merge.

624
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:52.510
National Democratic nationalists,

625
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.690
democratic reform,

626
00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.210
and the desire for economic change.

627
00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:02.200
And so you've got this charming man who it takes big time decisions.

628
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:03.350
I,

629
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:04.190
lots of Jews,

630
00:16:04.191 --> 00:16:04.641
for example,

631
00:16:04.641 --> 00:16:08.600
wanting to leave the Soviet Union and they were victimized by antisemitism

632
00:16:08.601 --> 00:16:09.434
there.

633
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:10.130
Uh,

634
00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:12.440
they were often treated as second class citizens.

635
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:13.610
And Gorbachev says,

636
00:16:13.611 --> 00:16:13.931
finally,

637
00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:14.121
he says,

638
00:16:14.121 --> 00:16:14.451
yes,

639
00:16:14.451 --> 00:16:15.171
you can immigrate,

640
00:16:15.171 --> 00:16:16.004
you can go to Israel,

641
00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:16.910
United States.

642
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:18.920
And so things change.

643
00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.250
There's palpable change and people have a sense of,

644
00:16:21.251 --> 00:16:23.180
of that what's going to happen,

645
00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:23.870
uh,

646
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:24.111
that,

647
00:16:24.111 --> 00:16:25.430
that new things are,

648
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.120
uh,

649
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:26.960
going to,

650
00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:27.530
uh,

651
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:28.490
going to occur.

652
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:33.230
And the speed with which this happened took a western leaders by surprise.

653
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.260
They weren't not Satcher that's a good example.

654
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:36.860
I mean,

655
00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:37.161
they,

656
00:16:37.161 --> 00:16:37.670
they,

657
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:40.980
they were not ready for the speed of,

658
00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:42.410
of which these,

659
00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.190
uh,

660
00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:43.930
uh,

661
00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:44.081
the,

662
00:16:44.081 --> 00:16:44.270
the,

663
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:44.751
these,

664
00:16:44.751 --> 00:16:46.760
these changes were coming.

665
00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.390
And so when people are shouting Gorbey Gorbey Gorbey,

666
00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:51.110
uh,

667
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:52.200
the subtext is,

668
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:55.790
is that we want the reforms in Hungary,

669
00:16:55.791 --> 00:16:56.541
in Poland,

670
00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:56.990
uh,

671
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.560
uh,

672
00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.050
in,

673
00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:58.700
uh,

674
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.370
in checklist Slovakia and in other countries as well.

675
00:17:01.371 --> 00:17:04.700
But the movements were much smaller in Bulgaria or in Romania,

676
00:17:04.701 --> 00:17:06.320
which was under the police state of,

677
00:17:06.321 --> 00:17:10.130
of chess queue in the same situation in Albania,

678
00:17:10.131 --> 00:17:12.650
that kind of the cult of whole Chai who was very tied to the,

679
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:13.820
to the,

680
00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:14.360
uh,

681
00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.020
to,

682
00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:15.321
to,

683
00:17:15.321 --> 00:17:16.490
to communist China,

684
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:16.980
uh,

685
00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:17.691
et Cetera,

686
00:17:17.691 --> 00:17:18.524
et cetera.

687
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:22.170
And He makes clear in straws book,

688
00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.040
in a speech to the Council of Europe.

689
00:17:25.041 --> 00:17:26.600
And in July,

690
00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.750
1989 that he rejects the Brezhnev doctrine.

691
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:30.670
Uh,

692
00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:31.100
you know,

693
00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.720
his predecessor Leonid Brezhnev,

694
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:37.830
that the Soviet Union as a 1953 and as of 1968 or 1956 in hunger.

695
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.060
I remember when it was a really little kid.

696
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.021
I remember,

697
00:17:42.021 --> 00:17:42.201
you know,

698
00:17:42.201 --> 00:17:43.034
Hungarian,

699
00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:43.580
uh,

700
00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:43.820
uh,

701
00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.010
children who've been lucky enough to escape the,

702
00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:46.590
uh,

703
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:47.150
uh,

704
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:48.230
the revolution,

705
00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:48.590
uh,

706
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.470
coming to Ainsworth's school and in Portland,

707
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.313
Portland,

708
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:53.430
Oregon.

709
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.971
He said,

710
00:17:53.971 --> 00:17:57.420
any interference in domestic affairs and any attempts to restrict the

711
00:17:57.421 --> 00:17:58.590
sovereignty of states,

712
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:02.370
both friends and allies or any others are inadmissible.

713
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:03.660
Um,

714
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.750
and the,

715
00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:08.370
the Gorbachev says that these movements in Hungary,

716
00:18:08.371 --> 00:18:09.204
in Poland,

717
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.590
that they are inspiring.

718
00:18:10.591 --> 00:18:12.270
He found them personally,

719
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.090
personally inspiring.

720
00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.493
And so the,

721
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.011
the rest,

722
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:17.721
as they say is,

723
00:18:17.721 --> 00:18:18.021
is,

724
00:18:18.021 --> 00:18:18.390
is,

725
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:19.350
I mean it is history.

726
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:20.190
Uh,

727
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:21.550
you've all seen images of,

728
00:18:21.551 --> 00:18:22.620
of the wall,

729
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:23.251
first of,

730
00:18:23.251 --> 00:18:23.491
of,

731
00:18:23.491 --> 00:18:25.860
of young students your age,

732
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.293
your age,

733
00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.430
putting flowers into the guns of the,

734
00:18:29.431 --> 00:18:32.100
of the vocal who are the east German guards,

735
00:18:32.101 --> 00:18:33.450
flowers in the guns.

736
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:34.330
And then you,

737
00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:37.350
the whole goddamn thing just collapses this.

738
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.510
Suddenly people are pouring over the wall.

739
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:40.200
Uh,

740
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.580
people on trains are,

741
00:18:41.581 --> 00:18:42.080
are,

742
00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:42.420
are,

743
00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:42.930
uh,

744
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:43.250
uh,

745
00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.430
and the East German government.

746
00:18:44.431 --> 00:18:45.720
Hanukkah was one of the very,

747
00:18:45.721 --> 00:18:47.010
very worst of all of them.

748
00:18:47.011 --> 00:18:48.950
And he's really just awful.

749
00:18:48.951 --> 00:18:49.910
And Staci,

750
00:18:49.911 --> 00:18:50.190
uh,

751
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:50.460
uh,

752
00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.050
infiltrated almost every,

753
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:52.881
every organization.

754
00:18:52.881 --> 00:18:55.170
There's a great movie called the lives of others.

755
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.660
Uh,

756
00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:56.251
a great,

757
00:18:56.251 --> 00:18:57.330
great movie that I say,

758
00:18:57.331 --> 00:18:58.530
if this course went this far,

759
00:18:58.531 --> 00:19:01.570
I would recommend you see the lives of others about spying and,

760
00:19:01.571 --> 00:19:01.741
and,

761
00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:01.991
and,

762
00:19:01.991 --> 00:19:04.350
and integrity and just all sorts of things.

763
00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.040
And,

764
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:05.550
you know,

765
00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:06.570
in a hundred Acre was saying,

766
00:19:06.571 --> 00:19:07.650
give these people,

767
00:19:07.651 --> 00:19:10.650
return them to East Germany and the Hungarian say,

768
00:19:10.651 --> 00:19:10.831
no,

769
00:19:10.831 --> 00:19:12.240
we won't return them to East Germany.

770
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.860
And they start taking around the,

771
00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:14.021
the,

772
00:19:14.021 --> 00:19:16.410
the barbwire borders around their own country.

773
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.940
And the whole thing just happens like that,

774
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:19.470
you know,

775
00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:19.860
within,

776
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:22.230
within the Berlin Wall collapses and with a,

777
00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:22.651
you know,

778
00:19:22.651 --> 00:19:23.484
a month,

779
00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:24.350
within a month,

780
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:25.660
the [inaudible].

781
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:26.341
So for better,

782
00:19:26.341 --> 00:19:26.860
for worse,

783
00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.350
our have been gunned down in,

784
00:19:28.351 --> 00:19:28.681
in,

785
00:19:28.681 --> 00:19:29.130
uh,

786
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.250
in a garden after a very hasty televised,

787
00:19:32.251 --> 00:19:32.720
uh,

788
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:32.930
uh,

789
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:33.320
trauma.

790
00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:33.840
They're very big,

791
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.621
very bad people.

792
00:19:34.621 --> 00:19:35.371
There's no doubt about it,

793
00:19:35.371 --> 00:19:35.620
but they,

794
00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.050
there was no due process but that,

795
00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:37.321
but,

796
00:19:37.321 --> 00:19:37.860
uh,

797
00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:38.490
um,

798
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:38.611
uh,

799
00:19:38.611 --> 00:19:39.630
that was the end of that.

800
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.690
And Honecker whose slogan was always forward,

801
00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:43.860
never backward.

802
00:19:43.861 --> 00:19:44.041
I mean,

803
00:19:44.041 --> 00:19:44.731
until the very end,

804
00:19:44.731 --> 00:19:44.941
he was,

805
00:19:44.941 --> 00:19:45.420
he was,

806
00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:46.710
he was in the Czech leaders,

807
00:19:46.711 --> 00:19:47.610
very much the same.

808
00:19:47.611 --> 00:19:47.781
And,

809
00:19:47.781 --> 00:19:48.011
and the,

810
00:19:48.011 --> 00:19:51.820
and a Bulgarian and Romanian leaders in Albanian leaders way,

811
00:19:51.821 --> 00:19:53.080
Albania is a case of part.

812
00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:53.700
Uh,

813
00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:53.971
we're,

814
00:19:53.971 --> 00:19:55.440
we're going to hold the,

815
00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:56.850
keeps the whole thing,

816
00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:57.670
uh,

817
00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:57.860
uh,

818
00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:58.693
alive.

819
00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.220
Uh,

820
00:19:59.220 --> 00:19:59.371
the,

821
00:19:59.371 --> 00:20:01.440
the whole communist system was going to,

822
00:20:01.441 --> 00:20:01.890
um,

823
00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:02.140
uh,

824
00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:02.850
uh,

825
00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:04.050
going to survive,

826
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.250
uh,

827
00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:05.761
no matter what.

828
00:20:05.761 --> 00:20:06.930
And of course it didn't work out that way.

829
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:08.281
And checklists.

830
00:20:08.281 --> 00:20:09.114
EVOC Kia,

831
00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:09.511
uh,

832
00:20:09.511 --> 00:20:11.250
the group of writers and intellectuals,

833
00:20:11.251 --> 00:20:11.820
so don't,

834
00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:12.530
don't,

835
00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:13.350
uh,

836
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.800
um,

837
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.633
Havo,

838
00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:15.240
uh,

839
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:15.481
you know,

840
00:20:15.481 --> 00:20:17.840
who had signed charter 77 and,

841
00:20:17.841 --> 00:20:18.171
and we're,

842
00:20:18.171 --> 00:20:18.831
we're put in,

843
00:20:18.831 --> 00:20:21.630
in jail as a result of that who demanded reform.

844
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.120
You already had in Czechoslovakia,

845
00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:24.661
uh,

846
00:20:24.661 --> 00:20:25.494
and in,

847
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:26.280
uh,

848
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.700
in Poland and in Hungary,

849
00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:32.400
you already had intellectuals who are anticommunist or who reforming communists

850
00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.680
meeting sometimes very openly.

851
00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:39.890
And so in these countries that transition to democracy or to parliamentary rule

852
00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:44.580
would be easier because the passing of the torch was easier in Czechoslovakia.

853
00:20:44.581 --> 00:20:44.971
You know,

854
00:20:44.971 --> 00:20:47.190
there were some parliamentary antecedents.

855
00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:47.860
Uh,

856
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.240
Poland also did,

857
00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.020
ah,

858
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:50.531
Hungary,

859
00:20:50.531 --> 00:20:51.071
less so,

860
00:20:51.071 --> 00:20:53.020
but you had this sort of flourishing,

861
00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:53.770
uh,

862
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:57.920
alternative civil society that had been in developing.

863
00:20:57.921 --> 00:20:59.140
And so the passing of,

864
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:00.111
of the,

865
00:21:00.111 --> 00:21:01.600
to the new generation,

866
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:05.320
despite all the economic problems and despite the ethnic tensions that would

867
00:21:05.321 --> 00:21:05.980
remain,

868
00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.950
was much easier than it would be in,

869
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:09.610
uh,

870
00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:10.090
in,

871
00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:10.780
uh,

872
00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:11.613
um,

873
00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.000
in Bulgaria for example,

874
00:21:13.001 --> 00:21:13.650
in Bulgaria,

875
00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:15.340
what the leadership does a,

876
00:21:15.341 --> 00:21:16.240
they feel cornered.

877
00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:19.930
So they tried to accentuate anti Turkish feeling cause or many Turks lived in

878
00:21:19.931 --> 00:21:20.764
Bulgaria.

879
00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:21.400
And so they,

880
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.770
lots of Turks flee and then they go to Turkey.

881
00:21:23.771 --> 00:21:24.071
In fact,

882
00:21:24.071 --> 00:21:26.560
they find the thing that things are worse in Turkey and made them go back to

883
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:27.394
Bulgaria,

884
00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:27.691
uh,

885
00:21:27.691 --> 00:21:28.540
that are in the con,

886
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:33.220
the problem of the tensions between the Romanians and the Hungarians in Romania

887
00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:38.370
helps generate change reform because outside of Bucharest,

888
00:21:38.591 --> 00:21:41.170
the big calls for reform and the organization,

889
00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:41.970
uh,

890
00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:46.970
is the work of Hungarians who are living in the Hungarian parts of Romania.

891
00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:51.400
But you have the transition to parliamentary regime.

892
00:21:51.401 --> 00:21:52.300
We much harder,

893
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:52.870
uh,

894
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:53.800
in those places.

895
00:21:53.801 --> 00:21:55.300
The case of Bulgaria is,

896
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:56.890
is particularly interesting.

897
00:21:56.891 --> 00:21:59.200
And it's also when I know the last about least about,

898
00:21:59.201 --> 00:22:00.620
because they've just had a,

899
00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:01.130
you know,

900
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:04.880
essentially the change is so slow in many ways of coming in a,

901
00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:05.330
of,

902
00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:06.230
of happening and,

903
00:22:06.231 --> 00:22:06.900
and the,

904
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:07.120
the,

905
00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.480
the kind of a bandit cessation or the kind of,

906
00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.040
uh,

907
00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:11.590
uh,

908
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:16.590
the sort of infiltration of major crime networks in Bulgaria really continued to

909
00:22:16.631 --> 00:22:17.260
run the show.

910
00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.370
And you found that to an extent,

911
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:19.360
and it's,

912
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.390
everybody knows in,

913
00:22:20.391 --> 00:22:20.891
in Russia.

914
00:22:20.891 --> 00:22:21.641
But that's another,

915
00:22:21.641 --> 00:22:22.180
uh,

916
00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:22.301
uh,

917
00:22:22.301 --> 00:22:22.600
that's,

918
00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.530
that's another case.

919
00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.780
So the velvet revolution occurs in,

920
00:22:25.781 --> 00:22:26.614
in a,

921
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:27.550
um,

922
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:27.911
uh,

923
00:22:27.911 --> 00:22:30.550
a curves and Chekhov in Texas,

924
00:22:30.551 --> 00:22:31.150
Slovakia.

925
00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:31.511
And,

926
00:22:31.511 --> 00:22:31.870
uh,

927
00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:34.150
where the entire politburo that is the ruling,

928
00:22:34.151 --> 00:22:34.510
uh,

929
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:35.050
group,

930
00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:35.530
uh,

931
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:35.651
uh,

932
00:22:35.651 --> 00:22:39.040
resigned on November 19th of 1989.

933
00:22:39.041 --> 00:22:39.281
I mean,

934
00:22:39.281 --> 00:22:40.380
this is just a matter of,

935
00:22:40.381 --> 00:22:41.080
of a,

936
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.560
a short period of time after the Berlin Wall,

937
00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.140
essentially a goes down.

938
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.221
And so,

939
00:22:48.221 --> 00:22:48.670
um,

940
00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:53.140
one of the interesting things about all of this is that it,

941
00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.630
that despite the ethnic tensions,

942
00:22:55.631 --> 00:22:57.040
huge ethnic tensions,

943
00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:57.701
uh,

944
00:22:57.701 --> 00:23:01.870
in many of these places that you didn't have the kind of awful bloodbath that

945
00:23:01.871 --> 00:23:03.580
you would have in ex Yugoslavia,

946
00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:04.600
uh,

947
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:04.800
uh,

948
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.700
which was primarily the work of the Serbs,

949
00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:07.310
uh,

950
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:08.500
in those,

951
00:23:08.501 --> 00:23:09.340
in those horrible,

952
00:23:09.341 --> 00:23:11.890
horrible wars that began a bloodletting,

953
00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:12.820
ethnic cleansing,

954
00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:13.990
mass murder,

955
00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:14.760
uh,

956
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:15.080
eh,

957
00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.480
is a less fancy way of,

958
00:23:16.481 --> 00:23:18.280
of putting a thin ethnic cleansing,

959
00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.060
uh,

960
00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:19.350
uh,

961
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.720
that,

962
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.050
that,

963
00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:20.231
uh,

964
00:23:20.231 --> 00:23:21.040
for example,

965
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.280
where there you'd all these tensions between poles and Ukraine because the parts

966
00:23:24.281 --> 00:23:27.130
of eastern Poland had passed back and forth.

967
00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:27.321
And,

968
00:23:27.321 --> 00:23:27.611
and,

969
00:23:27.611 --> 00:23:27.911
and,

970
00:23:27.911 --> 00:23:28.270
uh,

971
00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:30.160
lots of Ukrainians live in,

972
00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:31.480
in that part of Poland.

973
00:23:31.481 --> 00:23:33.990
And lots of polls live near level often in,

974
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.150
in Ukraine.

975
00:23:35.151 --> 00:23:35.380
And,

976
00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.213
and it actually,

977
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:36.730
uh,

978
00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:37.630
you didn't have the,

979
00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:38.533
and for all of those,

980
00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:39.570
of persecution of,

981
00:23:39.571 --> 00:23:40.420
of Russians,

982
00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.090
ethnic Russians living in Latvia above all,

983
00:23:43.091 --> 00:23:45.250
but also an h in Estonia and Lithuania,

984
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.380
you'd really didn't have the kinds of massacres that happened in,

985
00:23:48.381 --> 00:23:48.681
in,

986
00:23:48.681 --> 00:23:49.190
uh,

987
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:50.000
uh,

988
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:50.331
uh,

989
00:23:50.331 --> 00:23:50.630
that,

990
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.930
that,

991
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:51.180
that,

992
00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:51.941
that happened in,

993
00:23:51.941 --> 00:23:52.261
in,

994
00:23:52.261 --> 00:23:54.200
in ex Yugoslavia.

995
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:58.170
And one of the reasons for the two reasons for that a one is because of the,

996
00:23:58.171 --> 00:24:00.230
the ethnic religious complexity,

997
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:00.741
uh,

998
00:24:00.741 --> 00:24:01.490
in that,

999
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:01.850
uh,

1000
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:05.330
the massacres were primarily perpetuated against Muslims of,

1001
00:24:05.331 --> 00:24:06.590
by Orthodox,

1002
00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:07.320
uh,

1003
00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:07.610
uh,

1004
00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:11.790
Serbs who were inspired by one of the real villains of,

1005
00:24:11.791 --> 00:24:16.280
of the last century or any century Slobodan Milosevic who died during his trial

1006
00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:17.503
in The Hague,

1007
00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.080
uh,

1008
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.460
who kept talking about a Greater Serbia to include Kosovo,

1009
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:22.580
to include everywhere else.

1010
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:23.780
And also on a more minor,

1011
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:24.711
minor scale,

1012
00:24:24.711 --> 00:24:25.544
those carried out,

1013
00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:25.910
uh,

1014
00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:26.930
by some Croatians,

1015
00:24:26.931 --> 00:24:28.280
again against Muslims,

1016
00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:28.940
uh,

1017
00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:29.630
and all that.

1018
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:30.241
So that,

1019
00:24:30.241 --> 00:24:30.711
that was,

1020
00:24:30.711 --> 00:24:31.160
uh,

1021
00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:31.521
uh,

1022
00:24:31.521 --> 00:24:31.791
you know,

1023
00:24:31.791 --> 00:24:32.190
one,

1024
00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:32.740
uh,

1025
00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.870
a major reason why you didn't have that same thing.

1026
00:24:35.871 --> 00:24:36.450
That is,

1027
00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:36.860
uh,

1028
00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.300
the religious difference.

1029
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:38.930
Uh,

1030
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.450
and secondly is that in Ukraine,

1031
00:24:41.451 --> 00:24:43.640
nobody was really talking about greater Ukraine.

1032
00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:44.600
Uh,

1033
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.500
and people in Poland,

1034
00:24:45.501 --> 00:24:47.660
we're talking about greater Poland imagining.

1035
00:24:47.661 --> 00:24:48.620
And next thing you know,

1036
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.800
anybody that they can possibly do other way Hitler had done,

1037
00:24:51.801 --> 00:24:53.020
or the way the Molossia fits,

1038
00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:54.620
Sha perpetuated his,

1039
00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:55.850
his sleazy career,

1040
00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:56.630
uh,

1041
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:57.421
as leader of,

1042
00:24:57.421 --> 00:25:01.370
of the Yugoslav and then Serb a communist party by,

1043
00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:01.970
uh,

1044
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:03.780
by giving inflammatory speeches in,

1045
00:25:03.781 --> 00:25:04.614
in Kosovo,

1046
00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.180
uh,

1047
00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:06.020
et Cetera,

1048
00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:07.523
et cetera.

1049
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:09.530
So the whole thing,

1050
00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.220
uh,

1051
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:10.490
uh,

1052
00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:11.323
classes.

1053
00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:11.840
Um,

1054
00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.010
and of course this doesn't,

1055
00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.080
this doesn't eliminate problems.

1056
00:25:15.081 --> 00:25:17.330
If you don't have a real tradition of parliamentary rural,

1057
00:25:17.331 --> 00:25:18.260
how do rule,

1058
00:25:18.261 --> 00:25:21.350
how do you suddenly have a crate parties that are viable?

1059
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:23.360
How do you create this sort of civic culture?

1060
00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.350
Uh,

1061
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.900
uh,

1062
00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.090
and know that's not very easy.

1063
00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:26.960
And also,

1064
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:27.411
uh,

1065
00:25:27.411 --> 00:25:30.260
the Americans prickly from University of Chicago Economics School,

1066
00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:30.790
uh,

1067
00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:32.330
we're giving advice and Poland saying,

1068
00:25:32.331 --> 00:25:35.480
you just need an automatic infusion of capitalism that will solve everything.

1069
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:35.751
Well,

1070
00:25:35.751 --> 00:25:36.890
that's not what happens at all.

1071
00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:37.581
If anything,

1072
00:25:37.581 --> 00:25:38.720
it increases the,

1073
00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.840
the gap between a very rare wealthy people.

1074
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:45.860
A formerly would have been party cadres and the Communist Party and very

1075
00:25:45.861 --> 00:25:47.430
ordinary people and everybody,

1076
00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.430
anyone who follows contemporary Russia now,

1077
00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.090
uh,

1078
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:50.281
you know,

1079
00:25:50.281 --> 00:25:51.021
it was all of that are,

1080
00:25:51.021 --> 00:25:52.520
and the code doesn't have a nice,

1081
00:25:52.521 --> 00:25:53.090
uh,

1082
00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:53.470
you know,

1083
00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:55.940
an aggressive go hotel and niece and all these fees,

1084
00:25:55.941 --> 00:25:56.680
I should knock them,

1085
00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.280
go have stayed there in a Yale alumni tour.

1086
00:25:58.281 --> 00:25:58.940
But anyway,

1087
00:25:58.940 --> 00:25:59.370
uh,

1088
00:25:59.370 --> 00:25:59.750
you know,

1089
00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:01.610
you find these extraordinarily wealthy,

1090
00:26:01.611 --> 00:26:03.100
a Russian billionaire,

1091
00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.650
so buying up everything and including soccer teams in,

1092
00:26:05.651 --> 00:26:06.320
in,

1093
00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:06.920
uh,

1094
00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:07.520
in,

1095
00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:07.671
uh,

1096
00:26:07.671 --> 00:26:08.390
in Russia,

1097
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.801
I mean in,

1098
00:26:08.801 --> 00:26:09.040
in,

1099
00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:09.850
in England,

1100
00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:10.160
uh,

1101
00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.630
where you still don't have,

1102
00:26:11.631 --> 00:26:12.060
um,

1103
00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:12.670
I used to be,

1104
00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:14.030
there's still people with,

1105
00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:14.211
uh,

1106
00:26:14.211 --> 00:26:16.310
not enough to eat and other problems.

1107
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:17.660
These ethnic challenges of course,

1108
00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:22.670
are nor more graphically and horribly revealed then then in the Balkans.

1109
00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:23.240
Uh,

1110
00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.860
are there other problem of,

1111
00:26:24.861 --> 00:26:25.221
of,

1112
00:26:25.221 --> 00:26:25.700
of,

1113
00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:25.881
you know,

1114
00:26:25.881 --> 00:26:28.220
all of these communist systems set above all,

1115
00:26:28.221 --> 00:26:29.990
you must have large scale industry,

1116
00:26:29.991 --> 00:26:33.250
so they start building is awfully soon out of date factories that,

1117
00:26:33.251 --> 00:26:37.040
that the crank out pollution and unimaginable levels.

1118
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:37.700
Uh,

1119
00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:38.270
and,

1120
00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:38.461
uh,

1121
00:26:38.461 --> 00:26:39.380
that one of the effects is,

1122
00:26:39.381 --> 00:26:39.801
for example,

1123
00:26:39.801 --> 00:26:41.300
the destruction of the black forest.

1124
00:26:41.301 --> 00:26:41.441
And,

1125
00:26:41.441 --> 00:26:42.010
and in,

1126
00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:42.560
uh,

1127
00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:42.651
uh,

1128
00:26:42.651 --> 00:26:43.320
in,

1129
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.010
by these clouds of pollution coming from the Czech Republic and,

1130
00:26:46.011 --> 00:26:46.580
and,

1131
00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:46.890
uh,

1132
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:47.780
to say nothing of the,

1133
00:26:47.781 --> 00:26:48.840
of the nuclear,

1134
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:49.500
uh,

1135
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:49.681
you know,

1136
00:26:49.681 --> 00:26:53.100
the fact that a lot of the Soviet nuclear installations were in Kazakhstan and

1137
00:26:53.101 --> 00:26:56.310
other places and trying to get these diffuse and the mobilized,

1138
00:26:56.311 --> 00:26:57.150
particularly when,

1139
00:26:57.151 --> 00:26:57.660
uh,

1140
00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.110
uh,

1141
00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:58.501
you know,

1142
00:26:58.501 --> 00:27:00.450
when the United States now is trying to,

1143
00:27:00.451 --> 00:27:05.451
or has been under this last regime has been trying to restart the arms race.

1144
00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:05.911
Again,

1145
00:27:05.911 --> 00:27:06.540
this is why,

1146
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:07.560
this is a personal comment,

1147
00:27:07.561 --> 00:27:07.890
but,

1148
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:08.460
uh,

1149
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.060
too bad,

1150
00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:09.450
uh,

1151
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:10.800
I were talking about how Europeans view,

1152
00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:11.360
uh,

1153
00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:11.430
uh,

1154
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:12.263
view America,

1155
00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:12.421
uh,

1156
00:27:12.421 --> 00:27:15.810
the Americans now have this idea that to put bases in Poland,

1157
00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:16.440
uh,

1158
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:20.400
and this is a terrible idea because he's basically going can be transformed into

1159
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:21.780
offensive weapons as well.

1160
00:27:21.781 --> 00:27:21.961
And,

1161
00:27:21.961 --> 00:27:22.440
and,

1162
00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:22.770
uh,

1163
00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:22.951
you know,

1164
00:27:22.951 --> 00:27:24.690
this can very well as,

1165
00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:26.170
as Putin [inaudible],

1166
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.620
you know,

1167
00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:27.220
at some times,

1168
00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:27.781
can't be trusted,

1169
00:27:27.781 --> 00:27:28.614
but nonetheless,

1170
00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:29.550
it was a vigorous,

1171
00:27:29.551 --> 00:27:31.850
aggressive Russia nationalists for better,

1172
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:32.620
for worse,

1173
00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:33.090
uh,

1174
00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:33.511
that,

1175
00:27:33.511 --> 00:27:34.181
that this could,

1176
00:27:34.181 --> 00:27:34.481
it could,

1177
00:27:34.481 --> 00:27:35.580
it could declension or,

1178
00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:36.000
you know,

1179
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.410
start again this a unclench on leash,

1180
00:27:38.411 --> 00:27:39.690
whatever we call this,

1181
00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:41.010
this arms race,

1182
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.670
uh,

1183
00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:41.971
and the,

1184
00:27:41.971 --> 00:27:43.050
and that would be awful.

1185
00:27:43.051 --> 00:27:45.240
So there's still lots of problems what will come and say,

1186
00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:45.990
ah,

1187
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:47.340
but yet every time I go to Poland,

1188
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:47.731
as I said,

1189
00:27:47.731 --> 00:27:50.100
is very frequently now and to other countries.

1190
00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:50.371
I mean,

1191
00:27:50.371 --> 00:27:55.371
there is just great hope and there wasn't a lot of hope in 1987 or 1986 and

1192
00:27:55.501 --> 00:27:56.730
suddenly it was this new,

1193
00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:58.350
incredibly transformed,

1194
00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.070
uh,

1195
00:27:59.070 --> 00:27:59.191
uh,

1196
00:27:59.191 --> 00:27:59.970
world.

1197
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:00.803
Um,

1198
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:05.340
in many places it was easier to tear down to say what you are against that you

1199
00:28:05.341 --> 00:28:09.150
didn't want this unreformed communist state or he didn't want communism at all

1200
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.000
than it was to sort of miraculously crate this,

1201
00:28:12.001 --> 00:28:12.834
this new,

1202
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:13.500
uh,

1203
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.220
a new,

1204
00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:14.431
uh,

1205
00:28:14.431 --> 00:28:15.600
a fairer world.

1206
00:28:15.601 --> 00:28:16.171
And in Warsaw,

1207
00:28:16.171 --> 00:28:17.220
I'm constantly amazed by,

1208
00:28:17.221 --> 00:28:17.431
you know,

1209
00:28:17.431 --> 00:28:17.670
the,

1210
00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:18.600
if you walk war,

1211
00:28:18.601 --> 00:28:20.100
so it was completely rebuilt when I was a kid.

1212
00:28:20.101 --> 00:28:20.881
I was there and it was,

1213
00:28:20.881 --> 00:28:21.450
uh,

1214
00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:21.661
you know,

1215
00:28:21.661 --> 00:28:22.380
you could,

1216
00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.330
all you saw was rubble basically.

1217
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:25.400
And now,

1218
00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:25.580
you know,

1219
00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:26.910
when I walk out of the Hotel Bristol,

1220
00:28:26.911 --> 00:28:28.800
a very fancy famous hotel and I turned left,

1221
00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:30.090
it looks like the shots of these eight,

1222
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:30.781
you know,

1223
00:28:30.781 --> 00:28:31.810
or the roof who,

1224
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:32.430
uh,

1225
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:32.941
San Antonio,

1226
00:28:32.941 --> 00:28:33.721
hey in Paris,

1227
00:28:33.721 --> 00:28:34.740
all these fancy shops.

1228
00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.480
And then as we go out to the university,

1229
00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:39.540
then you see all these people still wearing the same threadbare quotes,

1230
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.081
uh,

1231
00:28:40.081 --> 00:28:43.620
waiting in line for the trams as before the communist revolution.

1232
00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:45.570
But yet thing things are better.

1233
00:28:45.571 --> 00:28:46.291
One of the reasons by the way,

1234
00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:49.530
things are better in Poland is that they never did completely collectivized

1235
00:28:49.531 --> 00:28:50.400
agriculture at all.

1236
00:28:50.401 --> 00:28:51.150
That property,

1237
00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:51.890
small,

1238
00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:52.170
petite,

1239
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:52.710
appropriate tail,

1240
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:53.200
small,

1241
00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:53.700
uh,

1242
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.170
units still existed.

1243
00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:55.770
Uh,

1244
00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:56.191
uh,

1245
00:28:56.191 --> 00:28:58.590
and so the transition there was a easy,

1246
00:28:58.980 --> 00:28:59.191
uh,

1247
00:28:59.191 --> 00:29:00.450
easier than other places.

1248
00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:01.230
Well,

1249
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:01.441
I mean,

1250
00:29:01.441 --> 00:29:02.071
we can say I,

1251
00:29:02.071 --> 00:29:02.401
again,

1252
00:29:02.401 --> 00:29:05.010
this is what I'm going to say now is how Europeans view,

1253
00:29:05.011 --> 00:29:05.390
uh,

1254
00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:05.670
you know,

1255
00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:08.130
view Europe and also as kind of a European,

1256
00:29:08.131 --> 00:29:08.311
I mean,

1257
00:29:08.311 --> 00:29:09.540
how they view the United States.

1258
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:14.490
And I might certainly be tempted at the end to talk a little about that and

1259
00:29:14.491 --> 00:29:15.330
about human rights,

1260
00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:16.493
um,

1261
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:17.280
that,

1262
00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:17.491
you know,

1263
00:29:17.491 --> 00:29:20.280
we talk about globalization and all of that.

1264
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.820
Uh,

1265
00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:21.653
uh,

1266
00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:22.590
uh,

1267
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:26.280
Josie bovie and she was able v lives in Los Angeles for two years.

1268
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:27.840
He's actually a city guy,

1269
00:29:27.841 --> 00:29:28.191
but he,

1270
00:29:28.191 --> 00:29:28.471
he,

1271
00:29:28.471 --> 00:29:28.830
uh,

1272
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:29.940
made his reputation,

1273
00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:30.511
uh,

1274
00:29:30.511 --> 00:29:31.680
in the south of France,

1275
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:32.340
uh,

1276
00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:32.880
uh,

1277
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.460
marching and with tractors,

1278
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:36.750
a blocking,

1279
00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:37.560
uh,

1280
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.070
uh,

1281
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:40.860
French air force installations is trying to keep part of,

1282
00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:42.390
of central lowers mass.

1283
00:29:42.391 --> 00:29:45.400
He was on trial called Lars Zach from being turned into a,

1284
00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:46.090
you know,

1285
00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:47.050
for testing,

1286
00:29:47.051 --> 00:29:48.310
bomb testing and,

1287
00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:49.510
and all that business.

1288
00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:52.060
And then he took his campaign against Mcdonald's.

1289
00:29:52.061 --> 00:29:54.780
Mcdonald's mcdo became identified with,

1290
00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:55.280
uh,

1291
00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:55.750
uh,

1292
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.991
uh,

1293
00:29:55.991 --> 00:29:57.160
with globalization,

1294
00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.030
uh,

1295
00:29:58.030 --> 00:29:59.560
and with Americanization.

1296
00:29:59.561 --> 00:30:03.220
So the old kind of anti American sentiment among intellectuals and Josie Bovie

1297
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:05.260
is that when he came to Yale a couple of years ago,

1298
00:30:05.261 --> 00:30:06.790
Jim Scott brought him here to Yale.

1299
00:30:06.791 --> 00:30:06.861
And,

1300
00:30:06.861 --> 00:30:09.640
and actually my daughter took them to Rudy's.

1301
00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.301
It's what she did.

1302
00:30:10.301 --> 00:30:11.020
But what they,

1303
00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:11.470
uh,

1304
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:11.860
you know,

1305
00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:12.340
uh,

1306
00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.300
when he came here,

1307
00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:15.970
he w he came here as sort of a symbol of,

1308
00:30:15.971 --> 00:30:16.540
uh,

1309
00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:16.901
uh,

1310
00:30:16.901 --> 00:30:18.450
of antiglobalization.

1311
00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:18.821
And you see,

1312
00:30:18.821 --> 00:30:19.091
all of,

1313
00:30:19.091 --> 00:30:20.520
you seen the images of people in,

1314
00:30:20.521 --> 00:30:20.820
in,

1315
00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:21.160
uh,

1316
00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:25.060
Seattle throwing themselves against the police or against the knees against

1317
00:30:25.061 --> 00:30:28.720
police barricades or in Nice or in Italy as well.

1318
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.670
And globalization is sort of a catchall.

1319
00:30:30.671 --> 00:30:32.770
But if you don't believe that we live in a more global society,

1320
00:30:32.771 --> 00:30:36.820
look at the impact of the economic crisis and how quickly that spread,

1321
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.210
uh,

1322
00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:39.040
within the last two months.

1323
00:30:39.041 --> 00:30:39.311
I mean,

1324
00:30:39.311 --> 00:30:39.520
we are,

1325
00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.830
it's an obvious thing that we live in a world where,

1326
00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:42.281
you know,

1327
00:30:42.281 --> 00:30:47.281
Adidas and all these other shoes and shorts and t shirts or are often outsourced

1328
00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:48.970
to two extremely,

1329
00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.100
the poorest people that can find in Indonesia,

1330
00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:51.730
uh,

1331
00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:52.780
and other places.

1332
00:30:52.781 --> 00:30:53.860
And when you get your phone,

1333
00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:54.430
uh,

1334
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:55.660
have some problem with your cell phone.

1335
00:30:55.661 --> 00:30:56.860
I still don't have a cell phone or whatever,

1336
00:30:56.861 --> 00:30:57.011
but,

1337
00:30:57.011 --> 00:30:57.251
but,

1338
00:30:57.251 --> 00:30:57.640
uh,

1339
00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:57.821
you know,

1340
00:30:57.821 --> 00:31:01.270
you're after you'll be ended up talking to somebody in India or Pakistan is as,

1341
00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:03.640
as easily are as you are talking to somebody,

1342
00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:04.101
uh,

1343
00:31:04.101 --> 00:31:04.690
in,

1344
00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:04.811
uh,

1345
00:31:04.811 --> 00:31:05.644
New Jersey.

1346
00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:06.250
Um,

1347
00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:08.560
and so one aspect of,

1348
00:31:08.561 --> 00:31:13.561
of globalization that is so much more visible now than even 15 years ago.

1349
00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:14.800
Uh,

1350
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.060
and which fits exactly in the,

1351
00:31:16.061 --> 00:31:17.020
one of the themes of this course,

1352
00:31:17.021 --> 00:31:17.381
of course,

1353
00:31:17.381 --> 00:31:18.310
obviously immigration,

1354
00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:19.210
uh,

1355
00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:21.040
that there are no borders anymore.

1356
00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:21.580
Uh,

1357
00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:25.630
the creation of the European Union for better or for worse means that you can go

1358
00:31:25.631 --> 00:31:30.631
from essentially from Calais all the way to Lithuania and never have your id

1359
00:31:31.391 --> 00:31:31.900
check.

1360
00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.270
Not once I travel on my French id there.

1361
00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:35.650
It's only in England and in,

1362
00:31:35.651 --> 00:31:35.981
in,

1363
00:31:35.981 --> 00:31:36.550
uh,

1364
00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:37.120
uh,

1365
00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.550
coming back to United States that you need a passport at all.

1366
00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:44.050
But the result is you've got all of these immigrants and you've all seen

1367
00:31:44.051 --> 00:31:44.691
pictures of,

1368
00:31:44.691 --> 00:31:46.390
of bodies bobbing in the,

1369
00:31:46.391 --> 00:31:51.391
in the sea of Moroccans and people from Mali or Tunisia or Senegal trying to get

1370
00:31:53.681 --> 00:31:54.371
into Spain.

1371
00:31:54.371 --> 00:31:56.500
Because once you got into Spain who essentially made it,

1372
00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:57.483
got it made,

1373
00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:57.940
uh,

1374
00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.580
the same passages that Spanish refugees fled,

1375
00:32:00.581 --> 00:32:01.710
Franco's terror,

1376
00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:02.170
uh,

1377
00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:03.310
during and after this,

1378
00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:03.850
the,

1379
00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:04.350
uh,

1380
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:04.531
the,

1381
00:32:04.531 --> 00:32:05.860
the Spanish civil war,

1382
00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:06.191
uh,

1383
00:32:06.191 --> 00:32:08.890
bring people from Mali into France.

1384
00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:09.610
Uh,

1385
00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:14.610
and of course a female and male sex trafficking from Moldavia in particular from

1386
00:32:15.701 --> 00:32:17.920
Bulgaria and from Albania.

1387
00:32:17.921 --> 00:32:21.580
Those are the three major points is something that's just just everywhere.

1388
00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:25.180
And one of the immigrants are not new.

1389
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:25.960
Uh,

1390
00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.160
in the 1960s,

1391
00:32:27.161 --> 00:32:28.620
these governments said pleased.

1392
00:32:28.621 --> 00:32:29.021
They would put,

1393
00:32:29.021 --> 00:32:29.711
they put up a science,

1394
00:32:29.711 --> 00:32:31.750
please come to work in France,

1395
00:32:31.751 --> 00:32:32.890
come to work in Germany,

1396
00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:33.550
uh,

1397
00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:34.840
in Istanbul have and the,

1398
00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.520
so many Turks went to Germany.

1399
00:32:36.521 --> 00:32:37.354
And then all of a sudden,

1400
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:37.720
you know,

1401
00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.740
when the bottom of the economy out,

1402
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:40.131
uh,

1403
00:32:40.131 --> 00:32:40.431
with,

1404
00:32:40.431 --> 00:32:40.820
uh,

1405
00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:41.440
uh,

1406
00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:41.770
eh,

1407
00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:44.570
the Arab oil embargo in 1973,

1408
00:32:44.571 --> 00:32:45.590
1974,

1409
00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:49.340
then some of these people who helped make the economy run and who still help

1410
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:50.510
make the economy run,

1411
00:32:50.511 --> 00:32:51.344
there's a whole,

1412
00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:51.710
you know,

1413
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:52.131
whole,

1414
00:32:52.131 --> 00:32:52.640
uh,

1415
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.061
uh,

1416
00:32:53.061 --> 00:32:54.470
underground economy and,

1417
00:32:54.471 --> 00:32:54.551
and,

1418
00:32:54.551 --> 00:32:56.830
and do jobs at lots of other people then suddenly said,

1419
00:32:56.831 --> 00:32:57.664
we don't want them.

1420
00:32:58.010 --> 00:32:59.000
And one of the risks,

1421
00:32:59.240 --> 00:32:59.660
uh,

1422
00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.660
that's an obvious grist to anyone who studied in Germany in the 1920s and

1423
00:33:02.661 --> 00:33:03.021
thirties,

1424
00:33:03.021 --> 00:33:03.854
which you have,

1425
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:08.390
is that economic crisis causes people to escape goat and just stereotyping the

1426
00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:09.290
scapegoat.

1427
00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:12.410
And in countries like France where the godless made their pact with the devil

1428
00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:15.920
and join with the national front and an over the top,

1429
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:17.870
aggressively racist,

1430
00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:21.020
a political party whose leader was a torturer,

1431
00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:21.600
uh,

1432
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:22.310
uh,

1433
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:25.980
John [inaudible] Le Pen in Algeria and,

1434
00:33:25.981 --> 00:33:29.670
and who described the Holocaust is a minor detail of world war two,

1435
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:33.770
and who supporters are Nigga the gas he and east to who were negation as to

1436
00:33:33.771 --> 00:33:34.810
believe that there wasn't a whole,

1437
00:33:34.811 --> 00:33:35.644
the cost,

1438
00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:36.080
uh,

1439
00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:39.320
when they start their discourse becomes extremely,

1440
00:33:39.321 --> 00:33:39.831
extremely,

1441
00:33:39.831 --> 00:33:41.570
not only prevalent but acceptable,

1442
00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:44.030
then you have a problem even in Switzerland,

1443
00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:44.770
uh,

1444
00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:47.360
wi which does have a very hard to become resonant switch on,

1445
00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:49.370
which does have a large immigrant population.

1446
00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.890
You had a party of the extreme right in Denmark,

1447
00:33:51.891 --> 00:33:54.110
one of the most tolerant places one could ever imagine.

1448
00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:58.130
You had one of the most over the top and still have right wing organizations.

1449
00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:59.323
Uh,

1450
00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.920
a hider who just got himself killed in a,

1451
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.610
running his car off the road a couple of weeks ago in Austria.

1452
00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:05.540
Uh,

1453
00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:05.930
you know,

1454
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:09.470
he was unapologetic is probably a bit too strong,

1455
00:34:09.471 --> 00:34:09.621
but,

1456
00:34:09.621 --> 00:34:09.861
but he,

1457
00:34:09.861 --> 00:34:10.550
but he,

1458
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:11.090
he,

1459
00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:11.521
he,

1460
00:34:11.521 --> 00:34:14.450
I said things were much better when the Nazis were in curl the economy.

1461
00:34:14.451 --> 00:34:16.130
We didn't have all these other people around.

1462
00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:21.640
And that economic crisis and national stereotyping and racism is a recipe for

1463
00:34:21.711 --> 00:34:22.544
disaster.

1464
00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:23.090
Uh,

1465
00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:24.860
and even in countries where democracy really,

1466
00:34:24.861 --> 00:34:25.401
really works,

1467
00:34:25.401 --> 00:34:25.581
when,

1468
00:34:25.581 --> 00:34:25.731
you know,

1469
00:34:25.731 --> 00:34:25.981
again,

1470
00:34:25.981 --> 00:34:27.320
to return to the case of Poland,

1471
00:34:27.321 --> 00:34:28.154
when you have a,

1472
00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:28.700
uh,

1473
00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:30.380
you have black players being,

1474
00:34:30.381 --> 00:34:30.560
uh,

1475
00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:31.480
being taunted,

1476
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.060
uh,

1477
00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:32.670
uh,

1478
00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:33.830
in soccer games.

1479
00:34:33.831 --> 00:34:36.290
And Poland is another country's as an in Spain,

1480
00:34:36.291 --> 00:34:37.130
one of the worst,

1481
00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:37.341
uh,

1482
00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:40.790
of a kind of racist baiting a that goes on when,

1483
00:34:40.791 --> 00:34:41.080
when,

1484
00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:42.230
when these clubs play,

1485
00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:42.980
uh,

1486
00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:43.960
in France with [inaudible],

1487
00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:44.803
Sandra Ma,

1488
00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:45.350
uh,

1489
00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:46.610
that's another classic example,

1490
00:34:46.611 --> 00:34:47.270
or Latino,

1491
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:48.180
which is the Mussolini,

1492
00:34:48.181 --> 00:34:49.580
a grand granddaughter's favorite,

1493
00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:50.070
uh,

1494
00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:51.170
a party and a,

1495
00:34:51.171 --> 00:34:51.371
a,

1496
00:34:51.371 --> 00:34:52.850
a team in Italy,

1497
00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:53.870
then you've got a real problem.

1498
00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:55.430
And when it becomes acceptable,

1499
00:34:55.431 --> 00:34:56.061
and this is probably,

1500
00:34:56.061 --> 00:34:57.650
maybe some of you may consider unfair,

1501
00:34:57.651 --> 00:34:57.921
but,

1502
00:34:57.921 --> 00:34:58.310
uh,

1503
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.760
uh,

1504
00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.890
when suck cuisine president of France,

1505
00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.350
he's the son of a team of,

1506
00:35:02.351 --> 00:35:04.040
of Hungarian immigrants.

1507
00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.290
And when he borrows the language,

1508
00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:08.420
the language of racism,

1509
00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:09.880
the language of Lapel Pin,

1510
00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:10.490
uh,

1511
00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:11.990
to help put them over the top.

1512
00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.760
And when someone indiviudal Upenn has said,

1513
00:35:13.761 --> 00:35:15.350
why do you do so badly in the election?

1514
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:16.011
He said,

1515
00:35:16.011 --> 00:35:17.300
and he was right for once.

1516
00:35:17.301 --> 00:35:17.661
He said,

1517
00:35:17.661 --> 00:35:17.781
well,

1518
00:35:17.781 --> 00:35:19.340
because they said the same thing as we're saying,

1519
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:20.720
then you've got a problem,

1520
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:21.261
you know,

1521
00:35:21.261 --> 00:35:23.390
fortress Europe maybe trying to,

1522
00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:23.960
you know,

1523
00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:24.830
human rights.

1524
00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:25.963
Uh,

1525
00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:29.450
all these human rights documents give people the right to emigrate,

1526
00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:31.220
but not to immigrate.

1527
00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:32.840
And how these countries,

1528
00:35:32.841 --> 00:35:33.860
including ours,

1529
00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:37.040
treat people who are legal immigrants,

1530
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:39.240
those who were illegal immigrants,

1531
00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:39.631
uh,

1532
00:35:39.631 --> 00:35:42.870
is that a true test of the kinds of values,

1533
00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:43.530
uh,

1534
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:44.101
that,

1535
00:35:44.101 --> 00:35:44.670
uh,

1536
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:45.900
that they have?

1537
00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:48.060
And this is an obvious thing to say,

1538
00:35:48.061 --> 00:35:48.421
but this,

1539
00:35:48.421 --> 00:35:49.450
this is the next,

1540
00:35:49.451 --> 00:35:53.220
is the future of this is an ongoing problem,

1541
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:57.660
an ongoing challenge in every single European country,

1542
00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:58.740
uh,

1543
00:35:58.740 --> 00:35:59.341
that,

1544
00:35:59.341 --> 00:35:59.910
uh,

1545
00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:00.900
toleration.

1546
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:04.020
So civic harmony,

1547
00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.790
a generosity,

1548
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:06.743
caring,

1549
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:07.230
uh,

1550
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:08.250
in hard times,

1551
00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:08.880
uh,

1552
00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:11.680
is under assault in our country is not,

1553
00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:14.670
it has never been immune from that as well.

1554
00:36:14.671 --> 00:36:15.510
And this is a,

1555
00:36:15.511 --> 00:36:16.740
it's an obvious case,

1556
00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:20.070
but it's something that's going to concern people that,

1557
00:36:20.071 --> 00:36:20.360
that,

1558
00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:20.620
that,

1559
00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:20.971
that,

1560
00:36:20.971 --> 00:36:21.300
uh,

1561
00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.081
work on Europe,

1562
00:36:22.081 --> 00:36:23.340
look at the role of xenophobia,

1563
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:24.240
uh,

1564
00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:29.240
in the rise of the right in the 1920s and above all in the 1930s the same thing

1565
00:36:30.001 --> 00:36:30.990
over and over again.

1566
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:32.340
And just to end,

1567
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:32.900
you know,

1568
00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:33.733
um,

1569
00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:34.770
to end with this,

1570
00:36:34.771 --> 00:36:38.840
there's a question of human rights and one of Europeans,

1571
00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:39.360
you know,

1572
00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.580
Europeans had hard time understanding the United States.

1573
00:36:41.581 --> 00:36:43.260
They don't understand capital punishment.

1574
00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.810
They then understand why you can just pick up a gun.

1575
00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:46.380
You know,

1576
00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:47.131
you can't vote,

1577
00:36:47.131 --> 00:36:51.960
but you can buy a machine gun that at some gun gun show almost anywhere you are

1578
00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:54.510
north or South and they can't understand that.

1579
00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:58.770
But one of the other things they can understand is why in this country we have a

1580
00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:02.940
deep abiding institutionalize belief in the right to bear arms,

1581
00:37:02.941 --> 00:37:03.201
et Cetera,

1582
00:37:03.201 --> 00:37:03.630
et cetera.

1583
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:04.081
But in,

1584
00:37:04.081 --> 00:37:06.300
in civic rights are civil rights.

1585
00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:06.481
You know,

1586
00:37:06.481 --> 00:37:07.200
your,

1587
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:10.530
your rights as defined by being a member of,

1588
00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:11.200
of,

1589
00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:11.520
you know,

1590
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.540
of the state.

1591
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:17.960
But we don't have often not accepted human rights as a category and Europeans

1592
00:37:18.331 --> 00:37:20.400
are often just mystified by this.

1593
00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:23.790
Let me give you an example that you know that,

1594
00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:24.181
again,

1595
00:37:24.181 --> 00:37:25.110
this is not politics,

1596
00:37:25.111 --> 00:37:27.600
but I can't help saying this said the,

1597
00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:30.520
it's very difficult to explain to people how it,

1598
00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:35.600
how it is that a United States in the last few years finds itself on a list of

1599
00:37:37.351 --> 00:37:40.500
countries that torture not big time,

1600
00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:42.300
not Nazi Germany,

1601
00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.040
not Stalin,

1602
00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:46.590
not even the,

1603
00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:48.000
not even the level of course.

1604
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.310
Pinochet who,

1605
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:52.170
who they tried to extradite and they tried to do everything,

1606
00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:53.430
uh,

1607
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:56.670
not in the level of Molossia vets who finally was carted off to,

1608
00:37:56.671 --> 00:37:57.370
uh,

1609
00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:57.900
uh,

1610
00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.733
tribunal,

1611
00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:03.980
but the United States in the smirks of President George Bush and Cheney and

1612
00:38:04.081 --> 00:38:04.914
these people,

1613
00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:10.280
these people put us on the list of tortures and Dif,

1614
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:13.290
Guantanamo that that is an,

1615
00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:14.700
that is hurt.

1616
00:38:14.701 --> 00:38:15.421
The United States.

1617
00:38:15.421 --> 00:38:16.320
The view that people have,

1618
00:38:16.321 --> 00:38:18.420
the United States in ways that are simply unimaginable.

1619
00:38:18.421 --> 00:38:18.950
That I knew that you can,

1620
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:19.770
these people,

1621
00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:19.951
you know,

1622
00:38:19.951 --> 00:38:20.161
some,

1623
00:38:20.161 --> 00:38:21.510
there are some really bad people.

1624
00:38:21.511 --> 00:38:23.400
Other people just got so caught up in the wrong thing.

1625
00:38:23.401 --> 00:38:24.300
But even if they're bad people,

1626
00:38:24.301 --> 00:38:25.890
they'd never had charges pressed against him.

1627
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:27.360
And you see them when they're in their,

1628
00:38:27.361 --> 00:38:27.780
you know,

1629
00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:29.350
chained to the ground with their little,

1630
00:38:29.351 --> 00:38:29.850
uh,

1631
00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:30.181
uh,

1632
00:38:30.181 --> 00:38:30.361
you know,

1633
00:38:30.361 --> 00:38:33.720
orange uniforms and you see the images that they came out of the prisons are,

1634
00:38:33.721 --> 00:38:34.320
you have,

1635
00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:34.530
you know,

1636
00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:37.960
blackwater are these private contractors and gunning down civilians with

1637
00:38:37.961 --> 00:38:38.710
impunity.

1638
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:42.850
This stuff didn't use to happen in this country that even during Vietnam.

1639
00:38:42.851 --> 00:38:42.971
You know,

1640
00:38:42.971 --> 00:38:43.804
when Kelly,

1641
00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:46.870
who murdered all those people in Vietnam and you don't remember Vietnam,

1642
00:38:46.871 --> 00:38:48.610
Bob and a few others remember Vietnam,

1643
00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:49.450
but you know,

1644
00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:50.590
he went on trial.

1645
00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:52.870
But when states become involved with this,

1646
00:38:52.871 --> 00:38:54.850
with kidnapping people off the streets,

1647
00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:55.750
uh,

1648
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:56.170
you know,

1649
00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:57.003
what do they call it?

1650
00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:59.020
And it's secret plane flights,

1651
00:38:59.021 --> 00:38:59.520
uh,

1652
00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:00.060
to,

1653
00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:01.810
to England or to wherever.

1654
00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:06.910
This is what made the United States lose so much of its of its,

1655
00:39:06.911 --> 00:39:08.440
you'll have its image of,

1656
00:39:08.441 --> 00:39:10.570
it's a cla of it's respect.

1657
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:11.860
It's incredible.

1658
00:39:11.861 --> 00:39:12.011
I mean,

1659
00:39:12.011 --> 00:39:16.600
even in a place that I live with 330 people there and people are not terribly

1660
00:39:16.601 --> 00:39:17.590
politicize,

1661
00:39:17.591 --> 00:39:17.841
you know,

1662
00:39:17.841 --> 00:39:21.820
the politics are still families that are hating each other for generations.

1663
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:24.250
But there is this image of how could this happen?

1664
00:39:24.251 --> 00:39:24.791
The United States,

1665
00:39:24.791 --> 00:39:28.720
it was always the place that you wanted to go to because things were fair,

1666
00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:29.950
things were right.

1667
00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:30.500
You know,

1668
00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:31.840
I believe nobody asks me,

1669
00:39:31.841 --> 00:39:33.100
but since we're talking about the view of,

1670
00:39:33.101 --> 00:39:34.260
of Europeans,

1671
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:34.650
you know,

1672
00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:34.820
I,

1673
00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:35.381
I believe that,

1674
00:39:35.381 --> 00:39:38.230
that people like Bush and Cheney to go before the tribunal in The Hague,

1675
00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.240
if human rights is going to mean anything,

1676
00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:41.190
that,

1677
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:43.690
that because there are from the most powerful country in the world,

1678
00:39:43.691 --> 00:39:46.510
doesn't mean that they shouldn't face the same kind of standards that you all

1679
00:39:46.511 --> 00:39:47.344
believe in.

1680
00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.610
And it should be that way.

1681
00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:53.740
Verner koosh naira is a sort of moderate politician in France.

1682
00:39:53.741 --> 00:39:54.940
He's somewhat socialist,

1683
00:39:54.941 --> 00:39:55.510
but he's,

1684
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:56.680
he's in the government of,

1685
00:39:56.681 --> 00:39:57.190
uh,

1686
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.401
of,

1687
00:39:57.401 --> 00:39:58.120
of Sarcoma,

1688
00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:58.953
of Sarcozi.

1689
00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:03.760
And he was the one who helped one of the original creators of mid South San

1690
00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:03.940
Frontieres,

1691
00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:05.290
Doctors without borders,

1692
00:40:05.291 --> 00:40:05.501
you know,

1693
00:40:05.501 --> 00:40:06.370
and all these people.

1694
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.031
The French,

1695
00:40:07.031 --> 00:40:09.100
but not just French Americans and other people.

1696
00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:10.210
Many of you may do this,

1697
00:40:10.211 --> 00:40:11.230
go off and try to help.

1698
00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.540
My friend was a physician's assistant,

1699
00:40:13.541 --> 00:40:16.510
goes after Guatemala all the time to help people in Nicaragua,

1700
00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:17.430
uh,

1701
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.821
and,

1702
00:40:17.821 --> 00:40:18.940
and cush snare,

1703
00:40:18.941 --> 00:40:19.151
you know,

1704
00:40:19.151 --> 00:40:20.530
it is a really good guy.

1705
00:40:20.531 --> 00:40:21.820
And he's very pro American.

1706
00:40:21.821 --> 00:40:22.750
And he said,

1707
00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:25.390
this is chilling and ought to be chilling for you.

1708
00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:29.380
He said that the magic is done.

1709
00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:31.210
The magic is over.

1710
00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:32.171
That's exactly what he said.

1711
00:40:32.171 --> 00:40:33.130
He said it in English too.

1712
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:33.881
He said,

1713
00:40:33.881 --> 00:40:35.740
the magic is over.

1714
00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:36.790
What was the magic?

1715
00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:40.810
It was what this country rec represents to Europeans.

1716
00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:42.970
The magic is over.

1717
00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.560
And then he paused and he said,

1718
00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.630
things will never be the same again.

1719
00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:49.143
So,

1720
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:50.590
uh,

1721
00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:50.860
you know,

1722
00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:55.860
I guess just in conclusion that it's up to you to believe in human rights and

1723
00:40:56.501 --> 00:40:57.670
believe in the value of people,

1724
00:40:57.671 --> 00:41:01.450
whether they're clandestine or are legal immigrants or not.

1725
00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.310
And that human rights should be written,

1726
00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:04.070
uh,

1727
00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:05.860
on the face of this country as well.

1728
00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:09.220
And that you can return restore that match.
