1
00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:03.340
I'm ready to talk about the French revolution and it's hard to do.

2
00:00:03.341 --> 00:00:06.790
And I will leave myself about 45 minutes after I screw around at the beginning.

3
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.570
Um,
and so,
um,
um,

4
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.770
I want to to do two things.

5
00:00:14.771 --> 00:00:17.820
I want to see the revolution through the eyes of maximum,

6
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.310
then Robespierre member of the committee of public safety,

7
00:00:21.311 --> 00:00:26.140
arguably with a sour juice.
I,
it's most important member,

8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.320
uh,
Jacoba in WWE in a way.

9
00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:34.240
He incarnated a Jacobin Jacabao.
He incarnated the French revolution and I,

10
00:00:34.241 --> 00:00:39.010
and doing so I want to talk about the terror and above all what,

11
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.720
what it was that,
why was that people support it or oppose the revolution.

12
00:00:43.721 --> 00:00:48.160
And that comes down a great deal to religion as we'll see.

13
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.430
But first,
because I promised that we had,
um,
uh,
you know,

14
00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:55.900
the only live bootleg only bootleg guy album of the trial of the king,

15
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.000
I end up his execution.

16
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.530
I thought I'd play those and also the death of citizen Maha in his bathtub.
Uh,

17
00:01:02.531 --> 00:01:07.300
and to do that,
I,
I decided to bring a prop,
uh,
because this is a,

18
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.120
we're going to talk about and I don't mean I'm not making light of a,
of,

19
00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:15.400
of a instant death.
I'm just finished a book about a guy who ends up with,

20
00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:17.050
is him putting his head in the little window.

21
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.270
You knew people were smaller back in those days,

22
00:01:19.271 --> 00:01:21.910
but you really didn't imagine that they were this small.

23
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.970
Do you know what this is what?
This comes from.
This guillotine.
I,
yeah.
Massa.

24
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.750
Do you know what this is for?
Be,
you know,
I mean,

25
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.270
what magic trick.
No,
no.
I mean,
I,
this is a real,

26
00:01:37.271 --> 00:01:41.260
that hurt actually,
when I did that,
I don't write your parents,

27
00:01:41.261 --> 00:01:42.890
especially with freshman to take God,
he was running around.

28
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.630
You're waving a gay teen running,
running around the place.
There he goes again.

29
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.870
No,
it's a first.
The cars.
This is first the gars.

30
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.380
There's your idea.
You did awesome.
Ah,
no,
I don't,
don't smoke.
Don't smoke.

31
00:01:56.381 --> 00:01:58.900
Don't smoke.
Anyway,
can you put on the,
on the first one,

32
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.990
this is the trial of the King Simon.
Yeah.
Thanks to CD.

33
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.440
This is the,
this is the king.

34
00:02:05.441 --> 00:02:07.360
I'll just translate part and I'm not gonna translate the whole thing.

35
00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:09.970
It doesn't matter if you don't know French.
This is just for Ami off.

36
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.320
This is be off.

37
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.083
<v 1>Wow.</v>

38
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.730
<v 0>The,
they're putting them on trial.</v>

39
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.190
He did bad things.
Just I'll try to take part in a minute.

40
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.440
Just takes probably too much time.
But this cool.
Is this from a rock opera

41
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.440
about revolution on phone says Keith Richards live here.

42
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.843
<v 1>Keith Richards.</v>

43
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.270
<v 0>Ah,
is this too long to get to it?
Paul dies.</v>

44
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.340
Louie the,
this was his finest

45
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.530
<v 2>moment.
This is not Louis the 16th</v>

46
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.953
<v 1>Yup.</v>

47
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.080
<v 2>They're going to ask him to respond to the charges and the old boy will</v>

48
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.810
answer the act of a,
of accusation,
the indictment,

49
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.130
what you've done against the nation,
but it's nice.
Listen.

50
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.283
<v 1>Okay.</v>

51
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.800
<v 2>It's good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I should have started with the next one actually.</v>

52
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.903
No,

53
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.223
<v 1>this is it.</v>

54
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.203
Hello.

55
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.750
<v 2>Among you.
I'm looking for judges and all.
I see his accusers.</v>

56
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:12.623
I want to do the whole thing.

57
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.130
I never did this horrible thing.
Igneous thing.
Connie.

58
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.340
I never be tried my country,
which is patently false.

59
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:38.663
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

60
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.420
<v 2>Oh,
life has given me some misfortune since death doesn't frighten me at all.</v>

61
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:49.283
Yeah.

62
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.500
Do France better than me.

63
00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.303
<v 1>Oh,</v>

64
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.560
<v 2>take care of France.
Better than I could</v>

65
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.090
keep it from its own excesses.

66
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.243
<v 1>Amen.</v>

67
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.070
<v 2>Take care of my family.</v>

68
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.730
They didn't come out very well either.
Take care of my children.

69
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.430
It's only favors

70
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.790
that I really,
everyone asks you to carry out.

71
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:49.783
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

72
00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.410
<v 2>Jenny Pooley.
Abu Dr. I have nothing more to say to you.</v>

73
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.110
They're going to vote now.

74
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.293

75
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.080
Lamar.

76
00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.790
Maha.
He'll get his in a few minutes.

77
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.930
Can we get his

78
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:39.763
<v 1>two?</v>

79
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.440
<v 2>Okay,
now the execute the old guy.
Next please.</v>

80
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.920
This is the death of citizen Maha.
He meets Charlotte called day,

81
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.590
who was from Normandy and a royalist.
He's in his bathtub.

82
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.080
I won't translate everything.

83
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:17.303
<v 1>Oh,</v>

84
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.980
<v 2>citizen.
And you're coming in without knocking.
Yeah.</v>

85
00:07:32.981 --> 00:07:36.890
You're seeing citizen my house.
I'll nude in his path.
What's your name?
Charlotte.

86
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:42.200
Oh,
would you have very nice eyes come here.
Look closer.
What can I do for you?

87
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.750
I won't translate that.
Did you like them citizen?

88
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:59.420
Why you're looking so mean all of a sudden
to make you afraid.

89
00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:02.510
You bastard you.
What's the knife for?

90
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:13.500
You heard it alive.
That's it.
Okay.

91
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:22.443
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

92
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:29.030
<v 2>Cute.
Can we get the lights
please?</v>

93
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:33.090
Simon,
leave me a little

94
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:41.961
Maximilian.

95
00:08:41.961 --> 00:08:46.961
Robespierre was born on May six 1758 and a Haas beautiful town,

96
00:08:48.201 --> 00:08:50.870
destroyed more.
We're one in the north of France.

97
00:08:50.871 --> 00:08:54.710
His father was a lawyer who has a son and grandson of lawyers.

98
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.243
His father

99
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.570
<v 0>married the wealth,</v>

100
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.860
the wife or the daughter of a well do brewer and they were married a few months

101
00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:05.490
before the birth of Maximillian.
Two daughters,
one who died.

102
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.170
This was fairly normal.
Uh,

103
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:12.171
and Agusta his brother followed is his mother died giving birth to a fifth child

104
00:09:12.871 --> 00:09:16.080
who barely survived her.
The father was unstable,

105
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:20.160
always leaving home at the time of the birth of all of his children.

106
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.620
He finally died in Germany,

107
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.270
so Robespierre and never had a family cycle.

108
00:09:26.271 --> 00:09:28.320
Historians have done a lot with this,

109
00:09:28.321 --> 00:09:32.590
the family of four with left to care in the care of her maternal grandmother and

110
00:09:32.591 --> 00:09:36.780
by ants.
So essentially he was an orphan at the age of eight.

111
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.370
He felt his father's guilt about causing the death of his wife.

112
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.740
After his sister remembered after his father left,
disappeared,

113
00:09:46.741 --> 00:09:51.120
a total change came about in them forming like all other children of his age.

114
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.340
He was thoughtless and turbulent and flighty.

115
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.690
But since he became the family head,
so to speak,
by virtue of being the eldest,

116
00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.520
he's become settled
and responsible.

117
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:07.460
In laborious,
he spoke to us with the kind of gravity,
um,

118
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:11.040
which impressed us if it was to take part in our games,

119
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.140
it was in order to direct them.

120
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.700
He loved us tenderly and there were no attentions and caresses that he did not

121
00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:20.640
lavish upon us,
hence forth.

122
00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:25.641
If you buy a psycho historians a interpretation by he could only be a man of

123
00:10:26.491 --> 00:10:27.324
order.

124
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:32.510
He desperately tried to assimilate himself to the social order he both loved and

125
00:10:33.691 --> 00:10:37.980
hated his father as he adored his,
uh,
uh,
dead.

126
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:42.570
A mother,
his whole life was marked by feeling of his father's guilt,

127
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:47.280
which also represented the death in a real way of his own childhood.

128
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.530
And then his last hours,
his death wish,

129
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.700
his inability to,
uh,

130
00:10:53.701 --> 00:10:58.230
to act when he might've saved himself a can be seen,
a,
if you will,

131
00:10:58.231 --> 00:11:00.810
in that,
um,
in that context,

132
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:04.920
he was forced into a seriousness and responsibility.
He always had a passion for,

133
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.670
for solitude,
isolation.
Um,

134
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:12.900
he knew what it was to be poor.
He was an example,
sort of downward mobility,

135
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.680
if you will.
He went to school and he was really smart,
um,

136
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:21.480
supported by charitable foundations first in a Haas and then in Paris,
uh,

137
00:11:21.481 --> 00:11:25.890
at age 11 to the collage or middle schools have Louie Louie long where it became

138
00:11:25.891 --> 00:11:27.420
a star classic scholar.

139
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:32.630
He was selected among all the other pupils to read a poem that he had composed

140
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:37.890
to,
none less than the king and the Queen as they passed by high ass,

141
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:42.210
uh,
also in the north of France and champagne country.
But what it,

142
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.710
but as it was raining,
the king and the Queen ordered the driver to go on,

143
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:51.780
not stopping to listen to Robespierre little speech,
little poem,

144
00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:57.050
and indeed splashing his only good suit of clothes with mud as they draw it up.

145
00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.750
And drove off.

146
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.980
He became a lawyer getting this degree in 1780 in Paris,

147
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:06.550
a lawyer at the Parlor Mall,
uh,
uh,
of Paris.

148
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:11.700
His scholarship pass just things did in the old regime to his younger brother.

149
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:16.480
He entered prices for literary contest for literary contest that were run by the

150
00:12:16.481 --> 00:12:20.050
academy.
Um,
it once it said,
uh,

151
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.260
that he even caught sight of the great who soul,

152
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:27.010
but that seems a little unlikely,
but in myths,
uh,

153
00:12:27.011 --> 00:12:29.860
where the academy award him 400 pounds,
which was a lot of,

154
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:34.890
a lot of money and he was elected to the Academy of a Haas in law cases.

155
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:40.060
He,
he championed the poor,
the humble.
He took the side of a,

156
00:12:40.061 --> 00:12:43.780
of a man in the Abbey who had been accused by the monks have a theft when in

157
00:12:43.781 --> 00:12:47.690
fact one of the monks had done,
uh,
the ripping off.
Um,

158
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.140
he was,
uh,
he once said,
uh,
when somebody was condemned to death,

159
00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:56.590
I know very well that he is guilty,

160
00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:01.660
but I can't imagine just send someone to his own death at the beginning.

161
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:05.740
But only in the beginning,
he did not believe in capital punishment,

162
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:07.390
although arguably those who support,

163
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.240
who agree with him would say that he's support.

164
00:13:10.241 --> 00:13:15.241
He saved the revolution by mapping out a capital punishment because of his

165
00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:19.870
reputation.
I mean,
this was a classic case of a,
of a,

166
00:13:19.871 --> 00:13:24.460
of a young lawyer on the make.
He's elected to,
um,
to,

167
00:13:24.461 --> 00:13:28.870
uh,
the,
the jet,
the estates general,
uh,
from Artois.

168
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.780
He's unknown when he goes to Paris,
he's called in the,
in the,
in the minute.

169
00:13:32.781 --> 00:13:37.620
Sometimes we'll call Beth hyphen Pierre.
Sometimes,
well,
best of Pierre,
uh,

170
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:38.620
sometimes roll Bayer,

171
00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:42.090
I liked the name Roberts ps or sometimes simply you've whole bay,

172
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.680
if that was his first name and Pierre,
uh,
his second name,
but again,

173
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:51.220
to make a mark speaking always very,
uh,
softly,
um,

174
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:56.250
68 times he spoke in 1789 and he gradually gets his reputation there.

175
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.560
He opposes all restrictions on the freedom of the press,

176
00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.800
and of course that would change later as well.
Uh,

177
00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:06.550
he invokes Russo's concept of the general will,
uh,

178
00:14:06.551 --> 00:14:10.420
to support the view that the king should have no right to oppose or delay

179
00:14:10.421 --> 00:14:14.650
legislative measures proposed by the assembly.
You know,
this,
uh,

180
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.720
from your reading,
uh,

181
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:21.870
he sided on the left of the assembly with those who went to a van to bring back,

182
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.730
uh,
Louis the 16th,

183
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:28.660
when he and when we have to net try to hire high tail it to the southern

184
00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:33.340
Netherlands or that is to uh,
uh,
to Belgium.
Uh,

185
00:14:33.341 --> 00:14:37.910
that was the king by the way.
He should have been their first,
uh,

186
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:42.170
tall or am I doing here?
Okay.
That's the king.
Um,

187
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.840
there was an Aha fully clothed

188
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:53.000
and there are some Maximilian how best Pierre,

189
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:55.310
although he spoke often,

190
00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:59.360
he lacked presence and in color and this would be the case until the very end.

191
00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:03.020
The English a rider Carlisle saw him as anxious,

192
00:15:03.021 --> 00:15:06.770
slight ineffectual looking man in spectacles.
His eyes troubled,

193
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:12.040
careful with an upturn face dimly trying to understand the uncertain future

194
00:15:12.381 --> 00:15:17.120
times.
But he spoke with an intense passion and conviction,

195
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:22.220
a belief in all that.
He said,
immuno bull who died of syphilis,

196
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.370
one of the king's,
uh,
um,
uh,

197
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:29.440
main advisors said of him that man will go far because he believes every single

198
00:15:30.651 --> 00:15:32.360
thing that he says.

199
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:36.440
He seemed rigid in this principles plane unaffected in this manners.

200
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:41.390
Nothing set an Englishman of the volatility of a Frenchmen in his character.

201
00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:44.630
Uh,
he supported the idea that all citizens,

202
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.350
all male citizens should have the right to vote.

203
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:53.530
And thus he opposed the idea of having active citizens who pay taxes and passive

204
00:15:53.571 --> 00:15:58.571
citizens who did not have enough money to pay taxes and thus could not vote.

205
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.380
Um,
he calls for the,

206
00:16:00.381 --> 00:16:05.030
among others with the deposition of the kings being deposed,
um,

207
00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:08.060
both in the legal sense and being deposed from the monarchy.
Um,

208
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:13.400
he was already known as the incorruptible and he received letters of admiration

209
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:17.630
once leaving the assembly,
a crowd,
uh,
uh,
put,

210
00:16:17.631 --> 00:16:21.890
put oak leaves around him and carried him the city around the city and triumph.

211
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:26.990
He always wore impeccably white clothes and he wore a powdered wig,

212
00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.350
which was very much an old regime thing and not a revolutionary thing.

213
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:34.280
He was not somebody who's going to go out and to trois,
uh,
easily.
And,

214
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:38.960
and the revolutionaries to Twan as a form of,
of,
of that is in the familiar form,

215
00:16:38.961 --> 00:16:43.490
like do in,
in,
in German as opposed to z of that familiar form.

216
00:16:43.491 --> 00:16:44.360
All were equal,

217
00:16:44.361 --> 00:16:47.870
therefore you didn't say [inaudible] to people who are above you in the social

218
00:16:47.871 --> 00:16:52.430
ladder.
Uh,
he didn't like people touching them and indeed probably,
uh,

219
00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:55.190
he was chased a,
he had only a few,

220
00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:59.810
a flimsy and only by mail search patients,
uh,
uh,

221
00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:01.760
with women.
And when they picked him up,

222
00:17:01.761 --> 00:17:05.630
you have to imagine a sort of crassly American,
uh,
analogy,

223
00:17:05.631 --> 00:17:09.230
but a football coach who sort of swept off his feet after a big upset or

224
00:17:09.231 --> 00:17:11.750
something and,
and he,
he doesn't like people touching him.

225
00:17:11.751 --> 00:17:16.610
He doesn't like being carried away by them.
Uh,
uh,
he,
he,

226
00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.700
uh,
one of the letters and he was ascetic,

227
00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:24.620
always preferred being alone.
Uh,
eight very modestly,

228
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:27.290
one letter to him said as current as corrupted,

229
00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.110
incorruptible as you are courageous.
And he was that,
uh,

230
00:17:30.111 --> 00:17:33.930
you have always openly displayed your feelings and it's never been self

231
00:17:33.931 --> 00:17:34.400
interested,

232
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:39.400
has made you act or speak only the general interest he identified with ordinary

233
00:17:39.831 --> 00:17:42.680
people.
Um,
and uh,

234
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.370
he ends up living in western Paris,

235
00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:50.520
a more process part of Paris,
but in the home of a,
of a carpenter,
a on a,

236
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.890
on a street called the full bore Santiano Hay.

237
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.870
And those were really his happiest moments because it,
it,

238
00:17:55.871 --> 00:17:58.700
it provided them with the family.
Uh,
uh,

239
00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:02.640
they had young children in it that he really hadn't had a very normal

240
00:18:02.641 --> 00:18:04.830
circumstance and people who came to see him.

241
00:18:04.831 --> 00:18:08.490
So I'm sort of stretched out on the couch with his family,

242
00:18:08.491 --> 00:18:11.910
trying to guess from the way he looked to what he might want.

243
00:18:11.911 --> 00:18:16.650
Would he want more grapes?
What do you want more milk,
uh,
uh,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

244
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:20.340
Um,
he,
he read a lot.
He wrote his speeches,

245
00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.050
which were written out by hand.

246
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:27.350
I'm always welcomed and powdered and the cleanest of dressing gowns.

247
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:30.510
Uh,
um,
it's a et Cetera,
et cetera.

248
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:34.140
Now he began to be a frequent user of the Jacoba.
Clo.

249
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.420
Now these clubs like the fool,
y'all and Cordell,
Cordelia and the Jacoba,

250
00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:42.000
we're network called that not because had anything to do with the religious

251
00:18:42.001 --> 00:18:45.950
orders like the Jacabao,
we're religious order because the bill,

252
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:48.690
the biggest place that you could meet,
we're churches and Abby.

253
00:18:48.691 --> 00:18:50.340
So those are always the biggest buildings.

254
00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:54.840
And so there's Jacoba who are on the left of these clubs,
this begin meeting,

255
00:18:54.841 --> 00:18:59.610
right?
Even before 17,
before the busty falls on the 14th of July,

256
00:18:59.611 --> 00:19:02.100
1789,
uh,
uh,

257
00:19:02.101 --> 00:19:07.101
he begins to go to the shackle van club and the Jacoba become the great left

258
00:19:07.781 --> 00:19:11.320
wing centralizers of the revolution.
They trumpet,
uh,

259
00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:13.800
the Authority of the Parisian sans culottes.

260
00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.530
And that's a term and other French term.

261
00:19:15.531 --> 00:19:19.470
So important and why it worked its way into English encyclopedia or a dictionary

262
00:19:19.471 --> 00:19:23.010
is a song.
Culottes were those who supported the revolution.
Technically,

263
00:19:23.011 --> 00:19:26.130
if you said a saw culottes with somebody who's not wearing pants,

264
00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:26.970
where that's not what it meant,

265
00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:31.410
what it meant was not wearing fancy kind of aristocratic breaches.
Uh,

266
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:35.580
and it became a identified with a form of political behavior.

267
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.960
You could be an aristocrat and there were liberal aristocrats,
uh,

268
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.630
in a meeting in a club called the club of the 30,
uh,

269
00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:46.020
who helped push the revolution,
uh,
uh,
really toward constitutional monarchy,

270
00:19:46.021 --> 00:19:49.020
at least in,
in the beginning.
If you were against the revolution,

271
00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:52.890
you are an I stole your,
an Aristocrat.
If you were for the revolution,

272
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:57.640
you were part of the book the people.
Um,
and,
and,
and you should,

273
00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:01.560
you chose the color red because red becomes the color,
uh,
of,

274
00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.710
of the left wing interpretation of the raffle revolution.

275
00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:08.730
And you gave people kisses on both sides of the cheeks or three times depending

276
00:20:08.731 --> 00:20:11.810
on where you are.
Uh,
uh,
we're in France as a,

277
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.170
as Reckitt recognizing the solidarity you had as being a [inaudible] that as a

278
00:20:16.171 --> 00:20:20.190
male citizen or a [inaudible],
a female citizen as well.

279
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.280
The whole idea of kissing by the way is terribly important,
France,

280
00:20:23.281 --> 00:20:27.870
but that's mostly a late 19th and early 20th century thing.
Uh,

281
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.860
you know,
eat because people really kept their distance.
Whereas now,
you know,

282
00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:35.550
if you live in Paris,
you kiss twice or in the 16th,
around these monad at all.

283
00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:36.690
You really shake hands.

284
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:40.200
If you live in a Parisian suburbs off and your kiss four times if you live or

285
00:20:40.201 --> 00:20:41.850
we're leaving this live in the south of France,

286
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.030
you kiss three times in the department of the whole,

287
00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:48.580
which is bought along the dock.
If you live in Bez,
Yay,
you kiss three times.

288
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.970
If you live in [inaudible],
which is a more aristocratic city,

289
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.720
traditionally a more formal city,
there was a big university town.

290
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.260
It really rocks,
uh,
you kiss only twice.

291
00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:03.610
But this idea of kissing people on the cheeks was assigned of revolutionary

292
00:21:03.611 --> 00:21:06.580
solidarity and symbols were very,
very important.

293
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:09.960
If you carried pikes around pikes at the battle of [inaudible],

294
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.940
which you can read about is the pikes of the song culottes that stopped the

295
00:21:12.941 --> 00:21:17.620
highly professional armies of the,
uh,
the enemies of,
uh,

296
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:22.510
uh,
of the revolution.
Um,
so,
um,

297
00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:23.643
he,

298
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:28.830
he believes in the necessity of a single will.

299
00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.970
Again,
this comes out of row of,
of,
uh,

300
00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:36.090
esos idea of the general will to save the revolution against its enemies.

301
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:43.290
And he is one of the people that helps push the French revolution to,

302
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:48.460
uh,
uh,
to the left now.
And his principles were,

303
00:21:48.461 --> 00:21:51.430
were,
were,
were totally unshakeable.
He,
he,
uh,

304
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:56.200
he doesn't budge on them at all.
Uh,
and of course,
you know,

305
00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:57.480
it's,
it's,
it's clean.

306
00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.760
It's just insane to look back and see in robes prn or the origins of

307
00:22:00.761 --> 00:22:05.740
totalitarianism despite the committee of public safety.
Uh,
Robespierre,
uh,
also,

308
00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:08.710
you know,
was a man of his times.
He was not against all property.

309
00:22:08.711 --> 00:22:13.340
He was against illegal people having too much unearned property.
Uh,

310
00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:17.440
he thought everybody should have enough,
uh,
uh,
to,
to get along,

311
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.000
but that even people who didn't have any property and couldn't invest in panty

312
00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:25.600
taxes,
as I said before,
ought to have the right to vote.

313
00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:30.880
Um,
he also liked the Jocko bath,
believed that the auto have enough,
uh,
to eat.

314
00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:35.950
Uh,
and one of the tensions that one found in the French revolutionary political

315
00:22:35.951 --> 00:22:40.380
clubs and politicals societies and in the sections,
neighborhoods,

316
00:22:40.381 --> 00:22:42.120
sections,
uh,
uh,

317
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.580
they began planning how you would defend your neighborhood against foreign

318
00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:49.750
invaders or insurgents from within the price of bread of course,

319
00:22:49.751 --> 00:22:51.790
counted enormously in,
in a couple of weeks.

320
00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:55.660
I'm going to talk about what difference bread made in terms of popular protest

321
00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.780
because people who believed in the kind of free trade,
that two,

322
00:22:58.781 --> 00:23:03.040
we'll go ahead in the,
in the,
you know,
the,
in the,
uh,
18,
uh,

323
00:23:03.041 --> 00:23:07.050
seventies believe that the market audit determine the price of bread.
Uh,

324
00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.220
but there was always a tradition that,
that,

325
00:23:09.221 --> 00:23:11.620
that the price of bread ought to be kept at a reasonable amount so that

326
00:23:11.621 --> 00:23:16.380
everybody ought to have,
uh,
have,
um,
enough to eat.
And so the [inaudible],

327
00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:20.920
most of them believed in sight in,
in,
in the maximum,
the maximum,

328
00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:25.930
which was a maximum on the price of bread.
Now they're,
uh,
their enemies,

329
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:30.310
uh,
on the,
the level revolutionary left or serve left central,

330
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.310
we're called as you hone down,
which I room,
I wrote on the board.

331
00:23:33.311 --> 00:23:36.370
And a name I sent around on the class server,

332
00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:40.540
the your home down a Gir,
O,
n,
d,
I,N ,
s,

333
00:23:40.541 --> 00:23:45.340
which is also the name of the Boldo soccer team.
I were from a Boldo and,

334
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:49.850
and the department of this Yo honed many of them were,
they are merchants.

335
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:52.010
They are free trade people.

336
00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:56.810
And they also were extremely interested in launching foreign wars,

337
00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.140
uh,
to,
uh,
to,
um,

338
00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:05.780
carry liberty fraternity and,
uh,
quality,
uh,

339
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:11.000
uh,
abroad.
Now I'm scrambling for this great quote.
Uh,

340
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:15.530
the gentleman down,
we're in love with,
with war.

341
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:19.730
And there was this great kind of rhetoric about conquest and,
um,

342
00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:24.320
and caring freedom,
uh,
uh,
in quotes,
uh,
uh,
to,

343
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:28.160
uh,
to other countries though one,
one had to be,

344
00:24:28.161 --> 00:24:30.350
and many people were cynical about this when the,

345
00:24:30.351 --> 00:24:33.640
when the French troops poured into the rent into the Rhineland,
uh,

346
00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:38.090
the prostitutes of,
uh,
uh,
of,
of the Rhineland cities,
uh,

347
00:24:38.091 --> 00:24:43.040
dressed up in red,
white and blue flags,
uh,
to welcome,
uh,
their new,

348
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.830
uh,
a new clients.
Um,

349
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:49.700
Robespierre I made a series of speeches against this,

350
00:24:49.701 --> 00:24:52.010
this brie soul who was the former,
uh,

351
00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.910
a grub street writer that I mentioned before argument that France should not go

352
00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:58.880
to war.
He said that,
and more about this in a minute,

353
00:24:58.881 --> 00:25:03.430
that the danger to the revolution did not come from a hand full of emigres,
uh,

354
00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:07.340
in Germany,
but from one in France,
from the counterrevolution.

355
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.060
And that's important and that's worth underlining.
And secondly,

356
00:25:11.061 --> 00:25:15.590
he argued that launching wars all over the place when merely play into the hands

357
00:25:15.591 --> 00:25:16.221
of the king,

358
00:25:16.221 --> 00:25:19.970
who at this point was still the king and the counter revolutionaries,

359
00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:24.050
perhaps paving the way for some sort of military dictatorship.

360
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:29.000
How a forward looking was that because that's exactly what they ended up with,

361
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.580
of course,
with Napoleon.
Moreover,

362
00:25:31.581 --> 00:25:35.540
you argue that war would separate soldiers from the rest of the people.
And,

363
00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:40.170
and indeed,
although the Levee en masse,
my guillotine almost fell down.
Uh,
um,

364
00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.840
uh,
w w w w would,

365
00:25:41.841 --> 00:25:45.970
would sort of compromise that because all citizens become soldiers,
uh,
uh,

366
00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.670
et Cetera,
et cetera.
But he said something.
This,
uh,

367
00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.100
this is an amazing little speech that he gave and I'm going to read just a few

368
00:25:52.101 --> 00:25:57.101
lines of it because if you think about a current politics in this country in the

369
00:25:57.801 --> 00:26:02.510
last,
say five years,
uh,
it may also a ring true.

370
00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:03.613
He said the most,

371
00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:08.090
this is Robespierre the most extravagant idea that can arise in a politician's

372
00:26:08.091 --> 00:26:12.650
head is to believe that it's enough for a people to invade a foreign country to

373
00:26:12.651 --> 00:26:16.130
make it adopt their laws and their constitution.

374
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:19.760
No one loves armed missionaries.

375
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:24.340
The declaration of the rights of man is not a beam of sunlight that shines and

376
00:26:24.341 --> 00:26:26.660
all men,
and it is not a lightning bolt,

377
00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:29.510
which strikes every thrown at the same time.

378
00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:33.350
I am far from claiming that our revolution will not eventually influenced the

379
00:26:33.351 --> 00:26:37.970
fate of the world,
but I say that it will not be today.

380
00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:43.260
Amazing.
He lost this debate,
uh,
in 1792.

381
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:45.390
Um,
and in fact,

382
00:26:45.391 --> 00:26:49.980
his denunciation of plots against the revolution may have contributed,

383
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:55.050
contributed to revolutionary paranoia.
Uh,
which would it be acting out,
uh,

384
00:26:55.051 --> 00:26:58.230
in the tear.
But on the 20th of April,
1792,

385
00:26:58.231 --> 00:27:00.690
they should own de and the king got their wish,

386
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:06.070
a war and war was declared on Austria and French troops crossed into Belgium.

387
00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:10.620
That is the Austria and Netherlands and the wars,
uh,
went,
uh,

388
00:27:10.621 --> 00:27:13.410
went on and on.
Now,
um,

389
00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:17.010
I want to make a couple of points that are,
that are pretty important.

390
00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:20.200
I'm not going to use these,
these papers to do this.
Um,

391
00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:26.420
that the threat to the revolution did not come just from Austria,

392
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:31.470
from Great Britain,
from Prussia,
from Russia,
from uh,

393
00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:34.860
the big allies and Robespierre got this right.

394
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.930
There are two in the timing of that.
You can read about it in the,
in the,

395
00:27:37.931 --> 00:27:40.830
in the chapter and please do.
Um,
uh,

396
00:27:40.831 --> 00:27:45.690
there were two main counterrevolutionary um,
threats to,

397
00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:50.910
uh,
to the revolution.
The first,
which was,
was not the most important,

398
00:27:50.911 --> 00:27:55.230
but still it's worth mentioning was what has been called the federalist revolt,

399
00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:57.210
the federalist revolt.

400
00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:02.510
And this was based in cities in which merchants free traders played a big role

401
00:28:04.501 --> 00:28:08.370
in that.
Here is a map of lob,
better Fossa.
Um,

402
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.680
now Boldo we've already talked about you've got all these wine merchants at all,

403
00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:17.370
all this family fancy land and who merchant other things as well.
Uh,

404
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:21.320
you've got Maasais big Trudeau is not yet the huge port.

405
00:28:21.321 --> 00:28:22.500
It become in the 19th century.

406
00:28:22.501 --> 00:28:27.501
We've gotten Maasais you've got the all then Francis a second city first and

407
00:28:27.631 --> 00:28:31.260
astronomy one could still argue,
uh,
today.
Uh,

408
00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:35.590
the hen was merely where the king is,
is,
is,
is caught.
That's up there.
Uh,

409
00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:40.590
by the way,
in 1790,
they,
in order to undercut local elites,

410
00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:45.600
that is clergy and nobles and also to impart a more rational organization of the

411
00:28:45.601 --> 00:28:48.540
country comes right out of the enlightenment or the philosophic.

412
00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:49.750
They create deep,

413
00:28:49.751 --> 00:28:53.370
hot tamale departments and they named most of them after rivers.

414
00:28:53.371 --> 00:28:58.371
So some are named after mountains and they create a capital in each of them.

415
00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.600
For example,
this,
it doesn't mean none of this matters,

416
00:29:00.601 --> 00:29:02.310
but it's just to tell you what's going on.
That's,

417
00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.210
it would VN the capital the most.
That's,

418
00:29:04.211 --> 00:29:08.790
the co has capitalism tune up there as to cause a capitalist go,

419
00:29:08.791 --> 00:29:13.790
Hey,
uh,
this is the long Moana my song.
Uh,
this is the,

420
00:29:13.791 --> 00:29:17.790
the,
the Pyrenees,
the Atlantic pier,
and he is the capitalist pull,
et Cetera,

421
00:29:17.791 --> 00:29:20.640
et Cetera,
et cetera.
Um,
so these,

422
00:29:20.641 --> 00:29:23.970
the federalists revolt also in comp,
that's where we're,

423
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.160
the aforementioned Charlotte called.
They came from,
uh,
from that part of it.

424
00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:30.180
That's the department of the kind of a dose,

425
00:29:30.181 --> 00:29:34.480
which is also the name of a wonderful apple brandy.
Uh,
so,
so,
so the,

426
00:29:34.481 --> 00:29:36.180
the federalists or volt comes instead,
he's light.

427
00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:40.790
Like it comes in above all in [inaudible] a call Mousey,
uh,

428
00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:45.130
uh,
too long.
And Leon and of course,
uh,

429
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:50.110
the revolutionary armies,
uh,
the armies of ordinary citizens in the republic,
uh,

430
00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:53.800
what has becoming,
becoming a republic,
a crush,
crush them,

431
00:29:53.801 --> 00:29:56.690
they crush them like grapes.
Uh,
in Leon,
uh,

432
00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:59.450
one of the members of the committee of Public Safety,
uh,

433
00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:01.540
who I was confined to a wheelchair,

434
00:30:01.541 --> 00:30:06.150
a man named [inaudible] that you can read about.
C,
O.
U.
T.
H.
O.
N a.

435
00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:10.660
It says he's going to plow a Leo under,
uh,
like Carthage,
uh,

436
00:30:10.661 --> 00:30:15.370
and they do execute people on the plus a better core.
Um,

437
00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:18.850
and so this federalist revolt is against the bow.

438
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:22.130
It's against the suppression centered,
uh,

439
00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:26.680
far left interpretation of,
of the French revolution.

440
00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:27.671
By the way,

441
00:30:27.671 --> 00:30:31.120
their groups on even further to left on the Jacobean really weren't that far to

442
00:30:31.121 --> 00:30:34.890
the left,
but,
but are groups like the enraged Lee's own.
Hi,
Jay.
Uh,

443
00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:38.680
there's even a guy called [inaudible] [inaudible],
uh,
who believed that,
uh,

444
00:30:38.681 --> 00:30:42.820
you know,
that pop for the,
that,
uh,
property should be abolished,
but these are,

445
00:30:42.821 --> 00:30:47.821
these are just a very small groups of a is a guillotine and Vom Dome,

446
00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:51.520
uh,
uh,
which is south of Paris,
uh,
uh,
near the Luau.

447
00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.530
And his trial is a wonderful source,

448
00:30:53.531 --> 00:30:58.240
actually the trial of [inaudible] Bofa and original source.
So anyway,

449
00:30:58.241 --> 00:30:59.890
so that's the federalist of all.

450
00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:04.600
But the most important threat to the revolution comes from peasants.

451
00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:09.010
It comes from,
uh,
peasants in the west of France,

452
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:13.750
also down where we live in this part of France to a,
that comes later.

453
00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:18.320
But basically what I'm going to talk about for a few minutes is the revolt,
uh,

454
00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:20.600
in the west.
Um,

455
00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:24.070
now it was often said that peasants would never march more than a day away

456
00:31:24.071 --> 00:31:26.210
further from their fields,
but certainly,
you know,

457
00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:30.340
as mile and lots of other people have shown,
uh,
uh,
or Hokey men,
uh,

458
00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:35.240
that's not the case at all.
Um,
uh,
and,
um,
the,

459
00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:39.920
the war was fought with a savagery with a brutality to was simply,
you know,

460
00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:44.770
a staggering,
uh,
I,
there were massacres on both sides,
uh,
that,

461
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.720
uh,
the,
the Von Day,
which is in dark,
there is an,

462
00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:53.470
it became a department,
a number 80 goodwill number 85.
Um,
uh,
and,

463
00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:58.210
but it became such a,
a major blood bath that,
uh,
that they'll entire,

464
00:31:58.270 --> 00:31:59.440
uh,
uh,

465
00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:04.480
counter revolution in the West is often simply called the von day.

466
00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:09.600
I am in the history,
literally because I read a long time ago,
uh,
uh,

467
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:14.470
a book written by my late and must much missed friend,
uh,
uh,
Charles Tilly,
uh,

468
00:32:14.471 --> 00:32:19.060
called the Von Day,
which sought to explain and did explain,
uh,

469
00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.760
and really hasn't been nuanced very much over the decades.

470
00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:26.500
Why some people opposed to revolution,
uh,
taking big time chances,

471
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:30.940
uh,
and other people and who didn't live that far away,
uh,

472
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.830
supported the revolution.
Um,

473
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:36.340
and so when he found he studied in an area that it doesn't matter where,

474
00:32:36.341 --> 00:32:40.190
but what sort of the north of that,
of that dark area,
uh,

475
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:44.350
actually in the many Lularoe a different department,
uh,
but um,
in,

476
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:47.810
here's another French word that's also English.
In the bulk cottage country,

477
00:32:47.811 --> 00:32:52.750
BOC age,
it's the hedge row country.
And he found that the,

478
00:32:52.751 --> 00:32:56.900
the people who rose up against the revolution and took mid big time chances.

479
00:32:56.901 --> 00:32:59.990
I mean,
the Republicans didn't screw around and there was a lot of just horrible

480
00:32:59.991 --> 00:33:04.370
brutality.
They drown thousands of clergy in the swirling waters of the,
of the,

481
00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.500
of the,
of the lower river,

482
00:33:06.501 --> 00:33:09.800
which is a very dangerous river by putting them out into the river with holes

483
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:12.530
drilled in the bottom of the boat,
which didn't give him a big hope.

484
00:33:12.531 --> 00:33:16.880
They killed lots of people on the East Bay,
which is up here off la,

485
00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:20.540
La Rochelle.
Uh,
and of course,
uh,
the,
the,
the,

486
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:25.580
the force is representing the monarchy representing the nobles were if anything

487
00:33:25.581 --> 00:33:28.550
even more brutal.
They crucified people.
Literally they,
they,
you know,

488
00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.810
they made them,
uh,
you know,
kiss the cross before they beat them to death.
Uh,

489
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:37.490
I mean,
it was really,
uh,
uh,
it was really a nasty time.
Um,

490
00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:42.080
and so,
but,
but looking at it,
people who,
who rebelled and,
and ones who didn't,

491
00:33:42.081 --> 00:33:45.140
that the areas,
one of the things we can say at least by that particular area,

492
00:33:45.141 --> 00:33:48.920
but it really rings true is it areas in which that traditional elite,

493
00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:54.340
noble and priest had not been broken down by the economic and social changes of

494
00:33:54.981 --> 00:33:58.850
the 18th century.
They were physically isolated.
These hedges,

495
00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:02.690
you see them up in the upper part of Norman d to uh,
uh,
I mean lower normally,

496
00:34:02.691 --> 00:34:07.130
but,
but,
but,
but high up there on the nearest,
uh,
share,

497
00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:12.830
um,
in the mosh,
you,
these are huge hedge rows that you literally,
I mean,

498
00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:16.790
we can't fight your way through and you can't really climb over and people

499
00:34:16.791 --> 00:34:21.630
tended to marry within their village or within a nearby village.
They still,
uh,

500
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:26.030
the priests will walk tall.
Uh,
the noble was somebody who,
uh,

501
00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.570
who they still respected,
even though the noble nobles had left.

502
00:34:29.571 --> 00:34:33.230
Many of them are left and even though many of they still had to pay pay dues to

503
00:34:33.231 --> 00:34:38.231
the nobles and their only contact with this kind of bourgeois world of economic

504
00:34:38.271 --> 00:34:41.480
change was with people were farming taxes,
for example,

505
00:34:41.481 --> 00:34:45.080
who may hated people that were putting out work into the countryside,

506
00:34:45.081 --> 00:34:48.770
who cheated them and said,
well,
I told you I'd give you five sue last time.

507
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.740
But there are a lot of women doing that same work.
I'm going to give you three.

508
00:34:51.741 --> 00:34:53.510
And if you don't like that too bad,

509
00:34:53.511 --> 00:34:56.390
I'll walk away and I won't take the cloth work that you've done for me,

510
00:34:56.630 --> 00:35:00.830
too bad for you.
Uh,
or people that collected the taxes for the nobles.

511
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:04.940
And so if you look up further along the La River where you had this sort of

512
00:35:04.941 --> 00:35:08.180
economic change in the 18th century,

513
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:11.180
people accepted this new lead and they were easy.

514
00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:14.420
They were willing to ditch the idea of the monarch.

515
00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:17.960
It wasn't say that they all went red or blue soul instead of the Bible before

516
00:35:17.961 --> 00:35:22.730
they went to bed.
Uh,
but these,
these are big time changes that reflected,

517
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:26.900
uh,
uh,
they're reflected the way things had evolved.

518
00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:30.590
Now let me give you some more,
uh,
some more examples.
Um,

519
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:33.890
now one of the most important moments of the French revolution,

520
00:35:33.891 --> 00:35:37.350
and this is also worth remembering and that you can read about it,
uh,

521
00:35:37.351 --> 00:35:41.850
the civil constitution of the French clergy because the revolutionaries get the

522
00:35:41.851 --> 00:35:44.400
very good idea that you're broke.

523
00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:46.830
You already know that the monarchy just flat broke.

524
00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:51.390
So where are you going to get the money?
Who has,
who has money?
Well,

525
00:35:51.391 --> 00:35:54.600
nobles who leave France have money because they have a lot of property,

526
00:35:54.601 --> 00:35:59.340
particularly in areas like Brittany and then in Burgundy,
uh,
Eh,
you know,

527
00:35:59.341 --> 00:36:01.410
and then the end of the false that is the,
you know,

528
00:36:01.411 --> 00:36:03.930
the island of France around Paris.
Um,

529
00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:08.700
but the church has enormous amounts of money,
enormous amounts of land.

530
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:11.850
So what they do is they essentially nationalize the church,

531
00:36:11.851 --> 00:36:16.851
the details you can get and they forced people to take an oath to the French

532
00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.300
revolution,
to the nation,
to the nation.

533
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:24.060
Now in certain parts of France,

534
00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:28.620
particularly those that rose up against the revolution,

535
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:30.780
the priests don't take the oath,

536
00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.740
they refused to and they are called non during.

537
00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:38.130
That is non swearing priests,
j,
u,
R.
I,
N,

538
00:36:38.131 --> 00:36:42.000
G in other parts of France,
uh,

539
00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:46.140
the priests were more willing to take the oath and they're called Jurin clergy.

540
00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:50.420
So this is important.
If you just look at this map,
you see,
uh,
this is by co,

541
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:54.690
this is by a calm,
tall captains,
uh,
within departments.

542
00:36:54.691 --> 00:36:57.870
But did you see all that white up in Brittany and those revolutionary areas that

543
00:36:57.871 --> 00:37:01.410
corresponds exactly to the area of people who fought against the French

544
00:37:01.411 --> 00:37:02.244
revolution?

545
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:07.280
Because the clergy still has enormous influence and sort of the nobles,

546
00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.140
even if they're,
you know,
living in England at the moment are living in Britain,

547
00:37:10.141 --> 00:37:12.930
are living living in Austria and Netherlands or in a,

548
00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:18.160
in a the Rheinland or somewhere else in Germany.
Um,
so,
but,

549
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:19.860
uh,
this isn't enough.
I mean that,

550
00:37:19.861 --> 00:37:22.920
that's not enough because we have to see really what,
uh,
here we go.

551
00:37:22.921 --> 00:37:25.950
This is by district.
This is even better map of it.
Uh,

552
00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:29.910
and you see that in the central part of France here,
uh,
that people,

553
00:37:29.911 --> 00:37:34.860
priests refuse to swear allegiance as in our village to the French revolution.

554
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:39.420
But in Brittany and enormity,
they did massively.
And in Alsace and Lorraine,

555
00:37:39.421 --> 00:37:44.370
they didn't massively.
And in the north of France,
they did massively.
So,
okay,

556
00:37:44.371 --> 00:37:49.260
but that's fine.
That's interesting.
But so what's going on here?
What's going on?

557
00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:51.810
Why did it,
does a goal like that?

558
00:37:51.811 --> 00:37:54.150
It's not just that people also get together and say,
you know,
let's,

559
00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:56.190
let's not swear to the revolution.
Let's,
you know,

560
00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:58.930
go have a drink with Calvin dose instead.
Uh,
uh,

561
00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:02.220
more important changes are going on.
Now,

562
00:38:02.221 --> 00:38:06.330
the word de Christianization,
which I also sent around,

563
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:11.130
has two meanings.
One is the campaign against the church by the revolution,

564
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:15.420
revolutionaries to melt down church bells,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

565
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:17.040
Uh,
um,

566
00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:21.510
de Christianization to change the calendar so that it's no longer January,

567
00:38:21.511 --> 00:38:22.650
February,
March,

568
00:38:22.651 --> 00:38:27.651
but it's a germy now Thermador von toes names they have to do with winds and

569
00:38:28.291 --> 00:38:32.810
plants and the agricultural calendar.
That's part of decriminalization,

570
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:37.560
but that's not the big issue.
The issue is that in these areas that old,

571
00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:40.000
that in which the revolution was accepted,

572
00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:43.330
that old time religion was on the rope.

573
00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:47.740
A friend of mine was a greatest story and called Michel Valle longtime ago.

574
00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.360
I did a book on decriminalization.

575
00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:53.020
He looked at part of provosts and he looked at how people,

576
00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:55.200
what they did with their money in,
in wills,

577
00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:59.140
they looked at the number of people who became priests or nuns.
Uh,
he looked at,

578
00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:01.970
you know,
at,
you know,
all sorts of things.
Well,

579
00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:05.590
how many people baptized their children within the three days you were supposed

580
00:39:05.591 --> 00:39:08.560
to in the Catholic church.
And what he found is that the church,

581
00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:11.050
it wasn't the revolution that destroyed,
uh,

582
00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:15.910
the role of the church or the reduced the role in ordinary people's lives that

583
00:39:15.911 --> 00:39:20.440
that had already happened.
And it began after the counter ref ref reformation.

584
00:39:20.441 --> 00:39:21.940
That is the Catholic reformation.

585
00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:26.440
I was already well underway by the 17 thirty's and the 1740s.

586
00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:31.090
So you can see political behavior here reflecting these big time,

587
00:39:31.091 --> 00:39:35.440
important trends.
You know,
it's in another way you can look at bishop sermons.

588
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:38.230
You look at how people name their children,
uh,
you know,

589
00:39:38.231 --> 00:39:41.170
in the 19th century when they start ne stop naming their children after,

590
00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:45.160
after a saints,
local saints,
for example.
That's another good indication.

591
00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:45.821
Or you know,

592
00:39:45.821 --> 00:39:49.810
you don't have many people named Mary Magdalen anymore in France or that kind of

593
00:39:49.811 --> 00:39:53.860
thing.
Or in the was Zahn named [inaudible] or they now,
and these names of local,

594
00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.710
local saints.
So these,
and,
and here again,

595
00:39:56.770 --> 00:40:00.030
the areas that were counterrevolutionary,
uh,
you know,
Eh,

596
00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:02.820
particularly up in Brittany and,
and,
and,
and you know,
what to,

597
00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:05.430
and those regions there,
uh,
there's some,

598
00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:09.340
the big story was these major kinds of of change.

599
00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:14.080
Ultimately what I'm saying then his religion was very likely to be,
uh,

600
00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:19.150
uh,
arguably the most important cause for,
um,
for,
uh,

601
00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:23.890
people,
uh,
supporting or opposing,
uh,
other revolution.
Uh,

602
00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:27.700
particularly the radical revolution is the committee of public safety sat around

603
00:40:27.701 --> 00:40:32.410
this Big Table,
uh,
and made a big decisions.

604
00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:35.610
Now what about the terror itself?
That they're,

605
00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:38.830
the interpretations of the tear basically have gone like this one.

606
00:40:38.831 --> 00:40:42.460
It was sort of a bloodletting by the very poor of their social betters.
Well,

607
00:40:42.461 --> 00:40:44.650
that's pretty much nonsense.
Uh,

608
00:40:44.651 --> 00:40:48.760
secondly that it's a reflex action to save the republic.

609
00:40:48.761 --> 00:40:53.200
Will that makes more sense.
Uh,
basically in somebody in the 1930s,
you know,

610
00:40:53.201 --> 00:40:55.780
before there was really quantitative history,
went to look,

611
00:40:55.781 --> 00:40:58.750
a guy called Donald Greer said,
let's look at the victims of the tear.

612
00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:03.580
And when he,
he finds fits into where we started,
which is Maximilian Robespierre.

613
00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:08.560
And his attempt to save the revolution,
um,
that the most people in the tear,

614
00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:13.630
uh,
there was a higher percentage of clergy and nobles executed because they're

615
00:41:13.631 --> 00:41:18.520
small percentages of clergy,
uh,
and particularly nobles in the French population.

616
00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:23.670
But the vast majority of people that either were given a prison sentences or it

617
00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:27.640
put their heads to the little window,
uh,
or were shot down,

618
00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:32.530
executed like as,
as in a executed as in Leone,
uh,
were,

619
00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:35.610
uh,
were and we're artisans.
Why?
I mean,

620
00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:38.900
cause there was more peasants and artisans and above all peasants in France and

621
00:41:38.901 --> 00:41:42.320
the other social group.
Now that's,
that's good.
I mean,
that's good to know that,

622
00:41:42.321 --> 00:41:47.321
but even more important that the incidence of the tear in the French revolution,

623
00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:52.250
common areas that are battle zones,
that they reflect,
you know,
the war,

624
00:41:52.251 --> 00:41:54.620
the professional soldiers of other,

625
00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:58.370
of monarchies fighting in the north of France are fighting the east of France.

626
00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:03.670
And they reflect,
uh,
the reflect the civil war is that people get,

627
00:42:03.671 --> 00:42:07.080
a lot of people were,
were put to death or executed,
uh,

628
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:09.350
cause they were fighting or participating in,
in,

629
00:42:09.351 --> 00:42:12.440
in supplying troops in battle zones.

630
00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:16.040
It's possible as my friend David Velez argued to say that parts of this

631
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:17.960
represent the first total war.

632
00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:21.830
I'll talk more about that when we get to Napoleon cause it's,
it's,
um,

633
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.140
it's an interesting subject.
But anyway,
uh,
uh,
the,

634
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:30.890
the terror was no,
was no sort of bloodletting,
organized,
bloodletting,
uh,
uh,

635
00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:34.970
or spontaneous.
It was that too,
despite the horrible incidents,
despite not,

636
00:42:34.971 --> 00:42:38.620
and despite the massacres in the prisons in,
in,
uh,
uh,

637
00:42:38.621 --> 00:42:42.110
I September massacres and,
uh,
in,
in Paris,
uh,
you know,

638
00:42:42.111 --> 00:42:46.990
there was a logic to this and it had to do with,
uh,
trying to,
uh,

639
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.390
save,
uh,
save,
uh,
the revolution.

640
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:53.270
Now I'm back to

641
00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:58.610
back to Maximilian Kolbe is a PA,

642
00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:04.320
I'm fumbling through his papers here to get to the appropriate point.

643
00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:09.710
Um,
they tried to kill Robespierre of course,
that's the,
as the terror gets,

644
00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:11.580
uh,
gets more organized and,

645
00:43:11.581 --> 00:43:14.330
and he had a tendency as his sounds used and the other ones that say,

646
00:43:14.331 --> 00:43:15.830
if we just have one more tear,

647
00:43:15.831 --> 00:43:20.510
one more round of tear will finally save the revolution and all will be well.

648
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:24.390
But lots of people,
uh,
in,
you know,
in the assembly,
uh,

649
00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:29.180
looked around reasonably enough,
uh,
and said we might be,
uh,
the next,

650
00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:33.920
uh,
uh,
the next victims.
Uh,
he became increasingly tired,

651
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:38.270
fatigued.
He was never a,
you know,
a,
a,
you know,

652
00:43:38.271 --> 00:43:40.910
a dramatic speaker.
But he was,

653
00:43:40.911 --> 00:43:45.460
if he no longer wanted to be heard,
um,

654
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:46.850
two attempts on his life,

655
00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:51.940
it finally got him to come to the Jacobin club and to go the convention.

656
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:57.790
It's possible to argue that death and revolutionary in mortality was,

657
00:43:58.130 --> 00:43:58.730
um,

658
00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:03.680
was something that he chose because of his own childhood guilt,

659
00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:07.430
uh,
a primal guilt,
uh,
about,
uh,

660
00:44:07.431 --> 00:44:11.870
his own father and,
uh,
the death of his,
uh,

661
00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:14.540
a mother,
uh,
for somebody who is aesthetic and,

662
00:44:14.541 --> 00:44:17.130
and withdrawn and preferred to be alone.
Uh,

663
00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:22.020
he became increasingly of that way unable to,
uh,

664
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:26.630
to act in a 17,
in 1794.

665
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:29.160
And Thermador the month of Thermador.
Um,

666
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:34.020
he became increasingly obsessed with his own and his own demise,
he says,

667
00:44:34.021 --> 00:44:37.950
of providence has seen fit to snatch me from the hands of the assassins.

668
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:43.190
It was to ensure that I would profitably employ the moments that still remained

669
00:44:43.321 --> 00:44:46.640
to me,
yet he could only,
uh,
you know,

670
00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:51.630
as people how let them from every conceivable angle,
uh,
in the convention,

671
00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:55.450
uh,
uh,
a murmur,
uh,
um,

672
00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:58.530
almost inarticulately.
Uh,
when he,

673
00:44:58.531 --> 00:45:00.780
he mounts the rostrum on the eighth of Thermador,

674
00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:04.560
he gives an incredibly clumsy speech for Robespierre.

675
00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:06.540
I need to unburden my heart.

676
00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:10.440
Everyone is in a league against me and against those who hold the same

677
00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:12.300
principles that I hold.

678
00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.650
What friend of the nation would wish to serve the moment the,
the,

679
00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:17.940
the nation when he no longer is allowed to serve it.

680
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:22.890
Why remain in an order of things in which intrigue eternally triumphs over

681
00:45:22.891 --> 00:45:23.724
truth?

682
00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:28.560
How may one bear the torture of seeing this horrible succession of,

683
00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:33.130
uh,
of traders?
Perhaps he thought that his own death with rouse,

684
00:45:33.131 --> 00:45:37.140
the Patriots,
that is the Sans Culottes,
uh,
in,

685
00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:41.850
in the sessions in the neighborhoods,
uh,
of,
of,
of particularly central,

686
00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:45.930
uh,
in,
um,
and eastern Paris.
Um,

687
00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:48.060
11 times,
uh,

688
00:45:48.061 --> 00:45:53.061
he is shouted down and people shouting down with the tyrant and he says,

689
00:45:53.131 --> 00:45:55.740
only I ask for death.

690
00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:59.980
He leaves with his brother and with tall,

691
00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:03.600
and they go to the town hall.
The same building is not there,

692
00:46:03.601 --> 00:46:07.590
but it's in the same plot,
the same spot.
And they weighed upstairs.

693
00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.150
And occasionally somebody would say to them,
well,

694
00:46:09.151 --> 00:46:12.360
why don't we go out and rouse up the sections?
Why don't we,
you know,

695
00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:16.380
we are at great risk here.
And they just sit there.
They sit in this,

696
00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:21.250
in this room.
They sit there all night.
And finally,
inevitably,
uh,

697
00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.060
the troops of the conspiracy run up the stairs,

698
00:46:24.061 --> 00:46:27.600
cutone tries to escape in his wheelchair and the wheelchair bounces along with

699
00:46:27.601 --> 00:46:29.160
him down the stairs.

700
00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:34.400
Robespierre either takes a pistol and shoots himself in the jaw or is shot and

701
00:46:34.921 --> 00:46:38.610
the,
and the jaw.
And he spends time trying to rub the blood because of the,

702
00:46:38.611 --> 00:46:39.900
he had this thing about clean,

703
00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:43.770
clean white clothes and Andy for,

704
00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:45.280
until they know what to do with him,

705
00:46:45.281 --> 00:46:48.270
he at one point he's lying on a table and he points with sounds juice.

706
00:46:48.271 --> 00:46:52.650
They point to the declaration of the man of the rights of man and of citizen.

707
00:46:52.651 --> 00:46:56.250
And they said,
we did that.
Uh,
and indeed they did.

708
00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:59.010
And they find themselves taken to the concierge.
Sorry,

709
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:02.730
that is the prison of the conversation of hey,
which is still there.

710
00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:05.160
It's no longer a prison is one of the great gothic halls,

711
00:47:05.161 --> 00:47:08.570
one of the three great gothic halls and France along with,
and y'all and,

712
00:47:08.571 --> 00:47:12.740
and most of them,
Michelle.
Uh,
and of course the trial is,

713
00:47:12.741 --> 00:47:17.741
is as he would have had it and had it for the enemies of the revolution is quick

714
00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:20.910
with no defense,
really permitted.
Uh,
uh,

715
00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:23.570
the next morning they clip his hair back,
uh,

716
00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:27.330
as one did a so that the long hair,
uh,

717
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:32.080
would not in any way slow the blade of the guillotine.
And they take him,

718
00:47:32.081 --> 00:47:35.830
put him in a wagon and it takes,
because there wasn't very good way.

719
00:47:35.831 --> 00:47:38.500
They're not major thoroughfares through Paris.

720
00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:40.720
They take him to the Plus Dilla Revenue Shawl,

721
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:45.580
which is now called the Plus luck Hong Kong.
And they pass him by his house.

722
00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:48.010
Uh,
the host of the carpenters with he,

723
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.380
which he stayed where he had had his happiest moments.

724
00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:54.180
And as he gets closer to the plus,
uh,
deliver revenues,

725
00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:59.170
show where he's going to meet Sasol the executioners or are all,

726
00:47:59.171 --> 00:48:02.200
it's a blood trade after all.
And rather like butchers,

727
00:48:02.201 --> 00:48:05.920
they all intermarrying and they lived outside the walls of cities.

728
00:48:05.921 --> 00:48:08.770
He's going to meet SAS song as he gets there.

729
00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:12.700
He surely noticed that the women were more and more well dressed and so are the

730
00:48:12.701 --> 00:48:16.750
men.
And as he gets there,
they're,
they're shrieking at him,
uh,

731
00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:20.470
of obscene term to go with down with the maximum,

732
00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:24.130
the maximum on the price of bread.
It's a different crowd.

733
00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:25.690
It's a very different crowd.

734
00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:30.070
Thousands of people came to hear the lean forward to catch the last words,

735
00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:33.880
to see the head held above as they did with Louie the 16th,

736
00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:37.890
and with Marie Antoinette's.
Uh,
uh,
hold my head up.
It's a good one.

737
00:48:37.891 --> 00:48:40.510
Said Down Tall,
uh,
or something like that.

738
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:45.630
When they executed him on San Juice and roves peers orders before and he meets

739
00:48:45.821 --> 00:48:49.900
Sasol with his,
with blood pouring out of his,

740
00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:54.220
the bandage holding his jaw on having come loose.
And even at the end,

741
00:48:54.221 --> 00:48:57.730
even if they shove his head into the little window,
uh,

742
00:48:57.790 --> 00:49:01.570
blood is pouring from him and wonder when does it,
no,
we can't imagine.

743
00:49:01.571 --> 00:49:03.580
As he looked up,
as his head is down and he looks up,

744
00:49:03.581 --> 00:49:07.610
he sees the throngs of paid a fine price to sit on the roofs,

745
00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:11.050
like living in being across from Wrigley field or something like that,

746
00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:16.320
to see the death of the tyrant tyrant or the person who saved the revolution,

747
00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:20.980
or one of them.
It's very hard to say,
uh,
it,

748
00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:22.810
it depends on your view,

749
00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:27.640
but certainly one can imagine that Robespierre a brief,
uh,

750
00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:31.130
a breathe,
a breath of,
of,
of,

751
00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:33.310
of a relaxation of,
of,

752
00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:37.300
of leaving a in existence that had tortured him.
Uh,

753
00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:39.010
and if gaining for the revolution,

754
00:49:39.011 --> 00:49:43.300
he hoped Revolution Neri revolutionary immortality,

755
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:47.170
but also perhaps when can argue paying a debt,

756
00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:49.570
a debt to his family that,
uh,

757
00:49:49.571 --> 00:49:54.070
stemmed from the death of his own mother long before in a Haas.

758
00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:55.510
See,
on Wednesday.
