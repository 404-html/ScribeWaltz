1
00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.130
All right,
I'm going to talk about imperialism today.

2
00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:09.240
And so this compliments the chapter in that,

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.630
um,
in the book.
Um,

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.180
so the main topic is the new imperialism

5
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.440
and
the lecturer is,

6
00:00:23.441 --> 00:00:27.080
and very much about the culture of imperialism,
uh,

7
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.370
because part of the age of mass politics,
uh,
in Europe and the,

8
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.870
and the 1880s,
nineties for World War One,
um,

9
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.300
involved a massive support for the new imperialism.

10
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:47.170
So what was new about the new imperialism?
Uh,
and,
and,
and when,

11
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.700
when,
what period did we talk about,
uh,
as having a,

12
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.010
having had the new imperialism,
it,
it's really from the mid eighties,

13
00:00:56.011 --> 00:01:00.150
just say the 1880s to a 1914.
And so at that point,

14
00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:03.570
as you can see from the maps in the book,
and you can see from the,
uh,

15
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.740
the discussion that,

16
00:01:05.741 --> 00:01:09.420
that the European powers a really conquer the world,

17
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.720
there's no way a other way to put it.

18
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.130
And there's a frenetic or wild chase even to the South Pole,
you know,

19
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:18.840
as part of that.
Um,

20
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:23.380
and after the African continent of which there were huge blanks in,
in,

21
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.850
in the maps of,
of Africa,
uh,
by 1914 number,

22
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.070
virtually entire continent was not only charted,
uh,

23
00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:35.250
but had been conquered.
Um,

24
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.230
and so Europeans,
uh,
really control a of the globe,

25
00:01:40.231 --> 00:01:44.490
the Americans in a,
in a,
in a smaller way,
but,

26
00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:49.230
but are part of,
of,
uh,
of the new imperialism.
Um,

27
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.440
so let me just start out by posing the question and I sent all this stuff around

28
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:55.381
too.

29
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:59.070
So it's like I don't have to scribble on the board and you don't have to try to

30
00:01:59.071 --> 00:01:59.850
figure out what it is.

31
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.180
It's written on the board cause it's hard to see from here,
um,

32
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.480
that if you were going to argue or to point out or to claim that there was a,

33
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.510
a,
a central reason for the new imperialism.
Why,
uh,

34
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.050
uh,

35
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.050
even Bismarck who described the colonies as an albatross around the neck of

36
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:26.540
Germany?
Well,
he gets into the kind of feeding frenzy himself.
Uh,
uh,

37
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.510
it's been putting rather clever layer cleverly by guy called bomb golf so long

38
00:02:30.511 --> 00:02:31.460
time ago,
uh,

39
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.600
that it comes down to God gold and glory that,

40
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.940
um,

41
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.770
there were those who interpreted the mad quest for colonies is as being,

42
00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:47.250
uh,
uh,
the missionary impulse.

43
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.560
A sort of subset of this would be the French idea that there was a civilizing

44
00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:57.000
mission going on and trying to,
uh,
trying to give,

45
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.940
give a indigenous peoples access to French culture.

46
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.700
But basically it's,
it,

47
00:03:02.701 --> 00:03:07.701
it argues that that Dutch Calvinist ministers and Lutheran ministers and

48
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:13.150
Catholic priests,
uh,
and,
and,
uh,
other denominations,

49
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.580
uh,
uh,
encouraged,
uh,

50
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.680
states and their own church people to,
uh,

51
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.740
to bring to their religion indigenous peoples all over the place.

52
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.780
Well,
we can dispense with that one.
That was part of it.
Of course.
I mean,

53
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:35.170
you can't distinguish any of these three and say that each at any of them are

54
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:37.380
new,
but,
uh,
that,

55
00:03:37.381 --> 00:03:42.130
that is a rather small part of the quest for,
uh,

56
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.600
for yet more colonies in the new imperialism.

57
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.710
And indeed for all of the,
uh,
the well meant,
uh,
uh,

58
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:55.360
however it will condescending in many cases,
a quest for conversion,

59
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.550
religious conversion.
Uh,

60
00:03:57.551 --> 00:04:02.380
most of the Lutheran ministers and Dutch Calvinist ministers and South East Asia

61
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.500
and Catholic priests,
uh,
all over the place such as Vietnam,
uh,

62
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.450
or my friend Charles Keith has just finished a dissertation on Catholic Vietnam

63
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:14.650
and the 1920s,
most of those priests,
uh,
in,
in,
in,
in,

64
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.540
in areas such as Africa were there to 10 tour to the religious needs of,

65
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.470
you know,
of the European communities is particularly true of,
of,
for example,

66
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:27.980
Lutheran ministers in German,
a southwest Africa.
Uh,
and,

67
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.340
and in other places,
uh,
the,
the,
the,

68
00:04:31.341 --> 00:04:34.570
the drive to convert a people's to,

69
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.940
to organize European religions was probably a greatest.
And it,
you know,

70
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.630
the Vietnam case is a very good one.

71
00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:44.020
And the role of the of the Catholic church is extremely interesting in Vietnam

72
00:04:44.021 --> 00:04:48.130
and the origins of,
of Vietnamese nationalism.
Uh,
but that,

73
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:52.200
that is another story.
Now,
the second one was,
was Gold Gi,

74
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.740
put a d for the g o and gold.
Was it spelled g.
O.
L.
D usually.

75
00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.850
Um,
and,
uh,
I,
I said in,
in what you're reading that if you,
if you,

76
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.740
if you get Karl Marx,
the fever sat together with Hobson,
you know,

77
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:10.030
a very major economic thinker who might describe it in there.
Uh,

78
00:05:10.031 --> 00:05:11.230
if they were having dinner there,

79
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.260
there'd be a lot of WWE was uncomfortable about the dinner,

80
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.360
but they would really agree.
They would say that,

81
00:05:16.361 --> 00:05:21.200
that the new imperialism of which obviously Hobson was a great critic,
you know,

82
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.000
emerged out of the quest for,
uh,
for riches,

83
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.250
for resources and part of,
of Marxism.
And,

84
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.410
and part of Leninism an important part was that imperialism was sort of the

85
00:05:32.411 --> 00:05:35.170
final stage of the development of capitalism.
And that,

86
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.210
that states need new markets.
They need new resources,

87
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.190
uh,
and therefore a,
they set off a set out to,
uh,

88
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.600
uh,
at a time of economic,
uh,
a crisis.
I mean,
nothing like now,

89
00:05:49.601 --> 00:05:54.340
but there is a depression that lasts from 1874 to the mid eighties,

90
00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.690
nineties.
Uh,

91
00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.750
they set out to define new Richards and that the people are going up the Niger

92
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:05.150
River,
for example.
Uh,
uh,
where I've been in,

93
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:08.920
in Molly and Molly.
Uh,
they,
uh,
you know,

94
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.760
they expected to find gold around the next bend or more peanut oil or,
or,
uh,

95
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.810
or diamonds because of the,
you know,
the diamond rush and South Africa,

96
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.830
which was the equivalent of the gold rush in the u s and about 1848.

97
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.510
And California.
Um,
and Hobson was,
no marks is at all,

98
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.730
but he said,
and he was a critic of the,
you know,

99
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.540
the brutality of the new imperialism,
which I'll talk about in a minute,
but,
uh,

100
00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:35.600
he said,
if you want to find out where this all began,
you look,

101
00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:40.160
you look at a high finance in the city,
the city being,
uh,
the city in London,

102
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.700
Westminster,
uh,

103
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.380
where the high rollers and the bankers and the big capitalists are,

104
00:06:45.381 --> 00:06:49.610
and there is your,
there is,
there,
there is the origins of the,

105
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:51.970
of the new imperialism.
Um,

106
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.990
now there were critics of the new imperialism and most of them,

107
00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.100
but not all,
were in Britain.
And,
and,

108
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.490
and many of them opposed the new imperialism because of the brutality,
uh,

109
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.470
of,
uh,
exerted on indigenous peoples,
uh,
by,

110
00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:12.890
uh,
by the imperial powers.
Um,

111
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.370
and there was a real wave of opposition,
for example,

112
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.060
to a imperialism that swept through,
uh,
uh,

113
00:07:20.061 --> 00:07:25.061
Britain and London in 1900 in what they called the,

114
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.360
um,
the,
the khaki election khaki,
because it was the color of,

115
00:07:30.361 --> 00:07:34.640
of the uniforms,
uh,
of many of the British,
uh,

116
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.460
soldiers,
uh,
in,
in hot,
in hot climates.
Um,

117
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.450
and so,
uh,
some of the opposition,
uh,
in the,
the Liberal Party,

118
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.830
um,
some of the,
uh,
we're,
uh,
opposed,
uh,

119
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.240
uh,
ran on a campaign of anti imperialism and they were just wiped away.

120
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.670
They were just absolute swept away in the elections of 1900 and ordinary people

121
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:03.530
in a,
in Britain,
a thrilling to the accounts of colonial,
uh,

122
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.440
uh,
uh,
exploits,
uh,
uh,

123
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.800
voted overwhelmingly from the conservatives who just blow the liberals out of

124
00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:13.970
the water and,
and,
and the Labor Labor or the party exists in 1900 bridges.

125
00:08:13.971 --> 00:08:18.710
Not yet,
uh,
you know,
uh,
a major,
uh,
a major force.
And so,

126
00:08:18.711 --> 00:08:22.940
uh,
uh,
imperialism,
um,
uh,
carries the,
uh,

127
00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:24.150
carries the day and,

128
00:08:24.151 --> 00:08:29.151
and the big parades in London of returning soldiers from the Boer War in South

129
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.550
Africa and from other wars,
from all the wars,
uh,

130
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.530
they agreed to this conquering heroes.

131
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:38.830
Nowhere more a frenetically enthusiastically exuberantly then the city,

132
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:40.070
uh,

133
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:44.780
cause there is a link between finance and a big finance,

134
00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:49.580
big capitol and imperialism plump,
uh,
uh,
period.
Uh,

135
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:50.900
and,
and uh,

136
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:55.830
besides that we have a category we call social imperialism.
Uh,

137
00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:57.090
and,
and,
uh,

138
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:02.070
the imperialist power said he and saw imperialism as part of the overall

139
00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:06.000
strategy of,
of,
of,
um,
you know,
of conquest is,
look,

140
00:09:06.001 --> 00:09:10.020
if you've got economic problems at home and you've got a lot of unemployed

141
00:09:10.021 --> 00:09:12.540
workers also in France,

142
00:09:12.541 --> 00:09:17.190
if you've got a lot of unemployed workers who happen to be socialists or in

143
00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:18.024
Italy,

144
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.230
that you can kind of export your problems because you can point people in the

145
00:09:22.231 --> 00:09:24.420
direction and say,
Hey,
you going when times are tough here,

146
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.790
but if you go to Algeria,
you know,

147
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:31.740
we'll rip off some Arab land for you and you'll be just fine.
Or you can go,

148
00:09:31.741 --> 00:09:35.190
um,
you can go,
uh,
make it rich in,

149
00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:39.210
in Vietnam or you can go to Kenya or to Ghana.

150
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:43.410
I would have become Kenya,
Ghana.
Uh,
and,
and,
uh,

151
00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:48.110
so you can export your social problems.
And this is sort of a new imperialism.
Uh,

152
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.690
man,
uh,
you know,
classic case would,
would be,
uh,
you know,

153
00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:55.050
the insurrection of 1851,
this is backing up before the new imperialism,

154
00:09:55.051 --> 00:09:58.080
but what do they do with the people who are arrested after the revolution of 18?

155
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:03.150
Uh,
I mean,
uh,
the instruction of 1851,
a lot of them are sent to Algeria.

156
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:08.160
You export your quote unquote social and political problems.
And the irony there,

157
00:10:08.161 --> 00:10:11.160
amazing,
delicious irony is they're a great,
great,
great,
great,

158
00:10:11.161 --> 00:10:12.780
great grandchildren.

159
00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:17.100
Ended up being a right wing supporters of the national front and before that of,

160
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:21.300
of at various right wing groups that,
that believe in,
in French,
Algeria.
Uh,

161
00:10:21.301 --> 00:10:26.040
and who tried to keep their friends from Legion leaving Algeria in,
uh,
in 19,

162
00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:30.840
the early 1960s after the Algerian War of independence.

163
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:35.910
So I'd be social imperialism is part of it as seen by,
you know,
uh,

164
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.150
by,
um,
sort of the economic cannon,
uh,

165
00:10:39.151 --> 00:10:43.810
that is the way of thinking about the economy and the political economy of,
uh,

166
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.540
of these countries.
Uh,
as a way of keeping things calm and home is that,
you know,

167
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.630
give people opportunities.
You send them to these foreign places.
Uh,
and Geez,

168
00:10:51.631 --> 00:10:53.800
I mean,
in the case of France,
I remember reading,
you know,
reading these,

169
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:58.890
this gripping,
I'm just pathetic stories of these people just can't make it in,

170
00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:01.350
in the area in which we live in the south of France.
And,
you know,

171
00:11:01.351 --> 00:11:04.360
they pack up all their stuff and,
and you know,
they walk,
you know,

172
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.220
they walk or they get a little push cars try to get to avenue.

173
00:11:07.221 --> 00:11:11.210
I'll try to hit the mouse day,
try to get a boat to,
uh,
to get to Morocco,

174
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:13.920
Tunisia or Algeria to try to make a living there.

175
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.950
And this too is part of social imperialism.
And as part of,
you know,

176
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:22.100
the idea that somehow that social imperialism is economically determined,

177
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:27.150
that is the final stage of capitalism.
Well,
is that the biggest reason?

178
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.730
No,
but it's damn important.

179
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.020
The biggest reason is it has to do with,
uh,

180
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:38.910
the entangling alliances and great power rivalries,
uh,

181
00:11:38.911 --> 00:11:43.440
that,
uh,
and it's mostly wrapper.
It's represented best by far,
showed up,
uh,

182
00:11:43.441 --> 00:11:44.420
at the end of the,
uh,

183
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:49.500
1890s where British force stumbles into a French force in the middle of Sudan

184
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.870
and they say nasty things to each other.

185
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:56.300
Finally toast each with drinks they had brought along,
uh,

186
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.830
and the other countries almost go to war,
uh,

187
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.330
because the flag would be tarnished by,

188
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:05.610
by losing out to your craven reptiles that you just stumbled into in,
in,
uh,

189
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:09.190
in the Sudan.
Uh,
and imperialism.

190
00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:14.191
The new imperialism is one of the fundamental causes of World War One period.

191
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:19.290
And that is the biggest reason now,
don't get rid of the,

192
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.120
the of the gold interpretation completely.

193
00:12:22.121 --> 00:12:27.121
Pink is obviously as Britain and Germany become huge economic rivals,

194
00:12:27.551 --> 00:12:30.970
big economic rivals as,
as the,
uh,

195
00:12:30.971 --> 00:12:34.450
as the Germans are not only nipping at the heels of,
of,
of,

196
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.680
of the city and a British industrial production in British naval production,

197
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:42.620
but passing them and things like chemistry and in,
in,
uh,

198
00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:47.050
in production of steel and the production of big battleships.

199
00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.470
Uh,
all this stuff runs together.
Your,

200
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:54.550
your victory is your craven reptile opponents loss.

201
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.990
And that's the way they viewed it.
And most people are.
I'll do,

202
00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:03.130
I'll talk about this on Wednesday.
It's fun to talk about,
uh,
sad,
but also fun.
Uh,

203
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:03.341
you know,

204
00:13:03.341 --> 00:13:06.670
most people in the 1890 [inaudible] thought that the next war would involve

205
00:13:06.671 --> 00:13:09.420
France and Britain.
There'll be fighting again.
Uh,
and,

206
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.110
and they're rivals here and there,

207
00:13:11.111 --> 00:13:14.080
or they thought that maybe the British and the Russians would fight because

208
00:13:14.081 --> 00:13:16.330
they're rivals and what was called the great game,
you know,

209
00:13:16.331 --> 00:13:21.330
for India and Afghanistan,
and it was north of India and all of that.
I mean,

210
00:13:21.331 --> 00:13:23.260
the,
uh,
uh,
so,

211
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:27.400
but basically glory and the imperial,
I mean,

212
00:13:27.401 --> 00:13:31.690
the rivalries great par rivalries is,
is the biggest reason,
uh,

213
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.830
that,
uh,
uh,
Germany gets into a,
uh,

214
00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:38.980
into the imperial game.
For example,
you know,
Bismarck,

215
00:13:38.981 --> 00:13:43.850
it's a famous Bismarck story.
Uh,
I'm really awful man,
but,
but,
uh,
uh,
there,

216
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:48.130
there's a,
when there's a imperial lobby comes racing along and says,
look,

217
00:13:48.131 --> 00:13:51.520
you know,
uh,
chancellor,
uh,
uh,
hair chancellor,

218
00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:54.130
we really need to have the troops go and protect our merchants.

219
00:13:54.131 --> 00:13:58.060
People like the sort of freelance guy.
Uh,
uh,
Carl Peters.
Uh,

220
00:13:58.061 --> 00:14:02.690
and he said at one point,
he slams down a map of,
of Europe on the table,

221
00:14:02.691 --> 00:14:05.530
and he says,
that's my map of Africa.
Here we are,

222
00:14:05.531 --> 00:14:07.870
and we're surrounded by Russia and France.

223
00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:12.730
But by,
toward the end of his career was completely different.

224
00:14:12.731 --> 00:14:16.540
And he's backing up,
uh,
uh,
German expeditionary,
I mean,

225
00:14:16.541 --> 00:14:20.980
a German merchants with expeditionary forces and once Plat plant the flag and

226
00:14:20.981 --> 00:14:23.440
then you'd better defend it.
But the,

227
00:14:23.441 --> 00:14:27.940
and the big issue there is rivalry with,
uh,
um,
you know,
with France,

228
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:33.090
uh,
and with Russia as Bismark says,
he says,
Jeez,
you know,
if we can get the,

229
00:14:33.091 --> 00:14:35.500
the French interested in all these colonies in Africa,

230
00:14:35.501 --> 00:14:39.130
then they won't be dreaming of reconquering,
Alsace and,
and,
and,
uh,

231
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.460
and much of the hen,
and then at the,
and he says,
well,
you know,

232
00:14:42.461 --> 00:14:45.160
we better be out there too.
And they're all out there.

233
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:49.160
And as some wag ones puts it.
Italy gets into the game too with,

234
00:14:49.161 --> 00:14:54.161
with in Libya and Ethiopia with a huge appetite in bad teeth as someone wants,

235
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:56.260
as if someone was put in,

236
00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:01.040
of course they get defeated in the battle and in 1896 and then they will pay

237
00:15:01.041 --> 00:15:01.960
them back with it,

238
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:06.970
a poison gas and cascades of bombs in the 1930s and just destroy everybody and

239
00:15:07.581 --> 00:15:12.581
kill them all if they can to pay them back for their defeat in 1896 now I am

240
00:15:15.651 --> 00:15:18.200
eventually going to talk about,
about the politics,

241
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:22.280
about the culture of imperialism and give you the example which I find telling

242
00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:25.520
of Robert Baden Powell and the origins of the boy scouts.

243
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:30.230
You didn't associate the boy scouts with imperialism,
but you will in a minute.

244
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.890
But first,
uh,
you know,
let me just say that,
that this is not,
you know,

245
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:37.590
some sort of seventies radical guy saying,
oh,
you know,
it's really,
you know,

246
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:38.570
they're,
there he goes again,

247
00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:41.390
it's really nasty to be slaughtering a hundreds of thousands of people,

248
00:15:41.391 --> 00:15:45.920
but it is nasty and that's what they did.
And that cannot be forgotten.

249
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.200
And it doesn't just start with the,
the famous case of,

250
00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:53.480
of the Germans in southwest Africa.
More about that in a minute.
Uh,

251
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.980
visual,
uh,
the name is quite forgettable,
but who's a general from,

252
00:15:56.981 --> 00:15:59.730
from an emotional,
you know,
the French,
uh,

253
00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:03.590
conquer LG or is any way in 1830 as a political diversion.

254
00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:08.570
And gradually they expand their control over,
uh,
Algeria.
Um,

255
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.330
and Algeria becomes a,

256
00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.580
it becomes a colony and it becomes an integral point of view,

257
00:16:13.581 --> 00:16:17.030
integral point of view from the point of view,
the French of,
of,
uh,
uh,

258
00:16:17.031 --> 00:16:21.530
in a different way than Tunisia is Vietnam or Morocco and other places,
uh,
of,

259
00:16:21.531 --> 00:16:26.260
of France,
even though it's not part of Metropolitan France was Yo,
uh,

260
00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:30.400
and his successors kill about 850,000 people,
uh,

261
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.830
during the campaign.
A very unequal,
uh,
uh,

262
00:16:33.831 --> 00:16:38.540
battles in Butoh comes up with the idea of simply putting,
uh,
uh,
men,

263
00:16:38.541 --> 00:16:41.070
women and children into these huge cat,
uh,

264
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:45.380
caves and caverns and then simply throwing bombs in.
And so they all die.

265
00:16:45.381 --> 00:16:49.340
And he did that over and over again.
Uh,
and so,
you know,
it's easy to say,
well,

266
00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:52.640
the demons of the 20th century,
they come into the 20th century,
don't they?

267
00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.280
But as I suggested before,
in terms of the commune,

268
00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:58.280
I mean this stuff is out there.
I in the 19th century as well.

269
00:16:58.281 --> 00:17:01.460
And so racist ideologies out there in the 19th century,

270
00:17:01.461 --> 00:17:04.870
there's no doubt about it in the French experience,
in,
in,
in,

271
00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.120
it wasn't that where in every place,
uh,

272
00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:11.170
but the French experience was pretty terrible.
And the case of,
um,
you know,
the,

273
00:17:11.171 --> 00:17:16.030
the,
uh,
no very well documented case of,
of,

274
00:17:16.031 --> 00:17:19.220
of what happened and what now is Congo and was in Zaire.
Uh,

275
00:17:19.221 --> 00:17:24.120
we're sort of the private,
uh,
private colony of the king of Belgium.
Uh,

276
00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:29.330
the atrocities there are well known and one could go on all day talking about

277
00:17:29.331 --> 00:17:33.650
these atrocities.
Uh,
the most well known,
uh,
certainly,
uh,

278
00:17:33.651 --> 00:17:38.651
and most well documented and in a way because of what comes later in the 20th

279
00:17:39.321 --> 00:17:42.800
century is that of,
uh,
of um,

280
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:47.270
the conquest and indeed genocide and the here on borrowing a term appropriate

281
00:17:47.271 --> 00:17:50.250
term.
I think in this case.
And that's not a term you throw around

282
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:55.020
<v 1>very loosely.
Uh,
of my friend and a colleague,
Ben Kiernan,</v>

283
00:17:55.021 --> 00:17:59.800
who some of you know,
big book on,
on genocide,
which you'll press published,
uh,

284
00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.740
uh,
recently.
Um,

285
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:06.920
they begin conquering southeast or southwest Africa in 1885.

286
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:12.360
Uh,
so Bismarck still has a few a years to go.
Um,

287
00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.470
and um,

288
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:19.210
in their way as they would see it among other people where the heroine hair

289
00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:21.660
hair,
O,
h,
e,
r,
e,
r,
O,

290
00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:27.090
a Bantu Group of about 75,000 cattle herders who were in the center of what

291
00:18:29.551 --> 00:18:33.180
would become the German,
uh,
uh,
colonial territory.
Now again,

292
00:18:33.181 --> 00:18:37.140
I mean this is European powers or are putting things like borders their

293
00:18:37.141 --> 00:18:41.390
boundaries and that has nothing to do with the,
with the way that,
that,

294
00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:45.480
that particularly nomadic peoples,
they don't have any sense of,
of borders.

295
00:18:45.481 --> 00:18:48.740
I mean,
Molly,
where I,
I've been,
uh,
cause my daughter was studying the,

296
00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:53.650
a Megan in Mali,
in northern Mali,
north of,
of of Timbuktu.
I mean the,
the,

297
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.720
the,
the,
the,
the,
the two of meg who are a,
people had no sense of borders.

298
00:18:57.721 --> 00:19:00.840
There were two of them hag across other borders too and borders or something.

299
00:19:00.841 --> 00:19:05.640
We're artificially constructed by these powers to stay.
We're here,

300
00:19:05.641 --> 00:19:10.560
our empire goes there and yours doesn't start till there.
And so,
um,

301
00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:15.900
as these people,
um,
you know,
rise up to defend their own territory,

302
00:19:15.901 --> 00:19:19.890
they are systematically,
um,
uh,
a massacred,
um,

303
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:24.890
and um,
they basically,
um,

304
00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:29.790
first decide to crush the uprising,
uh,
at,

305
00:19:29.791 --> 00:19:33.470
at,
um,
at all costs.
Uh,

306
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:37.710
and there is a in 1904 and extermination order.

307
00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:42.420
Um,
and that's literally that the German trend translation from the German,
uh,

308
00:19:42.421 --> 00:19:46.680
the proclamation of the local militia commander is that the horror people must

309
00:19:46.681 --> 00:19:49.260
leave this land.
If he,
they don't,

310
00:19:49.261 --> 00:19:53.580
I will force them to do so by using the great gun that is artillery within the

311
00:19:53.581 --> 00:19:56.370
German border that is defined as now German.

312
00:19:56.610 --> 00:20:01.440
Every male Herrero armed or unarmed with or without cattle will be shot to

313
00:20:01.441 --> 00:20:06.390
death.
I shall no longer receive women or children,
uh,
that is,

314
00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:11.640
uh,
spare them,
but we'll drive them back to their people or have them shot.

315
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:16.470
These are my words to the Herrero,
uh,
people now.

316
00:20:16.471 --> 00:20:20.710
Um,
I couldn't make this up and it's easy to say my how terrible this is,

317
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.510
but it is terrible.
And it was part,
it was part of the,
of,
of,
uh,

318
00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:29.010
of the enterprise and has remained the part of the imperialist enterprise.

319
00:20:29.011 --> 00:20:31.510
It wasn't the goal of every imperialists to,
uh,

320
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:35.540
to exterminate the people who were there.
Uh,
but if they got an a way,
uh,

321
00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:38.640
in a very unequal fighting,
uh,
in,
in India,

322
00:20:38.641 --> 00:20:41.700
there were various cases of soldiers complaining it was too easy as shooting

323
00:20:41.701 --> 00:20:44.490
down the,
uh,
the rebels because it was just like hunting.

324
00:20:44.491 --> 00:20:46.920
There was a very British upperclass analogy.
It was just like,

325
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:48.340
I just like hunting.

326
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:53.440
<v 0>Um,
and,
um,
so basically what they do,
if they don't shoot them,</v>

327
00:20:53.441 --> 00:20:57.970
they chased them out into the desert and then they cement over,
uh,
the,

328
00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.880
the wells in the oasis.
So they die.

329
00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.140
And basically they exterminate about two thirds of the people.

330
00:21:05.141 --> 00:21:08.110
There's a very excellent book on this written by a former graduate student here

331
00:21:08.111 --> 00:21:11.830
many moons ago called Etsy Hall,
Isabelle Hall,

332
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:15.490
that was published four or five years ago.
So,
um,
you know,

333
00:21:15.491 --> 00:21:19.180
th the origins of,
of this and,
and,
and again,

334
00:21:19.181 --> 00:21:22.420
I mean there are people not writing and saying,
well,
it wasn't that bad.
You know,

335
00:21:22.421 --> 00:21:25.090
they brought trains to India and did the,

336
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:30.100
ended the huge disparities and prices.
I mean,
certainly lots of good things.

337
00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:34.120
I did come,
but,
but,
you know,
looming in the background were,
were,
uh,

338
00:21:34.121 --> 00:21:35.340
were these massacres and,

339
00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:38.710
and know the addition that I'm working on now that I'm just finishing of,
of,
uh,

340
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.240
uh,
the book that you're kindly reading.
Uh,

341
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:44.710
there's a whole recent spate of interesting literature.

342
00:21:44.711 --> 00:21:49.540
I on the end of the British Empire in Kenya,
uh,
in the 1950s,

343
00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:53.620
the 1950s.
History of the hanged is one.

344
00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.370
There's another one by a woman called Carolyn Elkins at Harvard.

345
00:21:57.371 --> 00:22:01.360
And the title escapes me at the moment,
but are just fantastic.
But just gripping,

346
00:22:01.361 --> 00:22:05.550
just chilling,
you know,
accounts of,
of,
of,
uh,
uh,
uh,

347
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:08.600
essentially the,
you know,
the mass murder,
uh,

348
00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:13.630
incarceration and murder and shooting under the guise of trying to escape in

349
00:22:13.631 --> 00:22:17.890
quotes and all of this,
of,
of,
of,
uh,
you know,
hundreds of thousands of people.

350
00:22:17.891 --> 00:22:19.660
And this was hidden from the British public,

351
00:22:19.661 --> 00:22:22.720
just systematically by the government.
So it's a long,

352
00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.290
it's a long story and it's one that we have to wrestle with.
Now,

353
00:22:26.291 --> 00:22:30.340
having said that,
uh,
I want now to talk about the culture of imperialism.

354
00:22:30.341 --> 00:22:35.040
So this is sort of shifting gears rather rapidly and talk about,
uh,
uh,

355
00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.340
Robert Baton Powell.
Baden Powell is the best way of,

356
00:22:39.341 --> 00:22:43.660
of of pronouncing it,
uh,
and the origins of the boy scouts.
And again,

357
00:22:43.661 --> 00:22:46.420
because I was once asked to leave the boy scouts in Portland,
Oregon,

358
00:22:46.421 --> 00:22:49.240
cause that was of no use and it never accumulated a single badge.

359
00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.910
This is not the origins of this,
of this lecture.

360
00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:55.750
And there's lots of stuff written on being Paul.
He's an easy person to mock.

361
00:22:56.050 --> 00:23:00.220
He's an easy person,
I suppose,
to have some sort of respect for two in a way,

362
00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:01.420
depending on your point of view.

363
00:23:01.421 --> 00:23:03.940
And I'm not dissing the boy scouts once I had people running up,

364
00:23:03.941 --> 00:23:06.940
but I said woman or even became up was a girl scout and she says,
oh,

365
00:23:06.941 --> 00:23:09.820
this is so cruel.
What you're saying about scouting.
It's not like that.

366
00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.860
I know it's not like that now.
Uh,

367
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:16.060
but having had some relative who had a very strange idea of giving me of all

368
00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:20.140
people boy's life as a birthday present and I remember,
you know,

369
00:23:20.141 --> 00:23:21.590
reading that and all this kind of,

370
00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:25.900
this kind of over the top of Americana and publications,

371
00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:29.370
I suppose I'm wracking a little bit,
uh,
against that too,
but,
but the,

372
00:23:29.371 --> 00:23:32.790
there is a point to all this and,
and so the rest of this is about Baden Powell,

373
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.830
I and,
and the boy scouts.
Um,

374
00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:41.950
Robert a Baden Powell was a,
was a soldier I,
and he believed,

375
00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:46.280
he came up with the idea of scouting as a way of preparing a

376
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:51.110
<v 1>British youth for a imperialism and for,
uh,
the next war.</v>

377
00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:55.130
Um,
the origins of the,
of the scouts in terms of its timing,

378
00:23:55.131 --> 00:23:59.780
that is the first decade of the 20th century has to be seen in terms of these

379
00:23:59.781 --> 00:24:04.550
international conflicts is international great power rivalries with which,

380
00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.960
you know,
we began,
you know,
it,
it comes at the time of the Brock and affair,

381
00:24:08.961 --> 00:24:12.860
the first Moroccan affair and the second Moroccan affair,
1905,

382
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:17.180
1911 when it seems like the British or the French and the Germans will,
will,

383
00:24:17.181 --> 00:24:22.181
will go to war against each other and they will bring in the other great powers.

384
00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:23.930
Uh,
more about that.

385
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:27.680
Robert Baden Paul was a professional soldier and when he went back to,

386
00:24:27.681 --> 00:24:31.250
to England,
he,
uh,
he thought that the,

387
00:24:31.251 --> 00:24:35.710
that British youth were a cigarette smoking,
heavy drinking,
you know,

388
00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.920
flabby,
uh,
uh,

389
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:42.660
weaklings whether they were upper classes and even worse.
Uh,

390
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:47.510
he had his few lower classes because they were underfed and therefore a smaller,

391
00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:52.220
he,
he hated the Oxbridge common rooms.
He said with his town,
life buses,

392
00:24:52.221 --> 00:24:56.440
hot and cold water laid on,
everything is done for you.
Uh,

393
00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:58.070
the British working classes like that,

394
00:24:58.071 --> 00:25:00.880
like the upper classes tended to drink a lot.
Um,

395
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:05.150
he was sure that there'd be a war fought in the lifetime of these same people.

396
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:08.780
And he came to the idea of scouting.

397
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:13.820
Now America has a role in,
in,
in all of this.
I mean,
we,
we are,

398
00:25:13.821 --> 00:25:17.120
uh,
this country,
uh,
has always believed in the frontier.

399
00:25:17.121 --> 00:25:20.210
Those of you who had the Glen this course in American history and other people

400
00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:24.650
know about the Turner thesis,
about,
you know,
always you can expand to the west,

401
00:25:24.651 --> 00:25:28.040
you can diffuse your social tensions and the east by giving people access to

402
00:25:28.041 --> 00:25:32.990
land,
you know,
further on and get rid of the Indians and the way,
uh,
et Cetera,

403
00:25:32.991 --> 00:25:35.250
et cetera.
Now,
uh,
it,
you know,

404
00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:39.500
we have friends that still [inaudible] friends in France who still read the last

405
00:25:39.501 --> 00:25:40.790
of the Mohicans,
you know,

406
00:25:40.791 --> 00:25:44.630
and there's this fascination with the American frontier,

407
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:49.700
and this is extremely important.
And the end of,
uh,
of the,
of,
uh,

408
00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:54.020
of the 19th century,
uh,
in,
in Europe.
Um,

409
00:25:54.021 --> 00:25:56.870
and so Baden Powell,
um,

410
00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:02.290
he borrows the uniform of the boy scouts from the frontier,

411
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:08.360
uh,
from the frontier uniform,
as,
as,
as he imagined it,
uh,
on,

412
00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:13.290
uh,
um,
uh,
you know,
in America,
the cowboy hat,

413
00:26:13.291 --> 00:26:17.900
the flannel shirt there neckerchief the sh achieve the short,
uh,
her reset,

414
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:19.970
the short pants.
He said,

415
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.540
the shape of a face gives a good guide to a man's character.

416
00:26:23.541 --> 00:26:25.340
The sort of from face.

417
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:29.930
He loved that square jaw compared to working class loafers and,

418
00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.260
and shirkers has as he called them.
And it's this cult of,

419
00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:38.630
of masculinity.
Now this comes at a time one,
my stay,

420
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:43.870
when you've got very aggressive suffrage ism us by the suffragettes who want

421
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:49.460
<v 0>the rights of women to vote in,
uh,
in Britain,
one of whom,
uh,</v>

422
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:54.210
throws herself in front of a horse in a horse race and sacrifices her life to

423
00:26:54.211 --> 00:26:58.560
make a point.
It comes at a time as the author at the famous Oscar Wilde,
uh,

424
00:26:58.561 --> 00:27:03.310
try,
uh,
trials.
And Oscar Wilde,
of course,
was gay.
Uh,
and,
and,

425
00:27:03.311 --> 00:27:08.250
and there was a sense that,
you know,
the reality of English manhood.

426
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:12.780
I was being tested,
being tested by,
by women,
by a,

427
00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.760
and the bad Baden Powell did not like women.
He referred to women as,

428
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:20.670
as silly women,
uh,
uh,
silly girls,
silly women,
uh,
and by,

429
00:27:20.671 --> 00:27:24.670
uh,
uh,
you know,
and,
and,
and by gays whom he saw as,
as,

430
00:27:24.671 --> 00:27:28.470
as a feminist and,
and therefore not really British and wouldn't be there.

431
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:33.320
What good could,
could they do,
uh,
in,
uh,
the next war.
Also,

432
00:27:33.321 --> 00:27:36.090
it's a time where in Germany particularly,
but only in Germany,

433
00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.300
not only in Germany,
we're dueling,
there's sort of that test of,

434
00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:41.460
of masculinity where you,
if you're lucky,

435
00:27:41.461 --> 00:27:43.920
you'll end up with a dueling scar and not actually get killed.

436
00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.950
And most of them don't get killed,
but they're dueling all over the place there.

437
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:50.340
They're dueling in the woods outside of Paris.
They're dueling almost everywhere.

438
00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.890
Germany,
they're dueling still in,
in,
in Britain.

439
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:56.790
And that's what a reaffirmation according to Bob Nye and lots of other people

440
00:27:56.791 --> 00:27:59.040
and all sorts of people have written on this and who to flavored.

441
00:27:59.041 --> 00:28:02.770
My colleague who's now gone.
And unfortunately,
um,
you know,
this is,
uh,

442
00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:06.810
this is part of the reaffirmation of reality.
And the tendency is to say,

443
00:28:06.811 --> 00:28:09.150
looking back,
I said,
well,
they're taking it out on animals,

444
00:28:09.151 --> 00:28:14.130
blowing the hell out of them.
Uh,
and uh,
indigenous people,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

445
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:18.750
So scouting for boys takes off.
It spreads from,

446
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:23.580
from Britain to Australia to Canada,
to New Zealand,
to India,
to Chile,

447
00:28:23.581 --> 00:28:28.070
to Argentina,
to Brazil in 1910.
It starts in,
uh,

448
00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:30.990
the United States.
And in 1910,

449
00:28:30.991 --> 00:28:35.160
Baden Paul reside resigns from the command of a division of the territorial army

450
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:39.480
to spend the rice to the rest of his life involved in scouting.
And again,

451
00:28:39.481 --> 00:28:43.650
what I'm saying is that this is involves a sort of grasping on this idea of the

452
00:28:43.651 --> 00:28:46.230
American frontier.
You're going to create your new frontier.

453
00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.050
You're a new frontier is going to be an Africa.

454
00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:53.550
Your new frontier is going to be in Afghanistan.
Uh,
you,

455
00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:57.870
you create your frontiers and then you hold the frontiers and you train these,

456
00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:59.490
these boys,
uh,

457
00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:04.720
these young men to hold the colonial,
uh,
uh,

458
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:09.600
frontier.
And he founds,
he finds sponsorship and the daily Cat Telegraph,

459
00:29:09.601 --> 00:29:13.770
which was a big conservative newspaper.
All the big newspapers are conservative.

460
00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:18.510
Um,
and the 60,000 scouts,
I think I sent this around,
but 1909,

461
00:29:18.511 --> 00:29:22.950
there's 60,000 scouts and Britain 1910 or 107,000,

462
00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:27.150
1913,
150,
2000.
And in 1917,

463
00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.590
194,000.

464
00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:34.010
Why was there such a short gap that much of a leap between 1913 and 1917 because

465
00:29:36.931 --> 00:29:40.380
their dad,
they get killed.
They killed in the war.

466
00:29:40.381 --> 00:29:42.340
I mean they're going off to fight there scouting

467
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:46.690
<v 1>as a finished a,
uh,
a rather early.
Uh,
you've got these big rallies,</v>

468
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.870
enormous in London,
scouts coming from all over the empire.

469
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:54.410
Girl scouts are created in um,
in 1914,
but,
uh,

470
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:56.290
Baden piled in the eye care much about that.

471
00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:01.250
Now there had been groups of frontier inspired,
you know,

472
00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:04.960
youth organizations that existed in Scotland particularly,

473
00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:09.550
and they're called things like the sons of Daniel Boone that woodcraft Indians.

474
00:30:09.551 --> 00:30:13.720
The boys were glade in brigade in Glasgow in 1883.

475
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.030
Some were church sponsored.
Again,

476
00:30:16.031 --> 00:30:20.590
this is the sore moralization of the working classes.
Uh,

477
00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.380
you get them into groups.
They won't smoke cigarettes,

478
00:30:23.381 --> 00:30:26.080
which is a good thing not to do a,
they won't drink.
Uh,

479
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.320
they want to hang out with the wrong people.
Uh,

480
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:32.850
they will go to work and become cogs in Britain's,
uh,
industrial,
uh,

481
00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:36.970
empire.
And they too can look at maps of,
of,
of,
of,

482
00:30:36.971 --> 00:30:41.290
of Africa being increasingly painted red,
which was the color of the,
of,
of the,

483
00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:45.910
uh,
of the empire.
Um,
and so nature,
uh,

484
00:30:45.911 --> 00:30:49.860
remains,
uh,
uh,
a part of this now,
um,

485
00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:54.280
again,
to repeat the cult of the American frontiersmen,

486
00:30:54.281 --> 00:30:58.390
let me say a little bit more about that.
Uh,
is,
is,
is part of this,

487
00:30:58.391 --> 00:31:02.860
the idea of the fronts.
Tears man,
the buck skin man,
uh,

488
00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:06.880
Rudyard Kipling,
uh,
you know,
I mean,
Roger Kipling is not my kind of poet,

489
00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:11.680
but anyway,
um,
he,
he,
he expresses often this,

490
00:31:11.681 --> 00:31:16.200
this idea something hidden.
Go and find it.
What's happening.
Uh,

491
00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:21.130
uh,
what I put must have pushed something.
I pushed something.
It doesn't matter,

492
00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:25.120
not easily alarmed.
Uh,
go and find it.

493
00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:29.260
Go and look behind the ranges,
something behind the ranges,
uh,

494
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:32.170
lost and waiting for you go.

495
00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:37.730
Baden Powell described the frontiersman who's manhood is strong and rich of a

496
00:31:38.711 --> 00:31:42.210
pure life.
Now his own PR,
uh,
again,
uh,
he,

497
00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:44.410
his own predilections is that for him,

498
00:31:44.411 --> 00:31:49.390
a pure life would not involve a silly women quote unquote as he put it.

499
00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:54.310
But,
but the other idea is,
is,
uh,
and this is not,
you know,

500
00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:58.720
there's not at all,
I'm not saying anything about you know,
his sexuality,

501
00:31:58.721 --> 00:32:01.580
but I mean,
the reality of the situation is that he preferred the company of,
of,

502
00:32:01.581 --> 00:32:06.450
of,
of young men,
uh,
to,
uh,
to any anywhere else.
And this is involved in,
in,

503
00:32:06.451 --> 00:32:09.730
in the way he lived his life.
Um,
and,
um,

504
00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:14.560
but the idea is that the Freeman must earn independence with his gun.

505
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:19.150
Uh,
and this is again,
part of this old American,
a Western idea,

506
00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:23.710
but you apply it to,
uh,
um,
indigenous people.

507
00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:27.490
Now you have aggressive models coming from the American West,

508
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:31.780
William Wild,
Bill Cody from our white,

509
00:32:31.781 --> 00:32:35.890
my wife's state of Nebraska had killed thousands of buffalo.

510
00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:39.320
He had Dewald,
you know,
dual,
I mean,
these aren't,
you know,

511
00:32:39.321 --> 00:32:41.220
the duals that they do in the,
with with the Bush,

512
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:43.360
the German dueling fraternities.

513
00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.640
You got the equivalent in dodge city in all of this where you're dueling and

514
00:32:46.641 --> 00:32:50.540
they have the classic kind of Clint Eastwood,
uh,
uh,
a western.

515
00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:54.650
He'd killed thousands of Buffalo Dewald and he's a killer.
And Scott and,

516
00:32:54.651 --> 00:32:56.360
and scalper of Indians.

517
00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:01.460
He was his own publicist and he had enormous influence in Britain.

518
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.230
After the battle of the,
at the battle of little big horn in 1876,

519
00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:10.370
he kills Indian chief yellow hand.
In 1887,

520
00:33:10.371 --> 00:33:13.730
he crosses the Atlantic,
he goes to London,
Paris,

521
00:33:13.731 --> 00:33:17.390
and Berlin Queen Victoria came out of her period,

522
00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:22.400
extended period of decades of mourning for her dear husband,
Albert,
uh,

523
00:33:22.401 --> 00:33:26.270
to attend a wild bill Cody show.
She wants to go.

524
00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:28.850
And she's there with all of the others.
Uh,

525
00:33:28.851 --> 00:33:33.170
she hadn't been to an event like that in 26 years.
Um,

526
00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:37.850
and so the irony is that wild bill,
Cody,
when he runs these,
you know,

527
00:33:37.851 --> 00:33:42.680
these fake combats between the,
between the Indians and the cowboys,

528
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:43.703
you know,
in,
you know,

529
00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:48.200
in stadiums or the equivalent of stadiums in Britain when the ironies of this

530
00:33:48.201 --> 00:33:49.011
about art and,

531
00:33:49.011 --> 00:33:52.640
and railed emerging if at some of the people he brought across the Atlantic,

532
00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:57.170
we're Indians who had actually fought in the battle against him in the DAKOTAS

533
00:33:57.350 --> 00:34:00.860
and he hires them as extras and he takes them to Paris,

534
00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.820
to London and to Berlin.
And they are a big,

535
00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:09.650
huge success.
Uh,
it's the wild west program,

536
00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:14.330
um,
in north the same time in Canada.
Those are your Canadian know about the,

537
00:34:14.331 --> 00:34:16.550
you know,
the mounted police and all that business.

538
00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:20.570
And the mounted police become a powerful though,
somewhat tamer,

539
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:24.680
more acceptable,
more vanilla equivalent of that,

540
00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:26.210
of keeping order,
you know,

541
00:34:26.211 --> 00:34:30.500
in Saskatoon and all of these places like that actually been the Saskatoon as

542
00:34:30.501 --> 00:34:33.200
says,
it's a pretty nice place.
Um,

543
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:38.120
and so the idea of these mountain men and amount of the mountain men get your

544
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:41.660
uniforms,
you know,
the mountain men's are no augers or you know,

545
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:46.990
taking pot shots at people in Kentucky on the frontier or scalping Indians in

546
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:51.410
the Dakotas.
They're wearing,
you know,
so freelance scalpers,
you know,

547
00:34:51.411 --> 00:34:54.260
they're wearing the uniform of these countries and they're big time
imperialists.

548
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:57.030
And so that's really the point.
Um,

549
00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:59.750
here's a verse I can't remember where I got that.

550
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:05.480
Our mission is to plant the right of British freedom here,
restrain the law,

551
00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:08.750
lawless savages and protect the pioneer.

552
00:35:08.751 --> 00:35:13.751
It rhymes and tis are proud and daring trust to hold these vast domains.

553
00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:16.100
But with 300 mountain man,

554
00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:20.140
you've got to kind of make that rhyme a little bit mountain man,
like,
uh,

555
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:22.850
pronounce it is if you were a mountain man.
But anyway,

556
00:35:22.851 --> 00:35:25.520
that's a little harder to do if you have an Oxbridge accent.
Uh,

557
00:35:25.521 --> 00:35:29.480
which I clearly don't.
Um,
you know,
also,
this is part of it and the whole,
I mean,

558
00:35:29.481 --> 00:35:32.300
I don't have time to do it and I've spent a fair amount of time in Australia,

559
00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:36.530
but it's also part of the whole,
the idea of being Australian.
Two of you know of.

560
00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:37.920
But anyway,
but that's a,
that's another thing.

561
00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:42.060
It a Kipling's loss legion is really just awful.
But,
but here we go.
Ah,

562
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:45.480
there's a legion that was never listed that carries no colors or crest,

563
00:35:45.481 --> 00:35:48.960
but split in a thousand detachments is breaking the road to the rest.

564
00:35:48.961 --> 00:35:52.140
I'm supposed to be more respectful when I do this.
But anyway,
our fathers,

565
00:35:52.141 --> 00:35:55.860
they left us their blessing.
They taught us in groomed us and crammed.

566
00:35:56.070 --> 00:36:00.810
But we've shaken the clubs and the masses to go and find out and be damned dear

567
00:36:00.811 --> 00:36:04.950
boys to go and shot and be damned dear boys.

568
00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:09.870
A realty,
adventurous loyalty,
loyalty to boys,

569
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:14.670
loyalty to young men and,
and brotherhood.
Uh,
and so,

570
00:36:14.671 --> 00:36:17.370
um,
it starts,
uh,
like that.

571
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:21.690
Can I barely go on out from the woods of the great northwest under the Austral

572
00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.090
die from the south and the north.
They'll,

573
00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:28.650
they'll come forth at the sound of the mother's cry and each at his post where

574
00:36:28.651 --> 00:36:33.450
the danger is most will stand as a century then Britishers all to stand or to

575
00:36:33.451 --> 00:36:36.750
fall.
The empires,
frontiers men.

576
00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:42.810
Now Baden Paul is his own best publicist,
uh,

577
00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.090
even better than wild bill Cody and Ben.

578
00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:49.830
He helps plant newspaper articles about him.
Uh,
here's one from 1900.

579
00:36:49.831 --> 00:36:53.520
It's been suggested that Major General Baden is unrivaled skill as a calvary

580
00:36:53.521 --> 00:36:57.000
scout forms of quite remarkable inheritance of heredity.

581
00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:02.040
That he is descended from Pocahontas,
the American Indian princess.
Uh,

582
00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:03.870
which he was clearly not,

583
00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:08.130
but how does it become so popular and how do these poems,

584
00:37:08.131 --> 00:37:11.230
he's got off of poems that I've just read.
How,

585
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:13.380
how do they become popular?

586
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:18.570
They become popular because they become the stuff of,
of boys literature,

587
00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:23.100
of the culture of imperialism.
They were the British equivalent of boys life.

588
00:37:23.101 --> 00:37:26.850
I don't even remember.
I'm not knocking boys life.
I don't know if that existed.

589
00:37:26.851 --> 00:37:31.590
I strongly preferred sports illustrated and the sporting news,
uh,
to that.

590
00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:34.110
Uh,
so they become the stuff that people are reading it.

591
00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:37.980
They're looking at these maps of African gradually becoming painted British.

592
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.820
Now how did he become well known?
Well,

593
00:37:41.821 --> 00:37:46.000
because he's an imperialist and he's fighting in 1896,
uh,

594
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:49.170
he fought in the metabolite war,
which I sent around,
not the war,

595
00:37:49.171 --> 00:37:52.470
but the name a skirmish against about a thousand,
uh,

596
00:37:52.471 --> 00:37:55.140
indigenous of fighters.
Um,

597
00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:58.920
and it's at that point where he starts,
uh,

598
00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:04.310
starts coming up with his own freelance uniform that would become that of the

599
00:38:04.801 --> 00:38:08.580
boy scouts and in the middle in military units,

600
00:38:08.581 --> 00:38:12.780
people that were scouts,
again,
the idea of tracking of your tracking,

601
00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:16.770
you're seeing where the Indians have been,
the Indians can see where you've been.

602
00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:19.050
Now you learn how they do it,
you know,
what,

603
00:38:19.051 --> 00:38:23.340
how the blades of grass turn and all of that.
I couldn't scout anything,
but,
uh,

604
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:26.880
that,
that,
that you see how they do it and they become known as scouts,

605
00:38:26.881 --> 00:38:31.750
which is sort of an Americanization of,
of a term.
And this is what he's,
he's,
uh,

606
00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:36.160
he likes to do,
I mean,
Teddy Roosevelt,
you know,
there's a,
you know,

607
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:40.660
a good example of that.
I mean,
I talk about that kind of narcissism of,
of,
of uh,

608
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:44.830
uh,
you know,
of the colonial imagination and,
and imperial imagination.
Rough,

609
00:38:44.831 --> 00:38:49.390
rough.
We're the stuff we want to fight and we can't get enough whoopee,
uh,

610
00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:54.310
that,
uh,
the song of,
of the rough riders,
uh,
of,
uh,

611
00:38:54.311 --> 00:38:59.200
of,
uh,
you know,
from the,
the Cuban American war of Teddy Roosevelt.
So the,

612
00:38:59.201 --> 00:39:02.410
so as part of the hysteria of the U s Spanish war,
but again,

613
00:39:02.411 --> 00:39:05.170
it's the front tier a spirit.
Now,

614
00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:08.620
Baden Paul helps create his own myth.
What's I've said,

615
00:39:08.621 --> 00:39:13.621
he drew pictures of the people that he had allegedly shot these pictures and end

616
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.320
up being in the tabloid newspapers.
And again,

617
00:39:17.321 --> 00:39:20.860
the role of the tabloids and spreading all this stuff is terribly important.

618
00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:24.670
I said before,
they're 21 daily newspapers in Paris at the time.

619
00:39:24.671 --> 00:39:26.770
And I don't remember how many there are in Britain,

620
00:39:26.771 --> 00:39:29.460
but they're an awful lot of them.
Um,

621
00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:35.040
he a sketch to a last stand of eight people supposedly until they get rescued,

622
00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.900
uh,
against indigenous people.
Uh,

623
00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:42.160
he claimed that the Zulus against whom the British war,
the Zulus Z,

624
00:39:42.161 --> 00:39:46.810
u l u s called him quote,
sounds unlikely.
The man,

625
00:39:46.811 --> 00:39:49.650
he who likes to lie down to shoot.
Uh,

626
00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:53.740
and that the Ashanti called him in awe.
This was his term for himself.

627
00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:58.520
He of the big hat.
Um,
and that in,

628
00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:00.340
in this war,
uh,

629
00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:05.580
in 1896 that they called him the wolf in awe.

630
00:40:05.591 --> 00:40:09.610
Again,
his opponents,
the beast that does not sleep,

631
00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:11.410
but sneaks around at night.

632
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:15.610
And so he became the wolf who never sleeps.

633
00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:20.820
There's a slight problem with this invention of a term to describe himself as

634
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:23.060
the wolf who slept,

635
00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:26.770
who sneaks around is there aren't any Wolfson Africa.

636
00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:30.700
They're not any wolves at all.
So he made it up and made it up rather badly,

637
00:40:30.701 --> 00:40:33.370
having taken it out of some book somewhere else.

638
00:40:33.371 --> 00:40:38.050
But that doesn't stop the tabloids from referring to him as the wolf who never

639
00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:41.890
sleeps.
Uh,
and then,
uh,
as though some of the,

640
00:40:41.891 --> 00:40:43.920
and the Boers understand that.
And the,
the,

641
00:40:43.921 --> 00:40:48.610
the Boer war that is the Dutch African or opposition opponents who by the way,

642
00:40:48.611 --> 00:40:51.460
the British created the term concentration camp.
And again,

643
00:40:51.461 --> 00:40:56.050
I'm not looking back from history,
uh,
but they're separating men and women.

644
00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:58.870
I'm a children,
uh,
and,
and uh,

645
00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:03.640
and women from the men and trying to avoid,
uh,
uh,
uh,

646
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:05.500
that they received provisioning out in,

647
00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:09.880
out in the bush and they create the term concentration camp in the Boer war

648
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:13.090
where the bore with the bores.
You know,
we actually live there no,

649
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:15.640
and had for a long time though,
they're not an indigenous people.

650
00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:18.830
They know that there aren't a wolves there.
And so they start mocking,
uh,
uh,

651
00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:20.740
a Baden Paul.
Uh,
but,
uh,

652
00:41:20.741 --> 00:41:25.720
he have the big hat did not slow down at all.
And so,
um,

653
00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.120
in 1899,

654
00:41:28.121 --> 00:41:33.070
he is the good luck to be at the siege of Mustang Musky Mfa,
King Maf,

655
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:36.890
e.
K.
I.
N.
G,

656
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:42.080
a where they are surrounded by a force but not a terribly aggressive force.

657
00:41:42.081 --> 00:41:46.640
And they,
and again,
he draws pictures of people on,
on,
on duty and,

658
00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:51.770
and all of that night duty.
And the talented resisted 217 a days,

659
00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:56.720
uh,
uh,
station on the railway line that runs between the Cape,
uh,
and,

660
00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:00.410
and Rhodesia.
Um,
and um,
this,

661
00:42:00.411 --> 00:42:04.330
this was a big takeoff for his,
uh,
his,
uh,
uh,

662
00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:07.760
reputation and just the name Baden Powell,

663
00:42:07.761 --> 00:42:09.440
the initials Baden Powell,

664
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:14.630
a BP become identified with British imperialism.
Um,
BP.

665
00:42:14.631 --> 00:42:18.130
He loves the night and after his return from the hollows of the Veldt where he

666
00:42:18.131 --> 00:42:19.670
has kept so many anxious vigils,

667
00:42:19.671 --> 00:42:24.671
he lies awake hour after hour upon his camp mattress in the veranda tracing out

668
00:42:24.891 --> 00:42:28.520
in his mind the various means and the agencies by which he can forestall the

669
00:42:28.521 --> 00:42:30.950
bore move,
which are known to them.

670
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:34.370
He is personally already watched.
Uh,

671
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:38.090
he is the wolf who,
uh,
never sleeps.

672
00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:41.030
Now BP also becomes those initials,

673
00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:45.290
British pluck the idea that the British are mothers.
This is kind of a,

674
00:42:45.291 --> 00:42:49.810
a image of would come out of the,
a very heroic,
you know,
Battle of Britain and,

675
00:42:49.811 --> 00:42:51.890
and,
and,
uh,
you know,
under,
under the bombs of,

676
00:42:51.891 --> 00:42:56.891
of German Luftwaffe and World War II British plot.

677
00:42:56.930 --> 00:43:01.400
Also BP,
British peerage,
British peers.
They know the upper classes,

678
00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:06.680
the titled British peer says he becomes identified with,
uh,
with,
with,

679
00:43:06.681 --> 00:43:10.670
with all of this,
the wolf who,
uh,
who never sleeps.

680
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:15.400
His advice vice to his own,
um,
uh,
garrison is to,
um,

681
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:20.030
sit tight and shoot straight.
All is well here.
He writes,
I mean,

682
00:43:20.031 --> 00:43:23.710
they're able to get messages out to the newspapers who are covering this.
Uh,

683
00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:28.340
now again,
the British newspapers covered another siege,
which ends rather badly,

684
00:43:28.341 --> 00:43:32.300
which is that in,
uh,
at cartoon with the death of,
of,
uh,

685
00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:36.390
Charles Chinese Gordon as he was called Chinese Gordon because he slaughtered

686
00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:41.390
the Chinese,
uh,
and he,
uh,
gets his,
uh,
Eh,
in,

687
00:43:41.391 --> 00:43:46.190
um,
at Khartoum,
uh,
and of course children,
schoolchildren,
there's an enormous,

688
00:43:46.191 --> 00:43:50.770
enormous outpouring of tears,
uh,
over the death of this man.
Uh,
and the,

689
00:43:50.771 --> 00:43:53.500
the newspapers because of these modern techniques,
you know,
they can,

690
00:43:53.501 --> 00:43:57.980
they can follow all of this stuff pretty much how the siege is going,
et Cetera,

691
00:43:57.981 --> 00:44:02.690
et cetera.
And so BP the prince of Goodfellows,
Prince of Scouts,
uh,

692
00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:06.980
here we go.
They emphasize his youth.
He's 43,
but he's youthful.

693
00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:11.180
He's cheer,
cheerful.
He's always whistling and telling stories,

694
00:44:11.181 --> 00:44:15.380
even when things are going bad.
Uh,
he loves pranks,
Childish Pranks.

695
00:44:15.381 --> 00:44:18.770
This is from this,
some of the newspapers,
life was a game,

696
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:20.510
but you have to play it honorably.

697
00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:25.010
And it was a game that silly women as he called them,
could not play.
Um,

698
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:29.690
and he becomes known again.
I'm sports.
Mass sports is starting just at this time.

699
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:34.530
The Olympics are starting just at this time.
Uh,
you know,
again,

700
00:44:34.531 --> 00:44:39.300
there's a research and a of reality,
you know,
in the,
in these,
uh,
uh,

701
00:44:39.301 --> 00:44:44.280
these Olympics.
Um,
uh,
he's called the gallon goalkeeper.
You know,

702
00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:48.090
the guy they interviewed,
the goaltender of MF king.
Uh,

703
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:50.880
so a sports analogy becomes part again of,

704
00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:55.860
of this imperial imperial thrust.
Um,
and uh,

705
00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:59.760
they,
he,
they print patriotic letters to him,

706
00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:04.020
which can be signed,
uh,
uh,
and it can be sent.
You can send a postcard,

707
00:45:04.021 --> 00:45:07.740
you could send a postcard home.
Your parents have left after parents weekend.

708
00:45:07.741 --> 00:45:11.160
If they came,
you can send them the following postcard.
Dear parents,

709
00:45:11.161 --> 00:45:14.280
dear mom and dad,
we have shouted rule Britannia,

710
00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:17.850
we have Sun God save the Queen.
We have toasted gallon,

711
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:20.070
a Baden I half a score.

712
00:45:20.071 --> 00:45:24.900
We have sent our best respects to plucky must king and we have hoisted flags and

713
00:45:24.901 --> 00:45:29.160
bunting in Galore with a wild and frenzied madness.
Born of joy.

714
00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:29.941
The empire.

715
00:45:29.941 --> 00:45:34.770
Cheers while we Britishers rejoiced to the land in this hour of jubilation,

716
00:45:34.771 --> 00:45:38.460
I am sending you align with the wish that I could warmly shake your hand.

717
00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.690
Years Exalted Lee and then you sign your,

718
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:46.680
your own name to it.
So scouting is someone said,

719
00:45:46.681 --> 00:45:48.910
I can't remember,
which was,
uh,

720
00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:53.930
which person was an attempt to make these values in quotes onto Gamion quotes,

721
00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:58.770
uh,
a muff king permanent and to trace,
put,

722
00:45:58.771 --> 00:46:03.570
trace them on the map of these countries.
Have these peoples all over,

723
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.970
uh,

724
00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:08.970
other world 1909 newspapers said it may be that he is not a great soldier of the

725
00:46:09.481 --> 00:46:12.800
sort,
which Napoleon or the mult keys or kitchen Kitchener's are made.

726
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:17.460
He is there.
Frontiersman the born leaders of irregulars a maverick,
uh,

727
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:21.180
and the empire has need of such a,
furthermore,

728
00:46:21.181 --> 00:46:25.830
he has the knack of seizing the imagination of boys and a deep sympathy with

729
00:46:25.831 --> 00:46:26.550
them.

730
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:31.020
He is doing his days work for the empire by training a number of manly little

731
00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:34.560
fellows to keep their wits about them and their eyes,
skin.

732
00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:39.740
We show a profit another day in a much greater affair than muff king.

733
00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:46.400
And that of course is preparing for the war against those other peoples who

734
00:46:46.591 --> 00:46:49.920
might contest British domination,
not the indigenous peoples,

735
00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:54.900
but the other powers,
uh,
in Africa.
And so,
uh,

736
00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:59.790
be prepared.
BP The same thing,
the same initials,

737
00:46:59.791 --> 00:47:03.540
beaker it now that Sko,
anyone here a scout?
I had to memorize this stuff.

738
00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:06.840
I could didn't get a single badge but at scout be prepared.

739
00:47:06.841 --> 00:47:11.640
You're supposed to do that.
The Jam Burrito,
he creates these jam Marie's.
Um,

740
00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:15.630
and,
um,
in May also at the same time,
I don't have time to talk about this,

741
00:47:15.631 --> 00:47:19.380
but this is the same time when Arthur Conan Doyle Conan Doyle and you know,

742
00:47:19.381 --> 00:47:23.160
the idea of sleuthing,
but it was sort of an urban sloofing for,

743
00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:25.200
for evil doers in London and,

744
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:29.400
and sort of kind of merges a with all of that.
Um,

745
00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:31.390
and of boys who risked their life,
he says,

746
00:47:31.391 --> 00:47:34.660
I said to one of these boys on one occasion when he came through a rather heavy

747
00:47:34.661 --> 00:47:35.290
fire,

748
00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:38.470
you will get hit one of these days writing about like that and when shells are

749
00:47:38.471 --> 00:47:40.510
flying.
And he replied,
sir,

750
00:47:40.511 --> 00:47:43.510
I pedal so quickly they'll never catch me.

751
00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:48.070
Those boys don't seem to mind the bullets one bit.

752
00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:53.460
And of course millions of them would catch bullets that ultimately they serve

753
00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:58.420
they minded.
Um,
I will do my best to God and the king.

754
00:47:58.421 --> 00:48:00.670
I will do my best to help others.
Whatever it costs me,

755
00:48:00.671 --> 00:48:04.060
I know the Scout Law and I will obey it.
Again,
I am not knocking,

756
00:48:04.061 --> 00:48:06.370
doing good things for people.
Please do understand,

757
00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:10.270
but I'm just trying to place the origins of whatever you think of the boy scouts

758
00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:14.200
in the context of the imperialism of,
of uh,

759
00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:16.810
the culture of imperialism.
Cause that's where it belongs.

760
00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:21.220
And that's where it started.
In 1912 in August,

761
00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:25.390
a boat capsized off the coast of Devon,
I think,

762
00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:30.460
and nine boys from 11 to 14,
drown.
They were scouts.

763
00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:34.870
Um,
and there was an enormous,
enormous,
uh,

764
00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:40.100
of national funeral service in London in which millions of people,

765
00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:43.670
uh,
saw at least parts of it,
uh,

766
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:48.520
this helped their death and many more deaths would follow.
Help tie it together.

767
00:48:48.521 --> 00:48:53.320
The idea of scouting with service,
uh,
to,
uh,
the nation,

768
00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:57.100
um,
a magazine called the captain,
again,
this is part of,
of,

769
00:48:57.101 --> 00:49:00.310
of the culture of imperialism and of aggressive nationalism.

770
00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:04.300
Had a troop of mobile scouts on bikes have fitted with a rifle,

771
00:49:04.301 --> 00:49:08.300
beck bucket and a clip to carry a carbine,

772
00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:11.490
a rival.
Uh,
and so it,

773
00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:16.180
it shifts that the image of all of this shifts from,

774
00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:18.310
from Africa where,
uh,

775
00:49:18.490 --> 00:49:22.720
where much of the fighting was already over and indigenous people,
uh,

776
00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:25.930
destroyed or pacified to,
uh,

777
00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:30.550
the European enemies against whom the next tour would be,
uh,

778
00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:34.390
fought.
Um,
there's a famous cartoon in the British,
um,

779
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:38.830
and magazine punch,
which showed a boy scout you complete in uniform,

780
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:41.770
being prepared,
taking Mrs Britannia.

781
00:49:41.771 --> 00:49:44.410
That is the image of Victoria who was dead,

782
00:49:44.411 --> 00:49:48.040
but the female image of the empire by the arm and says,

783
00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:52.300
fear not grandma.
No danger can befall you.
I,

784
00:49:52.301 --> 00:49:55.870
after all,
remember I am with you now.

785
00:49:56.380 --> 00:50:00.130
Boy Scouts played an enormous role in,
uh,

786
00:50:00.131 --> 00:50:04.300
in 1914 and in the subsequent years.
Good,
good bye.

787
00:50:04.301 --> 00:50:06.820
I'm off to war.
Uh,
there was,
uh,

788
00:50:06.821 --> 00:50:10.120
a cartoon or a character in the newspaper as,

789
00:50:10.121 --> 00:50:14.740
as boy scouts joined up along with lots of other people who weren't scouts,
uh,

790
00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:17.860
in the war.
And as you well know,
um,

791
00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:21.670
they don't come back or a lot of them,
uh,
don't come,
don't come back.

792
00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:26.890
It's part of the mood of nationalism and of imperialism,
of the new imperialism.

793
00:50:26.891 --> 00:50:28.280
And two things are tied

794
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:32.750
<v 0>together and the expectation,
and indeed in many cases,
in the case of Baden Paul,</v>

795
00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:38.080
joyous expectation that you could test your virility in a more meaningful camp

796
00:50:38.441 --> 00:50:43.040
combat than simply slaughtering indigenous people or picking off bores,

797
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:47.600
uh,
with greater,
uh,
numerical superiority.
By the way,

798
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:48.351
Baden Powell,

799
00:50:48.351 --> 00:50:53.351
Robert Baden Powell died in Kenya in 1941 from which he had just sent his last

800
00:50:54.351 --> 00:50:59.351
patriotic message to the boy scouts in what was a very different war.

801
00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:01.850
Thank you.
I'll see you on Wednesday.
