1
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.600
Today I want to talk about about the Russian revolution.

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:07.890
Um,

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.880
and so I want to do just a couple of things at the beginning and then I'm going

4
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:12.230
to,

5
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.063
um,

6
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.270
and I hope you weren't in Jay's class,

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.040
uh,

8
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.070
the age of total war last year because I gave the almost the same much or in it.

9
00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:20.341
In fact,

10
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:21.330
I might've done it this year too,

11
00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:22.110
because you know,

12
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.591
as you know,

13
00:00:22.591 --> 00:00:25.430
I have him coming in and he has me go into theirs.

14
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.250
But what I want to do is see the revolution through the eyes of,

15
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:29.700
um,

16
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.200
of Nicholas and Alexandra,

17
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.160
uh,

18
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:32.820
for the last,

19
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.720
the last part,

20
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:34.231
but first,

21
00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:35.160
just a couple of things.

22
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.740
Uh,

23
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.840
at the beginning,

24
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:37.703
um,

25
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.580
picking up on something that,

26
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.030
that I said when we talked about 1848,

27
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:46.620
but the Russian revolution is a perfect way to see revolution as process at

28
00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:47.454
work,

29
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.710
uh,

30
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.060
because you're the revolution in February when we read the chapter,

31
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.900
uh,

32
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.500
the revolution of February is,

33
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.390
as I said before,

34
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.800
uh,

35
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.480
people wake up and they're not a lot of troops around and people are hungry and

36
00:00:59.481 --> 00:00:59.610
the,

37
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.190
and the,

38
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.023
and the revolution.

39
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.903
False.

40
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.493
I mean the,

41
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.533
uh,

42
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.030
I don't talk more about this in a minute.

43
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.610
The autocracy a false,

44
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:09.210
uh,

45
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.770
rather quickly and rather easily.

46
00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:14.730
And it's at that point when you got the provisional government of Koretsky,

47
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.990
it's at that point that as an 1848 and as in 17,

48
00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:20.490
89 and following years,

49
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.910
that people who want to shape the future of the country put in their claims.

50
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.520
And so that's when social and political conflict increase,

51
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.830
uh,

52
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.880
dramatically in the context of the wars.

53
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.211
Of course,

54
00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:34.890
I've just mind boggling,

55
00:01:34.891 --> 00:01:35.550
uh,

56
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.941
uh,

57
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:36.691
with the front,

58
00:01:36.691 --> 00:01:39.420
not all that far away from,

59
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.283
uh,

60
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.010
from pet,

61
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.550
from Petrograd because the Saint Petersburg was renamed petro guided at the

62
00:01:44.551 --> 00:01:46.140
beginning of the war because it was more,

63
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.460
uh,

64
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.660
more Russian name.

65
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.450
And so those groups like dementia,

66
00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:51.751
Vix,

67
00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:56.751
when we read about the Bolsheviks who I lending comes back on the sealed train,

68
00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.500
uh,

69
00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.221
the liberals,

70
00:01:59.221 --> 00:01:59.821
the cadets,

71
00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:00.810
the liberals,

72
00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:01.300
uh,

73
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.430
uh,

74
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.870
and those people who want to his Rs to a restoration,

75
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.190
uh,

76
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.620
and the socialist revolutionaries of which Kerensky was one,

77
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.160
uh,

78
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.551
who are,

79
00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:10.920
who have the most influence in Russia,

80
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:12.870
have any dissident party by far.

81
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.460
And they would be allies,

82
00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:17.790
especially the left wing of the socialist revolutionaries of,

83
00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:18.510
um,

84
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.811
uh,

85
00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:21.720
of the Bolsheviks after the Bolshevik seizure of power.

86
00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:22.231
And then of course,

87
00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:23.490
they're just dismissed,

88
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.180
uh,

89
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.750
and,

90
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.410
uh,

91
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.591
you know,

92
00:02:25.591 --> 00:02:26.251
persecuted,

93
00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:26.821
like it light,

94
00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:27.660
like the others.

95
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.480
Uh,

96
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.711
uh,

97
00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:30.630
but they all put forward their claims.

98
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:32.700
And so all of the kinds of tensions and the,

99
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.020
the Corner Law Firm,

100
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.620
uh,

101
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.160
uh,

102
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.030
in quotes,

103
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.301
uh,

104
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:36.990
plot,

105
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.320
uh,

106
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.220
which you can read about and the July days and all of that really reflect the

107
00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:42.240
revolutionary process.

108
00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:42.661
And of course,

109
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:43.441
what happens in,

110
00:02:43.441 --> 00:02:43.681
in,

111
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:44.490
um,

112
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.890
uh,

113
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:45.450
in,

114
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.781
uh,

115
00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:47.520
October is the Bolsheviks,

116
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.091
uh,

117
00:02:48.091 --> 00:02:49.770
after one attempt that didn't work,

118
00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:52.830
the Bolsheviks are able to seize power.

119
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.791
Uh,

120
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:54.660
and so Trotsky,

121
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:55.231
who ends up,

122
00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:55.381
as,

123
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:55.681
you know,

124
00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:57.300
with the ice pick planted,

125
00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.540
uh,

126
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.530
through his neck in,

127
00:02:58.531 --> 00:03:00.370
in a garden in Mexico City,

128
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.391
uh,

129
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:03.550
assassinated on the orders of stolen,

130
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.650
um,

131
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.030
and,

132
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.241
and,

133
00:03:05.241 --> 00:03:05.950
and learning.

134
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:06.151
And,

135
00:03:06.151 --> 00:03:06.391
and,

136
00:03:06.391 --> 00:03:06.791
and,

137
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:07.510
uh,

138
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.710
and the very young,

139
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.170
uh,

140
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.630
Stalin who was in,

141
00:03:11.631 --> 00:03:12.640
in jail,

142
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:13.031
uh,

143
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:13.211
I mean,

144
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:14.020
he's in,

145
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.840
he's in Siberia at the time of the February revolution.

146
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.561
Uh,

147
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:19.510
the Bolsheviks come to power and,

148
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:20.051
and,

149
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:20.291
uh,

150
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:22.750
the Soviet Union is created.

151
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:25.390
And a next week I'll talk about,

152
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.631
uh,

153
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:28.810
about Stalin and installing ism.

154
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.711
Uh,

155
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:30.750
but today it's enough to,

156
00:03:30.751 --> 00:03:31.600
to talk about,

157
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.080
um,

158
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.920
about the Russian,

159
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.650
uh,

160
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.950
uh,

161
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:34.810
a revolution.

162
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.370
And so before I go back and,

163
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:36.930
and,

164
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:37.450
um,

165
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.450
tell you about a Alexandra and I about to Nicholas and Alexandra and,

166
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.970
and the crazed Rasputin,

167
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.790
uh,

168
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.130
and those folks,

169
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.920
um,

170
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.630
uh,

171
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.841
you know,

172
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:50.501
there it is.

173
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:50.860
Um,

174
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.041
you know,

175
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:53.020
nobody expected there'd be a revolution.

176
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.903
I,

177
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.970
the revolution,

178
00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:57.400
the Marxist revolution or version would come to Russia.

179
00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.563
Um,

180
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.460
that populace,

181
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.943
uh,

182
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.000
who in the middle decades of the,

183
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:05.350
of the 19th century,

184
00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:09.670
believed that the Russian peasantry wasn't potentially revolutionary force.

185
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.851
I mean,

186
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:10.331
people like,

187
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:11.260
like Buck Union,

188
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.420
I'm whom I've talked about before,

189
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:14.171
you know,

190
00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:15.010
they thought that the,

191
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:17.650
that the peasants would rise up one day and,

192
00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:18.340
and,

193
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.060
uh,

194
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.810
uh,

195
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.370
sweep away their,

196
00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:22.610
their masters,

197
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.900
uh,

198
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:23.580
who,

199
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.900
uh,

200
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.940
to whom they were,

201
00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:25.750
uh,

202
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.021
uh,

203
00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:29.380
indentured as serfs until 1861.

204
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:29.471
Now,

205
00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:31.540
that's not that long before,

206
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.583
um,

207
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.981
uh,

208
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:35.380
before World War One and all of that.

209
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.611
But you know,

210
00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:37.331
for marks,

211
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:37.541
I mean,

212
00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:42.130
the revolution had to come where you had a class conscious proletariat that had

213
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:44.350
been organized by this,

214
00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:46.600
a revolutionary elite,

215
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.220
sort of a top down,

216
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.083
organized,

217
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.560
revolutionary leap.

218
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.530
And,

219
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.980
and then that would come in in Germany,

220
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.851
uh,

221
00:04:54.851 --> 00:04:55.684
in Britain,

222
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.641
you know,

223
00:04:56.641 --> 00:04:57.640
in France,

224
00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.841
eventually,

225
00:04:58.841 --> 00:05:00.490
maybe in the United States.

226
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.781
And you know,

227
00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:03.490
after the Bolshevik revolution,

228
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:04.720
uh,

229
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.931
you know,

230
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:07.960
Lennon is still convinced that the revolution isn't going to come in Germany.

231
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.561
Uh,

232
00:05:08.561 --> 00:05:08.981
in fact,

233
00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:11.230
the spartacists do rise.

234
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.650
There were a real far left revolutionary group full of some very good people

235
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:15.401
incidentally,

236
00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:17.590
like Rosa Luxemburg who ends up being murdered.

237
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.050
I was born in south motion in,

238
00:05:20.051 --> 00:05:20.680
uh,

239
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.130
in,

240
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.790
uh,

241
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:22.511
what then was,

242
00:05:22.511 --> 00:05:24.040
was a Russian,

243
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.660
a Russian Poland,

244
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.321
uh,

245
00:05:26.321 --> 00:05:26.621
you know,

246
00:05:26.621 --> 00:05:27.250
they,

247
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.830
but,

248
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:28.350
uh,

249
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.440
the revolution was,

250
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.450
had to come where you had an industrial proletariat,

251
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.093
but it doesn't,

252
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.713
or does it?

253
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.620
So let me just Ben,

254
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.590
little ambiguous there.

255
00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:43.450
But let me say that because the revolution starts in Petro God,

256
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.303
that the,

257
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.310
that the way petro God was in 1917 and administrative czarist autocratic capital

258
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:56.020
constructed by Peter the grade,

259
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.090
but also a huge,

260
00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:00.050
enormous,

261
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.651
uh,

262
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:05.651
industrial center with hundreds of thousands of industrial workers.

263
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.850
Uh,

264
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:08.690
and the,

265
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.010
the historians still debate whether by October that is after February during the

266
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:17.300
provisional government time or the socialist revolutionaries or the Bolsheviks

267
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.910
had more influence in the Soviet.

268
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.980
That's where the Soviet Union comes from.

269
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:22.701
And the Soviet,

270
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:24.470
which organizations of workers,

271
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:25.250
uh,

272
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.830
sailors and soldiers.

273
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:29.330
Um,

274
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.530
but so,

275
00:06:30.531 --> 00:06:30.771
uh,

276
00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:32.120
I mean was Mark's,

277
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.310
Mark's wasn't all wrong about because the revolution that the role of industrial

278
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:38.720
workers in Saint Petersburg,

279
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.261
uh,

280
00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:39.741
is,

281
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:40.280
um,

282
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:40.700
uh,

283
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.881
you know,

284
00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:43.100
is very important in this.

285
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.740
And of course lots of them to get better.

286
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:44.931
I mean,

287
00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:47.480
they all get betrayed ultimately because what was going to be,

288
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:47.660
you know,

289
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:48.830
the Worker's Paradise,

290
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:49.250
uh,

291
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.100
it ain't that and work herself management,

292
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:55.280
it didn't become that then become that at all.

293
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.981
And they're,

294
00:06:55.981 --> 00:06:56.970
they're shocked when the,

295
00:06:56.971 --> 00:06:57.200
you know,

296
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.860
when the,

297
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.110
the red guards are putting down their strikes.

298
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.090
But in the beginning,

299
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.770
the role of the workers in on the periphery member center and periphery is

300
00:07:06.771 --> 00:07:07.604
terribly important.

301
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:08.601
And in,

302
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:09.170
um,

303
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.351
I mean,

304
00:07:09.351 --> 00:07:10.940
I talk a little bit about this in what you're reading,

305
00:07:10.941 --> 00:07:11.751
but you know,

306
00:07:11.751 --> 00:07:13.310
along the Nevsky prospect,

307
00:07:13.311 --> 00:07:13.840
you have,

308
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.540
you have,

309
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:14.751
you know,

310
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:15.890
government buildings,

311
00:07:15.891 --> 00:07:17.750
you've got the singer sewing machine company.

312
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.800
Uh,

313
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.011
you know,

314
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:21.800
you got tramways I haven't been to Saint Petersburg in,

315
00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:22.560
in a sense,

316
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.381
central told him to come.

317
00:07:23.381 --> 00:07:24.450
Ohad does since,

318
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.401
you know,

319
00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:26.990
since the f the fall.

320
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.153
But I mean re,

321
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.530
but a very fancy stores in,

322
00:07:30.531 --> 00:07:30.891
in,

323
00:07:30.891 --> 00:07:31.400
uh,

324
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.230
in 1917,

325
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:33.790
uh,

326
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.150
very dolled up people,

327
00:07:35.151 --> 00:07:36.260
very rich people.

328
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.340
Uh,

329
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:37.731
uh,

330
00:07:37.731 --> 00:07:38.461
and then the,

331
00:07:38.461 --> 00:07:38.721
the,

332
00:07:38.721 --> 00:07:39.740
the tramway,

333
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.130
I simply stopped in the mud when they reached,

334
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.050
uh,

335
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:48.590
the periphery when they reached their working class suburbs and the lights that,

336
00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:48.801
you know,

337
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:52.190
the glittering lights of the big department stores that would make you think of

338
00:07:52.191 --> 00:07:54.260
London and Paris and Berlin and Vienna,

339
00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:55.250
uh,

340
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.100
and the big fancy hotels and all lit up with,

341
00:07:58.101 --> 00:08:01.430
with the dorm and clicking their heels as the well heeled,

342
00:08:01.431 --> 00:08:02.270
enter and leave.

343
00:08:02.271 --> 00:08:03.530
Even during the war.

344
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:04.620
Uh,

345
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:05.453
you know,

346
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.170
the lights,

347
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:10.370
there weren't any lights when you got it or very few when you got into the

348
00:08:10.371 --> 00:08:11.210
working class.

349
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:11.630
Uh,

350
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.463
suburbs.

351
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.380
So the,

352
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:14.950
the,

353
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.510
the one thing that to keep in mind is that,

354
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:17.810
you know,

355
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.590
the Russian revolution both that of February and that of,

356
00:08:21.591 --> 00:08:22.040
of,

357
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:22.570
uh,

358
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:22.850
of,

359
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.490
of October was a popular revolution.

360
00:08:25.491 --> 00:08:26.990
This was no sort of coup d'etat,

361
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:27.411
you know,

362
00:08:27.411 --> 00:08:28.370
carried out by,

363
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:29.050
you know,

364
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:29.210
uh,

365
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:30.950
a couple of extremely organized,

366
00:08:30.951 --> 00:08:31.784
determined,

367
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:32.220
you know,

368
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.910
politicos and Lennon.

369
00:08:34.911 --> 00:08:36.680
He was organized and he was determined.

370
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:39.890
Lennon was not with the French will call Rigo Lowe.

371
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.900
He was not a barrel of laughs.

372
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:43.370
Uh,

373
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:43.701
I,

374
00:08:43.701 --> 00:08:45.680
he was sure of himself.

375
00:08:45.681 --> 00:08:46.220
Uh,

376
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:46.731
uh,

377
00:08:46.731 --> 00:08:48.440
he had very little sense of humor.

378
00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:49.640
He had sarcasm,

379
00:08:49.641 --> 00:08:50.960
biting sarcasm.

380
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.970
And I guess I quote once in there,

381
00:08:52.971 --> 00:08:56.400
he said when he would argue with somebody who said he was not understand,

382
00:08:56.401 --> 00:08:57.420
that understands nothing,

383
00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:58.741
he was very,

384
00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:00.360
very sure of himself.

385
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:02.300
Very Dif difficult man to get it.

386
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:02.610
Yeah.

387
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:03.930
I had to get along with,

388
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.793
uh,

389
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:05.290
and,

390
00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:05.490
and,

391
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.430
and they'll leave it to you to think was stolen ism inevitable.

392
00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:09.120
And letting is,

393
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:09.250
I'm,

394
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.260
I'm not so sure it was,

395
00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:10.501
but,

396
00:09:10.501 --> 00:09:10.801
but,

397
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:11.280
uh,

398
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.120
anyway,

399
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.060
uh,

400
00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.390
but the revolution was a popular revolution.

401
00:09:15.391 --> 00:09:15.631
I mean,

402
00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:15.701
the,

403
00:09:15.701 --> 00:09:17.160
the fall of the autocracy,

404
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.300
th th th th the,

405
00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:21.270
the masters did not rise up to save the czar.

406
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:22.970
<v 1>Okay.</v>

407
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:23.631
<v 0>They did not.</v>

408
00:09:23.631 --> 00:09:26.090
And there's our Heda and bread.

409
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.950
It'll land and peace,

410
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.120
bread,

411
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.490
land and peace is a very,

412
00:09:31.491 --> 00:09:32.250
very,

413
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:32.511
uh,

414
00:09:32.511 --> 00:09:37.511
important slogan when you've got New Orleans of people under arms from all of

415
00:09:37.791 --> 00:09:38.960
the nationalities.

416
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:40.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

417
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.410
<v 0>Some of whom didn't know Russian at all.</v>

418
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:43.390
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

419
00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:44.860
<v 0>Many of whom when they go into the war,</v>

420
00:09:44.861 --> 00:09:45.431
don't know the difference.

421
00:09:45.431 --> 00:09:47.470
When a gun in a and a pitchfork,

422
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:49.383
uh,

423
00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.111
and you know,

424
00:09:50.111 --> 00:09:50.831
until the very end,

425
00:09:50.831 --> 00:09:54.250
Nicholas and Alexandra who are not very lovable people,

426
00:09:54.251 --> 00:09:56.980
one can feel sorry for them and you will feel sorry for them.

427
00:09:56.981 --> 00:09:58.120
They ended horribly.

428
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:59.051
Uh,

429
00:09:59.051 --> 00:09:59.920
but there was this sort of,

430
00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:01.270
they still had the belief that,

431
00:10:01.271 --> 00:10:01.461
that,

432
00:10:01.461 --> 00:10:01.751
that,

433
00:10:01.751 --> 00:10:02.310
uh,

434
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.530
uh,

435
00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:05.500
that the Russian people a love there's are,

436
00:10:05.501 --> 00:10:09.850
and that they would pour forward to save the czar and the Zarina and the

437
00:10:09.851 --> 00:10:10.690
autocracy,

438
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:11.800
uh,

439
00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.730
and they didn't.

440
00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.260
And then the treaty of breath,

441
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.960
the Tufts March,

442
00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:17.793
1918 polls,

443
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.640
uh,

444
00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.940
pulls Russia out of the war and all of that.

445
00:10:21.941 --> 00:10:25.780
So that's just a couple of things at the beginning to the say in it and it's all

446
00:10:25.781 --> 00:10:26.291
in the book,

447
00:10:26.291 --> 00:10:26.620
but,

448
00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:27.191
but it's,

449
00:10:27.191 --> 00:10:28.024
um,

450
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:28.571
you know,

451
00:10:28.571 --> 00:10:28.961
it's still,

452
00:10:28.961 --> 00:10:30.220
it's a very interesting revolution.

453
00:10:30.221 --> 00:10:33.240
There's a lot of great literature on the Russian Revolution in,

454
00:10:33.241 --> 00:10:33.821
in English,

455
00:10:33.821 --> 00:10:35.560
and I don't read Russian at all,

456
00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.161
uh,

457
00:10:36.161 --> 00:10:37.510
but in all sorts of languages.

458
00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:39.420
So now having a,

459
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:40.450
just sort of set that up,

460
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.410
reserved seating,

461
00:10:41.411 --> 00:10:42.250
VIP,

462
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.601
what is this?

463
00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:44.060
This is,

464
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:44.893
yeah.

465
00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:45.580
I don't know.

466
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.350
Anyway,

467
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:47.183
AH,

468
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.191
anybody there?

469
00:10:48.191 --> 00:10:48.851
Nobody there.

470
00:10:48.851 --> 00:10:49.211
So,

471
00:10:49.211 --> 00:10:49.750
uh,

472
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:50.350
uh,

473
00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:51.160
anyway,

474
00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:51.993
um,

475
00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:55.540
let's talk about,

476
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.290
um,

477
00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:56.921
did I do all that?

478
00:10:56.921 --> 00:10:57.754
Yeah,

479
00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:59.290
let's talk about,

480
00:10:59.340 --> 00:10:59.511
uh,

481
00:10:59.511 --> 00:11:00.700
Nicholas and,

482
00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:01.563
um,

483
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.280
and the Alexandra.

484
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:04.853
Um,

485
00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:09.923
hold on.

486
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:10.853
Um,

487
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:15.120
the Czar Nicholas was a family guy.

488
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:16.790
<v 1>Okay.</v>

489
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:17.090
<v 0>Uh,</v>

490
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:17.871
he enjoyed,

491
00:11:17.871 --> 00:11:18.320
uh,

492
00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.280
his family.

493
00:11:19.281 --> 00:11:20.060
Uh,

494
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.140
they played tennis,

495
00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:22.310
they were modern people.

496
00:11:22.311 --> 00:11:23.330
They had bicycles.

497
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:24.050
Uh,

498
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.900
they pedaled around the bicycle was relatively,

499
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:27.490
you know,

500
00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:28.610
recent invention.

501
00:11:28.611 --> 00:11:29.301
As you know,

502
00:11:29.301 --> 00:11:29.481
a,

503
00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:33.800
the first big bicycle races in Europe are already in the 18.

504
00:11:33.801 --> 00:11:35.300
I'm a nineties.

505
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:35.900
Uh,

506
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.840
but like his cousin Nicholas,

507
00:11:38.841 --> 00:11:42.980
the second he had some general education,

508
00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:46.430
I ended the political economy and math and geography,

509
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:47.450
uh,

510
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:48.560
in foreign languages,

511
00:11:48.561 --> 00:11:53.300
which he spoke very well and in middle in military science,

512
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:58.000
but he had very little intellectual interest at all.

513
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.630
And built into the way he looked at the world was this,

514
00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:02.530
uh,

515
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:07.530
this inherent suspicion of rationality of the enlightenment.

516
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.550
He would somebody who,

517
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:10.151
uh,

518
00:12:10.151 --> 00:12:15.151
and his wife also would still blame if he discussed it.

519
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:20.410
Peter the great for having really incorporated in some ways rational

520
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.270
organization and the alignment,

521
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.130
uh,

522
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:23.560
uh,

523
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.510
at least the works of the philosophic,

524
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:26.081
uh,

525
00:12:26.081 --> 00:12:27.010
into Russia.

526
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.680
A long before that,

527
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.670
he believed that war waging war was a matter of,

528
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:34.031
of,

529
00:12:34.031 --> 00:12:34.870
of honor.

530
00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.230
And in that he shared a lots,

531
00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:38.200
uh,

532
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:38.771
with his,

533
00:12:38.771 --> 00:12:40.030
a Wacko cousin,

534
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:40.930
Wilhelm.

535
00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:41.763
The second,

536
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.173
um,

537
00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:45.280
he was hardworking.

538
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.473
Uh,

539
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:47.201
he,

540
00:12:47.201 --> 00:12:48.011
I in the sense that,

541
00:12:48.011 --> 00:12:48.671
that he read,

542
00:12:48.671 --> 00:12:53.671
he read or listen to reports on all of that was going on about the war.

543
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:54.460
Uh,

544
00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.293
he,

545
00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:55.870
uh,

546
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.700
Mark Steinberg has published some of the letters of,

547
00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:01.840
of a mark Steinberg as a friend of mine who teaches at Illinois.

548
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:02.641
Um,

549
00:13:02.641 --> 00:13:04.000
and if I remember correctly,

550
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:04.571
I,

551
00:13:04.571 --> 00:13:05.230
he,

552
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:05.890
uh,

553
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:06.190
uh,

554
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:07.010
those are,

555
00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:07.960
those are belief,

556
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.771
believed that,

557
00:13:08.771 --> 00:13:12.940
that the nobles had compromised the fade of the autocracy.

558
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:13.391
Uh,

559
00:13:13.391 --> 00:13:15.520
in some ways are threatened it by being,

560
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.970
being,

561
00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:19.300
being indolent and not working hard enough.

562
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:23.980
His view was always that he was the father of his people,

563
00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:24.640
uh,

564
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.060
that he was the Holy Azhar.

565
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:27.521
And again,

566
00:13:27.521 --> 00:13:31.960
everybody's seen pictures of him standing as sitting on a horse blessing the

567
00:13:31.961 --> 00:13:35.290
kneeling soldiers as they're going off to fight.

568
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:35.921
Uh,

569
00:13:35.921 --> 00:13:40.921
in 1914 how he constantly referred to his ancestors.

570
00:13:41.531 --> 00:13:46.531
The Romanovs only the state which preserves the heritage of the past is strong

571
00:13:46.571 --> 00:13:47.261
and firm.

572
00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:48.094
He wrote,

573
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:52.930
we are still selves have sinned against this and God is punishing us,

574
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:54.130
punting,

575
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:55.810
punishing us with,

576
00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:56.040
uh,

577
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:56.873
the war.

578
00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:02.280
He took command of the Russian army in 1915 against the advice of his wife.

579
00:14:03.101 --> 00:14:04.690
He didn't usually go against the Weiss.

580
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:05.980
The advice of Nicholas,

581
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:06.341
I mean,

582
00:14:06.341 --> 00:14:07.174
if Alexandra,

583
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:07.660
uh,

584
00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:12.660
the advice of his ministers and the advice of the mad monk Rasputin uh,

585
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.710
obviously one of the reasons that people argued against this was a while.

586
00:14:19.711 --> 00:14:19.871
I mean,

587
00:14:19.871 --> 00:14:22.000
he really wasn't a military guy.

588
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:23.170
And B,

589
00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:24.910
if he doesn't go well,

590
00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:27.190
will people blame the czar?

591
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.860
Will the role of the czar,

592
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:30.191
uh,

593
00:14:30.191 --> 00:14:31.930
be a diminished?

594
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:32.951
Um,

595
00:14:32.951 --> 00:14:37.951
he had a strong sense of what he considered moral and it was shaped by,

596
00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:39.581
uh,

597
00:14:39.581 --> 00:14:40.450
his Orthodox,

598
00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:40.960
uh,

599
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.793
religion.

600
00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:47.730
His wife about whom I'll have more to say was a convert to Russian Orthodox.

601
00:14:49.611 --> 00:14:52.280
He didn't like many converts from one religion to another.

602
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:53.360
Uh,

603
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:53.930
was,

604
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:54.411
uh,

605
00:14:54.411 --> 00:14:56.570
absolutely fanatic in her,

606
00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:57.240
uh,

607
00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.100
attachment.

608
00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.713
Um,

609
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.380
he was more relaxed about religion than his wife was,

610
00:15:03.381 --> 00:15:06.350
but he often spoke about this or x to see,

611
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:07.130
uh,

612
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:10.640
religious ecstasy that he felt when he went,

613
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:11.031
uh,

614
00:15:11.031 --> 00:15:12.170
at a church.

615
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:13.340
Um,

616
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:13.641
you know,

617
00:15:13.641 --> 00:15:14.660
historians now say,

618
00:15:14.661 --> 00:15:14.961
well,

619
00:15:14.961 --> 00:15:18.560
it's too easy to shape a discourse about the Russian revolution around the

620
00:15:18.561 --> 00:15:19.790
influence of Rasputin.

621
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:20.661
Uh,

622
00:15:20.661 --> 00:15:21.381
but in fact,

623
00:15:21.381 --> 00:15:22.730
I'm Rasputin in a,

624
00:15:22.731 --> 00:15:24.580
in 1914 had worn that,

625
00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.410
that that war would bring God's punishment,

626
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:28.090
uh,

627
00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:31.610
upon Russia and great destruction and grief without end.

628
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.490
And,

629
00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:33.810
you know,

630
00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.230
Rasputin did have great influence with the family.

631
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:37.250
Uh,

632
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.120
in one letter,

633
00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:38.750
um,

634
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:39.051
again,

635
00:15:39.051 --> 00:15:39.750
this is mark,

636
00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:39.980
uh,

637
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:40.880
put this stuff together.

638
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:42.861
He wrote,

639
00:15:42.861 --> 00:15:43.310
um,

640
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:43.851
does our role,

641
00:15:43.851 --> 00:15:45.950
when I am worried or doubt fuller vexed,

642
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:50.180
I've only talked to Gregory for a few minutes to fuel myself immediately,

643
00:15:50.181 --> 00:15:52.670
suits and strengthened.

644
00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:53.601
Now,

645
00:15:53.601 --> 00:15:58.601
one of the reasons that Rasputin has so much influence on the royal family was

646
00:15:59.481 --> 00:16:03.440
of course tragic illness because Alexi,

647
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:09.470
the sun was a hemophiliac and haemophiliacs,

648
00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:10.430
um,

649
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.590
I guess now they can treat it easier than they could before,

650
00:16:12.591 --> 00:16:14.360
but when hemophilia x get a scratch,

651
00:16:14.361 --> 00:16:15.194
they can lead,

652
00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.860
the blood does not clog you late and,

653
00:16:16.861 --> 00:16:17.151
and you know,

654
00:16:17.151 --> 00:16:17.984
they can die.

655
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.090
And so he was always sort of,

656
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.340
you know,

657
00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:21.410
he was not in good,

658
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:21.900
uh,

659
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:22.670
a good,

660
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:23.030
good,

661
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:24.320
good health at all.

662
00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:25.873
Um,

663
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:31.420
he and Rasputin on a couple of occasions got lucky and predicted the end of,

664
00:16:33.051 --> 00:16:33.770
of a,

665
00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.420
a spell as he used to call him,

666
00:16:35.421 --> 00:16:36.620
or an episode,

667
00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:37.660
uh,

668
00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:41.420
of hemophilia a and everything worked out okay.

669
00:16:41.421 --> 00:16:42.920
And so this increases the,

670
00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:43.371
uh,

671
00:16:43.371 --> 00:16:43.870
this is,

672
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:47.000
increases the belief of,

673
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.580
of these parents in,

674
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.433
uh,

675
00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:51.363
uh,

676
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:52.320
in,

677
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.360
in the power,

678
00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:54.230
if you will,

679
00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.660
of of Rasputin.

680
00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.210
And when there was a mutiny in the navy,

681
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:00.771
he wrote,

682
00:17:00.771 --> 00:17:02.480
if you find me so little troubled,

683
00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.730
it is because I have the firm and absolute faith,

684
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.740
the destiny of my,

685
00:17:06.741 --> 00:17:07.490
of Russia,

686
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:08.420
of my own fate.

687
00:17:08.421 --> 00:17:12.890
And that of my family are in the hands of all mighty God who has placed me where

688
00:17:12.891 --> 00:17:13.724
I am.

689
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.380
Whatever may happen,

690
00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:20.680
I shall bow to his will and this kind of fatalism you would see to the end when

691
00:17:22.401 --> 00:17:23.360
after the revolution.

692
00:17:23.361 --> 00:17:25.600
And he's on a train and,

693
00:17:25.601 --> 00:17:26.434
and uh,

694
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:27.291
I,

695
00:17:27.291 --> 00:17:27.651
you know,

696
00:17:27.651 --> 00:17:27.791
he,

697
00:17:27.791 --> 00:17:28.050
he,

698
00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:28.883
he doesn't,

699
00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:29.950
he finally get you,

700
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:31.100
it has to turn back.

701
00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:31.640
Uh,

702
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.510
but he doesn't,

703
00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:33.681
he,

704
00:17:33.681 --> 00:17:35.510
this is her fatalism was part of it.

705
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.970
And maybe Rasputin by then that,

706
00:17:37.971 --> 00:17:39.800
that point was art was already dead.

707
00:17:39.801 --> 00:17:40.251
He'd been,

708
00:17:40.251 --> 00:17:41.084
he'd been,

709
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:42.920
he'd been assassinated.

710
00:17:42.921 --> 00:17:44.630
And even the story of his assassination,

711
00:17:44.631 --> 00:17:44.791
I mean,

712
00:17:44.791 --> 00:17:47.180
he was almost impossible to kill him.

713
00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:51.280
They kept hammering with huge rocks and pumping one bullet after another into

714
00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:51.960
them.

715
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.440
Uh,

716
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.270
the people that want to get them out of the way.

717
00:17:54.271 --> 00:17:54.441
And,

718
00:17:54.441 --> 00:17:54.610
and,

719
00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:55.170
and,

720
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:55.891
and they finally,

721
00:17:55.891 --> 00:18:00.090
after just sort of beating the hell out of and pumping one bullet after another,

722
00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:00.790
uh,

723
00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:02.310
into all parts of his body,

724
00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.900
or they threw him into a lake,

725
00:18:03.901 --> 00:18:05.490
weighted down with rocks.

726
00:18:05.491 --> 00:18:06.540
And when they brought the weight,

727
00:18:06.541 --> 00:18:06.960
uh,

728
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.300
uh,

729
00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:07.530
the,

730
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:07.860
the,

731
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.570
the body up and did an autopsy,

732
00:18:09.571 --> 00:18:11.220
they found out that he died of drowning.

733
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:12.511
But in any way,

734
00:18:12.511 --> 00:18:13.020
his,

735
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.350
his influence over the czar in a way create or helped a,

736
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:17.480
accentuated the,

737
00:18:17.481 --> 00:18:18.990
this sort of fatalism,

738
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:19.651
uh,

739
00:18:19.651 --> 00:18:20.484
that was,

740
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:21.323
uh,

741
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.470
almost predetermined.

742
00:18:22.471 --> 00:18:23.760
You could say by this,

743
00:18:23.761 --> 00:18:24.181
this,

744
00:18:24.181 --> 00:18:24.690
uh,

745
00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:24.841
uh,

746
00:18:24.841 --> 00:18:25.591
his religious,

747
00:18:25.591 --> 00:18:26.090
uh,

748
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:26.220
uh,

749
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.150
orthodoxy.

750
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:32.040
But if you're going to be the autocratic czar father of all the people,

751
00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:36.780
you don't want any PR schickl any political institution that's going to limit,

752
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:37.480
uh,

753
00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:37.890
uh,

754
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:38.723
your will.

755
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.140
Now the Duma,

756
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.560
uh,

757
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.340
the assembly had been created in 1905 after the revolution,

758
00:18:44.341 --> 00:18:46.230
which I trust that you have,

759
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.840
have read about in 1905.

760
00:18:48.841 --> 00:18:52.740
And the role of the Russell Japanese war in facilitating that,

761
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:56.910
he believed that even the existence of the Duma a would compromise,

762
00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:57.660
uh,

763
00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.050
the virtues of,

764
00:18:59.150 --> 00:18:59.971
of the Toc crecy.

765
00:18:59.971 --> 00:19:00.631
And as you know,

766
00:19:00.631 --> 00:19:00.801
the,

767
00:19:00.801 --> 00:19:01.980
the Duma loses,

768
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.511
loses what,

769
00:19:03.511 --> 00:19:03.831
what,

770
00:19:03.831 --> 00:19:03.960
uh,

771
00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.090
most of what authority and had given,

772
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:07.263
um,

773
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:08.040
that,

774
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.620
that the Duma seem to be a rational organization.

775
00:19:10.621 --> 00:19:13.050
And this didn't fit terribly when terribly well,

776
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:13.511
uh,

777
00:19:13.511 --> 00:19:14.970
in a worldview that,

778
00:19:14.971 --> 00:19:15.330
that,

779
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:15.990
uh,

780
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.291
that,

781
00:19:16.291 --> 00:19:17.730
that believes in faith,

782
00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:18.330
uh,

783
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:21.930
feeling as opposed to reason a and has a particular,

784
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.401
uh,

785
00:19:22.401 --> 00:19:24.690
in something that's peculiar idea of a,

786
00:19:24.691 --> 00:19:27.510
of morality shaped by the traditions of,

787
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.021
uh,

788
00:19:28.021 --> 00:19:29.460
of mother Russia.

789
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.540
Um,

790
00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:30.880
and,

791
00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:31.800
and he,

792
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:36.960
he and his wife to look back to this sort of imaginary time before Peter the

793
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:37.350
Great,

794
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:42.350
when the true Russia did not look westward at all and was not tempted by these,

795
00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:47.520
these foreign imports imports.

796
00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:48.151
Uh,

797
00:19:48.151 --> 00:19:50.040
and he idealize that time of,

798
00:19:50.041 --> 00:19:50.340
you know,

799
00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.450
piety,

800
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.230
uh,

801
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.180
the unity between the czar,

802
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:55.020
uh,

803
00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:56.040
and his people,

804
00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:56.980
the Nahad.

805
00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:57.940
Uh,

806
00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:58.890
in 1902,

807
00:19:58.891 --> 00:20:01.920
he wrote a letter to Alexandra when he was on tour.

808
00:20:01.921 --> 00:20:02.341
He said,

809
00:20:02.341 --> 00:20:06.690
we pass through large villages where the good peasants presented simple bread

810
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.273
and salt,

811
00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:09.121
a vert,

812
00:20:09.121 --> 00:20:09.960
which are very important in,

813
00:20:09.961 --> 00:20:11.130
in Russia.

814
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.450
And his coordination,

815
00:20:12.451 --> 00:20:15.330
they spilled the salt that was part of the ceremony.

816
00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:16.740
And that was a bad omen.

817
00:20:16.741 --> 00:20:18.510
He was very superstitious by the way.

818
00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:19.870
17 was,

819
00:20:19.871 --> 00:20:20.850
is unlucky number.

820
00:20:20.851 --> 00:20:22.950
He was terrified of 17.

821
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:23.933
And at us,

822
00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:29.180
there was a huge throng at his inauguration and a stampede and lots of people

823
00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:29.971
were killed.

824
00:20:29.971 --> 00:20:31.560
So that was a bad omen too.

825
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:32.340
But anyway,

826
00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:33.110
he said,

827
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.720
uh,

828
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.590
all the peasants presented simple bread and salt and all went down immediately

829
00:20:37.591 --> 00:20:40.020
on their knees showing such a touching,

830
00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:40.741
touching,

831
00:20:40.741 --> 00:20:41.880
childish joy.

832
00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:42.960
Uh,

833
00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.420
he had the image that the Russian people were childish,

834
00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.530
uh,

835
00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:47.080
that,

836
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:47.291
uh,

837
00:20:47.291 --> 00:20:49.900
that they and his wife insisted on this,

838
00:20:49.901 --> 00:20:50.261
that the,

839
00:20:50.261 --> 00:20:50.760
that the,

840
00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.150
that they loved being whipped.

841
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.250
They love being punished.

842
00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:56.520
Now since the abolition of the surf term in,

843
00:20:56.521 --> 00:20:57.160
in,

844
00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.570
in 1861,

845
00:20:59.050 --> 00:20:59.680
uh,

846
00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.513
uh,

847
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.680
there was lots of mistreatment of peasants by,

848
00:21:02.681 --> 00:21:03.461
by Lords,

849
00:21:03.461 --> 00:21:03.731
but,

850
00:21:03.731 --> 00:21:04.090
but,

851
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:04.450
uh,

852
00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:04.560
uh,

853
00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.730
you could no longer torture,

854
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.360
uh,

855
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.500
literally torture a serf.

856
00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:10.091
So long as,

857
00:21:10.091 --> 00:21:13.210
as he didn't die and before 1861,

858
00:21:13.211 --> 00:21:15.850
if you torture to surf and he did die,

859
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:19.840
or if you just exited them a ordered him killed or kill them yourself,

860
00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.670
you receive a small fine.

861
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:23.050
Um,

862
00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.850
but still there was this idea that,

863
00:21:24.851 --> 00:21:25.684
that,

864
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:26.980
uh,

865
00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:27.760
that,

866
00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.061
uh,

867
00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:32.410
that the know and that the people of good quote unquote good,

868
00:21:32.411 --> 00:21:37.411
virtuous and kindly will come to their senses and that they will not disobey

869
00:21:38.621 --> 00:21:39.520
during the war.

870
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:41.290
They will do what he told them.

871
00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:45.130
And until the end possibly,

872
00:21:45.131 --> 00:21:46.060
we don't know this,

873
00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:51.540
the idea that they will rise up and take him away from his captors in those

874
00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:52.181
final days.

875
00:21:52.181 --> 00:21:52.841
And they did try,

876
00:21:52.841 --> 00:21:53.531
there were attempts,

877
00:21:53.531 --> 00:21:54.430
but it wasn't the,

878
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.020
it wasn't ordinary people.

879
00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:57.041
So,

880
00:21:57.041 --> 00:21:57.760
um,

881
00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.750
he had these views of orthodoxy,

882
00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:02.651
autocracy,

883
00:22:02.651 --> 00:22:03.670
aristocracy,

884
00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:04.541
et Cetera.

885
00:22:04.541 --> 00:22:05.860
It's a romantic view.

886
00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:06.521
Uh,

887
00:22:06.521 --> 00:22:08.230
he preferred Russian foods.

888
00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:09.453
Um,

889
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.020
Peter the great like Russian food,

890
00:22:11.021 --> 00:22:13.960
but he also remember ripped roasts off tables in,

891
00:22:13.961 --> 00:22:14.181
in,

892
00:22:14.181 --> 00:22:15.070
in London and,

893
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:18.680
and drink tons of wine and things like that when he was in a,

894
00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:19.540
um,

895
00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:19.871
uh,

896
00:22:19.871 --> 00:22:20.280
you know,

897
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:20.460
in,

898
00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:20.661
in,

899
00:22:20.661 --> 00:22:21.790
in western Europe.

900
00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:23.043
Um,

901
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:24.183
he,

902
00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:24.880
he,

903
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.590
he spoke Russian obviously very well,

904
00:22:26.591 --> 00:22:29.920
but he spoke English with his wife because English was her,

905
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:31.180
was her language,

906
00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:31.511
uh,

907
00:22:31.511 --> 00:22:31.811
you know,

908
00:22:31.811 --> 00:22:32.644
along with,

909
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.001
along with,

910
00:22:34.001 --> 00:22:34.330
with,

911
00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:35.440
with some German.

912
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:36.783
Um,

913
00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:38.300
and again,

914
00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:39.160
uh,

915
00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:43.180
speaking English was part of the kind of aristocratic tradition of speaking

916
00:22:43.181 --> 00:22:45.730
other languages by the aristocracy,

917
00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:46.241
but not,

918
00:22:46.241 --> 00:22:46.790
but not,

919
00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:47.411
not Russian,

920
00:22:47.411 --> 00:22:47.831
because again,

921
00:22:47.831 --> 00:22:49.630
French and German was,

922
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:49.871
you know,

923
00:22:49.871 --> 00:22:50.740
they did speak Russian,

924
00:22:50.741 --> 00:22:51.551
but French and German,

925
00:22:51.551 --> 00:22:51.940
we're,

926
00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:52.900
we're sort of privileged,

927
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.590
uh,

928
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:54.423
languages.

929
00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:55.150
Um,

930
00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:59.260
and he had his feeling that he didn't like big cities.

931
00:22:59.290 --> 00:22:59.471
Uh,

932
00:22:59.471 --> 00:23:00.820
he had his retreat on,

933
00:23:00.821 --> 00:23:01.031
on,

934
00:23:01.031 --> 00:23:02.000
on the scene there,

935
00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:02.620
uh,

936
00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:02.711
uh,

937
00:23:02.711 --> 00:23:04.660
Saint Petersburg or petro God.

938
00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:05.560
Uh,

939
00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:10.560
he said that Moscow and Saint Petersburg were two needle dots on the map of our

940
00:23:10.871 --> 00:23:11.704
country.

941
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:12.430
Well,

942
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:13.510
in terms of percentages,

943
00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:13.811
uh,

944
00:23:13.811 --> 00:23:14.600
he was certainly,

945
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:14.860
uh,

946
00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:15.693
correct.

947
00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:16.061
Uh,

948
00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:20.080
and it was his idea to rename a Saint Petersburg a petro cloud because it was

949
00:23:20.081 --> 00:23:21.400
more a Russian,

950
00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.020
but he believed that,

951
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:23.500
uh,

952
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.230
and I've already spoken about this a little bit of that,

953
00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:28.180
that the heart of the empire,

954
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:29.170
uh,

955
00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:29.501
was,

956
00:23:29.501 --> 00:23:32.860
was Moscow because it was a religious capital of the empire.

957
00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:34.690
And that the skyline was dotted,

958
00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:35.201
uh,

959
00:23:35.201 --> 00:23:35.590
with,

960
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:38.020
with churches and not by a government,

961
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:38.370
uh,

962
00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:38.801
uh,

963
00:23:38.801 --> 00:23:39.670
buildings,

964
00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:40.001
uh,

965
00:23:40.001 --> 00:23:40.390
that,

966
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.870
that,

967
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:41.380
uh,

968
00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:44.620
part of having a modern army and a modern navy navy,

969
00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.380
uh,

970
00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.540
you had to have a bureaucracy and that,

971
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.290
uh,

972
00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:49.120
uh,

973
00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.580
petro rod was a bureaucratized city and not,

974
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:53.330
uh,

975
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:56.870
truly a Russian in its heart and its spirit.

976
00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.720
And he didn't spend much time in the famous winter palace,

977
00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:00.530
uh,

978
00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:01.071
that of,

979
00:24:01.071 --> 00:24:02.060
of the siege,

980
00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:02.510
uh,

981
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:04.760
in the Russian a revolution.

982
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:07.250
And when he moved to his,

983
00:24:07.251 --> 00:24:07.790
um,

984
00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:08.360
uh,

985
00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.140
when he,

986
00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:09.411
when he,

987
00:24:09.411 --> 00:24:10.850
when he went to his provincial,

988
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:11.460
uh,

989
00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:12.070
uh,

990
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:13.610
a resort,

991
00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:13.780
uh,

992
00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:15.050
on the sea where I've been,

993
00:24:15.051 --> 00:24:16.010
but a long time ago,

994
00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:16.490
uh,

995
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:18.320
he had a new church built there,

996
00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.090
but in the Moscow style,

997
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:20.300
the,

998
00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.100
in the original Moscow style,

999
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:27.450
now Nicholas and Alexander Alexandra,

1000
00:24:27.451 --> 00:24:27.740
Huh.

1001
00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:28.573
Excuse me.

1002
00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:30.890
Were raving antisemites.

1003
00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.290
And that's why it's amazing.

1004
00:24:33.291 --> 00:24:34.190
This is business about,

1005
00:24:34.191 --> 00:24:34.371
you don't,

1006
00:24:34.371 --> 00:24:34.601
can't,

1007
00:24:34.601 --> 00:24:35.211
I don't know if they didn't,

1008
00:24:35.211 --> 00:24:37.010
they canonize them as a saint or something.

1009
00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.210
I really don't know.

1010
00:24:38.211 --> 00:24:38.551
But it's,

1011
00:24:38.551 --> 00:24:38.961
it's a,

1012
00:24:38.961 --> 00:24:39.794
that's horrific.

1013
00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:43.290
He loved the black hundreds who had sparked and,

1014
00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:43.731
and,

1015
00:24:43.731 --> 00:24:44.151
and,

1016
00:24:44.151 --> 00:24:44.271
uh,

1017
00:24:44.271 --> 00:24:44.900
you know,

1018
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.460
in the pool go home,

1019
00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:46.830
uh,

1020
00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:50.180
particularly in Crimea in 1905 and had beaten Jews to death.

1021
00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:55.330
He thought that they represented the true heart of,

1022
00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.393
of Russia.

1023
00:24:57.050 --> 00:24:57.411
Um,

1024
00:24:57.411 --> 00:25:02.090
his interpretation was that the pogrom were the pious rage.

1025
00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:03.980
I think that's Mark's phrase,

1026
00:25:03.981 --> 00:25:05.330
but not his,

1027
00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:05.871
but again,

1028
00:25:05.871 --> 00:25:07.550
here's his against,

1029
00:25:07.551 --> 00:25:12.410
and I unfortunately quote the Poles and the yields that is,

1030
00:25:12.411 --> 00:25:12.960
uh,

1031
00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:13.120
uh,

1032
00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:13.431
you know,

1033
00:25:13.431 --> 00:25:14.264
a slang,

1034
00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:14.870
uh,

1035
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:15.703
horrible,

1036
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:15.981
uh,

1037
00:25:15.981 --> 00:25:16.221
you know,

1038
00:25:16.221 --> 00:25:16.761
racist,

1039
00:25:16.761 --> 00:25:17.120
uh,

1040
00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:21.860
ethnic denunciation of people who happen to be Jewish who had agitated and

1041
00:25:21.861 --> 00:25:24.530
brought about the concessions of 1905,

1042
00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.900
that the revolution of 1905,

1043
00:25:26.901 --> 00:25:29.600
and until he went to his grave,

1044
00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.770
so to speak.

1045
00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:31.940
Uh,

1046
00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:35.750
he believed that the Russian revolution was the work of,

1047
00:25:35.751 --> 00:25:36.584
of Jews.

1048
00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:37.371
And incidentally,

1049
00:25:37.371 --> 00:25:37.901
because some,

1050
00:25:37.901 --> 00:25:39.230
some of the Bolsheviks,

1051
00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.510
a fair number of the Bolsheviks hadn't to be Jewish.

1052
00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:42.170
Uh,

1053
00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:43.190
this played into,

1054
00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.020
in the Russian civil war because of the,

1055
00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:45.720
uh,

1056
00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.750
the sheer brutality of,

1057
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:48.031
uh,

1058
00:25:48.031 --> 00:25:52.290
in the Russian civil war of the quote unquote white forces against the reds are

1059
00:25:52.291 --> 00:25:53.150
the Bolsheviks,

1060
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:53.721
uh,

1061
00:25:53.721 --> 00:25:54.370
was,

1062
00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:54.500
uh,

1063
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:55.333
often,

1064
00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:55.930
uh,

1065
00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:56.240
uh,

1066
00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:56.780
part of,

1067
00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:57.021
uh,

1068
00:25:57.021 --> 00:25:57.270
you know,

1069
00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:58.480
just sort of extension of,

1070
00:25:58.481 --> 00:25:58.711
of,

1071
00:25:58.711 --> 00:25:59.001
of,

1072
00:25:59.001 --> 00:25:59.400
of,

1073
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.100
uh,

1074
00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.640
of antisemitism,

1075
00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:02.240
uh,

1076
00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.620
run a wild.

1077
00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:04.731
Anyway,

1078
00:26:04.731 --> 00:26:05.690
Nicholas wrote that,

1079
00:26:05.691 --> 00:26:06.051
that,

1080
00:26:06.051 --> 00:26:06.490
uh,

1081
00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:06.920
uh,

1082
00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:11.920
that the deaths of these people of the Jews in 1905 was justified harm be fell

1083
00:26:13.291 --> 00:26:14.270
not only the kids,

1084
00:26:14.271 --> 00:26:15.920
but also Russian agitators,

1085
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:17.210
engineers,

1086
00:26:17.211 --> 00:26:17.781
lawyers,

1087
00:26:17.781 --> 00:26:19.100
and all other bad people.

1088
00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:20.923
Uh,

1089
00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:21.621
and,

1090
00:26:21.621 --> 00:26:22.310
uh,

1091
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:23.143
well anyway,

1092
00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:23.751
his,

1093
00:26:23.751 --> 00:26:24.584
I mean it's very sad,

1094
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:25.850
but his,

1095
00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:30.770
there's lots of complexity built into his,

1096
00:26:30.771 --> 00:26:31.281
his,

1097
00:26:31.281 --> 00:26:32.114
uh,

1098
00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:33.200
he is being,

1099
00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:33.831
on one hand,

1100
00:26:33.831 --> 00:26:34.790
he's supposed to be the,

1101
00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:36.650
the tsar of all the people.

1102
00:26:36.651 --> 00:26:37.850
He's supposed to be ruthless.

1103
00:26:37.851 --> 00:26:39.080
He's supposed to be tough,

1104
00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:40.393
hard,

1105
00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.091
et Cetera,

1106
00:26:41.091 --> 00:26:41.924
et cetera.

1107
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:43.020
Um,

1108
00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:43.980
but on the other hand,

1109
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.890
he's dominated by his wife.

1110
00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.293
Um,

1111
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:48.960
and,

1112
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.171
uh,

1113
00:26:49.171 --> 00:26:52.860
his wife has constantly urging him in her letters to him to be harsh,

1114
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.780
demonstrate quote,

1115
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:59.990
the power of your will and your decisiveness show you're the complete autocrat.

1116
00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.131
Without whom,

1117
00:27:02.131 --> 00:27:02.790
quote,

1118
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:04.230
Russia cannot exist.

1119
00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:05.691
Um,

1120
00:27:05.691 --> 00:27:07.890
my love when it lasts,

1121
00:27:07.891 --> 00:27:12.120
where you some with your hand upon the table and scream at those who act

1122
00:27:12.121 --> 00:27:12.954
wrongly.

1123
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:15.210
They didn't not fear you enough,

1124
00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:17.340
but indeed they must.

1125
00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:18.930
Oh my boy.

1126
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.920
Make one tremble before you to love you is not enough.

1127
00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:27.540
They must obey you.

1128
00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:33.680
Show to all that you are the baster and that your will will be obeyed.

1129
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:36.330
He signed one letter to his wife,

1130
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:37.463
quote,

1131
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:39.570
ever your poor little Hussy.

1132
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.010
That's an odd choice of word

1133
00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:46.560
with a tiny will with a tiny will.

1134
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.460
She was born in Germany,

1135
00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:52.080
a princess,

1136
00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.120
and these royals,

1137
00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:55.740
as I've stressed,

1138
00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.390
they're all in our married.

1139
00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.500
She's the granddaughter of Queen Victoria of England.

1140
00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:03.600
Uh,

1141
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.990
she had identity with Hessa,

1142
00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:06.531
[inaudible],

1143
00:28:06.531 --> 00:28:07.364
Stott,

1144
00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.110
the part of Germany in which he was born.

1145
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.180
And as I said,

1146
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:15.900
although she spoke English at home and with her children,

1147
00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:17.160
uh,

1148
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:21.210
she had been a convert to Russian orthodoxy.

1149
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:26.010
She also feared or resented idleness.

1150
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:26.830
She,

1151
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:27.330
uh,

1152
00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:28.530
thought it was important to work.

1153
00:28:28.531 --> 00:28:30.480
She was a nurse for her children.

1154
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.250
She worked for her son above all.

1155
00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:33.151
She worked very,

1156
00:28:33.151 --> 00:28:34.050
very hard.

1157
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.470
Uh,

1158
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:39.470
she wanted to keep her daughter's quote from foolish gossip and a way from being

1159
00:28:39.931 --> 00:28:40.470
quote,

1160
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:43.170
idle and list and listless.

1161
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:45.680
She was fanatically religious.

1162
00:28:45.681 --> 00:28:50.681
You went to church every day and she was intolerant of those people who did not.

1163
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:53.341
And again,

1164
00:28:53.341 --> 00:28:55.320
this turns them toward Rasputin.

1165
00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:56.333
Now again,

1166
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:59.340
Rasputin did not make the bite by being who he was,

1167
00:28:59.341 --> 00:29:00.210
the Russian revolution.

1168
00:29:00.211 --> 00:29:01.320
It's a popular revolution,

1169
00:29:01.321 --> 00:29:02.040
but still,

1170
00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:02.221
you know,

1171
00:29:02.221 --> 00:29:04.350
he's there lurking in the shadows.

1172
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:05.371
She said,

1173
00:29:05.371 --> 00:29:06.204
recipe Putin,

1174
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.980
God has given rescue and more insight,

1175
00:29:07.981 --> 00:29:08.760
wisdom,

1176
00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:09.061
uh,

1177
00:29:09.061 --> 00:29:09.750
and,

1178
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.890
uh,

1179
00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:12.390
enlightenment than all of,

1180
00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:13.140
uh,

1181
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:13.770
the,

1182
00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:16.020
the czars advisers.

1183
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:17.130
And at home,

1184
00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.400
she reinforces the ideas that any kind of compromise,

1185
00:29:20.401 --> 00:29:21.840
constitutional compromise,

1186
00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:22.530
uh,

1187
00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:23.363
was,

1188
00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:24.600
was dangerous.

1189
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:26.430
And she believed that until the end,

1190
00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:30.000
that that Saint Petersburg petro cod was a rotten town,

1191
00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.680
not rushing at all.

1192
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:35.220
And as for the black hundreds who had murdered all the Jews,

1193
00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:36.690
they represented a quote,

1194
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.210
the healthy right thinking Russians,

1195
00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.440
the Russian people love to be whipped.

1196
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.210
She said that was a quote.

1197
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.170
Um,

1198
00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:48.700
she believed it was in the Slavic nature and they use over and over the world.

1199
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:53.260
The word childish in describing the Russian people.

1200
00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:54.490
Um,

1201
00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:55.990
the Progressive Block,

1202
00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:56.350
uh,

1203
00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:57.640
which I sent around,

1204
00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:58.470
uh,

1205
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.700
uh,

1206
00:29:58.700 --> 00:29:59.141
on,

1207
00:29:59.141 --> 00:29:59.500
uh,

1208
00:29:59.500 --> 00:29:59.861
uh,

1209
00:29:59.861 --> 00:30:01.120
on the website.

1210
00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.140
Um,

1211
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.760
she believed that that the prayer,

1212
00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:05.930
the existence of the progressive block wood,

1213
00:30:05.931 --> 00:30:09.580
which we wouldn't have been really possible had it not been for war one.

1214
00:30:09.581 --> 00:30:14.581
That's one way world war one gives opportunity to Russian dissidents to get

1215
00:30:15.341 --> 00:30:17.920
together in ways that they couldn't have otherwise.

1216
00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.300
It makes possible,

1217
00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:20.020
uh,

1218
00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:20.261
the,

1219
00:30:20.261 --> 00:30:20.501
the,

1220
00:30:20.501 --> 00:30:21.400
the operation,

1221
00:30:21.401 --> 00:30:26.401
the creation and operation of voluntary associations that are bringing people

1222
00:30:26.621 --> 00:30:30.340
together to try to send food and letters to the front,

1223
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.000
uh,

1224
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.910
to get news from the front that are not military secrets.

1225
00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:34.810
Eh.

1226
00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:38.890
And these inevitably began to think to imagine a world without the czar.

1227
00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:43.180
And there were people in 1905 who could imagine a world without the czar.

1228
00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:43.841
But again,

1229
00:30:43.841 --> 00:30:48.841
there are lots of people who are thinking about the postwar world and who

1230
00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:54.570
imagine or are planning beginning to plan for a reform Zara's.

1231
00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:54.910
Him,

1232
00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.460
it's very hard to say how many people,

1233
00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:58.090
uh,

1234
00:30:58.090 --> 00:30:58.391
could,

1235
00:30:58.391 --> 00:30:59.140
could,

1236
00:30:59.140 --> 00:30:59.750
uh,

1237
00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:00.190
uh,

1238
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:00.611
could,

1239
00:31:00.611 --> 00:31:01.030
um,

1240
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:05.500
comprehend the idea that Russia would not have a tsar.

1241
00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:06.610
Obviously the Mensheviks,

1242
00:31:06.611 --> 00:31:09.700
the socialist revolutionaries and the Bolsheviks,

1243
00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:10.500
uh,

1244
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:10.690
uh,

1245
00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:11.300
did,

1246
00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:11.531
uh,

1247
00:31:11.531 --> 00:31:13.900
a fuel that way.

1248
00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:15.040
Uh,

1249
00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:15.761
but all,

1250
00:31:15.761 --> 00:31:15.911
you know,

1251
00:31:15.911 --> 00:31:17.920
all of these dissident groups want,

1252
00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:18.370
uh,

1253
00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:19.690
want change,

1254
00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:24.670
but only the liberals and particularly the cadets Kaa d ts whom you can read

1255
00:31:24.671 --> 00:31:25.210
about,

1256
00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:25.720
uh,

1257
00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.201
want,

1258
00:31:26.201 --> 00:31:26.630
uh,

1259
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:27.490
the czar,

1260
00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:27.971
uh,

1261
00:31:27.971 --> 00:31:30.130
as armed autocracy to,

1262
00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:30.850
um,

1263
00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:31.001
uh,

1264
00:31:31.001 --> 00:31:31.834
to continue.

1265
00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:33.340
But until the very end,

1266
00:31:33.341 --> 00:31:36.460
Nicholas is determined to defend the awkward at the autocracy,

1267
00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:40.360
trying to transfer power to his brother when the revolutionary comes.

1268
00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:40.991
Michael,

1269
00:31:40.991 --> 00:31:42.700
who would be their reason for Alexi?

1270
00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.770
And then when told by his son's physician and imagine this,

1271
00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.670
that his son would not recover.

1272
00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:52.750
Uh,

1273
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:53.800
he tried to leave,

1274
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:54.280
uh,

1275
00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:58.360
the autocracy in the hands forever in his of his brother,

1276
00:31:58.660 --> 00:31:59.230
uh,

1277
00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:00.063
Michael.

1278
00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:00.311
Uh,

1279
00:32:00.311 --> 00:32:00.880
but,

1280
00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:01.151
uh,

1281
00:32:01.151 --> 00:32:01.984
in fact,

1282
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.770
uh,

1283
00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:05.470
he abdicated the next day and he,

1284
00:32:05.471 --> 00:32:06.850
and he really wrote only,

1285
00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:08.223
um,

1286
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.770
all around me is treachery,

1287
00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:13.330
cowardness,

1288
00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:14.753
cowardice,

1289
00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:15.460
uh,

1290
00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:16.990
and deceit.

1291
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:19.420
Now what were they going to do with them?

1292
00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:25.170
What do you do with the czar of all the Russians and Alexandra and their

1293
00:32:27.191 --> 00:32:28.024
children?

1294
00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.670
Now predictably enough,

1295
00:32:30.671 --> 00:32:34.170
the liberals and the cadets want,

1296
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:35.470
want to have them protected.

1297
00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:38.140
The Socialists,

1298
00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:40.730
basically one him,

1299
00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:41.480
uh,

1300
00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.291
to go on trial.

1301
00:32:42.291 --> 00:32:43.130
That is the Mensheviks,

1302
00:32:43.131 --> 00:32:44.600
the socialist revolutionaries and,

1303
00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:45.230
and,

1304
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:46.310
and the Bolsheviks.

1305
00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:47.690
But for a couple of days,

1306
00:32:47.691 --> 00:32:48.770
they don't do anything at all.

1307
00:32:48.771 --> 00:32:50.390
I've made good other things going on.

1308
00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:51.260
Uh,

1309
00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:52.410
they've got the war and,

1310
00:32:52.411 --> 00:32:52.901
and that,

1311
00:32:52.901 --> 00:32:53.061
you know,

1312
00:32:53.061 --> 00:32:55.640
I won't discuss the attitude of the provisional government to the war and the

1313
00:32:55.641 --> 00:32:58.310
kinds of pressures from the allies of course,

1314
00:32:58.311 --> 00:32:59.840
for them to keep the war going.

1315
00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:00.840
Uh,

1316
00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:01.481
and that is,

1317
00:33:01.481 --> 00:33:01.711
is a,

1318
00:33:01.711 --> 00:33:02.630
is handled in,

1319
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:03.270
uh,

1320
00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:05.570
handled it in textbooks in the textbook,

1321
00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:06.920
but there are more demands from,

1322
00:33:06.921 --> 00:33:11.300
from the public and from the Soviets in particular to arrest him.

1323
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:14.040
And so the provisional government wants,

1324
00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:18.770
they want to protect them and they finally ordered them confined to the resort,

1325
00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:19.300
uh,

1326
00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:19.491
uh,

1327
00:33:19.491 --> 00:33:21.700
which is called Czar School Slo,

1328
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:22.790
but the name doesn't matter.

1329
00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:23.481
Uh,

1330
00:33:23.481 --> 00:33:24.440
Nicholas himself,

1331
00:33:24.441 --> 00:33:25.310
he wants to go to Britain.

1332
00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:26.780
Uh,

1333
00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:30.920
and one day he wanted to live out the rest of his life with his family in

1334
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:31.783
Crimea.

1335
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:35.570
Now does the British government wants the tsar of all the Russian people to

1336
00:33:35.571 --> 00:33:36.500
arrive in London?

1337
00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.240
Not exactly a,

1338
00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.220
because it might complicate a,

1339
00:33:40.221 --> 00:33:43.610
the war effort and the Labor Labor will have no part of it at all.

1340
00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:46.190
And because you're dealing with a coalition in the war,

1341
00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:47.370
you can't have the czar,

1342
00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:47.990
you know,

1343
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.261
the,

1344
00:33:48.261 --> 00:33:48.560
the,

1345
00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:48.801
you know,

1346
00:33:48.801 --> 00:33:49.790
you're not going to be taking,

1347
00:33:49.791 --> 00:33:51.350
coming into seven 47 or something,

1348
00:33:51.351 --> 00:33:51.770
but,

1349
00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:52.130
uh,

1350
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:52.341
you know,

1351
00:33:52.341 --> 00:33:53.990
you can't have him coming up the river and the,

1352
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:55.040
and in the Tams.

1353
00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.320
And how are you going to get them there in the first place?

1354
00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:58.850
So that simply is,

1355
00:33:58.880 --> 00:33:59.510
is not,

1356
00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:00.050
um,

1357
00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:00.410
not,

1358
00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:00.740
uh,

1359
00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:01.573
practical.

1360
00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:02.420
Um,

1361
00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:04.190
and the liberals didn't want the czar there,

1362
00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:04.820
uh,

1363
00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:05.653
either,

1364
00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:06.320
uh,

1365
00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.890
but there were constantly rumors that the czar was going to be allowed to leave.

1366
00:34:09.891 --> 00:34:10.041
And,

1367
00:34:10.041 --> 00:34:10.551
and this,

1368
00:34:10.551 --> 00:34:10.671
uh,

1369
00:34:10.671 --> 00:34:11.900
there's lots of protests,

1370
00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:12.460
uh,

1371
00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:13.370
about that.

1372
00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:14.031
Uh,

1373
00:34:14.031 --> 00:34:15.410
Koretsky says that the,

1374
00:34:15.411 --> 00:34:15.541
the,

1375
00:34:15.541 --> 00:34:20.541
the revolution should show its moral worth by seeing that no harm came to the

1376
00:34:20.571 --> 00:34:21.410
royal family.

1377
00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:22.131
By the way,

1378
00:34:22.131 --> 00:34:23.210
just as an aside,

1379
00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.390
Kerensky lived a very,

1380
00:34:25.391 --> 00:34:26.600
very long life.

1381
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:28.310
And at the end of his life,

1382
00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:31.970
he taught this course at Stanford University.

1383
00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:33.411
And there's a story,

1384
00:34:33.411 --> 00:34:34.610
there's probably Apocryphal,

1385
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:35.480
uh,

1386
00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.590
that a student once,

1387
00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:41.360
this is in very contentious times in American politics in the late 1960s,

1388
00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:43.730
I can vaguely remember those days.

1389
00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:44.841
Uh,

1390
00:34:44.841 --> 00:34:49.330
and that a student not realizing what's Kerensky ask a question saying,

1391
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.590
how could their provisional government and be so stupid,

1392
00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:52.101
you know,

1393
00:34:52.101 --> 00:34:53.070
in their conduct of,

1394
00:34:53.071 --> 00:34:53.301
of,

1395
00:34:53.301 --> 00:34:53.541
of,

1396
00:34:53.541 --> 00:34:53.901
of,

1397
00:34:53.901 --> 00:34:54.380
uh,

1398
00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:55.430
of those operations.

1399
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.581
And,

1400
00:34:55.581 --> 00:34:55.871
and the,

1401
00:34:55.871 --> 00:34:56.720
the coolest person.

1402
00:34:56.721 --> 00:34:58.370
I had no idea that this was Koretsky,

1403
00:34:58.690 --> 00:34:59.200
you know,

1404
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.800
who was an historian.

1405
00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:03.410
It was trained as an historian and he died shortly thereafter.

1406
00:35:03.411 --> 00:35:03.701
But that,

1407
00:35:03.701 --> 00:35:04.011
that is,

1408
00:35:04.011 --> 00:35:04.580
uh,

1409
00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:05.241
that is really,

1410
00:35:05.241 --> 00:35:05.660
uh,

1411
00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:05.901
uh,

1412
00:35:05.901 --> 00:35:06.621
it's amazing thing.

1413
00:35:06.621 --> 00:35:06.861
Of course,

1414
00:35:06.861 --> 00:35:10.070
Lenin dies in 1,924 or 25,

1415
00:35:10.071 --> 00:35:11.780
but Krinsky went on and on.

1416
00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:13.070
So what they do,

1417
00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:14.570
they're in the park.

1418
00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:15.441
I mean,

1419
00:35:15.441 --> 00:35:15.741
they're in the,

1420
00:35:15.741 --> 00:35:15.891
in,

1421
00:35:15.891 --> 00:35:16.730
in the resort.

1422
00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:17.330
Uh,

1423
00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:17.620
uh,

1424
00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:18.321
their little palace,

1425
00:35:18.321 --> 00:35:19.280
they're mini palace.

1426
00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.140
They're allowed to,

1427
00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:20.380
to,

1428
00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:21.230
to take walks.

1429
00:35:21.231 --> 00:35:22.370
They could talk on the telephone,

1430
00:35:22.371 --> 00:35:26.690
but only in Russian and only in the presence of a guard who spoke Russian.

1431
00:35:26.691 --> 00:35:29.930
They could not speak German or they could not speak English.

1432
00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:30.830
Um,

1433
00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:32.840
they separated the family for a while.

1434
00:35:32.841 --> 00:35:34.430
Fearful of the influence on,

1435
00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:37.100
on Alexon of Alexandra on,

1436
00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:37.910
uh,

1437
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:38.580
I'm Nicholas.

1438
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:38.731
No,

1439
00:35:38.731 --> 00:35:39.031
again,

1440
00:35:39.031 --> 00:35:44.010
this is rather like the attitude that people had towards [inaudible] net and

1441
00:35:44.011 --> 00:35:45.950
Louie the 16th cause people w uh,

1442
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:46.560
uh,

1443
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.420
thought that the influence I'm Ranta network.

1444
00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:49.680
It was a on with that,

1445
00:35:49.681 --> 00:35:51.170
it was overwhelming on,

1446
00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:51.750
uh,

1447
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:52.380
uh,

1448
00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:52.860
on,

1449
00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:53.490
um,

1450
00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:53.791
uh,

1451
00:35:53.791 --> 00:35:55.380
I Louis the 16th.

1452
00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:56.221
Anyway,

1453
00:35:56.221 --> 00:35:58.500
then they were put back together and they didn't have much to do.

1454
00:35:58.501 --> 00:35:59.334
They gardened.

1455
00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.670
Uh,

1456
00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:00.720
they taught the children,

1457
00:36:00.721 --> 00:36:01.710
which they always had done.

1458
00:36:01.711 --> 00:36:02.431
They wrote letters,

1459
00:36:02.431 --> 00:36:05.700
they went to church and they complained that the soldiers were more and more

1460
00:36:05.701 --> 00:36:06.810
disrespectful.

1461
00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:07.710
They,

1462
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:08.070
they,

1463
00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:09.210
they were noisy.

1464
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.260
Um,

1465
00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.590
they were slowly in their dress.

1466
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:12.990
Slovenly and their address,

1467
00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:13.741
they're crushed.

1468
00:36:13.741 --> 00:36:17.550
Caps were set awry on a huge mops of unkept hair.

1469
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:21.930
Their coats were half buttoned and their nonchalant manner of performing their

1470
00:36:21.931 --> 00:36:26.931
military duties with a constant irritation and they mocked them.

1471
00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:28.440
Uh,

1472
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.670
the knock on the door,

1473
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.530
who's there and the answer,

1474
00:36:31.531 --> 00:36:32.311
who is there.

1475
00:36:32.311 --> 00:36:33.300
And the answer would come.

1476
00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:37.200
The czar of all the Russians and a Latvian guard,

1477
00:36:37.201 --> 00:36:37.710
uh,

1478
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:38.090
uh,

1479
00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:38.271
uh,

1480
00:36:38.271 --> 00:36:42.060
I'm near a commoner in quotes outside would be laughing.

1481
00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.580
Uproariously once he was peddling this,

1482
00:36:44.581 --> 00:36:48.450
ours peddling his bike and he goes by a guard who was a band nat and the gay the

1483
00:36:48.451 --> 00:36:48.691
bay,

1484
00:36:48.691 --> 00:36:51.240
the guy sticks his bayonet into the spokes of the,

1485
00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:51.871
uh,

1486
00:36:51.871 --> 00:36:56.871
of the wheel and the tsar of all the Russians went tumbling down and skinned his

1487
00:36:57.001 --> 00:36:57.834
knees.

1488
00:36:58.100 --> 00:36:58.350
Uh,

1489
00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:01.080
but yet there were rumors how a well there were eating when nobody else was,

1490
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:02.093
was eating.

1491
00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:02.880
Uh,

1492
00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:03.391
when,

1493
00:37:03.391 --> 00:37:03.541
uh,

1494
00:37:03.541 --> 00:37:04.650
the July days,

1495
00:37:04.651 --> 00:37:05.220
um,

1496
00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:05.500
uh,

1497
00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:05.981
many,

1498
00:37:05.981 --> 00:37:06.260
uh,

1499
00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.130
attempted revolution comes,

1500
00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:08.930
uh,

1501
00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:09.763
uh,

1502
00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:10.830
for their own safety.

1503
00:37:10.831 --> 00:37:12.510
Krantz he says they have to be moved.

1504
00:37:12.511 --> 00:37:14.850
And so they decided on a sub on Siberia,

1505
00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:20.110
so almost inevitably to a town called Tobolski where they're presumably be safe

1506
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:23.640
and they were moved on the August 1st,

1507
00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:26.460
1917 with train their windows covered up for most of the trip.

1508
00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:31.610
Like Lennon when he comes back is brought back by Germany to help to encourage

1509
00:37:32.251 --> 00:37:33.630
the Russians to get out of the war.

1510
00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:38.280
He goes on the famous sealed train so people can't see that it is Lennon because

1511
00:37:38.281 --> 00:37:39.330
people knew what he looked like.

1512
00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:40.380
The same thing,

1513
00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:40.861
you know,

1514
00:37:40.861 --> 00:37:44.430
the tsar of all the people are not going to be seen by the masses because what

1515
00:37:44.431 --> 00:37:47.100
if they tried to stop the train and pull them off that,

1516
00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.120
um,

1517
00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:53.120
ironically they passed by Rasputin's home village and Adidas House as a steam

1518
00:37:56.051 --> 00:37:56.640
boat,

1519
00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:56.880
uh,

1520
00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.670
took them via two rivers to this town of,

1521
00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:02.340
of Toll Bosca where I have never been.

1522
00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.630
This frightened them because they're,

1523
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.500
especially Nicholas is so superstitious,

1524
00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:08.071
you know,

1525
00:38:08.071 --> 00:38:09.120
the salt falling,

1526
00:38:09.121 --> 00:38:09.540
the Ma,

1527
00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:10.740
the stampede,

1528
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:12.360
the number 17,

1529
00:38:12.361 --> 00:38:15.630
and all of this is that when either pulled by the house or,

1530
00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:16.051
uh,

1531
00:38:16.051 --> 00:38:16.370
on the,

1532
00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:21.030
on the steamboat of the dead Rasputin his trusted advisor.

1533
00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:23.130
It is a bad omen.

1534
00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:24.060
Um,

1535
00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.640
and so they could now they could go to church when they arrive.

1536
00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.480
They play cars,

1537
00:38:27.481 --> 00:38:29.730
they perform place and you all from me,

1538
00:38:29.731 --> 00:38:30.564
which they did,

1539
00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:30.850
uh,

1540
00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:31.683
a lot.

1541
00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:31.890
Uh,

1542
00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:32.723
but as the co,

1543
00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:35.100
the counterrevolution was a very real threat,

1544
00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:36.040
uh,

1545
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:36.641
of course.

1546
00:38:36.641 --> 00:38:37.960
And of course the Americans and,

1547
00:38:37.961 --> 00:38:38.321
and,

1548
00:38:38.321 --> 00:38:38.800
uh,

1549
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:39.221
uh,

1550
00:38:39.221 --> 00:38:41.430
the British and the French after the bullshit of revolution,

1551
00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:43.420
if you want one reason that's to Stalin in the,

1552
00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:46.390
was so paranoid and he's clinically paranoid just to complete,

1553
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:47.410
you know,

1554
00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:47.890
uh,

1555
00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:49.090
dangerous crackpot,

1556
00:38:49.091 --> 00:38:51.640
but they had a lot to be paranoid about because the Americans and the British

1557
00:38:51.641 --> 00:38:52.750
and the French kept trying to,

1558
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:53.210
you know,

1559
00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:54.043
Undo,

1560
00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:54.650
uh,

1561
00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:54.870
uh,

1562
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:56.410
the Russian a revolution.

1563
00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:57.250
But anyway,

1564
00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:59.800
there were photographed and the ID cards,

1565
00:38:59.801 --> 00:38:59.921
I mean,

1566
00:38:59.921 --> 00:39:04.210
you can imagine the czar and there's arena having id cards like your Yale I id

1567
00:39:04.211 --> 00:39:05.044
cards.

1568
00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:05.710
Um,

1569
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:06.191
and,

1570
00:39:06.191 --> 00:39:07.024
um,

1571
00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:07.860
they're,

1572
00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:08.020
uh,

1573
00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:10.570
they start seeing obscene graffiti written,

1574
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:11.190
uh,

1575
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.620
uh,

1576
00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:15.080
new guards come in that they were thought to be a,

1577
00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:15.970
that were,

1578
00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:16.421
uh,

1579
00:39:16.421 --> 00:39:18.820
had even less respect for him than the other people.

1580
00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:19.540
Uh,

1581
00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:19.781
there,

1582
00:39:19.781 --> 00:39:21.310
there are serious attempts to,

1583
00:39:21.311 --> 00:39:21.880
uh,

1584
00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:22.510
uh,

1585
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:22.841
to,

1586
00:39:22.841 --> 00:39:25.000
to kidnap them and to,

1587
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.211
to,

1588
00:39:25.211 --> 00:39:26.170
to take them,

1589
00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:26.800
uh,

1590
00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:27.250
uh,

1591
00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:27.960
um,

1592
00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:28.110
to,

1593
00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:29.050
to get rid of them.

1594
00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:29.770
Uh,

1595
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:34.180
there was one in which monarchists we're supposed to be hidden under the altar

1596
00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:35.860
of or czarist,

1597
00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:36.520
uh,

1598
00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.230
under the altar of the church,

1599
00:39:38.231 --> 00:39:38.441
you know,

1600
00:39:38.441 --> 00:39:39.940
when they're in the service.

1601
00:39:39.941 --> 00:39:40.211
And this,

1602
00:39:40.211 --> 00:39:40.810
again,

1603
00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:42.820
these throwback to the revolution,

1604
00:39:42.821 --> 00:39:44.650
it was like the in French revolution.

1605
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:45.360
Uh,

1606
00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.750
there's a massacre starts at the,

1607
00:39:46.751 --> 00:39:47.410
at the,

1608
00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:47.850
uh,

1609
00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:48.160
the,

1610
00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:48.471
the,

1611
00:39:48.471 --> 00:39:48.870
the,

1612
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:50.830
the festival of the federation,

1613
00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:51.670
uh,

1614
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:53.890
when people are hidden under a,

1615
00:39:53.891 --> 00:39:54.790
under the church.

1616
00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:55.811
And so,

1617
00:39:55.811 --> 00:39:55.931
uh,

1618
00:39:55.931 --> 00:39:59.980
there are articles in the newspapers calling for the surveillance of Nicholas,

1619
00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:02.410
the bloody Romanov I,

1620
00:40:02.411 --> 00:40:03.400
and calls for him,

1621
00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:04.130
uh,

1622
00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:06.280
to be put on trial.

1623
00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:07.563
Um,

1624
00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:11.500
the arrival of a certain Vasily Jaco left the name,

1625
00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:11.751
uh,

1626
00:40:11.751 --> 00:40:12.581
you don't have to remember,

1627
00:40:12.581 --> 00:40:16.450
obviously sent by the central executive committee of the Soviets.

1628
00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:17.440
Uh,

1629
00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.420
he was a longtime revolutionary,

1630
00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:19.960
uh,

1631
00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.930
rumored subsequently to been an agent of,

1632
00:40:21.931 --> 00:40:22.131
of,

1633
00:40:22.131 --> 00:40:22.600
of,

1634
00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:23.450
of the Germans with,

1635
00:40:23.451 --> 00:40:24.520
which is preposterous.

1636
00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:24.851
I mean,

1637
00:40:24.851 --> 00:40:25.421
Lennon was,

1638
00:40:25.421 --> 00:40:29.440
rent was rumored to have been an agent of the Germans by his enemies because of

1639
00:40:29.441 --> 00:40:31.180
the way he got back to,

1640
00:40:31.181 --> 00:40:31.940
uh,

1641
00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:32.260
uh,

1642
00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:33.093
to Russia.

1643
00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:33.280
Uh,

1644
00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.990
after the initial,

1645
00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:35.231
uh,

1646
00:40:35.231 --> 00:40:36.190
revolutions.

1647
00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:37.173
He was a sin,

1648
00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:37.840
uh,

1649
00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:38.770
of a peasant.

1650
00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:39.370
Uh,

1651
00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:40.840
he had that kind of,

1652
00:40:40.841 --> 00:40:41.320
um,

1653
00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.400
curriculum vitae,

1654
00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:42.820
uh,

1655
00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:43.990
that lots of folks,

1656
00:40:43.991 --> 00:40:45.460
including styling had.

1657
00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:46.120
Uh,

1658
00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:46.721
he,

1659
00:40:46.721 --> 00:40:47.170
uh,

1660
00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:47.741
had,

1661
00:40:47.741 --> 00:40:48.490
um,

1662
00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:49.330
uh,

1663
00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:53.020
participated in holdups armed holdups to raise money,

1664
00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:53.650
uh,

1665
00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:54.380
for,

1666
00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:54.850
uh,

1667
00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:56.770
a revolution and became,

1668
00:40:56.771 --> 00:40:57.910
became a Bolshevik,

1669
00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:58.330
uh,

1670
00:40:58.330 --> 00:40:58.920
he,

1671
00:40:58.920 --> 00:40:59.140
uh,

1672
00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:02.590
transferred the czar and family to a much a smaller place.

1673
00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:03.310
Uh,

1674
00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:07.330
the tsar and his wife believed a naive Lee that they were going to be,

1675
00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:07.960
um,

1676
00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:11.320
taken to Moscow because Krinsky wanted,

1677
00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:12.250
uh,

1678
00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:12.610
uh,

1679
00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:14.260
because of the provisional government,

1680
00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:14.800
uh,

1681
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:15.520
wanted,

1682
00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:16.353
um,

1683
00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:17.320
originally,

1684
00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:17.680
uh,

1685
00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:21.290
before the provisional government has ended a wants to Nicholas to sign the,

1686
00:41:21.291 --> 00:41:22.510
the eventual peace treaty,

1687
00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:23.200
uh,

1688
00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:23.760
with,

1689
00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:23.931
uh,

1690
00:41:23.931 --> 00:41:24.820
the Germans.

1691
00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:26.043
Um,

1692
00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:26.801
but,

1693
00:41:26.801 --> 00:41:26.951
uh,

1694
00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:27.611
so,

1695
00:41:27.611 --> 00:41:27.821
uh,

1696
00:41:27.821 --> 00:41:28.271
this,

1697
00:41:28.271 --> 00:41:28.670
uh,

1698
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:31.780
Yaakov that was ordered to take his baggage as they called it,

1699
00:41:31.781 --> 00:41:33.070
that is the royal family,

1700
00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:33.801
uh,

1701
00:41:33.801 --> 00:41:35.630
to this small town,

1702
00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:36.140
uh,

1703
00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:38.990
in the year olds in the Ural Mountains.

1704
00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:39.651
But the,

1705
00:41:39.651 --> 00:41:40.190
you're all,

1706
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:42.590
you're all mountain Bolsheviks were harder to control.

1707
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:44.150
Remember the Russian revolution,

1708
00:41:44.151 --> 00:41:47.570
both the first one in the second have been an athlete described as a revolution.

1709
00:41:47.571 --> 00:41:48.500
By Telegraph,

1710
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:51.110
I mean the vast reaches of the Russian empire.

1711
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.531
So,

1712
00:41:51.531 --> 00:41:52.610
absolutely enormous,

1713
00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:53.180
uh,

1714
00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.440
that in many cases,

1715
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:55.070
uh,

1716
00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:55.311
uh,

1717
00:41:55.311 --> 00:41:57.620
it was a weeks in a few places,

1718
00:41:57.621 --> 00:41:59.290
months before any revolutionary call me.

1719
00:41:59.291 --> 00:42:00.710
Sarah arrived to,

1720
00:42:00.711 --> 00:42:01.250
to,

1721
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:01.580
uh,

1722
00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:03.350
to sort of inform people what's going on.

1723
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:07.850
And so lots of these Bolsheviks were sort of freelancers and for a party that

1724
00:42:07.851 --> 00:42:11.150
was extremely hierarchically controlled from the top down,

1725
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.930
uh,

1726
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:13.880
there was very little control over,

1727
00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:14.510
uh,

1728
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:15.350
the Ural,

1729
00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.180
uh,

1730
00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:16.430
uh,

1731
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:20.600
Bolsheviks I'm Nicholas had some trepidation about that,

1732
00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:21.020
uh,

1733
00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:24.320
because he heard that there was a quote wrote that there was a mood that was

1734
00:42:24.321 --> 00:42:26.360
rather harsh against him.

1735
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:27.021
Uh,

1736
00:42:27.021 --> 00:42:28.190
conditions were worse.

1737
00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:28.551
Uh,

1738
00:42:28.551 --> 00:42:29.960
they used to like to photograph,

1739
00:42:29.961 --> 00:42:30.500
uh,

1740
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:30.561
uh,

1741
00:42:30.561 --> 00:42:34.070
birds and things like that and bushes and their equipment was taken away from

1742
00:42:34.071 --> 00:42:34.251
them.

1743
00:42:34.251 --> 00:42:36.440
They could no longer control their own money.

1744
00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:38.480
The guards couldn't talk to them at all,

1745
00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:41.150
so they can only talk to each other.

1746
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:42.263
Um,

1747
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.910
uh,

1748
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:45.620
and some of the guards were,

1749
00:42:45.621 --> 00:42:45.891
were,

1750
00:42:45.891 --> 00:42:46.490
were just,

1751
00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:47.630
just awful to them.

1752
00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:48.351
Uh,

1753
00:42:48.351 --> 00:42:50.960
there were plans afoot to put them on trial,

1754
00:42:50.961 --> 00:42:51.170
the,

1755
00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:53.000
a kind of show trial.

1756
00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:53.930
Uh,

1757
00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:56.120
but there was also this possibility,

1758
00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:56.480
uh,

1759
00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:57.680
discussed that,

1760
00:42:57.681 --> 00:42:57.801
uh,

1761
00:42:57.801 --> 00:42:58.330
they might,

1762
00:42:58.330 --> 00:42:58.461
uh,

1763
00:42:58.461 --> 00:42:59.300
simply been,

1764
00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:00.293
be killed,

1765
00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:05.620
Trotsky ask that they be put on trial so that the corruption and abuses of the

1766
00:43:07.461 --> 00:43:09.710
autocracy could be revealed.

1767
00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:11.113
Um,

1768
00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:12.890
the context is,

1769
00:43:12.891 --> 00:43:13.850
is that there are,

1770
00:43:13.851 --> 00:43:14.090
you know,

1771
00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:14.780
large,

1772
00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:15.740
massive,

1773
00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:16.201
uh,

1774
00:43:16.201 --> 00:43:17.960
armies being organized,

1775
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.500
uh,

1776
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:19.850
the white armies.

1777
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.241
Uh,

1778
00:43:20.241 --> 00:43:24.320
and because foreign intervention was already underway,

1779
00:43:24.321 --> 00:43:26.300
it's conceivable that,

1780
00:43:26.301 --> 00:43:26.511
I mean,

1781
00:43:26.511 --> 00:43:30.890
one could imagine a why there was a,

1782
00:43:30.891 --> 00:43:31.724
a current,

1783
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:32.420
um,

1784
00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:37.100
w national current within the Bolsheviks but local in particular,

1785
00:43:37.101 --> 00:43:39.800
and that's what would count that they should be,

1786
00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:40.510
uh,

1787
00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:42.200
that they should be executed.

1788
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:48.010
It's possible that a telegram came from Moscow ordering that they be executed.

1789
00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:51.563
Um,

1790
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:54.230
or simply that it had was a year old.

1791
00:43:54.231 --> 00:43:56.200
Bolsheviks you're all the mountains.

1792
00:43:56.201 --> 00:43:59.510
You are Aal Bolsheviks acting on their own.

1793
00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:00.670
The recently,

1794
00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:00.800
you know,

1795
00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:03.650
the archives have been opened up only in the last 10 or 15 years.

1796
00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:05.030
And the people that have looked,

1797
00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:05.660
uh,

1798
00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:07.070
think that that is,

1799
00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:07.220
uh,

1800
00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:08.053
mostly,

1801
00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:08.400
uh,

1802
00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.260
the case.

1803
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:10.483
Um,

1804
00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:12.890
in any case,

1805
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:13.970
um,

1806
00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:16.940
the order came that in July,

1807
00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:18.170
1918 that there'd be a trial.

1808
00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:18.921
Uh,

1809
00:44:18.921 --> 00:44:20.360
but if that was not possible,

1810
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:22.640
deemed possible that they should be shot

1811
00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.790
a bloody execution.

1812
00:44:25.791 --> 00:44:29.870
And the night of a early morning really of July 16th,

1813
00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:31.130
17th,

1814
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:32.730
that number again,

1815
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.470
they actually died on the 17th of July,

1816
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:38.191
1918 in a,

1817
00:44:38.191 --> 00:44:38.381
you know,

1818
00:44:38.381 --> 00:44:41.910
a horrific massacre with machine guns and pistols,

1819
00:44:41.911 --> 00:44:45.270
a bloodbath in the basement of a house.

1820
00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:51.020
Almost immediately there were stories that Alexandra and her daughters had been

1821
00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:56.300
a seen taking a train away from their way into the 1980s.

1822
00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:59.040
The Russian community,

1823
00:44:59.360 --> 00:44:59.580
uh,

1824
00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:00.420
in Paris,

1825
00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:01.170
uh,

1826
00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:04.170
tended to settle around the boulevard Montparnasse,

1827
00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:06.270
whether it's who's still a very good Russian restaurant,

1828
00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:06.690
uh,

1829
00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:07.530
that is there.

1830
00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:08.370
Um,

1831
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:12.090
and there's a particular cafe called the Coupole were sort of the Russian emigre

1832
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:16.890
wealthy people went and they were periodically women turning up who claimed to

1833
00:45:16.891 --> 00:45:17.730
be the daughter.

1834
00:45:17.731 --> 00:45:19.260
And then later as the time passed,

1835
00:45:19.261 --> 00:45:21.630
the granddaughter of the czar,

1836
00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:24.090
it was only after the,

1837
00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:29.360
what was left of the bodies are the bones and dry bones were discovered in 1976

1838
00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:35.600
and forensic experts in 1991 we're able to work with a DNA that the victims have

1839
00:45:38.971 --> 00:45:40.830
all been accounted for.

1840
00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.680
None of them escaped.

1841
00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:48.230
And the others were in that long Russian tradition of faults.

1842
00:45:48.231 --> 00:45:52.110
Czars or false Serenas the kind,

1843
00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:55.260
the loyalty of who to whom in the 18th century,

1844
00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:57.480
January and somebody uprisings.

1845
00:45:58.110 --> 00:45:59.340
What can one say?

1846
00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:00.960
You know,

1847
00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:01.310
they were,

1848
00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:01.920
uh,

1849
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.570
he's being canonized,

1850
00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:05.070
this vicious murderers,

1851
00:46:05.071 --> 00:46:07.830
anti-semite by the Russian Orthodox Church.

1852
00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:10.500
But that's not my church this off for me to say that.

1853
00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:12.323
So I don't know.

1854
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:12.691
It's,

1855
00:46:12.691 --> 00:46:13.080
I do know,

1856
00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:13.913
but anyway,

1857
00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.630
tragic mart martyrdom,

1858
00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:16.860
you know,

1859
00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:17.580
where they,

1860
00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:17.761
you know,

1861
00:46:17.761 --> 00:46:22.761
heroic people or simply human beings who are mowed down in a revolution,

1862
00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:26.880
a revolution that,

1863
00:46:26.881 --> 00:46:27.211
that,

1864
00:46:27.211 --> 00:46:28.044
uh,

1865
00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:28.591
that,

1866
00:46:28.591 --> 00:46:28.831
that,

1867
00:46:28.831 --> 00:46:29.191
that,

1868
00:46:29.191 --> 00:46:29.550
uh,

1869
00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:31.740
it didn't start out as a bloody revolution,

1870
00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:33.150
but became a very,

1871
00:46:33.151 --> 00:46:35.190
very bloody civil war.

1872
00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.880
Was that the first sign posts of Soviet totalitarianism?

1873
00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:40.253
No,

1874
00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:41.161
it wasn't.

1875
00:46:41.161 --> 00:46:46.161
That was a bloody vengeance for past misdeeds and the pursuit of justice.

1876
00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:50.340
It depends on your viewpoint.

1877
00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:53.040
I happen to believe the ladder.

1878
00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:54.953
See on Wednesday.

1879
00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:55.650
Thank you.
