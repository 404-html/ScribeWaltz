1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,110
We're going to talk about the war
today. Let's do it. Let's do that. Now.

2
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:09,090
I assume that you guys all saw,
uh, um, uh, paths of glory.

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,620
And so I'm going to talk about
the mutinies and in awhile. Um,

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,350
and then Jay winter is
going to talk about, uh,

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,430
essentially the great war and modern
memory. Uh, and I'm going to end,

6
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:23,130
so make a nice transition to his lecture.

7
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:28,131
I'm going to end with something
that he wrote about how reality and,

8
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:33,060
and art came together in
a terrifying way in 1918.

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,500
Okay. Now I'm almost feel
sauce, just going to say.

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,780
Okay. Um, so just a few
things. Uh, you know,

11
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:45,350
at the beginning of their
obvious through in the book. Um,

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,310
but it didn't work out the way
Falcon Heine wanted it to. Uh,

13
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:54,390
and of course the point, I mean,
this leaf and wanted it to a, and a,

14
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:57,820
the point about the Belgium, uh,
it'd be invasion of Belgium, uh,

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,080
was of course that it brought a
Britain of the war. And, uh, the, the,

16
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,680
the Germans were counting on the fact
that it would take Britain a very,

17
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:08,070
very long time to raise,
uh, an army, not a navy,

18
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:11,790
been an army of any size and what they
call the British expeditionary force does

19
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:14,670
arrive and takes his place
and next to the French,

20
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:17,760
but it's very small and they
don't have conscription until, uh,

21
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:19,590
late in the war because they,
unlike the French,

22
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:21,900
I did not have military conscription.

23
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,400
But basically to make a
long story short, um, I,

24
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:29,730
is that the, in part because, uh,

25
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:33,870
Germany as France, as everybody was
worried about the home front, uh,

26
00:01:33,871 --> 00:01:35,790
basically what happens is,
is they,

27
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,030
they hurt their chances of pulling this
off by moving some divisions to Alsace,

28
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,350
uh, to try to blunt the, the, the
force there. And also some more, uh,

29
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,100
are headed off to the eastern front
because they start to realize that the

30
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:53,940
Russians are mobilizing more rapidly
than they thought they could. Um,

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,650
and so basically, um, it's possible
to argue that the battle of the Marne,

32
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,670
uh, saves a, saves Paris, um, and,

33
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,810
and saves France, uh, because, um,

34
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,790
and sleeping would've gone
crazy about this. Remember,

35
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,910
he's the last thing he said
that supposedly in his life
was let the last soldier

36
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:16,260
touching was channel and then
come down and hit. I hit Paris.

37
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,030
But they turned down before that.
Um,

38
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,010
and the first airplanes that are used as
reconnaissance planes, they, you know,

39
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:24,380
the, the pilot's literally, you know,

40
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,120
had to have carried pistols
with them at the very beginning,

41
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:31,110
and they had not figured out a way to
put machine guns on that, that wouldn't,

42
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,830
the bullets wouldn't hit the propeller
and then come back and kill the pilot.

43
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,480
So all this took a,
uh,

44
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:40,080
took some doing with the first planes
where we're kind of sauce planes. And, uh,

45
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,030
at one point in, in, uh, this, this huge
engagement, futuring, just enormous,

46
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:49,560
enormous armies, uh, in the German
case supplied by trains going, uh, uh,

47
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,840
many every hour across the Rhine.
Uh, the, the, the French, um,

48
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,730
uh, a plane, see that there's
a big, uh, uh, a gap in, in,

49
00:02:58,731 --> 00:03:01,210
in the German lines.
And so they counter attack.

50
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:05,110
And the famous story everybody knows, uh,
and again, what do I want to insist on?

51
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:07,120
It is, I mean, look at where it
says the battle of the Marne.

52
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:08,450
There's a town called [inaudible].

53
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,270
They're at now is practically a
suburb of Paris lag. And why? Uh,

54
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,990
and you could hear, I mean, you
could hear, uh, the battle in Paris.

55
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:21,100
You could hear the, the, uh, you know,
the, the roll of thunder of the guns.

56
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:24,550
And one thing that has to, when you
ask how the, the French Home Front, uh,

57
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:28,210
holds together so long, he said, the
Germans are so close. And in 1918,

58
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:31,600
there'll be close again. In 1918,
they're firing this huge gun,

59
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:35,200
which the British soldiers called Big
Bertha. And it's lobbying from way,

60
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:36,640
way the hell up in the north.

61
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,330
In the north is lobbying shells from
the German lines behind the German lines

62
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:45,160
all the way to Paris on Easter Sunday,
1918 hitting apartment house on,

63
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,850
uh, the Church of Santa Fe and
apartment house on the boulevard.

64
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,780
A run on the [inaudible], not too
far from, uh, uh, from our place.

65
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,070
And so there, there's the Germans are
so close, but in 1914, what happens is,

66
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,610
is that, I mean, literally the,

67
00:03:58,611 --> 00:04:02,870
the commander of Paris who's that name is
Galliani and as has attack, he has, uh,

68
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,940
he has a metro stop named after him.
It's a lot of these guys do a,

69
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:11,920
he commandeers the Paris taxis and they're
literally carrying a soldiers out to

70
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:13,360
the front at the battle of the Marne.

71
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,920
And what happens is the battle of the
Marne stops the German advance and then

72
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:22,390
the race to the seed begins, uh, and they
tried to outflank each other. And again,

73
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:25,000
to borrow a ridiculous football analogy,
but it's not so ridiculous.

74
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:27,100
It doesn't matter if you don't
follow football, but you know,

75
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:29,590
if you're trying to get
around the outside, you know,

76
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:32,800
you're trying to get around outside before
the outside linebacker can get there,

77
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,810
uh,
and you're trying to turn the corner.

78
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:36,580
And so basically that's
what they're trying to do.

79
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,560
Both sides are trying to turn the
corner and they end up, you know,

80
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:43,160
if they end up at the sea. Uh,
and, uh, at that point, uh,

81
00:04:43,161 --> 00:04:47,740
the trenches are dug literally
from the sea all the way to,

82
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,540
uh, to Switzerland. Uh, and so the war,

83
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:57,430
uh, to repeat what I said the other day,
only a couple people who had seen the, uh,

84
00:04:57,431 --> 00:05:01,450
what was going on in the Russell
Japanese war of 1904, 1905,

85
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:06,690
I could have imagined that this war in
which the office was supposed to have

86
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:10,030
the, as an 1870, 71, uh,

87
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:12,850
was supposed to have every
advantage. Remember, uh,

88
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,600
the French commander said a long
vetol, we need this, the frenetic,

89
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:20,950
a patriotic energy. That's all we need.
We need to attack and keep on attacking.

90
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,960
It doesn't work out that way.

91
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,600
And the reason that you have all of these
millions of people killed the flower

92
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:32,170
of British youth, the flower of
every youth in that period, uh,

93
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:37,171
is because this offensive war becomes
a defensive struggle in which breaking

94
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:40,540
through is almost literally impossible,

95
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:45,780
thus backdrop to what you
have seen in, in, uh, in,

96
00:05:45,781 --> 00:05:49,660
in paths of glory. And that the weapons,
the defense, the, the, the, the,

97
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,960
the weapons of the war,
uh,

98
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:54,790
including really the shelling.

99
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:58,310
Most people are killed by
shells in World War One,

100
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,360
then dying in any other way. And
they're new and horrible ways of dying.

101
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,920
Flame throwers, for example, poison gas,

102
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:07,390
which was first used by the Germans that
Hipo one of the many battles of EAP.

103
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,020
There's 12 battles of the same
river, uh, in northern Italy.

104
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,290
Um, and there, there are several
battles of the Somme. I mean,

105
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:19,640
these battles keep on happening
because large chunks of real estate are

106
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:23,060
virtually impossible to, uh, to conquer.

107
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,280
And so trenches are defensive weapons.
Uh,

108
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,470
and, and what, what makes that,

109
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:33,260
one of the reasons that the breakthrough
is impossible is that when you,

110
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,310
you know, you're going to try to
break through these trenches, uh,

111
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,500
what did they have is what they call
creeping barrages and where the, you know,

112
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:40,670
they start trying to end.

113
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:43,790
Lots of people died with what the
Americans call friendly fire. Uh,

114
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,640
they try to coordinate
the, the shelling. Uh,

115
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,760
so to go in advance of the people going
over the top and then trying to carry 60

116
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:55,280
pounds, pick up 60 pounds sometimes.
Where's this stuff on your back?

117
00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:00,410
And to get down into these
horrible creative crater's
full of all sorts of crap

118
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:05,210
and dead floating rats and dead floating
bodies of human beings and to try to

119
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:08,840
get to break through. And then you run
into machine guns and machine guns,

120
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,630
which can fire, what is it, 600 something.

121
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:16,160
I just saw this this morning or
last night, 600 rounds a minute. Uh,

122
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,480
um,
and,

123
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,750
and the Gatling guns had first been used
and I think in the American civil war,

124
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:23,480
but these are much more
rapid firing and they just,

125
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,900
they aim basically that your knees and
they just sort of go back and forth,

126
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,510
back and forth.
And then Barb wire,

127
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,240
one of the things that soldiers had
to carry with them or wire cutters and

128
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:35,180
sometimes a wire cutters weren't
equal to the task of cutting the wire.

129
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:38,840
It's hard to keyer cut wire if you know
people are firing machine guns at you as

130
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:42,290
well. And so that's why, uh, the trenches,

131
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:46,820
which you'll see some real
ones in in a minute, uh, are,
you know, fairly elaborate,

132
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,700
elaborate a defensive, uh, uh, uh,

133
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:54,380
weapons and everybody has seen
the footage of a real battle. Uh,

134
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,710
um, I mean sometimes they've wrecked
it, but the imperial war museum, it,

135
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:00,350
which used to be much better than it is
now in London is really worth seeing.

136
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,480
And they used to have this amazing small,
a clip of it.

137
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,900
You see these three guys and they're
about ready to go. And the guy,

138
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,250
one guy blows his whistle to follow me
and the first guy goes up and he gets his

139
00:08:10,251 --> 00:08:12,800
head over. Then he's kind of,
he's dead. He falls back in,

140
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:16,160
the second guy goes up and he gets a
little further than you see his body hit.

141
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,600
And then the third guy, when the film,
the cliff ends is just about to get out.

142
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,440
And you don't know what happens to them,
but it's, chances weren't very good. Um,

143
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:29,500
so breaking through, I mean it's, it's
their debates on how ridiculous the, uh,

144
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:34,510
these people like Nevada, we're or
you know, a [inaudible] and the,

145
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,940
and the whole gang, uh, because they keep,

146
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,420
they keep ordering these attacks.
The breakthrough is going to come next.

147
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,250
We really got them.
We're going to break through,

148
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,460
but they don't break through and they
don't break through. And that again,

149
00:08:46,461 --> 00:08:50,380
is battles for, they can't break
through. Uh, and that is is, um,

150
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,640
that is background for,
uh, for the mutinies. Um,

151
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,220
and the first real breakthrough
doesn't come until March 19, 18.

152
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:04,190
And the Luton Dorf offensive in 1918
and then they run over, run their spa,

153
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:08,820
their supplies, and it kind of snaps
back like a rubber band and pushes them,

154
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,110
pushes them back.

155
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:13,320
And if the Germans at that point for
reasons I'll explain in a minute, uh, no,

156
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:16,520
that they're not going to win the
war. They can't win the war. But what,

157
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:18,180
what happens,
it's going to happen is that the,

158
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:21,030
when the war ends and more about
this when we talk about the post war,

159
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,420
is that the war ends with
German troops far inside France.

160
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,050
So how do you explain that back to the
home front and the, and the, and, and, uh,

161
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,090
the, uh, Berlin homefront
has started to collapse a,

162
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:37,290
there's great a deprivation, great to, uh,
problems getting enough to eat and the,

163
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:40,380
and that situation. And that will
make it easier later for Hitler.

164
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:43,770
And many other little would be Hitler's
to argue that the were winning,

165
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:46,920
but you were stabbing back by the Jews
and the communists and the Socialists and

166
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:51,840
the peaceniks and all of these people,
uh, from, from their point of view.

167
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,310
And so, uh, when you do these
creeping barrages, you know,

168
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,490
you're indicating where the
attacks going to come and, and,

169
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,660
and the trenches behind the trenches,

170
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:04,200
the Germans as to the French have
railroad lines that are used to bring in

171
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:07,230
reinforcements to bring in supplies.
And so we,

172
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,940
what you do is you bring in supplies,
you bring in reinforcements. Um, and so,

173
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:16,080
uh, if you read a great book
by Paul Fussell, F U S, s,

174
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,520
e l or two L's, F, U, s, s, e, l,

175
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:24,570
l I think called the great war and
modern memory. It's about the war poets.

176
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:29,220
It's about Siegfried staff
soon and Wilfred Owen and,
and, and folks like that.

177
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,690
Eisenberg, I, I quote him in the, I
think one of his poems in the book.

178
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,900
And that is an amazing
look at the whole thing.

179
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:40,260
I mean that's a readymade paper
topic that take a couple of those,

180
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,250
those plums and, and talk about
the talk about the war. Um,

181
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:49,320
and so I mean breaking through is very,
very difficult.

182
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,790
Uh, it's almost impossible and
that's why you have the carnage.

183
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,170
That's why you have, as I said, the
very first day if you were here, uh,

184
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,780
that there are more bitter soldiers
killed or seriously wounded in the first

185
00:11:00,781 --> 00:11:05,460
three days of the battle of the Somme.
Somn m m e like the river.

186
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:09,960
Then there were Americans killed
in world war one, Korea in Vietnam

187
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,350
in three days,

188
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,680
the first three days.

189
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,470
So you're talking about horrific losses,

190
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,670
you're talking about an expectation and
we try to put yourself in the same thing.

191
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,700
Uh, I think I have that quote
in there. Somebody said,

192
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:30,000
you discuss your own death as if
you're discussing a lunch that you were

193
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:32,340
planning tomorrow.
And someone else said,

194
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:34,830
I didn't want to die at least until
I'd finished reading the return of the

195
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:36,600
native.
Uh,

196
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:40,980
and so that again is
background for the mutinies.

197
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:44,820
And what is amazing is, is that,
and again, the French situation,

198
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:46,170
because of the precariousness,

199
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,280
it's difficult to explain how
people could have continued to,

200
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,390
to fight in many ways. And, and again,

201
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:55,000
looking at the Austrian Hungarian
empire where they had a huge losses, uh,

202
00:11:55,001 --> 00:12:00,001
is that the army's hold together really
until 1917 and even beyond the Austrian

203
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:03,330
Hungarian empire and the Russian
case to us, our market, well,

204
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:06,920
the battle of Tannenberg, uh,
it's just, it's just, you know,

205
00:12:06,921 --> 00:12:10,690
an amazing battle in 1914 in the,
and the Russian, uh, you know,

206
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,300
there's so many casualties.
They couldn't even count them.

207
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:15,490
There's so many people dead and
there never been a war like this.

208
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:19,240
No one had ever seen, couldn't
have imagined a war like this. Um,

209
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,370
and the proximity also,
I mean the English had the,

210
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:25,960
had the advantage of having the channel
there, but there, but it's one of these,

211
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:27,490
if you've been to Victoria station,

212
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:29,740
I mean it's one of these things they
always say about the war, but it's true,

213
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,880
is that you go to the officer's club and
in Victoria station have a decent lunch,

214
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,340
knocked down a couple of
pints of beer and you,

215
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,300
and you're on the front and the early
evening and can be dead by early evening.

216
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:45,310
Uh, and it is sad that in Kent we
did these, these, these, uh, minors,

217
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:49,360
he's Welsh, mine, Welsh minors,
uh, in Belgium. They crawl,

218
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,530
they tunneled under this,
the sort of promitory that sticking up a,

219
00:12:53,531 --> 00:12:56,700
that's a defensive position for
the, uh, for the Germans. And they,

220
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:00,700
they bring in all these, these, uh,
munitions and they blow the thing up.

221
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,880
They blow this huge thing
up and, and, and can't,

222
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:07,550
supposedly it is sad that people
in Kent, you know, I, I, uh, uh,

223
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,900
on and near the coast of the English
Channel could actually hear the explosion.

224
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,190
So the war is, the war is that close?
And of course it's close in other ways.

225
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:17,920
Is that the, that every imagine
that you lived in, you know,

226
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:22,300
living in a village and the in France
or anywhere and the fact to the,

227
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:26,170
in our case, the fuck the, uh, the, um,

228
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:31,200
the mail carrier comes and what you don't
want to see is you don't want the mail

229
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:36,190
carrier to come to your house.
You don't want mail because he,

230
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,870
uh, I would be carrying a
telegram saying, be proud of x,

231
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:45,790
who has just died for you feel
in the country. Turkey, Bulgaria,

232
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:50,560
Romania, France, Germany,
Russia, Britain, anywhere.

233
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,900
Um, so it became a war,
like, like no other war. And,

234
00:13:55,901 --> 00:14:00,460
and, uh, with the only possible exception
that's the Spanish civil war has given,

235
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:05,200
has given birth to really the greatest
writing about, but arguably any,

236
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,210
a,
any war,

237
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:11,230
certainly in history and arguably any
events outside of maybe the rise of Hitler

238
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,910
and national socialism in
Germany because it was, uh, uh,

239
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,970
it was like that. And it really
couldn't have been a, uh,

240
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,550
it couldn't have been any, uh, any other
way. And they're still trying to, uh, uh,

241
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:27,280
they're still arguing over these
battles, that passion. Dale,

242
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:30,760
we once drove up posh and Dale was one
of these places that they first used

243
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,290
poison gas and, and, uh, uh, you know,
now there's a lot of low t small,

244
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,010
a lot of 'em in Belgium will,

245
00:14:37,011 --> 00:14:40,890
a lot of housing developments and I just
wanted to go and see their, and you,

246
00:14:40,891 --> 00:14:45,680
you can't even see there where the
hell that was. Passion Dale, uh,

247
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,870
was actually there. Um, if you're
going to go see these battlefields,

248
00:14:49,871 --> 00:14:52,930
so the one to go to his Israel in which
were done, which I'll talk about in, in,

249
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,930
uh, in a minute because I had had it
there. You can go through these forts. Do,

250
00:14:56,931 --> 00:15:01,910
I'm all and Volvo I n n you
can imagine when it's like,

251
00:15:01,911 --> 00:15:04,950
and you can see some places
where they've left. Uh,

252
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,560
they've in the winds and the myths and
the terrible weather of that part of

253
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:13,870
France and the one road going
from Barla Duke supplying, uh, uh,

254
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,810
the on the sacrum is sacred roads
applying, very done that they've eye.

255
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:21,320
You still see a, there's one place
where they've left the, you know,

256
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:24,710
the guns with their bayonets. And there
was a lot of hand to hand fighting there.

257
00:15:24,711 --> 00:15:27,320
And, and that's the place
where Falcon Heights said,

258
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:31,610
we can afford to lose more children,
a more young people, more young men.

259
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:36,680
We will simply out bleed them.
And he hurdles one attack after another,

260
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,340
over most of 1916 against fair done.

261
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,570
And that's where so many,
uh, so many people a die.

262
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:49,340
And of course that is that as
the background also, uh, for,

263
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,450
uh, uh, for these, uh, for these,

264
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,170
these mutinies ousel. Okay. Um,

265
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,500
oh yeah,
we used to do that.

266
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,960
Okay. Here, here we've got,
uh, you know, here's the,

267
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:14,240
the western front in 19 six, 1915, 1917.

268
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:17,570
And you could see that it really doesn't,
you know, it doesn't move at all.

269
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:20,870
But again, I mean, look, there is Paris
and there was fighting. And by the way,

270
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:24,950
these places like Raf Raf, so
rei, m s, the beautiful cathedral,

271
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:27,500
which was rebuilt thanks to
the Americans after the war,

272
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,590
the Carnegie family gave a lot of
money and ordinary people rebuilt.

273
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:33,830
The cathedral is one of the great
cathedrals anywhere in Europe or house was

274
00:16:33,831 --> 00:16:36,800
right on the line. And of
course, ranch just got pounded.

275
00:16:36,801 --> 00:16:41,320
The whole place was just
totally devastated. Ah, Aha.

276
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:46,100
So the uh, there's another,
uh, example, uh, uh, up there,

277
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,760
um, right, right on the line. And I
can't remember on the first day or not,

278
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:54,510
if I didn't relate a story of, of
people that we knew, uh, five, uh, no,

279
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,041
about now,

280
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:59,030
about eight years ago who were actually
killed because of world war one a,

281
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:02,850
they were killed as a family. We
knew in, in who are cousins from, uh,

282
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,830
of really good friends of ours and would
come, they would come down there and,

283
00:17:05,831 --> 00:17:10,160
and there was a boy I the
age of my daughter then and
there, I guess he was 12.

284
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:14,070
Then. Uh, and, uh, we met
them and we, you know, simple.

285
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,080
We hadn't had a good time talking to them.
And then I asked what,

286
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,480
how they weren't Thanksgiving
when I went over to thanksgiving.

287
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:22,250
Not that in France we don't celebrate
thanksgiving, but I hadn't 10 days,

288
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:26,670
so why not? Um, and there were dad,
I'm not the father, but the, the,

289
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:30,320
the son and the mother had been killed
by World War One because they live,

290
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:34,190
their house was right up in our Haas
and in the basement they had a fire.

291
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,730
This was just a few, you know, you
were 10 years old when this happened.

292
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,730
This was world war one.
Still, I'm still killing.

293
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,210
And they were killed because there
was a fire in their basement.

294
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,810
They didn't know that
another side of the wall, uh,

295
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,650
we're all these munitions stocked
right near the Front World War One.

296
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:53,010
And the fire caught and it blew up
the house and the father wasn't there.

297
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:57,090
And this, this guy, this little guy
and his, his mother were killed,

298
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,163
were blown up,

299
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,400
killed by world war one in 1920s
there were people killed all the time.

300
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,530
You just still,
for every couple a weeks,

301
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:06,510
you still see in the paper
now that they found, you know,

302
00:18:06,511 --> 00:18:09,510
bomb and Berlin from World War Two,
from all the bombing or,

303
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:13,890
or in dressed in and all these other
places in war one there. We're constantly,

304
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,460
you know,

305
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,390
farmers were blown up as they were
plowing constantly as they were plowing on

306
00:18:18,391 --> 00:18:21,810
the, on these battlefields around
the Shema. They, dom for example,

307
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,750
which is up near a while,
you can see the psalm there,

308
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:29,460
that's a good one to have a there, but
this Chavela they, dom is up near there.

309
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:34,290
It's north of, of swift song. Uh,
anyway, and if you go to any of those,

310
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:38,820
they pop them all. If you go up,
uh, say, uh, uh, well, any of them,

311
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,180
if you go to the Martin,

312
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,990
which is where the song basically was
a or into the product, Calais, uh,

313
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,050
which is Pickety there, uh, you can
see they're just fields and fields,

314
00:18:49,051 --> 00:18:53,790
these cemeteries, uh, with, uh,
uh, hundreds of thousands of,

315
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,840
of, uh, of crosses and when one
can go on and on about this,

316
00:18:57,841 --> 00:18:59,190
but there'd never been anything like it.

317
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,900
And it's a war became the
dominant experience, uh,

318
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,430
in the lives of Europeans,
period.

319
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:10,260
No matter how old you were because
you knew somebody who died,

320
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,580
you had a relative who died period.

321
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:18,240
There are in France where
much of the fighting was,

322
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:23,270
the western front fighting was there and
in Belgium there are 36,000 communes,

323
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:25,920
which is an administrative unit.

324
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:31,370
36,012 out of 36,000 had
nobody killed in war one.

325
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,520
And there are places you can go,

326
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:37,650
particularly if you're in the
south of France where you can go.

327
00:19:37,651 --> 00:19:41,370
Where they did didn't, they didn't have
any reason they were all taken. You know,

328
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:45,300
if people were skilled workers who could
work in munitions factories, you know,

329
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,230
could get out.

330
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,140
And there are a lot of tensions between
rural and urban people because there was

331
00:19:49,141 --> 00:19:52,680
an urban people who had
rationing problems, had
owed, you know, it's a rural,

332
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:56,760
people are, are hoarding their, their
pro pro products and stuff like that.

333
00:19:56,761 --> 00:19:59,790
But there are places you can go where
you see these and I count, I'm a counter,

334
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:03,510
I count things all the time. It's
maddening. You'll find there's one town,

335
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:05,070
there is 74 people died.

336
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:08,010
Very small town in south of France
in a place called to having at home.

337
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,370
And you know, there's hardly 74
houses and there's a village.

338
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,320
It's quite beautiful as
a 12th century church,

339
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:18,100
way up in the seven mountains about
where we take tourists, you know, uh,

340
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,240
and there's a, when you
walk there, uh, the,

341
00:20:22,241 --> 00:20:24,540
the monument to the dad
is inside the church.

342
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:29,570
And when you show people this
beautiful a renaissance, uh, entryway,

343
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:35,580
and there's 12 people killed in
the war and that you cannot count,

344
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:39,930
two aren't 12 houses. You can't count 12
houses. People don't live there anymore.

345
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,900
Hardly anyone's there. So the, I mean,

346
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:46,050
we know more about the western front and
now there's some good books appearing

347
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:46,861
on the eastern front,

348
00:20:46,861 --> 00:20:49,990
but it's the same thing in every country
that you're talking about. But as the,

349
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,220
the,
the list of people,

350
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,330
percentages or the numbers of people
killed around will make clear what the

351
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:58,560
country is, where that really suffered
the most. And, and they were, uh,

352
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:02,170
whether they were Germany and France,
and then they followed by, uh, by Russia,

353
00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:05,870
but also Britain. And don't forget
in Britain. And remember I said that,

354
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,580
that the four empires disappear.
Well,

355
00:21:07,581 --> 00:21:11,150
the fifth empire arguably disappears
in the end because of, of,

356
00:21:11,151 --> 00:21:13,840
of dynamics caused by the war.
Because after people,

357
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:18,310
people in the so called colonies,
the fighting for the British empire,

358
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,190
they began to think, well, why
shouldn't we have independence?

359
00:21:21,191 --> 00:21:24,970
Why shouldn't we have freedom to, and
of course, at the battle of globally,

360
00:21:24,971 --> 00:21:27,880
which is one of the great
tragedies of the war,

361
00:21:27,881 --> 00:21:31,420
when Churchill who had 10 ideas
a day and nine of them were bad,

362
00:21:31,421 --> 00:21:34,810
it's one of his critics said, uh, you
know, Churchill said, well, why don't we,

363
00:21:34,811 --> 00:21:37,090
you know, we'll take the
pressure off by, we'll, uh,

364
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,830
we'll have to knock the
Turks out of the war.

365
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:42,400
And so they're going to have this
impossible assault on Turkish fortified

366
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,050
positions. And so they said, well,

367
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,590
we'll knock them out of the war with
the Australians and the Indians and the,

368
00:21:47,591 --> 00:21:52,120
and the New Zealanders and, uh, you know,
we can afford to lose them more easily.

369
00:21:52,121 --> 00:21:54,730
You know, they're not really ours. Uh,

370
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:59,730
and of course that still resonates in
places like New Zealand and Australia and

371
00:21:59,731 --> 00:22:01,390
in India as well. It should. But anyway,

372
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:06,250
that's another complicated story and we
have, we have other stuff to do. So, um,

373
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,240
you know, read things on this. It is,
it is, uh, you know, it is a phenomenal,

374
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,340
a phenomenal thing.

375
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:17,140
The mutinies just a little
bit to the mutinies to Psalm.

376
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,180
You can read about him and all of that.

377
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,530
When I used to work at the vast
sand in the military archives there,

378
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,040
cause I was writing about 1830 and 18,
48 and all that stuff,

379
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,960
I was reading day by day,
you know,

380
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:33,400
the correspondence from various regions
in France. And, and I was trying to find,

381
00:22:33,401 --> 00:22:36,910
um, I was fine to find these documents
that I knew that I knew were there.

382
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:40,360
This was when I was just starting out. I
wasn't much older than you guys. And, um,

383
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:45,700
I'd like to think that. And, um, uh,
you know, younger than I once was,

384
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:49,260
but you know, anyway, here,
whatever the song is, um,

385
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,210
and I knew this stuff was there
and the person that ran it was the,

386
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,510
was out having a sort of a torrid
affair with this guy all the time.

387
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,940
And so she was never there at lunch
and she didn't know what she was doing

388
00:22:57,941 --> 00:23:00,220
anyway. And so I bribed one of the, the,

389
00:23:00,221 --> 00:23:03,670
the guards to let me back in the,
in the,

390
00:23:03,671 --> 00:23:06,610
in the stacks where you're not
supposed to go and French archives,

391
00:23:06,611 --> 00:23:07,870
but the guy was a stamp collector.

392
00:23:07,871 --> 00:23:11,410
So I kept leaving all these jazzy and
I knew that I left all these jazz,

393
00:23:11,411 --> 00:23:15,030
he stamps on the, on my table and finally
said, oh, those are beautiful stamps.

394
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,020
What would you like them? And the
next thing I knew, I'm in the,

395
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,340
I mean in the back,

396
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,270
but I remember what I saw was this
huge number of thing of boxes.

397
00:23:22,271 --> 00:23:26,560
This is in the mid seventies is huge
number of boxes that were chained up.

398
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:27,041
Literally.

399
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:32,041
They were in this cage and they were
chained up and I mean really chained up,

400
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,610
you know, with big locks and all that
stuff, big security. And I said, well,

401
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,200
we know what's all that. And he said,
well, those are the mutiny documents.

402
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:43,510
Those are the documents from the
mutinies in 1917 and now finally,

403
00:23:43,511 --> 00:23:44,740
a guy was able to get in,

404
00:23:44,741 --> 00:23:47,870
because in France there's a 50 year rule
and he should have been able 50 years

405
00:23:47,871 --> 00:23:49,880
after the fact,
you should be able to consult documents.

406
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:54,050
And this guy was finally able to get, uh,
uh, they were, as they call it, to it,

407
00:23:54,051 --> 00:23:56,810
to get, you know, an exception
to go work on these documents.

408
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,900
And so the thesis that was published is
very good by a guy called g Pedrol Sini

409
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,580
who am, I don't know. And it's on the
mutiny. So now we know about the mutinies.

410
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,020
So how,
you know,

411
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:11,070
what do we know about the mutinies that
that confirms what you saw, uh, in, uh,

412
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,470
in the film, um, that, uh,

413
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,400
several things is that the
Munis were spread rapidly.
They did indeed begin with,

414
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,890
with uh,
soldiers who were being sent to the front,

415
00:24:21,891 --> 00:24:25,220
buying like sheep as if they were
being sent to a slaughter house.

416
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:26,480
Cause that's where they're being sent to.

417
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:31,730
What's the difference between a soldier
carrying 60 pounds of equipment going to

418
00:24:31,731 --> 00:24:33,740
some attack that's going to go nowhere,

419
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:39,260
whereas chances of being killed or
enormous and sheep being led to a

420
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:43,190
slaughterhouse, what is the
difference? Really, not much,

421
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:48,100
except you're dealing with a human
being and not and, and not a sheep. Um,

422
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:52,910
and so that was a bad sign
for these officers. And um,

423
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:56,750
when the mutiny started, there were
only really for reliable divisions.

424
00:24:56,751 --> 00:24:59,750
They figured at one point between
Paris and the German lines,

425
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:04,460
the incredible thing was it's because
soldiers never talk about the battle when

426
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,920
they went go back.
They don't talk about the battle.

427
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:08,670
Okay.

428
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:11,940
It was impossible to
communicate what was going on.

429
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:16,500
And the mutinies were one of the
well kept secrets. Nobody knew.

430
00:25:16,501 --> 00:25:19,170
The Germans didn't know at the time.
Hardly anybody knew.

431
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,570
Nobody is probably too
strong. Um, but the,

432
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:28,200
the mutinies involved thousands and
thousands and thousands of soldiers.

433
00:25:28,201 --> 00:25:33,201
And some cases they elected people to
represent them in a few cases where the

434
00:25:33,781 --> 00:25:35,980
officer's maintain the upper hand.
They simply,

435
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:41,090
similarly some of the early
shot a mute ners mutiny mutiny.

436
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,970
Mutineers what? Yeah, mute nurse you say
mutinous I don't know people who mutiny.

437
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,690
I can't confuse these
things. So, um, they,

438
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,160
but they were massive. Uh, they,

439
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:58,580
but they had nothing to do with
socialist or an anarchist or passivist

440
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,100
propaganda at all. Uh, there were
attempts, there were congresses.

441
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,110
There was a congress in Sweden,
there was another one in Switzerland.

442
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:10,780
The French government would
not let representatives go
to those congresses. Um,

443
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,900
and the first reaction was,
you know,

444
00:26:12,901 --> 00:26:16,170
in the high command was that while
the Socialists and the, you know,

445
00:26:16,171 --> 00:26:19,990
now they're showing their true,
uh, uh, their, their true stripes,

446
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,720
anarchist propaganda is working the bowl.

447
00:26:22,721 --> 00:26:26,010
Look at the Bolshevik revolution had
not yet happened. That was an October.

448
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:29,460
But the, uh, the Russian revolution
in February had already occurred.

449
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:33,210
It's nothing to do with it.
Uh, what they objected to,

450
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,870
they were not defeatist at all. They did
not want the Germans to win the war. Uh,

451
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:41,790
but they realize that they weren't going
to win the war either and that this

452
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:45,060
strategy was completely,
completely few tile. Uh,

453
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,500
there were cases of fraternization
there, very famous cases, um,

454
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,540
Christmas 1914,

455
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:55,620
and I'm the front way up near Belgium,
uh,

456
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,190
on the British side particularly. Uh,
they start yelling back and forth,

457
00:26:59,191 --> 00:27:02,100
the Germans and the British and they
say, basically, screw this stuff.

458
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,200
Why don't we take the day off?

459
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:08,320
And so the Welsh were singing Christmas
carols to the Germans and the Germans

460
00:27:08,321 --> 00:27:12,450
are getting their best singers and
sweating and, and, and uh, singing back.

461
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,470
They actually did get together
and play a soccer game.

462
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:21,390
They found a place that wasn't
totally chopped up and plate. In 1915,

463
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:26,850
uh, on Christmas, uh, British,
uh, uh, soldier said, why
don't we do the same thing?

464
00:27:26,851 --> 00:27:28,230
And they put him up against
the wall and shot him.

465
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,010
There were these rumors that
very persistent during the whole,

466
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:37,000
the whole fighting and the western
front, that underneath, underneath glass,

467
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:40,920
we're, after all, all these
champagne caves are underneath.

468
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,990
And that was the town where the statue
of the Virgin Mary on the top of a church

469
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:49,890
hung like this and that the Germans,
that if it falls one way,

470
00:27:49,891 --> 00:27:51,120
we're going to win for
falls the other way.

471
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,730
The French are going
to win that somewhere.

472
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:58,050
The people who are lucky enough
to be alive, we're down there.

473
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:01,830
And they would come out and take
it, take food, and they would take,

474
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,610
they would take a wine reiterations and,
and stuff like that.

475
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,790
They would take them back
from the, uh, from the dad.

476
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:13,230
And they were all partying under,
under underground,

477
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,620
and that they were the lucky ones
and they were all fraternizing.

478
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,260
It wasn't that case,
but still,

479
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,860
you hear all these stories and the
great war poets of saying, well, yeah,

480
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:26,810
so and so these two German, the guy in a,
in a British guy find themselves in, in,

481
00:28:26,811 --> 00:28:29,190
in a, in a crater, uh,

482
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,450
both on the verge of death and they're
discussing Nicha until somebody finally

483
00:28:33,451 --> 00:28:37,560
comes in and rescues them. I mean,
a lot of this may be apocryphal,

484
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,390
but the mutinies hadn't had to do,
not with defeatism.

485
00:28:42,391 --> 00:28:47,280
It had to do with the sheer
madness of it all. And,

486
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,640
and, and it was mad. And, and there's
still historians who were saying, well,

487
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:52,590
you know, the creeping barrage
is if they hadn't made them,

488
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,680
they'd made them a little more organized
and maybe the breakthroughs would have

489
00:28:55,681 --> 00:29:00,681
come and they're still defending the
impossible after all of these years.

490
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,610
Um,
and so

491
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:09,500
god,
okay,

492
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,270
something happened.
I want to show you these

493
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:17,910
please.
My turning up.

494
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:22,300
I think I'm turning it off.
Simon, can you, uh, God,

495
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,290
I am nude.

496
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:25,943
Uh,

497
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:32,660
it was very dark at the battle
of air done. What happens?

498
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,333
Can you do this?

499
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,673
Yeah,

500
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:47,250
yeah. Okay. I just, these are real ones
from fair dot. Unveiled then was 1916.

501
00:29:47,251 --> 00:29:51,300
It begins in February. It rains all
the time. And that part of France,

502
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:54,960
and this will get at this to explain,
uh,

503
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:59,880
the mutinies is also to understand they're
done. This is reconnaissance plane, uh,

504
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,260
that,
those are craters

505
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,003
there.

506
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,700
Those are the creditors. Those are
some more craters over there. Next.

507
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:13,260
And then that Foret Du,
Du, Du I'm or, or volt.

508
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,180
And when you go to them and
you really should go to them.

509
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:17,190
I mean it's a long way from there,
down there, down at the top,

510
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:20,460
Donald is the town that's near there,
but the one, I'll never forget this.

511
00:30:20,461 --> 00:30:23,610
When you go in and you see after the war,
like as people do in churches,

512
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,970
people would come and put plaques and
the most moving one is to my sons.

513
00:30:26,971 --> 00:30:30,150
Since his eyes closed,
might've not deceased to cry.

514
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,570
Next one please. And so
that's, you'd be going in there

515
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:42,140
and that, those were where the plaques
are right there. This guy right there, uh,

516
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:45,310
there are plaques. Fact, that plaque
that I, that I just said is right on,

517
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,840
is right next to that there.

518
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:51,893
Now

519
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,050
you're here and they say over the top men.

520
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:57,480
Okay,

521
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,480
and you're trying to get
on the other side there.

522
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,580
How are you going to do that?

523
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,170
Okay.

524
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:08,990
Hi. That's all barbed wire around there.
How are you going to do that? You can,

525
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,443
these are just,

526
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:20,250
that's inside Volvo or do 'em all
night patrol. Again, there's a trash

527
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,260
and they're, they're, they're attacking.

528
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,560
But you've got to climb
over your own Barb wire too,

529
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,790
because that's Barb wire this
protecting you from if they attack.

530
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:41,470
And the casualty rates are just absolutely
phenomenal. You know, it, all these,

531
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,570
the Kashi rates here
are not the same as the,

532
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,270
as the song because it
wasn't a massive attack.

533
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:49,090
It's like you're defending it against
the Germans and there's taking care of

534
00:31:49,091 --> 00:31:53,440
some people that are getting hurt.
I mean, it would have been hurt, uh,

535
00:31:53,441 --> 00:31:57,850
carrying somebody back. I mean, the poor
guy, it looks a little peek in there.

536
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,360
Telephones.
The Russian phone system was so bad.

537
00:32:02,361 --> 00:32:06,260
The Germans could hear every single word
that they said on the eastern front.

538
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,083
Next,
please.

539
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,680
Well,
you get the point.

540
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:16,450
There's the machine
guns aimed low medical.

541
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:17,370
Yeah.

542
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:21,020
Oh, that's fantastic to walk in there.
But you have to remember that, you know,

543
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:25,560
the lot of the fighting is on the outside
and the myth and the snow and the crap.

544
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,290
It's just a, it's an amazing
thing. But they help.

545
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:33,060
They held and marshal Petain I became
the hero, you know, a hero of France.

546
00:32:33,061 --> 00:32:37,350
He would have a later incarnation in
World War II and we'll get back to them.

547
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,030
Uh, but they, they,

548
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,760
how are you going to run up
that hill, Karen? 60 pounds.

549
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,040
There was a comment by
the way called Dewa Mall,

550
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:52,880
which is the only commune
out of the 36,000 that no
longer exists because it was

551
00:32:52,881 --> 00:32:57,260
so battered that there's a difference
in height in, in these hills of, of,

552
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:57,741
you know,

553
00:32:57,741 --> 00:33:02,741
just of 15 a hundred feet and it
could never be rebuilt next please.

554
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,950
Yeah,
we get to get the scene

555
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,420
and it is amazing how little people
knew what they knew in the home front.

556
00:33:14,421 --> 00:33:18,230
And there's a very good book edited by
Jay Winter and, and uh, his friend, uh,

557
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,100
there's only to be your whole bay,

558
00:33:19,101 --> 00:33:21,980
I don't know about capital
cities at war about London,

559
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,800
Paris and Berlin comparing the home front.

560
00:33:24,801 --> 00:33:29,030
And it's really good stuff is how
little people knew about this.

561
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,680
It's like an Italian said,
do people really imagine that we go,

562
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:38,820
that we just jump up and
down and screaming, long
live Italy? Uh, uh, it's, uh,

563
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,580
one of the most amazing things
is that people, uh, in the
hell actually more than,

564
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,190
uh,
more than didn't mute need that.

565
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,650
That's one of the most incredible
things about the, about the whole,

566
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,170
the whole bloody mass.

567
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:56,600
Now they died in the hell they
called it posh and Dale. Um,

568
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,800
that was a place where the
British gained four miles.

569
00:34:00,801 --> 00:34:03,980
That's about a seven kilometers.
Um,

570
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:08,860
in exchange for 300,000 dead
or wounded 300,000, take uh,

571
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:09,800
uh,

572
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,130
take a football stadium like University
of Michigan or ut Austin and fill it up

573
00:34:13,131 --> 00:34:17,010
three times and imagine that, you
know, those people. Uh, that's,

574
00:34:17,011 --> 00:34:21,110
that's what it was like 19, 17, 19,

575
00:34:21,111 --> 00:34:25,850
17 changes. It changes everything. Uh, 19,

576
00:34:25,851 --> 00:34:30,851
17 changes everything because two key
events happen and there are obvious.

577
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:35,480
One is the Russian revolution
in 1917 in February.

578
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,230
That's a,
and then B,

579
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:43,940
this is still point number one is the
Russian revolution in, uh, in October.

580
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,600
And it's clear that the,
that the, uh, the Pr, the Pr,

581
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,190
we'll talk about this or
you can read about this.

582
00:34:49,191 --> 00:34:52,640
The cremsky provisional government is
under tremendous pressure from the allies

583
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:53,480
to stay in the war,

584
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,680
but it's clear that when the Bolsheviks
seized power and October, 1917,

585
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:01,980
that the Russians are going to get
out of the war. And that that piece,

586
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,910
land and bread is a powerful,

587
00:35:04,911 --> 00:35:07,880
powerful slogan for the Russian soldiers.

588
00:35:07,881 --> 00:35:11,290
And it's amazing that the
Russian soldiers didn't all, uh,

589
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:15,830
go back to Vladivostok or to
Kazakhstan or to wherever, uh,

590
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,110
that they were able to hold
on as long as they did.

591
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:23,420
And so that's going to change
things. Is it that time that, um,

592
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,600
the second event happens and then
as the Americans come into the war,

593
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:28,550
now the Americans I,

594
00:35:28,551 --> 00:35:33,280
outside of places like
Chicago and Milwaukee and
Philadelphia, maybe they had a,

595
00:35:33,281 --> 00:35:37,380
lots of Germans, uh, most
people in the United States, uh,

596
00:35:37,381 --> 00:35:41,640
the tendency was to want the allies
to lit, to, to, to, to win, uh,

597
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:44,370
the loser to fight another
day. And, and, uh, uh,

598
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:48,750
the Americans were angered by the
submarine warfare campaign in 1915 a boat

599
00:35:48,751 --> 00:35:51,330
called the Lusitania was sunk.
Uh,

600
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,570
there had been a warnings posted
by the German government saying,

601
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:57,810
if you're a passenger, don't go on that
you're going to go into a war zone. Uh,

602
00:35:57,811 --> 00:36:02,010
the Germans claimed when the, what was
sunk that was full of munitions, uh,

603
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:05,160
the Americans and the British said, no, it
was, and in fact, it was, and they were,

604
00:36:05,161 --> 00:36:09,180
that was proved about 20 years
ago by divers and near Ireland.

605
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,560
And lots of people die.

606
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:15,990
And the Germans know that the only
way they can win the war is the, the,

607
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,100
the unrestricted campaign of, uh, of, uh,

608
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:24,940
a submarine warfare to try to keep
Britain from being supplied by American

609
00:36:24,941 --> 00:36:29,460
supplies. And Wilson, who won
election, Woodrow Wilson, Princeton,

610
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:32,790
uh, who won election on the,
uh, he kept us out of war.

611
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:35,310
He takes the country into war,
uh,

612
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:38,420
and eventually he can't get the
treaty of Versailles past, even by,

613
00:36:38,421 --> 00:36:42,240
by the American, uh,
isolationists, uh, senate. Um,

614
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:46,380
and so the Americans go to war
in 1917 I took a Yale Alumni,

615
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:48,480
besides taking the April
Neda drink champagne.

616
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,630
A lot of them wanted to go to this as
a long time, go to Chateau [inaudible],

617
00:36:51,631 --> 00:36:56,400
which is the first place that American
soldiers fought in 19, in 1917. Um,

618
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:59,720
uh, but now it wasn't the American troops
that made the difference. I mean, the,

619
00:36:59,721 --> 00:37:02,280
the, the, in the imaginary,
the imaginary, in the, in the,

620
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:05,940
in the perceptions of the French,
who was the rival of, uh, you know,

621
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,240
of general Pershing,
you know,

622
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:12,090
who had made his career sort
of a slaughtering Mexicans,
uh, uh, in, in Mexico.

623
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,280
Uh, he, um, uh, you know,

624
00:37:14,281 --> 00:37:19,281
the image was at the far west was coming
in and these sort of gun toting a dodge

625
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:22,590
city types where we're going to turn
the tide. That's not what happens,

626
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,380
but what turns the tide is the,
once the Americans are in the war,

627
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,420
that the tremendous industrial
strength of the U S uh, it may,

628
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:32,790
it means the curves are gonna are
gonna Cross. And by that simply,

629
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:36,570
I mean the curves that, that
the, the Germans, no, they
ain't going to win the war.

630
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:41,530
Uh, and the, the, the, the British
and the French, uh, and the,

631
00:37:41,531 --> 00:37:44,070
the American, uh, high command,

632
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,100
they know they're going to win the war
and they think they're going to win the

633
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:52,050
war in 1920 or 1921, maybe
19, 19. If all goes well.

634
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:56,700
There was a quote in there after they
just had at the cost of thousands of lives

635
00:37:56,701 --> 00:38:00,570
I think is still in there. Uh, they
had got a, a couple of kilometers,

636
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,480
kilometers of carrot Tori back from the
Germans and somebody says, you know,

637
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:08,070
at this rate we'll get to the Rhine in
the year 2006, I think is what they,

638
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:10,940
what they figured. Um, and uh,

639
00:38:10,941 --> 00:38:15,480
the long do a w I mean of being in for
four till the end was going to be a long

640
00:38:15,481 --> 00:38:18,750
time if you were, if you were able to
survive. So those are the two big events.

641
00:38:18,751 --> 00:38:23,010
The curves cross 1917 is also important
here because tanks begin to make a

642
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:26,820
difference. Tanks can't do
anything in the, in these
craters. They get stuck there.

643
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:29,790
What are those things? There? Treads,
you know, just sort of a spin,

644
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:32,850
like a car stuck in the snow in
north haven or something. Uh,

645
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,410
they don't make any difference
until, uh, until they actually,

646
00:38:35,411 --> 00:38:38,170
they can break into the open and at
that point then they can be a way of

647
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:43,171
protecting infantry of behind them
of us in 1917 really turns it around.

648
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:46,270
And then making a long story
short yet again in 1918, I mean,

649
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:47,500
Luton Dwarf by this time,

650
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:50,830
Hindenburg and Ludendorff basically
have to have taken over the government

651
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,980
basically. Uh, the, um,

652
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:58,570
the Second Reich is now controlled
by, by the military. Of course,

653
00:38:58,571 --> 00:39:02,020
Hindenburg has a rather pernicious role
in the long run to play because he was

654
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:05,170
determined to destroy the Weimar Republic,
even though it was as president.

655
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:07,960
And as he in 1932 says,
we'll bring in an odd off.

656
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,610
I will bring him in as
chancellor. Um, but anyway, uh,
so alluded to, I've said, look,

657
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:14,740
you know, we've got to do it
now. If we don't do it now,

658
00:39:14,741 --> 00:39:15,640
it ain't never gonna happen.

659
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,740
And so they throw every conceivable
resource into this, uh, offensive.

660
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,540
Uh,
and they do break through.

661
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:25,720
They do break through and you
can look at the maps in the book.

662
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:30,130
They get along way,
but then it snaps back like a rubber band.

663
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:35,670
They overrun their supplies as
they had in 1914 in the big,

664
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:40,570
you know, big war offensive. In 1914,
they began to overrun their supplies.

665
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:45,130
They get tired, and then they're pushed
back. And at that point, you know,

666
00:39:45,131 --> 00:39:49,660
at that point, the worst days of the
bombardment of Paris as a is ended, uh,

667
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:53,400
uh, the, the, the allies are sure they're
there, they're going to win the war. And,

668
00:39:53,401 --> 00:39:56,140
and that, uh, the Germans and
the Austrians hearing empire,

669
00:39:56,141 --> 00:39:58,930
which is almost on the verge of collapse,
a,

670
00:39:58,931 --> 00:40:03,400
despite the sheer inefficiency
of the Italian, uh, uh, military,

671
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:07,030
uh, um, they, they know
that it's going to collapse.

672
00:40:07,031 --> 00:40:10,180
And that Russia's coming out of the war
in the long run did not make that much

673
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:11,720
of a difference.
Um,

674
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:16,000
because Italians are able to stabilize
really the front end in Austria, Hungary,

675
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:19,180
and the whole thing is, is
going to collapse. And the
Austrian Hungarian Empire,

676
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:23,200
the nationalities are putting forward
their claims and Franz Joseph Dies in

677
00:40:23,201 --> 00:40:28,030
1916. Um, and it's not going
to go that long. And finally,

678
00:40:28,031 --> 00:40:33,031
on the 11th of November in 1918
in a railroad car in [inaudible],

679
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,440
near [inaudible] in the forest,
uh, not very far north of Paris,

680
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,360
uh, they, uh,

681
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:45,390
sign on the dotted line and the
armistice is declared a in 1940,

682
00:40:45,491 --> 00:40:49,710
Hitler would, would accept
a Francis Surrender, uh, in,

683
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,610
it wasn't actually the same railroad car,
but he,

684
00:40:51,611 --> 00:40:55,300
they told him it was also
in the forest and comb PN,

685
00:40:55,590 --> 00:41:00,190
a near called PN in, um, uh, in 1940.

686
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,830
Uh, and the war, the war ended.

687
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:07,990
Now the more about this later, um, but,

688
00:41:07,991 --> 00:41:09,370
um,
the

689
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,200
basically that France in
victory is not as strong as,

690
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:20,740
as Germany and defeat because
Germany is an industrially, uh,

691
00:41:20,741 --> 00:41:24,340
much more, uh, prosperous
country. And this will,

692
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:29,610
this will hang over the negotiations
at Versailles because the French demand

693
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:35,210
that somebody pay for the war of which
France suffered more than any other

694
00:41:35,211 --> 00:41:40,210
country, uh, in terms of its agricultural
land being chewed up, the finest land, uh,

695
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:44,980
uh, in France, et Cetera, et
cetera. So that's going to
hang over the priest piece,

696
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:46,340
uh,
proceedings.

697
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:50,240
But I want to make it just a few comments
before I end with was j winter and we

698
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:53,990
have five minutes left. So I'm going to
do that. Uh, the highest percentage of,

699
00:41:53,991 --> 00:41:58,991
of of a losses was France with
16.8% of those mobilized killed,

700
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,000
uh, in Germany, 15.4% killed.

701
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:10,610
But if you take those in, in actually
in combat is 22% officers in 18%.

702
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,440
A soldier's cause.
Remember officers,

703
00:42:12,441 --> 00:42:15,110
they weren't all fancy generals who
were sitting drinking champagne,

704
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,830
plotting the deaths of all these people,
the junior officers,

705
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:22,100
and particularly not particularly,
but also the case in the British sense,

706
00:42:22,101 --> 00:42:25,080
the flower, British youth from
Oxford, Cambridge, etc. Etc.

707
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,650
They're the ones that blew the
whistle, said, follow me man.

708
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:32,130
And they jump over armed with only a
pistol there, toast, you know, they,

709
00:42:32,131 --> 00:42:35,240
they get killed. Uh, even in
greater percentages anyway,

710
00:42:35,241 --> 00:42:39,410
Serbia loses 37% of all it's common
sense that come combat. And that's not,

711
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,770
they don't have as many
Turkey, 27%, Romania,

712
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:46,430
25% and Bulgaria 22%.
Now sink of this,

713
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:51,080
the worst starts in early August,
1914 and ends on the 11th of November,

714
00:42:51,081 --> 00:42:55,910
1918 every day of those years,

715
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,660
every day,
think four years back in your own lives.

716
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:04,130
And then everyday be the 900
freshmen were killed every day,

717
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,910
every day. That's a lot of
telegrams. Be Proud of X.

718
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:11,330
1300 Germans were killed every day.

719
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:16,460
The death rate was higher. And World
War II, of course, in World War II,

720
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:21,050
the Soviet Union, it has an unbelievable
death rate. 25 million people die,

721
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:25,370
some of them in Stalin's Gulag, but
most of them because of the war, uh,

722
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:29,510
the death rate is higher.
Uh, July 1st, 1916,

723
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,160
just the first day of
the battle of the Somme,

724
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:35,570
20,000 British soldiers were killed,
not just killed and wounded.

725
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:38,390
Then in one day,

726
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:44,090
so they were there to go over the
top and they're dead at the end. Um,

727
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:49,610
unlike previous wars, disease didn't
play a major part. Unlike for example,

728
00:43:49,611 --> 00:43:54,611
the Crimean war though the blue flu
sometimes called the Spanish flu,

729
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:58,820
uh, as you know, will kill
more people in 1918, 19, 19,

730
00:43:58,821 --> 00:44:02,840
1920 then the war, that's, I mean,
that's the big pan. And Demi,

731
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:07,250
um, as I said, most people
die of old, of, of a,

732
00:44:07,251 --> 00:44:12,251
of shells followed by machine guns and
flames despite a progress in medicine.

733
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:17,630
Now also things like shellshock were first
identified at this time after the war.

734
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:22,730
Freud was very interested in that among
other people. So the psychological,

735
00:44:22,731 --> 00:44:25,320
I wasn't just that you went into the
Paris metro or the London tube and you saw

736
00:44:25,321 --> 00:44:29,240
people begging with one
arm or one leg or no legs,

737
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:34,110
is that you saw people who had also choked
out their lungs on gas. We were blind.

738
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:38,160
They were all over the place.
And Europe was a country of widows,

739
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:41,580
especially in countries like Italy where
when widow's still wore black all the

740
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:46,230
time, Europe was a country of widows.
If you had a demographic curve,

741
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,160
a triangle,

742
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,050
it was like a shark had it had eaten
a huge bite out of the male population

743
00:44:52,051 --> 00:44:56,180
between 18 and say 55 um,

744
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:58,920
no one had ever seen.
The lengths was simply staggering.

745
00:44:58,921 --> 00:45:01,500
The Battle of the Somme
lasted five months.

746
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:05,730
Gallipoli's lasted more than eight months,
veer done 10 months.

747
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,080
He put in 1917,
four months on the battle of the Somme.

748
00:45:10,081 --> 00:45:12,120
You talk about how war
influenced people's lives.

749
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,350
4 million men participated in the
battle of the Somme. 4 million.

750
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,820
That's a phenomenal statistic. More
than a quarter were killed, captured,

751
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:25,170
or [inaudible] or
classified as disappeared,

752
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:28,680
disappeared.
Nothing left battlefields.

753
00:45:28,681 --> 00:45:33,120
We're no longer called the field of
glory that went. The language went.

754
00:45:33,121 --> 00:45:36,390
I make an illusion to that, which is an
obvious one at the end of what you read.

755
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:37,081
Also,

756
00:45:37,081 --> 00:45:42,081
there's a brutalization of the sense of
humanity that you lost because you were

757
00:45:43,471 --> 00:45:47,220
dealing with so many people dead all
around. You are fighting for your life,

758
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:52,290
that the attitude that people
had toward other people changes,

759
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:57,440
and the Demons of the 20th century
fascism above all would be built on that

760
00:45:58,411 --> 00:46:03,030
dehumanization. Difficult to
imagine though, not impossible,

761
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,870
the whole accost without world war one.
But given the Turks and the,

762
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:10,950
and what they did to the Armenians,
it's hard to say also atrocities.

763
00:46:10,951 --> 00:46:14,390
There were atrocities. Now, there are a
couple of good books on atrocities. Uh,

764
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,070
most of the atrocities were committed
by the Germans in Belgium. Uh,

765
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:21,420
they gunned down.
They executed 5,500 Belgian civilians.

766
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:25,590
And EAD Cavallo was the
most famous, the nurse, um,

767
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,220
to p in part because German
soldiers believed that they
were being picked off by

768
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,360
civilians,
is a,

769
00:46:30,361 --> 00:46:34,530
what had happened in France in 1870 to 71.

770
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:39,480
But the Russians, uh, uh, committed the
atrocities in east Prussia and in Galicia,

771
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:43,710
the Austrians who had been told that
the Serbs were subhuman committed

772
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:48,150
atrocities there, there were rapes not
yet raped, had not become an arm of, of,

773
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,500
of combat as it would with
Russians after World War Two. Uh,

774
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:55,830
but people were treated
like a, uh, like animals.

775
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:58,980
Hitler said in 1939,
after all,

776
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,850
who will remember the Armenians,
that that's an incredible chilling thing.

777
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:08,370
So I want to end simply,
uh, with uh, with Jay,

778
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:13,940
with Jay winter, whom you're going to meet
soon. So maybe I can find this. And um,

779
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:18,770
it's about a haunting
film done by about Goss.

780
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:23,460
It's called j'accuse. I accused, it's
not the same thing as well as Iq is,

781
00:47:23,461 --> 00:47:27,900
but it's another one made in 1918 to 1919.
The hero,

782
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:32,050
John Diaz is a wounded soldier,
poet. He begins to lose his mind.

783
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:36,100
He escaped from the hospital and
he reaches his village there.

784
00:47:36,101 --> 00:47:39,520
He summons the villagers and
he tells them of a dream.

785
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:44,260
It starts in a battlefield graveyard with
wooden crosses all here and there and

786
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:45,010
everywhere.

787
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:50,010
A huge black cloud rises above it and
magically ghostlike figures emerged from

788
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:53,710
the ground. They're wrapped and
tattered bandages. Some limping,

789
00:47:53,711 --> 00:47:57,130
some blind walking with ups raised arms,

790
00:47:57,131 --> 00:48:00,100
stomach blindly like
Frankenstein's monster.

791
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:02,530
They leave the battlefield
and they go home.

792
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,120
They go from the graves to their
villages and they want to see if their

793
00:48:07,121 --> 00:48:10,810
sacrifices have been in vain and
they get back to their villages.

794
00:48:10,811 --> 00:48:12,910
And what they find is that their
wives have cheated on them.

795
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:16,530
They find that the people are
still ripping people off by faults,

796
00:48:16,531 --> 00:48:18,400
waits at the market.
Uh,

797
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:22,450
the petty ways have continued
despite the horrific losses.

798
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:26,170
And they say,
you must manage your ways.

799
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:30,040
We didn't go through all of this hell so
that you would continue to behave like

800
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:33,910
you do the world after all must be a
better place. Isn't it a better place now?

801
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:37,680
Won't it be? That's the big
illusion, by the way, about 1920s,

802
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:42,520
1930s because the world wasn't going
to be a better place. It wasn't at all.

803
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:47,890
And they believe their mission is
fulfilled and they go back to their graves

804
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:51,190
after we're counting this dream.
The poet now totally mad.

805
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:57,660
Accuses The sun above of standing idly
by and watching the war go on and then he

806
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:02,770
dies. Now, the one of the
oddest thing about this,

807
00:49:02,771 --> 00:49:07,771
about how art and railed emerge is that
this film was made before the end of the

808
00:49:07,991 --> 00:49:10,630
war. And I bet a goss, the producer,

809
00:49:10,631 --> 00:49:15,631
got permission from the army to have
real soldiers be extras in his movie.

810
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,900
And you can see real people who are not
going back to the front with their arms

811
00:49:19,901 --> 00:49:22,780
ripped off stumps.

812
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:27,700
They had stumps and some of the people
who were in that movie went back to the

813
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:31,780
front and were killed and
they didn't survive the war.

814
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:37,010
The war had taken a terrible
vengeance. Now, both in art,

815
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:42,990
joys of, of, of great artistic
production, but on reality to it.

816
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:46,870
It's an incredible scene. And of
course, things couldn't be back again.

817
00:49:46,871 --> 00:49:48,690
You couldn't go back to your village,
you couldn't give back.

818
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:50,710
Get off a bus at the end of the,
uh,

819
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:54,970
and go back and fall into
the arms of your family and,

820
00:49:54,971 --> 00:49:58,630
and stand there with tears in your cheeks
as you're counting off the names of

821
00:49:58,631 --> 00:50:02,920
the dead people that you knew things
were going to get better, but they don't.

822
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:08,220
And one way of looking at the entire
period in 1914 to 1945 and Jay,

823
00:50:08,471 --> 00:50:09,550
we'll talk about this,

824
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:14,850
is to view it as an entire more horrible
30 years' war cause things don't get

825
00:50:15,131 --> 00:50:18,970
better. They get worse. If that's
even possible. On that light note,

826
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,590
I wish you a happy election.
