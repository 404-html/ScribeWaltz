1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:04,170
And so today I'm going to
do a fairly impossible task,

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:06,390
which is to talk mostly
about Eastern Europe,

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:07,620
um,

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,670
in the interwar period.

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,253
Um,

6
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,250
and let me just add,

7
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:15,600
I sent around a rather lengthy list of
terms so I don't have to write on the

8
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:16,830
board and you can't see it anyway.

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:17,850
Um,

10
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:18,181
and I,

11
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:19,500
I'll work from that.

12
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,160
Uh,

13
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,470
so it'll help you understand,

14
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:23,700
but the big points are clear.

15
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,360
Um,

16
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,550
and the maps will help you as well.

17
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:28,260
But just a couple of things
at the beginning of their two,

18
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,220
perfectly obvious,

19
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,600
um,

20
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:30,991
that,

21
00:00:30,991 --> 00:00:31,201
you know,

22
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:32,150
in 1914,

23
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:32,701
I mean,

24
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:35,460
few people could ever imagine that
they would sweep away four empires,

25
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:35,731
et Cetera,

26
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:36,564
et Cetera,

27
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,890
and take the lives of,

28
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:38,400
um,

29
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:38,491
uh,

30
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:39,480
millions of people.

31
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,793
Um,

32
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,430
in 1918 in 1919,

33
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,391
uh,

34
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:46,021
there was,

35
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:46,680
uh,

36
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,320
the great illusion and the great
illusion was a held by Wilson.

37
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,340
Lots of other people is that worse were
started by evil people in high places,

38
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:57,030
which may often be the case.

39
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,673
Um,

40
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,281
but,

41
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:00,114
um,

42
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,230
that,

43
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,123
uh,

44
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,510
that the problems left by
the treaty of Versailles,

45
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:07,771
uh,

46
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:10,410
we're basically a insoluble.

47
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,191
Uh,

48
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:13,710
and that the 1920s and thirties,

49
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,700
I is basically a continuation of the war,

50
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:18,901
uh,

51
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:20,520
and that you can look
at the entire period,

52
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:22,950
14 to 45,

53
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,551
a as a,

54
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:24,810
as a 30 years war.

55
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:25,921
Uh,

56
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:30,921
and that Europe was in
depression basically the
entire time between the wars.

57
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:34,560
And as we'll see when I talk about
Eastern Europe and central Europe,

58
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,470
that has a lot to do with the instability,

59
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:40,440
the chronic instability of the period.

60
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,250
Now Western Europe and
the United States were,

61
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:44,760
were,

62
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,593
uh,

63
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,930
really not an in depression between a,

64
00:01:47,931 --> 00:01:48,220
you know,

65
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,100
24 and 29.

66
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,780
Um,

67
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,700
and then the thunder comes a in 29 and
the United States as they get out of the

68
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:59,370
depression until basically
World War II instead of,

69
00:01:59,371 --> 00:01:59,940
uh,

70
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,150
you know,

71
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:00,983
buy and that's,

72
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,030
uh,

73
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,410
the war economy helps them do that.

74
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,520
But Eastern Europe,

75
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,181
uh,

76
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:10,160
and the places where the instability
and the lack of parliamentary traditions

77
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,880
was so important,

78
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:12,601
uh,

79
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:14,940
is an agricultural
depression the entire time.

80
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:16,711
Uh,

81
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:17,550
and that,

82
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,413
um,

83
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,840
by 1939 in central and eastern Europe,

84
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,910
only one state,

85
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,560
Czechoslovakia,

86
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,580
uh,

87
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,440
remains a parliamentary
regime in all of the others,

88
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,070
uh,

89
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,680
the Europe of the eastern Europe of
little dictators and fascist parties and

90
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,580
right where,

91
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,410
right wing,

92
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,000
uh,

93
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,040
agrarian populous parties that didn't,

94
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,480
some of them didn't start out right wing,

95
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,560
uh,

96
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,280
poisoned the political atmosphere
and the treaty of Versailles.

97
00:02:50,281 --> 00:02:50,560
You know,

98
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,210
it when they meet and
these delegations meet,

99
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:57,150
including the former president of a Yale,

100
00:02:57,151 --> 00:02:59,010
a Charl or future president of meal,

101
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,190
Charles Cmr,

102
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,001
I,

103
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:03,010
within the American delegation there,

104
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,031
I,

105
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:04,960
they,

106
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,820
they were convinced that they could put,

107
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,713
um,

108
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:12,180
put an end to all wars and they will
get Germany to sign on the dotted lines

109
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:12,371
thing.

110
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:13,480
We started at all.

111
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,310
And there's all argued next week.

112
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:16,510
And it's perfectly clear.

113
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,470
Uh,

114
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,160
that was a catastrophic mistake
because the war was Germany.

115
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:21,761
Arguably,

116
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:24,880
he had a greater war role and starting
the wars and the other places.

117
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:29,881
But this guaranteed the perpetual hot
hostility of an ever increasing number of

118
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:34,270
right wing parties at
which the most vicious,

119
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:34,900
uh,

120
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,840
and the most successful
would be the Nazis.

121
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,320
Uh,

122
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,620
post the very existence of the,

123
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,670
of the Weimar Republic,

124
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,050
uh,

125
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,540
and became what is all
explained in a minute.

126
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,040
A revisionist state.

127
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:49,990
The revision of state is one that wanted
to revise the treaty of Versailles

128
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,240
because people have their ethnic,

129
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:52,930
uh,

130
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:53,320
uh,

131
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,490
dominant ethnic group.

132
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:56,350
It ended up on the wrong
side of the frontier.

133
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:02,190
And if you'd fought a war that was based
upon national claim in 1914 in which

134
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:09,910
aggressive nationalism was one
of the root causes of the war,

135
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:10,900
um,

136
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,620
the successor states that
are created out of these,

137
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:15,041
these,

138
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:15,750
uh,

139
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,071
uh,

140
00:04:16,071 --> 00:04:18,030
a collapsed empires,

141
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:18,550
uh,

142
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,600
find themselves,

143
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:20,350
uh,

144
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:20,681
uh,

145
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:24,940
with facing the reality that you could
get all the maps you wanted and you could

146
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:28,280
get all the photographers that you wanted
and geographers and bring them all to

147
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,220
side and bring them all to,

148
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:30,800
uh,

149
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,020
this fringe suburbs.

150
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,050
[inaudible]

151
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,530
knew he and the others.

152
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:35,980
Uh,

153
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,270
Sandra man that became,

154
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:37,390
you know,

155
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,670
named after the treaties
with the individual,

156
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:40,450
uh,

157
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,270
powers.

158
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,530
But,

159
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:46,300
but you couldn't draw lines around
national groups that we're going to

160
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:47,680
incorporate everybody,

161
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:48,310
uh,

162
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,630
within the country of their choice.

163
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:50,464
You couldn't do it.

164
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,203
And that becomes,

165
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,470
that leaves a permanent,

166
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,580
uh,

167
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,600
factor of,

168
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:56,080
uh,

169
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,410
uh,

170
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:56,681
for,

171
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:57,700
for instability.

172
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,840
And if you don't believe me,

173
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,130
look at the Balkans.

174
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,080
And in the,

175
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:04,240
in the 1990s,

176
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:05,080
which were the worst,

177
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:05,751
uh,

178
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:06,010
you know,

179
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:06,880
atrocities,

180
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,150
uh,

181
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:07,700
since,

182
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,530
uh,

183
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,670
a sense of death counts,

184
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:10,300
uh,

185
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,080
in,

186
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,280
in World War II and in
which ethnic cleansing and,

187
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:14,620
and,

188
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,490
and rape as a,

189
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:15,730
as,

190
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,081
as a,

191
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:16,880
as a,

192
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,390
as a,

193
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,970
as a means of waging war,

194
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,560
I became a reality again in which
those old hatreds had never been been

195
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,461
extinguished.

196
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:27,130
And so the great illusion was that
there wouldn't be any more wars.

197
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:27,900
Uh,

198
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,870
and in the case of Germany,

199
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:29,704
as we'll see,

200
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:30,341
uh,

201
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:33,280
that the troops who are
demobilized who came back,

202
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,840
they kept drilling in their basements,

203
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,130
the fry core,

204
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,340
the free core in Germany,

205
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:40,331
and that,

206
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:41,350
that lots of people,

207
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,213
uh,

208
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:42,551
you know,

209
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:42,700
uh,

210
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,511
among them,

211
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,330
just one of millions,

212
00:05:45,331 --> 00:05:45,520
uh,

213
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,870
the young Adolf Hitler,

214
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,040
uh,

215
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,070
the argument with the,

216
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,351
the,

217
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:50,650
the view that they held it was,

218
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:53,980
was that the problem wasn't to have
fought the war in the first place,

219
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:55,660
which was a Wilsonian view of the war.

220
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:57,010
But the problem was not
to have won the war.

221
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,010
And the problem is how do you explain
to home that you've lost a war when your

222
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:01,641
tubes are far,

223
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:02,410
far inside,

224
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:02,930
uh,

225
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,763
uh,

226
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:03,950
uh,

227
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,330
Germany and the other,

228
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,440
I'm going to of my story,

229
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:06,741
but,

230
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,040
uh,

231
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,180
it's just such a complicated,

232
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,780
uh,

233
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,850
subject to all of this.

234
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,180
It's a little hard not to.

235
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:16,210
And the other problem was if you're
punishing losers in World War One,

236
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:17,690
uh,

237
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,760
you're often punishing the way that,

238
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:20,061
that,

239
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:24,380
that seems to violate the very
principle that you hope to espouse of,

240
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:24,800
you know,

241
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,820
each country,

242
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,170
each people more or less their own country
peak and the powers that become the

243
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:31,850
revisionist powers,

244
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:32,511
uh,

245
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:35,600
almost all were on the losing side.

246
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,370
And they're the ones that,

247
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:40,370
that by the very principles
espoused at Versailles,

248
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,650
the basically just simply get screwed,

249
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,001
uh,

250
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:45,700
and as the Hungarians put it,

251
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:46,610
uh,

252
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,151
no,

253
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:47,750
no,

254
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,583
never.

255
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,300
That was their response.

256
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,020
No,

257
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,470
no,

258
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,303
never.

259
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,001
Uh,

260
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:53,690
and these,

261
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,960
these powers of which the most
dangerous ultimately is Germany,

262
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,870
uh,

263
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,900
of far more powerful and defeat than,

264
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:04,901
than Francis and victory basically vow
to get even not the Weimar republic.

265
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,250
But those people who wanted to destroy
other republic and that Eastern Europe

266
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:12,530
will be full of little of little Hitlers,

267
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,001
little,

268
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:17,210
a racist dictators who,

269
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:18,044
um,

270
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,630
are also convinced that the
next one we'll get it back.

271
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,450
We'll get it all back and
we'll bring it back with,

272
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:23,781
with,

273
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:24,260
uh,

274
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,960
a percentage of interest as well.

275
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,680
And increasingly appointed.

276
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,780
I'd better make an awhile,

277
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:30,530
uh,

278
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:35,530
that they begin to look at in the
Europe of extremes as Germany has a very

279
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:36,830
compelling model,

280
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,091
uh,

281
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:43,091
and the Eastern European states that had
certainly reasons to fear increasingly

282
00:07:43,191 --> 00:07:44,024
if you're Germany,

283
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:48,160
but begin to see Germany is that
rather successful model and the,

284
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:48,471
you know,

285
00:07:48,471 --> 00:07:49,131
the Europe of,

286
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:49,640
uh,

287
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,740
of the extremes as Eric
cops warm that has,

288
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,900
has called it is a,

289
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,110
it's basically basically,

290
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:54,771
uh,

291
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:57,230
if you include the Soviet
Union and if you exclude the,

292
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,240
which is another kind
of a totalitarian state,

293
00:07:59,540 --> 00:07:59,841
uh,

294
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:00,151
and,

295
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:03,770
and if you exclude the role of the
Communist parties as a d cell stabilizing

296
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:04,430
force.

297
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,430
And many of these
countries is a Europe of,

298
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,570
of fascism,

299
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,020
uh,

300
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,610
and they just keep right on marching
because fascism part of fascism,

301
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,370
they're better at the fascist
or veteran describing it,

302
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,090
what they,

303
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,440
how they will take power,

304
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,450
marching violence,

305
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:21,231
uh,

306
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:25,370
and whom they hate than what
they will construct afterward.

307
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,180
But what they will construct Afro
afterward in all of these places,

308
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,320
uh,

309
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,153
will be,

310
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,020
uh,

311
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,930
totalitarian,

312
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:33,950
fascist state,

313
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,030
uh,

314
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:40,030
that is based upon the
principle of totally over the
top aggressive nationalism.

315
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,500
And anti whatever the minorities are,

316
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,620
particularly the Jews and antisemitism.

317
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,290
I becomes an important part of,

318
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,640
of all of this.

319
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,660
So the map,

320
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,410
the guys with the maps
and the pencils and,

321
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,050
and uh,

322
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,010
trying to drive the little,

323
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,340
draw a little squiggly lines,

324
00:08:56,341 --> 00:08:58,080
it doesn't really work out very well.

325
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,650
And,

326
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:03,650
and Wilson comes back in utter defeat
and the American Congress doesn't prove

327
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:05,910
the treaty of Versailles,

328
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,880
uh,

329
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,170
uh,

330
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:07,681
anyway,

331
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:08,640
in America enters that,

332
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:08,980
you know,

333
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,840
a period of,

334
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,500
uh,

335
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,100
of isolationism at least until the next,

336
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,420
the next time around.

337
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,860
So that was a rather lengthy introduction
to what I was going to talk about.

338
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:20,700
So let's try to be,

339
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:21,534
um,

340
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,403
a more,

341
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,651
uh,

342
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:23,730
a specific,

343
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:24,421
uh,

344
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:25,650
specific now.

345
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,183
Um,

346
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:29,731
so what are their,

347
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:29,911
you know,

348
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:34,680
what are the big time revisionists states
first let me just start out with one

349
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:36,580
that didn't lose a,

350
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,130
but it's one in which,

351
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:39,960
as you'll see when you read the chapter,

352
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:44,220
we're fascism is first a saluted and then,

353
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:44,820
uh,

354
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,391
take power.

355
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:46,224
And that is Italy.

356
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,030
Now Italy wins.

357
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,290
They're open to offers,

358
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,850
open to the highest bidder,

359
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:53,460
and they joined in 1915 because,

360
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:54,010
uh,

361
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:54,600
uh,

362
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,740
because the allies can promise,

363
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:57,900
the more they pomp promising
part of the Tier Hall,

364
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,381
you know,

365
00:09:58,381 --> 00:09:59,720
between Austria and Italy and the,

366
00:09:59,721 --> 00:10:00,600
and they promise them,

367
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:01,170
uh,

368
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,003
um,

369
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:02,610
uh,

370
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,560
parts of the much of the Dalmatian coast.

371
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:05,940
Um,

372
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,980
and Italy went to war,

373
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:08,790
uh,

374
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,630
um,

375
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,920
well for that reason,

376
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:12,780
but also because in a country in which,

377
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:13,230
you know,

378
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,810
a sense of national unity
basically didn't exist.

379
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,740
There was a strong feeling that war
will make Italians out of all these

380
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:20,580
different people,

381
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,271
you know,

382
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:22,950
that's no real good reason to go to war,

383
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:23,940
but they do go to war.

384
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:24,691
Uh,

385
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:28,560
and of course they were being
systematically denigrated
by the other allied

386
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,260
leaders for a wolf,

387
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,520
all aspects of their,

388
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:33,241
of their army,

389
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:35,100
which also took huge losses.

390
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,750
Uh,

391
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,150
uh,

392
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,990
fighting the,

393
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,351
you know,

394
00:10:37,351 --> 00:10:37,850
the,

395
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,000
uh,

396
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,833
Austria,

397
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,860
Hungarian forces.

398
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:41,461
Uh,

399
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:42,840
and so when they come to,

400
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:43,500
uh,

401
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:43,771
uh,

402
00:10:43,771 --> 00:10:44,700
they come to Versailles,

403
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:45,421
Orlando,

404
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:46,111
who is their,

405
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:46,630
um,

406
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,420
their representative,

407
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,030
it's so easy.

408
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,320
He's the junior partner in this.

409
00:10:49,321 --> 00:10:50,550
They don't pay a lot of attention to them.

410
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:51,730
And,

411
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:52,650
and Wilson says,

412
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:52,801
well,

413
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:55,650
you can't give them the two hole
because they don't have Italian.

414
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:56,600
Um,

415
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:56,781
uh,

416
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,580
a majority is there and they certainly
don't have Italian majorities.

417
00:10:59,581 --> 00:11:00,480
And the in the,

418
00:11:00,481 --> 00:11:00,690
you know,

419
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,620
the animation coast,

420
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:03,420
which is populated by logically enough,

421
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:04,081
reasonably enough,

422
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:04,500
bye,

423
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,370
bye Croats.

424
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,041
Um,

425
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,350
and so they don't get what they want.

426
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,240
And Mussolini who began his,

427
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:09,690
uh,

428
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,950
his career was a socialist.

429
00:11:10,951 --> 00:11:12,570
He was the editor of Avante,

430
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,351
you know,

431
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:14,000
forward,

432
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,930
which is the socialist paper.

433
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:16,531
Uh,

434
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:16,981
he,

435
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:17,430
uh,

436
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,651
he,

437
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:18,980
he becomes a,

438
00:11:18,981 --> 00:11:19,100
it,

439
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,300
one of the originators of
fascism many period is,

440
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:22,134
you'll see in the,

441
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,960
in the book on the cover of
Time Magazine and eight times.

442
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:27,420
He's the guy that got the
railroads to run on time in Italy,

443
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,130
but only the ones for the ski resorts.

444
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,240
Um,

445
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,870
and,

446
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,470
uh,

447
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,041
uh,

448
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:32,490
anyway,

449
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:32,631
uh,

450
00:11:32,631 --> 00:11:33,690
I don't have time to talk about them now,

451
00:11:33,691 --> 00:11:34,080
but,

452
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,930
but so they're kind of
originate as power and then,

453
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:37,440
uh,

454
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,320
Mussolini's discourse about how he's
going to turn them into training,

455
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,520
into an Italian lake,

456
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,930
revived the Roman Empire.

457
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:45,030
And all of that has to
be seen in that context.

458
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:45,751
Uh,

459
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:46,770
but Italy did not,

460
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,300
I was not quote unquote,

461
00:11:48,301 --> 00:11:50,430
a loser in World War One,

462
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,500
but rather an aggrieved winner.

463
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:53,920
And that,

464
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,330
I guess that's a good way of putting it.

465
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,370
Now the revisionist powers are those that,

466
00:11:58,371 --> 00:11:58,700
that,

467
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:58,960
that,

468
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,350
that,

469
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,220
that last,

470
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,173
um,

471
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:01,751
that,

472
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:02,584
um,

473
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:03,540
uh,

474
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,400
originals powers of course
no one was more revisionist.

475
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,121
Uh,

476
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:07,910
then,

477
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,743
then Germany,

478
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,380
uh,

479
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,270
and the German,

480
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,080
the German empire is destroyed.

481
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,601
And,

482
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:14,850
and,

483
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,551
and Germany,

484
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:15,721
I mean,

485
00:12:15,721 --> 00:12:15,971
again,

486
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:17,560
this is hard to summarize all of this,

487
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:17,980
but,

488
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,520
uh,

489
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,353
Germany,

490
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:19,511
uh,

491
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:20,620
from the very beginning,

492
00:12:20,621 --> 00:12:21,101
so I said,

493
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:21,191
well,

494
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:22,150
if you're going to argue that,

495
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:22,451
that,

496
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:22,990
uh,

497
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:23,111
uh,

498
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:27,820
that national ethnic groups and
where they live should determine,

499
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,600
uh,

500
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,710
should determine,

501
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,490
uh,

502
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,140
the drawing of boundaries.

503
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:32,741
Uh,

504
00:12:32,741 --> 00:12:33,370
then,

505
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,180
um,

506
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,970
what the allies did to Germany,

507
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,920
it seemed extremely unfair
and not only to the far right,

508
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:42,760
uh,

509
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,630
in Germany.

510
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,280
Now this leaves aside the question,

511
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:46,630
and I'll come to next week,

512
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,350
uh,

513
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,490
and John Maynard Keynes,

514
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:48,851
who was a,

515
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,130
you know,

516
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:49,631
brilliant,

517
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:50,321
brilliant guy,

518
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:51,640
he's the one who saw that this is,

519
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,470
this is recipe for disaster,

520
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:54,450
the treaty of Y'all side.

521
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:54,881
And he's the one,

522
00:12:54,881 --> 00:12:55,391
he said,

523
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:56,500
this is just a truth.

524
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,790
It's not the end of the war because if
you make Germany pay for the whole war,

525
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,340
based on that they've
signed the war guilt clause,

526
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:03,791
you're going to sew,

527
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:04,960
destabilize this,

528
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,240
this country that eventually
the right will take over.

529
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,500
And that's exactly what happened.

530
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,060
That's exactly what happened.

531
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,500
But to [inaudible] point of view of,

532
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:11,910
of,

533
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,080
uh,

534
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,120
of Germany,

535
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,020
uh,

536
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,351
the,

537
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:19,351
the most egregious loss that they
suffered was the Polish corridor.

538
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,330
Um,

539
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,380
if you go to [inaudible],

540
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,540
which is a wonderful city,

541
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,770
which was the story during the war,

542
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:24,604
like mostly,

543
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,020
most every city in Poland,

544
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:26,980
except for Krakoff,

545
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:27,641
uh,

546
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:28,870
which really got lucky.

547
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:29,340
Uh,

548
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,610
I can remember going to Warsaw,

549
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,361
Oh tone,

550
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:32,350
they come Ohad uh,

551
00:13:32,351 --> 00:13:32,700
you know,

552
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,533
it was still,

553
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:33,930
you know,

554
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,400
under and under the communist regime.

555
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:37,240
And it was still,

556
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,470
when I was a kid,

557
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:39,304
there were still,

558
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,560
you could see there were there
once it had been boulevard,

559
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,220
the whole place was just absolutely raise
Krakow was very lucky cause cause it,

560
00:13:45,221 --> 00:13:46,090
it survived.

561
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,410
But what they do is,

562
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:47,681
is,

563
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:47,871
you know,

564
00:13:47,871 --> 00:13:49,090
a good dance gets rebuilt,

565
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,420
but,

566
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,400
but gun Gdansk was a German city.

567
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,770
The Polish population was extremely small.

568
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:56,380
You may know of Gdansk because
that's for solidarity began in,

569
00:13:56,381 --> 00:13:56,611
in,

570
00:13:56,611 --> 00:13:59,080
in 1979 in 1980.

571
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:01,450
It's an important port there
and that's where liquid lens,

572
00:14:01,451 --> 00:14:03,400
I've got his start in the
whole solidary movement,

573
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:04,234
including some of my,

574
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,340
some of my friends who
are very young printers,

575
00:14:06,341 --> 00:14:08,920
historians who are young
printers for solidarity,

576
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:09,461
uh,

577
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:10,091
in those days.

578
00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:11,350
And as I've said a couple of times,

579
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,370
I go to pull on all the time,

580
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,090
uh,

581
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:13,271
uh,

582
00:14:13,271 --> 00:14:14,051
for the last couple of years,

583
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:15,310
five times or something like that.

584
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,031
But anyway,

585
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:18,370
Gdansk in the point of
view of the Germans was,

586
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,090
um,

587
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:19,570
uh,

588
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,403
was German.

589
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,161
Uh,

590
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:26,161
the vast majority of the population was
German of the Polish corridor divided,

591
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,870
uh,

592
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,190
uh,

593
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,120
the rest of,

594
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,910
of Germany from East Prussia.

595
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:32,770
And it was,

596
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,030
uh,

597
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,300
was resented.

598
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,440
Uh,

599
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,610
and because of the,

600
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:37,631
by the Germans,

601
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:38,251
because of,

602
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:39,220
of there was a strong,

603
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,710
a German population that remained,

604
00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:42,041
of course,

605
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:42,611
the Poles,

606
00:14:42,611 --> 00:14:43,630
when they look at Gdansk,

607
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,720
they look back to when a good
dance was an important port,

608
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:49,450
them to in the Polish
Lithuanian Commonwealth.

609
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:49,751
In fact,

610
00:14:49,751 --> 00:14:50,890
polls are quite insistent,

611
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,690
Polish a story into the
whole concept of solidarity.

612
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,170
I mean,

613
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:54,730
excuse me,

614
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,563
of,

615
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,130
of,

616
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,830
of sovereignty that that emerged,

617
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,480
uh,

618
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,010
uh,

619
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,950
in the Netherlands and an England,

620
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,520
uh,

621
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,070
in early modern times was
also being constructed in,

622
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:04,401
in,

623
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:04,880
um,

624
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,110
in and around Gdansk.

625
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,101
And the other,

626
00:15:07,101 --> 00:15:09,770
a big wound for the Germans was of course,

627
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,550
uh,

628
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:10,821
uh,

629
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:11,210
the Cha,

630
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,260
the checklist,

631
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:13,094
Slovakia,

632
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:17,450
because the second largest
ethnic group in the newly,

633
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:17,841
uh,

634
00:15:17,841 --> 00:15:19,430
one of the successor states,

635
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,270
uh,

636
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,280
along with Poland and Yugoslavia.

637
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:22,550
I,

638
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,241
the first it,

639
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:25,130
I have the statistics in
what I sent around to,

640
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:25,940
uh,

641
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,410
were,

642
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:26,721
uh,

643
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:28,730
were checks about 50%,

644
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,241
uh,

645
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:29,751
Germans,

646
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:30,531
if I remember correctly,

647
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:34,970
we're 23% and Slovaks or 16%.

648
00:15:34,971 --> 00:15:35,391
And the other,

649
00:15:35,391 --> 00:15:35,751
of course,

650
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:36,650
or other minorities,

651
00:15:36,651 --> 00:15:36,831
I mean,

652
00:15:36,831 --> 00:15:39,490
they're Ukraine and Poles and uh,

653
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,790
and all sorts of things.

654
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,250
And lots of the Germans were concentrated.

655
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,360
The majority of Germans
were concentrated in a prog,

656
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:48,230
or there weren't as
many of them is before.

657
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:48,860
Uh,

658
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,190
but,

659
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,280
but above all,

660
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:50,540
you know,

661
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,940
I mean in the whole area,

662
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,030
the region of Bohemia and in that
region called the Sudeten land,

663
00:15:56,031 --> 00:15:56,811
the Sudeten land,

664
00:15:56,811 --> 00:15:57,644
Germans.

665
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,700
And when,

666
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,150
uh,

667
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,390
the allies capitulate to,

668
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:01,761
to,

669
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:02,300
uh,

670
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:02,451
uh,

671
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:04,130
Hitler's demands,

672
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:04,730
uh,

673
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,241
that,

674
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:05,451
that,

675
00:16:05,451 --> 00:16:07,480
that part of checklist of Aki.

676
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:07,911
And then of course,

677
00:16:07,911 --> 00:16:08,051
he,

678
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,400
he munched the whole thing a pass into,

679
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:11,091
into Germany.

680
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:12,590
One of the reasons that the AAP says,

681
00:16:12,591 --> 00:16:13,130
they said,

682
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:13,311
well,

683
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,330
maybe he's got a point,

684
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:14,901
you know,

685
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:15,291
19,

686
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:15,871
18,

687
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,071
you know,

688
00:16:16,071 --> 00:16:18,470
we couldn't really put the people
where they were supposed to be.

689
00:16:18,471 --> 00:16:18,890
And,

690
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,960
and there are German minor majorities in,

691
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:21,141
in,

692
00:16:21,141 --> 00:16:21,411
in,

693
00:16:21,411 --> 00:16:21,980
in,

694
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,510
in good percentage of,

695
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:24,470
of Bohemia.

696
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,011
Uh,

697
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:26,450
so maybe within the checklist,

698
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:26,871
Slovakia.

699
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:27,201
So maybe,

700
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:27,370
you know,

701
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,170
maybe he's got a point.

702
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,001
And that was an excuse.

703
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:30,170
That was a rationale for,

704
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:30,801
uh,

705
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:33,350
for appeasing them at a time
that he might've been stopped in,

706
00:16:33,351 --> 00:16:34,320
which is in generals,

707
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,880
his generals who were
just scared to death,

708
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:35,991
that,

709
00:16:35,991 --> 00:16:36,130
that,

710
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,070
that there was going to be,

711
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,710
that the allies were going to fight
them because they weren't ready.

712
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,480
They weren't ready for war.

713
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:42,291
So,

714
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:42,550
uh,

715
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,900
Germany is above all of
the big revision as power.

716
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,820
More about this when we talk about,

717
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,683
uh,

718
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,860
about off Hitler,

719
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,060
um,

720
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:50,361
uh,

721
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:51,194
next week.

722
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,360
The other is a course,

723
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,253
um,

724
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:55,270
mass.

725
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:55,590
Come on.

726
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,830
Do we need to see shows?

727
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,383
Um,

728
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,230
the other big one is if,

729
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,640
of course I can't find him as a matter of,

730
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:02,001
uh,

731
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:02,630
is,

732
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,380
is,

733
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,110
um,

734
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:04,370
uh,

735
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,480
is hungry,

736
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,440
um,

737
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,970
and so hungry loses.

738
00:17:07,971 --> 00:17:09,680
I got to remember these statistics.

739
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,021
Uh,

740
00:17:10,021 --> 00:17:11,330
it might've put it around,

741
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:12,570
but they lose if I could,

742
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,483
I think I remember them.

743
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,290
They lose 25% of the Hungarian population,

744
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,310
uh,

745
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,020
to other states.

746
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:21,471
Uh,

747
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:25,730
they lose about two and
a half and two thirds,

748
00:17:25,731 --> 00:17:26,361
I should remember,

749
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:27,194
but I don't,

750
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:27,531
uh,

751
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:29,360
of the land of,

752
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:29,871
uh,

753
00:17:29,871 --> 00:17:32,060
the old Hungarian domains,

754
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:32,420
uh,

755
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,670
when they were in Austria,

756
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,020
Hungary,

757
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,801
when they were the,

758
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:37,340
you know,

759
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,890
as supposedly after a 1967,

760
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,670
uh,

761
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:41,503
the,

762
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,410
uh,

763
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:42,731
the,

764
00:17:42,731 --> 00:17:43,001
the,

765
00:17:43,001 --> 00:17:44,840
the equal partner,

766
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:45,390
uh,

767
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,820
of Austria.

768
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,630
Um,

769
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:52,440
and so they lose the greatest percentage
of that Hungarian population to

770
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,430
Romania.

771
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,660
Um,

772
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,261
and of course,

773
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:56,910
the tensions between the Romanians,

774
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:57,391
uh,

775
00:17:57,391 --> 00:17:58,620
and the Hungarians,

776
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,210
uh,

777
00:17:59,210 --> 00:17:59,610
w were,

778
00:17:59,610 --> 00:17:59,991
were,

779
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:01,140
were extremely great.

780
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:01,900
Uh,

781
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,120
I mean,

782
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,770
the linguistic differences that
are enormous because Hungarian is,

783
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:05,011
is,

784
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:05,221
is,

785
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:05,700
uh,

786
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:05,941
uh,

787
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:07,260
is such a difficult language.

788
00:18:07,261 --> 00:18:08,940
It's just an isolated language.

789
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:09,690
Uh,

790
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,371
in that I have a,

791
00:18:10,371 --> 00:18:12,630
I have a friend who retired
here I many years ago,

792
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:12,931
uh,

793
00:18:12,931 --> 00:18:14,160
who speaks 18 from,

794
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:14,850
uh,

795
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:15,121
uh,

796
00:18:15,121 --> 00:18:16,530
from eastern Russian,

797
00:18:16,531 --> 00:18:19,080
east European languages and literatures,

798
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:20,730
who knows 18 languages.

799
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,091
He knows,

800
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:21,480
like all,

801
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,990
mostly every European
Central European language.

802
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:25,261
I said,

803
00:18:25,261 --> 00:18:26,094
do you know Hungarian?

804
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:26,581
He says,

805
00:18:26,581 --> 00:18:26,761
no,

806
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:27,594
it's too hard.

807
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,650
Uh,

808
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,341
and so that,

809
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,800
that accentuates the sort of
isolation from the Romanians.

810
00:18:31,801 --> 00:18:32,401
And again,

811
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:33,480
in 19,

812
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,460
in 1989,

813
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:36,480
uh,

814
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,480
the Gra the great ground swell against
your chest Q and as horrendous wife,

815
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,920
the dictators in Romania,

816
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,040
I began with Hungarian,

817
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,930
a dissidence who had,

818
00:18:48,931 --> 00:18:53,250
whose families had been
generations since World War One,

819
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,320
a stock from their point of view,

820
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,100
uh,

821
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,090
in Romania.

822
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,500
And so,

823
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,040
uh,

824
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,010
when you're trying to look at each of
these countries and try to figure out why

825
00:19:02,011 --> 00:19:02,844
to some,

826
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,270
you know,

827
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,590
right wing Maggot,

828
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,600
some of right wing dictator,

829
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,380
uh,

830
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,460
take power,

831
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:08,910
uh,

832
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,490
is because as in the
case of odd off Hitler,

833
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:14,370
if you say the same thing
over and over and over again,

834
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,770
pretty soon you get people to believe you.

835
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,150
And Admiral Horthy,

836
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:18,661
h,

837
00:19:18,661 --> 00:19:18,781
o,

838
00:19:18,781 --> 00:19:19,200
r,

839
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,501
t,

840
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:19,801
h,

841
00:19:19,801 --> 00:19:20,221
y,

842
00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:22,920
who was an admiral in the
Austrian Hungarian Empire.

843
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,130
He becomes a,

844
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:24,410
uh,

845
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,171
an extraordinarily,

846
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:25,351
you know,

847
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:26,500
vicious dictator and,

848
00:19:26,501 --> 00:19:26,681
and,

849
00:19:26,681 --> 00:19:28,230
and the egregious collaborator,

850
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,010
uh,

851
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:33,360
during World War II to sort
of a admiring junior partner,

852
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,200
uh,

853
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,480
of Hitler and the Nazis.

854
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:36,851
And,

855
00:19:36,851 --> 00:19:37,230
and,

856
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,310
and the frenetic,

857
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,110
uh,

858
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:42,210
aggressive Hungarian nationalism,

859
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,170
uh,

860
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:43,820
will,

861
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,440
uh,

862
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,020
you can go a,

863
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:48,180
you can go to Budapest and
then go along the river,

864
00:19:48,181 --> 00:19:49,650
the Danube river and Budapest,

865
00:19:49,651 --> 00:19:50,484
and see where they've,

866
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,270
they've made a sad monument
over the shoes of Jews who were,

867
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,380
who were shot or just simply
pushed into the swirling waters of,

868
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:57,800
of,

869
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,070
of the Daniel by the,

870
00:19:59,220 --> 00:19:59,671
by the,

871
00:19:59,671 --> 00:20:01,200
a Hungarian fascists in,

872
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:01,401
in,

873
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:02,200
in 19,

874
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,580
uh,

875
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,480
44.

876
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,180
Uh,

877
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,540
and,

878
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,190
and again,

879
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,610
this is not dissing Hungarians that,

880
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:06,841
you know,

881
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:08,790
as a people obviously
not hunger in friends.

882
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,624
And I love Hungary.

883
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:10,521
Budapest.

884
00:20:10,521 --> 00:20:11,730
It's my third favorite city.

885
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,540
Uh,

886
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:12,691
uh,

887
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:13,050
but,

888
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:13,530
uh,

889
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:13,831
the,

890
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:15,870
the damage done by,

891
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,700
uh,

892
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:16,880
you know,

893
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,300
the revision that's claims in Hungary
where were simply amazing and of all the,

894
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:21,721
uh,

895
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:22,860
after the Germans,

896
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,340
uh,

897
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,930
and arguably even more than Germans,

898
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:28,560
they had the most to be aggrieved about,

899
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:29,040
uh,

900
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,010
because losing so much of,

901
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,570
of their country,

902
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,231
uh,

903
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:37,050
awarded as because they had lost to,

904
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:37,800
uh,

905
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,380
uh,

906
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:38,670
to,

907
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,810
to other places.

908
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:40,231
Now,

909
00:20:40,231 --> 00:20:41,730
the case of Austria also,

910
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,091
I mean,

911
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:42,924
Austria,

912
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:43,920
if you go to Vienna,

913
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,401
Austria,

914
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:45,021
I mean at Vienna's,

915
00:20:45,021 --> 00:20:48,370
it's a wonderful and a
huge musical full of broke,

916
00:20:48,371 --> 00:20:48,761
broke,

917
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:49,540
broke.

918
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,020
Uh,

919
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,201
you know,

920
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:50,651
it's really a,

921
00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:51,091
it's a,

922
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:53,230
it's a great city and you think,

923
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:53,780
oh,

924
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,990
this is an enormous city
for such a little country.

925
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:56,741
And of course,

926
00:20:56,741 --> 00:20:58,410
what happens from the
Austrian Hungarian Empire is,

927
00:20:58,411 --> 00:20:59,560
is dismembered.

928
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:00,011
Uh,

929
00:21:00,011 --> 00:21:01,450
Australia becomes a,

930
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,380
a small,

931
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,190
uh,

932
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,710
and overwhelmingly German speaking state.

933
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:05,861
There,

934
00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:06,970
there are very few ethnic,

935
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,091
uh,

936
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:09,460
comparatively ethnic minorities living in,

937
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:09,840
in,

938
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,330
uh,

939
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,110
in what was,

940
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,000
became Austria after,

941
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,350
after World War One.

942
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:15,940
It's an imperial city.

943
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,650
It's imperial city,

944
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,220
uh,

945
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,780
not reduced in size,

946
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,860
but reduced,

947
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,311
uh,

948
00:21:21,311 --> 00:21:21,940
in,

949
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,211
uh,

950
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:23,590
in importance.

951
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,820
So Hungary,

952
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,900
I'm huge,

953
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:29,280
huge reasons to be extraordinarily,

954
00:21:29,281 --> 00:21:29,790
uh,

955
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,130
uh,

956
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,510
extraordinarily angry,

957
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,081
uh,

958
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:32,561
by the,

959
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:33,490
the whole thing.

960
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,110
Um,

961
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,070
Yugoslavia,

962
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,990
Yugoslavia.

963
00:21:37,991 --> 00:21:38,351
I mean,

964
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:38,650
they,

965
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,190
they,

966
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,023
um,

967
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,421
you know,

968
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:42,670
they lose some land that they would have,

969
00:21:42,671 --> 00:21:43,210
uh,

970
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:43,810
uh,

971
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,141
uh,

972
00:21:44,141 --> 00:21:44,760
that,

973
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,120
that,

974
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,840
that they wish that they would've gotten.

975
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:47,021
But,

976
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:47,771
but again,

977
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:48,401
Yugoslavia,

978
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:49,300
you have this tremendous,

979
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:49,751
you know,

980
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:51,010
ethnic complexity.

981
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:53,320
So in a way that that successor state of,

982
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:53,801
uh,

983
00:21:53,801 --> 00:21:54,700
of Yugoslavia,

984
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:57,790
maybe some of you have or will
take evil bonuses of course this,

985
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:58,820
and he's a great Balkan,

986
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,470
uh,

987
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,251
a historian.

988
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:00,581
But the,

989
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:02,220
the ethnic complexity of course is,

990
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:02,840
uh,

991
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,180
is a sort of a mini version of the
Austrian Hungarian Empire were Serbs,

992
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:07,930
uh,

993
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,300
something like 40% of the population of,

994
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:11,440
of Yugoslavia,

995
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:11,980
uh,

996
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,790
between,

997
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,150
uh,

998
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:13,810
the wars.

999
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:17,650
And that would be really
about the percentage until
the whole thing collapses in

1000
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:18,484
the early,

1001
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,390
in 19,

1002
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:19,731
uh,

1003
00:22:19,731 --> 00:22:21,400
nighties and with the crops,

1004
00:22:21,401 --> 00:22:22,190
the next,

1005
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:22,750
uh,

1006
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,160
the next largest,

1007
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,053
uh,

1008
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:25,750
uh,

1009
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,441
percentage,

1010
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:27,400
and then followed by,

1011
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,630
by Slovenes,

1012
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:33,070
who are the wealthiest Ralphie region
in [inaudible] roommate remained that

1013
00:22:33,071 --> 00:22:33,904
until the end.

1014
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,500
The standard of living in Slovenia,

1015
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:35,880
uh,

1016
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,200
in the 1980s was about that of,

1017
00:22:38,201 --> 00:22:38,501
of,

1018
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:39,010
of,

1019
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:39,281
of,

1020
00:22:39,281 --> 00:22:39,541
of,

1021
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:40,374
of Italy,

1022
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:40,841
uh,

1023
00:22:40,841 --> 00:22:42,040
where if you went far,

1024
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,150
far down to,

1025
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:43,691
uh,

1026
00:22:43,691 --> 00:22:45,220
to Kosovo where I've been,

1027
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:45,780
uh,

1028
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,630
you know about which,

1029
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:47,290
uh,

1030
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:47,501
you know,

1031
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:49,780
so much it's been going on in
which is now has been been,

1032
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,140
uh,

1033
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,220
I've reclaimed independent
and me was absolutely,

1034
00:22:52,221 --> 00:22:52,480
you know,

1035
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,560
absolutely impoverished.

1036
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,520
So the athlete complexity is a,

1037
00:22:55,550 --> 00:23:00,550
it's in self there to going to be
a factor for a destabilization.

1038
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,410
And what about Poland?

1039
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:02,981
I mean,

1040
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:03,641
Poland is a,

1041
00:23:03,641 --> 00:23:04,474
is a,

1042
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,070
uh,

1043
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:05,230
you know,

1044
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,000
Poland had not been independent since,

1045
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:10,450
since 1795 since the third partition.

1046
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,700
And you had,

1047
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,540
as I've already discussed
in another context,

1048
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:14,950
you've got Polish intellectuals.

1049
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,700
Uh,

1050
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,590
you've got political militants in,

1051
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:17,951
in the,

1052
00:23:17,951 --> 00:23:18,784
in the,

1053
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:19,211
uh,

1054
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:20,350
1830s,

1055
00:23:20,351 --> 00:23:21,900
and again in the 1860s,

1056
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,350
who don't want to be part of Congress.

1057
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,453
Russia.

1058
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:24,851
Uh,

1059
00:23:24,851 --> 00:23:25,690
they don't want to be Congress,

1060
00:23:25,691 --> 00:23:26,081
Poland,

1061
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:27,700
I don't want to be part
of the Austrian an empire.

1062
00:23:27,701 --> 00:23:28,780
They want to be part of Prussia.

1063
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,360
They want an and dream of
the independent Poland.

1064
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,613
And so,

1065
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,161
you know,

1066
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,090
what you have,

1067
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:34,450
uh,

1068
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:34,960
in,

1069
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,111
uh,

1070
00:23:35,111 --> 00:23:35,741
they get,

1071
00:23:35,741 --> 00:23:40,030
they get their independence
in 1918 immediately.

1072
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,050
But the complexity of course,

1073
00:23:42,051 --> 00:23:44,830
is enormous to there because
you've already got these ethnic,

1074
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,440
uh,

1075
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,190
who,

1076
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,350
uh,

1077
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:48,710
you know,

1078
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,221
are there.

1079
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:49,371
I mean,

1080
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:50,390
the Germans are there.

1081
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,820
You've got a huge numbers of Ukrainians.

1082
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:53,271
In fact,

1083
00:23:53,271 --> 00:23:53,530
in,

1084
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:53,750
in,

1085
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:53,950
in,

1086
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,400
in eastern Poland,

1087
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:55,851
I mean,

1088
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,730
the city's like zoom Moish were
the Rosa Luxemburg was worn,

1089
00:23:58,731 --> 00:23:59,690
which is a beautiful city.

1090
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,410
Uh,

1091
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:00,740
you know,

1092
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,240
these are Polish cities.

1093
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:02,990
Uh,

1094
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,900
but the,

1095
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,640
the vast majority of the rural
population are Ukrainian.

1096
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,450
Uh,

1097
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,470
they are Ukrainian.

1098
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,510
And this was a force of a,

1099
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,201
for quote,

1100
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,430
unquote instability.

1101
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:14,091
And of course,

1102
00:24:14,091 --> 00:24:16,910
they will be killing each
other off during World War II.

1103
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:17,900
Uh,

1104
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,430
and then the other minority,

1105
00:24:19,431 --> 00:24:20,264
of course,

1106
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:20,740
are,

1107
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,680
are the Jews.

1108
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,550
Um,

1109
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,190
and how many Jews were there in Poland in,

1110
00:24:25,191 --> 00:24:25,940
um,

1111
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,440
in 1918,

1112
00:24:27,441 --> 00:24:27,831
19,

1113
00:24:27,831 --> 00:24:28,640
19?

1114
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,473
Well,

1115
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:29,781
uh,

1116
00:24:29,781 --> 00:24:30,614
Poland,

1117
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:31,551
uh,

1118
00:24:31,551 --> 00:24:33,680
was considered to be before Israel.

1119
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:34,940
Poland was really the,

1120
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:35,270
uh,

1121
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,980
the cultural heart of,

1122
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:37,431
of,

1123
00:24:37,431 --> 00:24:38,210
uh,

1124
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:38,610
of,

1125
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:38,900
uh,

1126
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,733
Judaism.

1127
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,400
Uh,

1128
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,870
they're 3 million Jews living in Poland,

1129
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:45,441
uh,

1130
00:24:45,441 --> 00:24:46,780
in the east mostly,

1131
00:24:46,781 --> 00:24:46,940
you know,

1132
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,140
mostly Orthodox.

1133
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:48,974
And [inaudible].

1134
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,030
Uh,

1135
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,571
but,

1136
00:24:50,571 --> 00:24:50,900
um,

1137
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,391
when I was at,

1138
00:24:51,391 --> 00:24:51,711
by the way,

1139
00:24:51,711 --> 00:24:52,544
this is not just that,

1140
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:52,790
you know,

1141
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,241
it's a side,

1142
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,130
but it's a telling aside,

1143
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,040
when I was in his emotion,

1144
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:55,970
um,

1145
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,080
we were taken to,

1146
00:24:57,081 --> 00:24:57,710
um,

1147
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,900
we were taken to a synagogue
which had been turned into,

1148
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:00,320
um,

1149
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,010
uh,

1150
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,680
had been turned into a
place where students,

1151
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,310
uh,

1152
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,820
uh,

1153
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,180
the same students and middle school
students exhibited there painting.

1154
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,501
And I asked the,

1155
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:10,680
the guide who was taking,

1156
00:25:10,681 --> 00:25:10,811
you know,

1157
00:25:10,811 --> 00:25:13,670
these are academics around and
press editors and all this stuff.

1158
00:25:13,671 --> 00:25:13,911
I said,

1159
00:25:13,911 --> 00:25:14,001
well,

1160
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:14,181
look,

1161
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:14,570
uh,

1162
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:14,901
how many,

1163
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:15,734
how many Jews?

1164
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,930
Most of the population was emotion.

1165
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,900
1939.

1166
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,041
And he said,

1167
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:20,210
the population of his emotion,

1168
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:21,860
1939 was 39,000.

1169
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:22,821
He said,

1170
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,980
how many Jews were living in as emotion?

1171
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,160
Who would have been coming
to this synagogue in 1939,

1172
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,600
he said 12,000.

1173
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,033
12,000.

1174
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:31,761
I said,

1175
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:33,800
how many Jews live in his emotional,

1176
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,333
Cheryl,

1177
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,833
Cheryl,

1178
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,993
the others,

1179
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,060
if they were lucky enough not to
have been killed in the death camps.

1180
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,250
And I just reviewed a book
for the globe about the,

1181
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,820
about the ghetto in what's no Lod z.

1182
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:49,841
You know,

1183
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:50,671
they were like,

1184
00:25:50,671 --> 00:25:51,360
had to get a file,

1185
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,001
get out.

1186
00:25:52,001 --> 00:25:52,930
I'm not to jump ahead,

1187
00:25:52,931 --> 00:25:55,860
but the number of Jews who
survived out of the 3 million is,

1188
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,490
it was about 300,000,

1189
00:25:58,570 --> 00:25:59,170
uh,

1190
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:03,160
Polish Jews who I think came back
to pull them to the same time.

1191
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,570
The point of this is that,

1192
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,280
that these ethnic tensions,

1193
00:26:06,281 --> 00:26:10,660
particularly in a part of Europe were
antisemitism had been just replete,

1194
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,710
uh,

1195
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,191
in,

1196
00:26:12,191 --> 00:26:12,550
um,

1197
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:12,731
I mean,

1198
00:26:12,731 --> 00:26:13,001
again,

1199
00:26:13,001 --> 00:26:13,390
just don't,

1200
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,380
how can you not,

1201
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,460
it's a 30 years war.

1202
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,100
How can you not leap
ahead into World War Two?

1203
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,120
You know,

1204
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,690
some of the,

1205
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,220
some of the massacres of Jews,

1206
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:21,401
uh,

1207
00:26:21,401 --> 00:26:22,091
for example,

1208
00:26:22,091 --> 00:26:22,924
in,

1209
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:23,140
uh,

1210
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,480
during this horrible period were,

1211
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,330
were done by,

1212
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:25,840
uh,

1213
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,231
by,

1214
00:26:26,231 --> 00:26:26,351
uh,

1215
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,720
Ukrainians in Ukraine,

1216
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,760
Lithuanians,

1217
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,451
uh,

1218
00:26:31,451 --> 00:26:32,620
in Lithuania.

1219
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,960
And many of you've seen
just horrific pictures.

1220
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:35,810
I can't remember that we have,

1221
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:37,930
is awful picture that used
to read first edition.

1222
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:40,090
I don't even know if it's
in the second edition,

1223
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:40,990
uh,

1224
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,310
who were beaten to death.

1225
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,250
A colleague of mine here,

1226
00:26:44,251 --> 00:26:44,740
my Darlene,

1227
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,350
no one,

1228
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,070
a yawn,

1229
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,651
a gross,

1230
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:51,030
wrote an important book called neighbors
about how Jews and Poles who lived in

1231
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:53,910
Poland in the 1920s in
1930 [inaudible] live.

1232
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:56,580
Do they live very
peacefully in one village.

1233
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:59,220
And how almost without
an without ends up here,

1234
00:26:59,221 --> 00:27:02,130
an instigation from the Nazis who have
been happy to kill them all on a plan to

1235
00:27:02,131 --> 00:27:02,910
kill them all,

1236
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:06,420
just simply one day started killing
them all and shot them all dead,

1237
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:07,081
beat them to death,

1238
00:27:07,081 --> 00:27:07,741
put them in barns,

1239
00:27:07,741 --> 00:27:08,574
burned the barns.

1240
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,130
And so these tensions,

1241
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,400
these at which is aggressive nationalism,

1242
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:14,910
I mean still,

1243
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:15,830
I mean in Poland Manga.

1244
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:16,690
Okay.

1245
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,520
You still,

1246
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:17,881
you just,

1247
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:18,691
it's amazing.

1248
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:19,351
It's amazing.

1249
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:19,531
I mean,

1250
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:20,610
there still is this undercurrent of,

1251
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:20,931
of,

1252
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:21,540
uh,

1253
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:21,930
of,

1254
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:22,231
of,

1255
00:27:22,231 --> 00:27:23,430
of antisemitism.

1256
00:27:23,431 --> 00:27:23,631
And I,

1257
00:27:23,631 --> 00:27:24,840
and I hope this being filled,

1258
00:27:24,841 --> 00:27:25,591
I sometimes forget.

1259
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:25,861
I mean,

1260
00:27:25,861 --> 00:27:26,694
they may get letters from,

1261
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,200
but,

1262
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,471
but,

1263
00:27:27,471 --> 00:27:27,810
but it's,

1264
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,710
it's really incredible.

1265
00:27:28,711 --> 00:27:30,450
I was being interviewed and I'd Polish TV,

1266
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:31,051
uh,

1267
00:27:31,051 --> 00:27:34,290
with this other guy and it was a
pleasure to announce our president.

1268
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:34,910
But anyway,

1269
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:35,210
because,

1270
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:35,700
uh,

1271
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,150
anyway,

1272
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:36,570
uh,

1273
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,530
but I don't speak Polish.

1274
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:38,310
Um,

1275
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:38,641
and,

1276
00:27:38,641 --> 00:27:41,430
and another time we were all
being interviewed and they said,

1277
00:27:41,431 --> 00:27:42,264
this guy said,

1278
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,100
he said,

1279
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,680
what do you think of the
Jew problem in Poland?

1280
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:47,790
And just,

1281
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:47,941
you know,

1282
00:27:47,941 --> 00:27:48,774
I was about to

1283
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:50,910
kill him.

1284
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:51,721
I shouldn't say that,

1285
00:27:51,721 --> 00:27:51,871
but,

1286
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:52,704
you know,

1287
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,551
take them out.

1288
00:27:53,551 --> 00:27:54,121
And not really,

1289
00:27:54,121 --> 00:27:54,271
but,

1290
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:54,511
you know,

1291
00:27:54,511 --> 00:27:55,231
I was pretty mad.

1292
00:27:55,231 --> 00:27:56,550
And then this woman who was there,

1293
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:57,180
uh,

1294
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,680
who represents the,

1295
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,370
the Jewish community such
as it remains for in Israel.

1296
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:02,881
She said,

1297
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:03,001
no,

1298
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:03,151
no,

1299
00:28:03,151 --> 00:28:03,271
no,

1300
00:28:03,271 --> 00:28:03,541
it's just,

1301
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:04,770
it's a question of language.

1302
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,050
But when we went to one
of the Polish museums,

1303
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:09,750
which is the museum of
the Warsaw uprising,

1304
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,660
and they don't have a museum of the,

1305
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:14,070
of the ghetto uprising,

1306
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:14,933
they have a meeting.

1307
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,480
We had to complain semi officially about,

1308
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,140
about the,

1309
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:23,760
how they depicted Jews
in the 1920s in 1930s.

1310
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,980
So this is not the dump on Polish.

1311
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,990
What is the DAP on Polish antisemitism.

1312
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:28,650
But,

1313
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,160
uh,

1314
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,020
but not as Poland as a state,

1315
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,220
but these tensions were,

1316
00:28:32,221 --> 00:28:37,140
so they're exacerbated in
world war between the wars.

1317
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,890
Because if you've got these frenetic
right wing leaders who are aggressive

1318
00:28:40,891 --> 00:28:42,930
nationalists and all of these places,

1319
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,900
and who are they denouncing,

1320
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:47,010
they're announcing what
the treaty of Versailles,

1321
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,510
who,

1322
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,161
Romanians,

1323
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:51,330
if they are Hungarians,

1324
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:51,721
et Cetera,

1325
00:28:51,721 --> 00:28:52,051
et cetera.

1326
00:28:52,051 --> 00:28:55,620
You pick the nationality
and Jews most anywhere,

1327
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:57,180
uh,

1328
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,980
and it was there.

1329
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,061
And so,

1330
00:29:00,061 --> 00:29:00,181
uh,

1331
00:29:00,181 --> 00:29:00,401
these,

1332
00:29:00,401 --> 00:29:02,680
these folks are often like whore.

1333
00:29:02,681 --> 00:29:04,110
The are preaching to the converted.

1334
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,970
They're preaching to the converted.

1335
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:07,621
And,

1336
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:08,454
um,

1337
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:09,001
well,

1338
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:09,361
I mean it's,

1339
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:10,111
it's an obvious,

1340
00:29:10,111 --> 00:29:10,950
sad story.

1341
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:12,370
But in this review,

1342
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,800
these revisionist powers,

1343
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,330
all this stuff is going on.

1344
00:29:15,331 --> 00:29:15,730
Oh,

1345
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:17,040
I know less about,

1346
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:18,870
and don't have much time
to talk about Bulgaria,

1347
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,310
but you have the same,

1348
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,600
which was what's lost.

1349
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:22,890
But you have the same kind of,

1350
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:23,930
of tensions.

1351
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:24,300
Uh,

1352
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,560
Turkey was just completely,

1353
00:29:25,561 --> 00:29:28,710
that's arguably the harshest
treaty is that with Turkey,

1354
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:30,270
because they lose much of the,

1355
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:30,810
of,

1356
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:34,200
or what most of what's left really
in the Middle East of Turkey.

1357
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:36,600
And this gets transformed
into mandates under,

1358
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,280
under British and French,

1359
00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:38,770
uh,

1360
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:39,420
uh,

1361
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,253
control.

1362
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:40,770
Um,

1363
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:43,840
and of course they lose as a losing power.

1364
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,360
They lose a land to a,

1365
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:46,660
uh,

1366
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,160
they're bitter arch enemy.

1367
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,030
Uh,

1368
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:49,990
Greece.

1369
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:54,310
And then this enormous exchange of
populations begins forced exchange of

1370
00:29:54,311 --> 00:29:56,110
populations as followed by,

1371
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:56,381
you know,

1372
00:29:56,381 --> 00:30:00,490
voluntary between Turkey and Greece.

1373
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,180
Uh,

1374
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:01,540
but the,

1375
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,420
the case of Turkey is
special because a Ataturk,

1376
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:04,870
um,

1377
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:05,770
whom you can read about,

1378
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,251
you know,

1379
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:09,670
he becomes the to visionary president of,

1380
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:10,830
of a,

1381
00:30:10,831 --> 00:30:12,250
of a new Turkey,

1382
00:30:12,251 --> 00:30:13,810
of a secularized Turkey,

1383
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:14,740
uh,

1384
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,161
and,

1385
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:17,050
and does not go the way of,

1386
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:17,520
of,

1387
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:17,920
uh,

1388
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,041
uh,

1389
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:22,090
for all occasional stridency of
the way of this serve Europe,

1390
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,750
of,

1391
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,280
of little dictators,

1392
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,060
uh,

1393
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:25,271
uh,

1394
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:27,250
the eastern and central Europe of,

1395
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,420
of little,

1396
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:28,690
uh,

1397
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:29,291
dictators.

1398
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:29,481
And,

1399
00:30:29,481 --> 00:30:30,314
and even as I said,

1400
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,000
and we check this over,

1401
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,361
where are we?

1402
00:30:31,361 --> 00:30:32,590
I kind of left my lecture behind,

1403
00:30:32,591 --> 00:30:33,424
but that's all right.

1404
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,750
I'm doing the themes that,

1405
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,100
that we should be doing anyway,

1406
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:36,880
and you can read it,

1407
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,713
but the rest,

1408
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,440
um,

1409
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:38,890
that,

1410
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:39,723
um,

1411
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,860
even Czechoslovakia,

1412
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:42,400
you,

1413
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,001
no one can say,

1414
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:43,451
well,

1415
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:45,940
there was of a democracy that really,

1416
00:30:45,941 --> 00:30:46,840
truly function.

1417
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:47,650
Uh,

1418
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:47,941
but there,

1419
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:51,310
there are enormous tensions
and Czechoslovakia as well
because what you've got,

1420
00:30:51,311 --> 00:30:55,930
you've got your checks and your
checks are the dominant population in

1421
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:57,400
Czechoslovakia,

1422
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:00,670
but they are basically Protestant,

1423
00:31:00,671 --> 00:31:01,900
mostly Protestant.

1424
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,370
Uh,

1425
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:07,630
to check part or would it become the
Czech Republic is as you already know?

1426
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,470
Uh,

1427
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,460
largely Bohemia,

1428
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:09,581
well,

1429
00:31:09,581 --> 00:31:10,660
much of it is Bohemia.

1430
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:11,510
There's Moravia also,

1431
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,251
it was just my poor,

1432
00:31:12,251 --> 00:31:12,710
but,

1433
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,120
uh,

1434
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,320
it is very industrial.

1435
00:31:14,321 --> 00:31:15,850
It is much more pro pro,

1436
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:16,300
uh,

1437
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:16,810
more pro,

1438
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:21,810
a prosperous and then Slovakia is almost
entirely Catholic and much more rural.

1439
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:24,821
Uh,

1440
00:31:24,821 --> 00:31:29,650
it's basically a peasant society in which
the Catholic Church and particularly

1441
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:33,370
the very right wing aspects of the
Catholic Church as opposed to the case of

1442
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:34,204
Poland,

1443
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:38,230
I where the Catholic Church has
basically been a force for progress.

1444
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,790
I saw except for,

1445
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:40,211
you know,

1446
00:31:40,211 --> 00:31:43,840
antisemitic currents in
some parts of the clergy.

1447
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,820
And it's not surprising
that our world war two,

1448
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,151
when the,

1449
00:31:46,151 --> 00:31:46,331
you know,

1450
00:31:46,331 --> 00:31:49,840
the most horrendous collaborators
and people cheering on,

1451
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:50,770
you know,

1452
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:51,191
uh,

1453
00:31:51,191 --> 00:31:52,120
the guards of the,

1454
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:52,521
of,

1455
00:31:52,521 --> 00:31:52,770
of,

1456
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,250
of the Jews is they're putting,

1457
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,250
packing them onto the
train can be taken away.

1458
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:56,980
Killed.

1459
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,813
I was a priest.

1460
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,490
Uh,

1461
00:31:58,490 --> 00:31:58,830
uh,

1462
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,221
and again,

1463
00:31:59,221 --> 00:31:59,591
I mean this is,

1464
00:31:59,591 --> 00:32:00,610
I'm not dissing the Catholic church.

1465
00:32:00,611 --> 00:32:03,130
I was raised at a Jesuit high school,

1466
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:03,770
uh,

1467
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:04,050
uh,

1468
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,260
and again,

1469
00:32:05,261 --> 00:32:05,530
but,

1470
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,010
uh,

1471
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:06,550
uh,

1472
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,090
but there were tensions
with it within a checklist.

1473
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,130
The lucky also that even in the victor,

1474
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:11,361
you know,

1475
00:32:11,361 --> 00:32:11,520
the,

1476
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,850
in the triumphant case,

1477
00:32:12,851 --> 00:32:13,870
I mean triumphant until,

1478
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:14,231
you know,

1479
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:18,910
the German legions start marching in
and then they start killing Jews again

1480
00:32:18,911 --> 00:32:19,744
there,

1481
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,470
uh,

1482
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,310
or they'd not again,

1483
00:32:21,311 --> 00:32:24,160
because it really hadn't been been
in a program and stuff like that.

1484
00:32:24,161 --> 00:32:24,850
They're,

1485
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:25,540
uh,

1486
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,170
um,

1487
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:26,651
was,

1488
00:32:26,651 --> 00:32:27,700
was even there.

1489
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:28,010
The,

1490
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:28,300
that,

1491
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,110
it's the complexity of,

1492
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,020
of the whole thing that is simply,

1493
00:32:32,021 --> 00:32:32,854
um,

1494
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:33,701
you know,

1495
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:34,630
it's simply amazing,

1496
00:32:34,631 --> 00:32:35,890
but the big point,

1497
00:32:35,891 --> 00:32:37,150
it's not big news,

1498
00:32:37,151 --> 00:32:37,491
but the,

1499
00:32:37,491 --> 00:32:40,610
but the big point is that contentions,

1500
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,280
a contested borders,

1501
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,450
uh,

1502
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,290
the diplomatic problems,

1503
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:46,940
uh,

1504
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,080
caused by the,

1505
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:48,860
uh,

1506
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,290
or inherent in having these new states,

1507
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:52,130
Czechoslovakia,

1508
00:32:52,131 --> 00:32:52,581
Poland,

1509
00:32:52,581 --> 00:32:53,510
and Yugoslavia.

1510
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:54,681
Uh,

1511
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,101
we'll,

1512
00:32:55,101 --> 00:32:55,760
uh,

1513
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,061
we'll,

1514
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:56,360
we'll,

1515
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,680
we'll continue to,

1516
00:32:57,681 --> 00:32:58,430
uh,

1517
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,270
um,

1518
00:32:59,330 --> 00:32:59,541
to,

1519
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:00,291
to be,

1520
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:00,920
uh,

1521
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,670
uh,

1522
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,180
to be very important in,

1523
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:03,411
in a,

1524
00:33:03,411 --> 00:33:06,380
in a place that had
virtually no parliamentary,

1525
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,010
uh,

1526
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,060
traditions.

1527
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,020
Um,

1528
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,590
there is,

1529
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:09,850
there,

1530
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:12,660
there aren't the ones we're
the democratic traditions in,

1531
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:13,340
in,

1532
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:13,551
uh,

1533
00:33:13,551 --> 00:33:15,020
even in a country like Poland,

1534
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:18,530
which had been divided up
between these three empires.

1535
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,491
So it was pretty hard,

1536
00:33:19,491 --> 00:33:20,660
darn hard to suddenly say,

1537
00:33:20,661 --> 00:33:20,811
well,

1538
00:33:20,811 --> 00:33:21,830
now we are a,

1539
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,400
you know,

1540
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,340
we are a republic and try
to try to make that work.

1541
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,240
Um,

1542
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,651
it's very,

1543
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:28,350
very different difficult indeed.

1544
00:33:28,351 --> 00:33:28,461
You know,

1545
00:33:28,461 --> 00:33:29,360
there's a mistake in that,

1546
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:30,160
in that book,

1547
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,470
uh,

1548
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:33,500
or at least I Polish friends told me
it's a mistake as I have described

1549
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:37,580
Pilsudski Pil Sud ski who,

1550
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:38,510
um,

1551
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:42,020
whose parents and who he himself thought
he was a Lithuanian at the beginning,

1552
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:43,730
but I already talked about that.

1553
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,380
He's described as being right wing.

1554
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:48,320
He began his career as
being kind of left wing,

1555
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,360
but he's the first to destroy,

1556
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,430
uh,

1557
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:51,630
uh,

1558
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:55,310
a parliamentary regime
and he does that in 1926,

1559
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:56,210
uh,

1560
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:56,861
fuel zoots Keith,

1561
00:33:56,861 --> 00:33:59,600
a great hero in Poland still,

1562
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,590
I was taken on a,

1563
00:34:00,591 --> 00:34:01,400
you know,

1564
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,530
almost a forced march to see his tomb.

1565
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:04,640
Uh,

1566
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,270
and,

1567
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:05,630
uh,

1568
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,080
why?

1569
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,170
Because he in the miracle
of this tool or river,

1570
00:34:09,171 --> 00:34:12,250
the stool is monumentally
important river in,

1571
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,010
in Poland that the,

1572
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:14,201
that,

1573
00:34:14,201 --> 00:34:15,260
that the Red Army,

1574
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,100
uh,

1575
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:16,461
you know,

1576
00:34:16,461 --> 00:34:20,270
Trotsky's Red Army is moving toward
Warsaw and imagining that they're going to

1577
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:23,840
move toward Berlin and assist this rush,

1578
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,670
the revolution in Germany.

1579
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,580
And they're turned back
in the suburbs of Warsaw,

1580
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:31,560
the miracle of the Vistula by Pilsudski.

1581
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:32,751
And of course,

1582
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:37,580
this gives him a kind of a prestige and
identification with the Polish state.

1583
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,450
Uh,

1584
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:39,650
that is obviously important.

1585
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:41,300
And so he,

1586
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,193
um,

1587
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,640
in 1926,

1588
00:34:43,641 --> 00:34:43,941
he says,

1589
00:34:43,941 --> 00:34:44,151
look,

1590
00:34:44,151 --> 00:34:44,331
this,

1591
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:45,260
this is impossible.

1592
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:48,140
He puts an end to the
parliamentary regime,

1593
00:34:48,141 --> 00:34:49,310
at least in reality.

1594
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,630
And then of course,

1595
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:51,321
the night he's a 19,

1596
00:34:51,321 --> 00:34:52,640
29 or 1930,

1597
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:53,031
uh,

1598
00:34:53,031 --> 00:34:53,511
he,

1599
00:34:53,511 --> 00:34:53,840
uh,

1600
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,411
he rested,

1601
00:34:54,411 --> 00:34:55,244
he arrests the,

1602
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:55,880
you know,

1603
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,210
the progressive opposition.

1604
00:34:57,211 --> 00:34:59,870
So he behaves like these other dictators.

1605
00:34:59,871 --> 00:35:00,111
It's up.

1606
00:35:00,111 --> 00:35:01,670
He's not putting people against the wall,

1607
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,361
you know,

1608
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:02,511
and,

1609
00:35:02,511 --> 00:35:03,080
and,

1610
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:03,590
uh,

1611
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,900
or beating them to death and stuff,

1612
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,050
having a beaten to death by,

1613
00:35:06,051 --> 00:35:06,381
by,

1614
00:35:06,381 --> 00:35:06,770
uh,

1615
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,130
iron guards and all these,

1616
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:08,760
these,

1617
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,030
uh,

1618
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,863
these groups.

1619
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:10,490
Um,

1620
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:11,091
so,

1621
00:35:11,091 --> 00:35:11,241
uh,

1622
00:35:11,241 --> 00:35:11,471
that,

1623
00:35:11,471 --> 00:35:12,920
that's one of the first to go.

1624
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:16,830
Now compounding all of this is the,

1625
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,331
again,

1626
00:35:17,331 --> 00:35:20,540
to go back what I said at the
beginning is that eastern Europe,

1627
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,890
East Central Europe,

1628
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,431
incidentally,

1629
00:35:22,431 --> 00:35:25,400
the polls no longer want to see themselves
as described as the eastern Europe.

1630
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:30,560
And then it was east central Europe and
they said you should go through your

1631
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,900
book and take out all references to
eastern Europe with regard Poland.

1632
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,380
Um,

1633
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,980
we are central Europe and they look,

1634
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:37,671
they,

1635
00:35:37,671 --> 00:35:38,040
you know,

1636
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,360
that's how they see themselves.

1637
00:35:39,361 --> 00:35:39,780
And again,

1638
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,051
it's,

1639
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:40,680
it,

1640
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:45,680
it's impossible to overestimate the
hatred and still the fear of uh,

1641
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:48,091
uh,

1642
00:35:48,091 --> 00:35:48,541
of Russia.

1643
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:51,360
And that's why they had this ridiculous
idea of having American basis in,

1644
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:51,841
in Poland,

1645
00:35:51,841 --> 00:35:52,890
which is just a crazy idea.

1646
00:35:52,891 --> 00:35:53,251
But anyway,

1647
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:56,910
that's just my personal opinion
and in in a parentheses.

1648
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,871
But compounding,

1649
00:35:57,871 --> 00:36:01,890
all of this is the fit.

1650
00:36:01,891 --> 00:36:03,480
You've got a peasant society.

1651
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,610
All of these are peasant societies.

1652
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,760
The vast majority of the
population are peasants.

1653
00:36:08,761 --> 00:36:11,640
I think it's about 75%
in Poland and Poland.

1654
00:36:11,641 --> 00:36:13,250
Warsaw is already very big crop office.

1655
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:13,441
Very,

1656
00:36:13,441 --> 00:36:14,070
very big.

1657
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,410
Keep talking about Poland
cause that's the one I know I,

1658
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,730
I know the best,

1659
00:36:17,731 --> 00:36:21,130
but a Buddha and hungry would be
less because Budapest is so sad.

1660
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,230
It's such a large city.

1661
00:36:22,231 --> 00:36:25,650
And also lots of the rural parts
of Hungary had been amputated,

1662
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,720
but it's a peasant society.

1663
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,640
And what brings,

1664
00:36:29,641 --> 00:36:30,600
and this is the argument of,

1665
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:31,081
of my,

1666
00:36:31,081 --> 00:36:31,520
uh,

1667
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:31,981
a good friend,

1668
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:32,814
Kim Snyder,

1669
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:33,300
uh,

1670
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:38,300
what brings peasants into politics in
the 1920s is one thing besides hating

1671
00:36:41,671 --> 00:36:44,760
people might have the same ethnic
group was them depending on the place.

1672
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:45,301
And,

1673
00:36:45,301 --> 00:36:46,134
and uh,

1674
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:46,920
and uh,

1675
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,640
maybe being antisemitic because of their
tradition of rural money lenders and

1676
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,420
all this who happened to be Jewish
and Jewish store keepers in,

1677
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:55,600
in their perception,

1678
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,050
in the peasant perception of the world,

1679
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:58,800
uh,

1680
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,870
is the hope of land reform,

1681
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,060
of land reform,

1682
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:06,470
of maybe breaking up
the biggest states and,

1683
00:37:06,471 --> 00:37:06,740
and,

1684
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,573
and uh,

1685
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:11,400
but at a minimum helping
out poor rural people.

1686
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:14,340
And what happens is that in the 1920s,

1687
00:37:14,341 --> 00:37:15,450
in the 1930s,

1688
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:20,720
is that poor rural people are being
screwed and put it crudely by what?

1689
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,780
By the agricultural depression.

1690
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:26,890
Because the price of,

1691
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:27,250
of,

1692
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:27,530
uh,

1693
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:28,590
agricultural products,

1694
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,460
which is the economy is the,

1695
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,210
uh,

1696
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,770
plunges to practically nothing,

1697
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:35,910
uh,

1698
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:36,530
and,

1699
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,363
um,

1700
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,393
they can't get by.

1701
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:39,900
And,

1702
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,530
um,

1703
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:44,160
one of the factors for
the rise of fascism,

1704
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:45,450
uh,

1705
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,480
in all of its guises,

1706
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,410
this called fascism,

1707
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:48,681
Italy,

1708
00:37:48,681 --> 00:37:50,290
it's called national socialism in,

1709
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:50,630
in,

1710
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,240
uh,

1711
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:51,930
um,

1712
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:52,111
you know,

1713
00:37:52,111 --> 00:37:52,860
in Germany,

1714
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,520
uh,

1715
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,353
it's called,

1716
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,150
it's called shrunk keys and men in a,

1717
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,740
why this we call in French
and we call in English in,

1718
00:37:58,741 --> 00:37:58,990
in,

1719
00:37:58,990 --> 00:37:59,450
uh,

1720
00:37:59,450 --> 00:37:59,970
um,

1721
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:00,840
in Spain.

1722
00:38:00,841 --> 00:38:00,961
No,

1723
00:38:00,961 --> 00:38:01,651
that's,

1724
00:38:01,651 --> 00:38:02,880
he's not really a fascist.

1725
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:03,301
He's a right.

1726
00:38:03,301 --> 00:38:04,710
Frank was a right wing authoritarian,

1727
00:38:04,711 --> 00:38:05,544
still a murderer,

1728
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,710
but he's a right wing authoritarian.

1729
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:08,400
Uh,

1730
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,233
but he's still a murderer.

1731
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:10,243
A period,

1732
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,220
um,

1733
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,000
is,

1734
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,421
uh,

1735
00:38:12,421 --> 00:38:14,070
is the economic situation,

1736
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,040
and I'll make this clear
when I talk about Germany,

1737
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:18,480
uh,

1738
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,480
because that's what
drives the middle class,

1739
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:21,841
which is,

1740
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,820
are the first class to embrace Hitler.

1741
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,050
Um,

1742
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,940
it's the big crisis of,

1743
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:27,750
uh,

1744
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:31,080
of the great inflation in the early 1920s.

1745
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,210
And what helps drive,

1746
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:34,660
uh,

1747
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,510
drive peasants to all of these countries,

1748
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:40,150
the ones who become
politicized and finally say,

1749
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:40,361
well,

1750
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:41,194
you know,

1751
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:44,080
what a parliamentary
regime bring me my family.

1752
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,101
Not much.

1753
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:45,970
We just still can't,

1754
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,290
we can't get by.

1755
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,430
Um,

1756
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,121
so,

1757
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:49,330
uh,

1758
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:49,571
well,

1759
00:38:49,571 --> 00:38:50,050
ah,

1760
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:50,883
uh,

1761
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,670
these little dictator
guys thundering away,

1762
00:38:54,671 --> 00:38:56,350
they seem to be telling it like it is.

1763
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:59,800
It's the Jews or it's the Bulgarians.

1764
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:02,830
There's the Romanians or it's
Hungarians or it's that serves her.

1765
00:39:02,831 --> 00:39:03,131
It's a,

1766
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:03,521
you name.

1767
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:04,301
It was the Muslims.

1768
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:04,620
It's,

1769
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,170
yeah,

1770
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:05,891
it's the Greeks.

1771
00:39:05,891 --> 00:39:06,311
It's the Turks.

1772
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:06,491
I mean,

1773
00:39:06,491 --> 00:39:06,591
you,

1774
00:39:06,591 --> 00:39:07,424
you name it,

1775
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,111
you know,

1776
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:09,840
you fill in the fill in the,

1777
00:39:09,841 --> 00:39:14,841
that national group and it's a Europe
of hatred and to Europe of fear

1778
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:19,690
and absorbed integrated fear.

1779
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,160
I suppose that's kind of
a silly way of putting it,

1780
00:39:21,161 --> 00:39:21,994
but not that,

1781
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,290
not that,

1782
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,220
not that bad.

1783
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,390
After all.

1784
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,370
And when they look around,

1785
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:31,210
what do they see the first,

1786
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:31,471
you know,

1787
00:39:31,471 --> 00:39:31,761
the,

1788
00:39:31,761 --> 00:39:31,990
the,

1789
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,790
these countries are your other frightened.

1790
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:33,991
They,

1791
00:39:33,991 --> 00:39:34,824
they uh,

1792
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,231
they,

1793
00:39:35,231 --> 00:39:35,910
the,

1794
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:36,581
these powers,

1795
00:39:36,581 --> 00:39:37,211
the new states,

1796
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:37,700
they lie.

1797
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,021
They say,

1798
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:38,171
well,

1799
00:39:38,171 --> 00:39:39,640
we're going to have to lie together.

1800
00:39:39,641 --> 00:39:40,061
And you know,

1801
00:39:40,061 --> 00:39:44,230
some of them join up with France
and that won't do much good in 1939.

1802
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,483
Um,

1803
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:49,900
but there is this model that seems to
be working in Germany and the France,

1804
00:39:49,901 --> 00:39:53,440
what they do in this inflation
and 1920s and thirties,

1805
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:53,591
you know,

1806
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:54,070
they've,

1807
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,180
they were loaning money everywhere.

1808
00:39:55,181 --> 00:39:55,361
You know,

1809
00:39:55,361 --> 00:39:56,410
before they know,

1810
00:39:56,411 --> 00:39:57,600
they pull in the reins,

1811
00:39:57,601 --> 00:39:59,140
they ring in the credit

1812
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,950
and Nazi Germany,

1813
00:40:02,951 --> 00:40:04,720
particularly after it is Nazi Germany,

1814
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:06,340
after January,

1815
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,920
1933 they provide the sort
of model and they say,

1816
00:40:08,921 --> 00:40:09,221
well look,

1817
00:40:09,221 --> 00:40:09,371
you know,

1818
00:40:09,371 --> 00:40:10,204
we'll help you out.

1819
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,500
We'll help you out.

1820
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,391
We'll,

1821
00:40:12,391 --> 00:40:15,400
we'll the other countries are not buying
your products will buy even more of

1822
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:18,790
them and we'll loan you money
and we'll organize this.

1823
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,650
And it seems to be an orderly
society and more about that.

1824
00:40:23,651 --> 00:40:27,640
It's not just a society of
coercion a without jumping ahead.

1825
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:28,301
You know,

1826
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:32,450
Hitler seems to be providing
things to the German people that,

1827
00:40:32,451 --> 00:40:32,631
that,

1828
00:40:32,631 --> 00:40:32,950
that,

1829
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:35,200
that they want a work.

1830
00:40:35,201 --> 00:40:35,411
I mean,

1831
00:40:35,411 --> 00:40:36,430
the armaments factories,

1832
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:39,310
he's preparing for war order,

1833
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:39,791
you know,

1834
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:41,020
they're resting petty criminals.

1835
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:44,980
I'll talk more about
that and racial purity.

1836
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:46,480
And they begin thinking,

1837
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:46,991
Hey,

1838
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:47,681
that's a good thing.

1839
00:40:47,681 --> 00:40:50,890
It's the fault of the Jews and the Poles.

1840
00:40:50,891 --> 00:40:51,160
It's,

1841
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,720
it's the fault of the Poles.

1842
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,071
And you know,

1843
00:40:54,071 --> 00:40:54,430
when they,

1844
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,540
when they invade Poland,

1845
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:56,471
uh,

1846
00:40:56,471 --> 00:40:56,711
this,

1847
00:40:56,711 --> 00:40:59,200
I don't emphasize this as much
as I should have been in your,

1848
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,070
um,

1849
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,000
in your book,

1850
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:01,270
but,

1851
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:01,950
uh,

1852
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:02,260
uh,

1853
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:02,441
you know,

1854
00:41:02,441 --> 00:41:02,581
they,

1855
00:41:02,581 --> 00:41:03,910
they begin right away,

1856
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:04,331
uh,

1857
00:41:04,331 --> 00:41:06,790
carrying out a genocide.

1858
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,630
Uh,

1859
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:10,780
they begin killing the
Polish intelligentsia,

1860
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,290
uh,

1861
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:12,190
right away,

1862
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:16,210
and they kill the Polish
a generals right away.

1863
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,200
Uh,

1864
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,330
and the Russians are doing
the same thing actually,

1865
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:19,990
uh,

1866
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:22,270
the Soviets a further on.

1867
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,793
And so,

1868
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:24,581
uh,

1869
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:25,241
this is a,

1870
00:41:25,241 --> 00:41:25,751
it's a,

1871
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:28,720
it's a permanent source of instability.

1872
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,290
This agrarian,

1873
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:30,880
uh,

1874
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,830
depression does economic,

1875
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:33,830
uh,

1876
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:34,663
depression.

1877
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:35,720
But what it does,

1878
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:40,790
it's a factor for further destabilization
and talk about parliamentary regimes

1879
00:41:41,841 --> 00:41:42,800
comes pretty cheap,

1880
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:43,460
but they,

1881
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:47,000
they disappear one after another.

1882
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:51,310
And in each and every
case in the fascist and,

1883
00:41:51,311 --> 00:41:54,860
and variance in each and every case,

1884
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:55,670
uh,

1885
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,860
the discourse is we,

1886
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:01,070
the real people of this place.

1887
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:04,790
We do not want these other people here.

1888
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,560
We don't want them here.

1889
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:10,310
And of course not all of
these people carried it to,

1890
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,150
uh,

1891
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:11,581
to the,

1892
00:42:11,581 --> 00:42:12,081
to,

1893
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:12,530
uh,

1894
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,130
the,

1895
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,150
the outcome of,

1896
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:15,720
uh,

1897
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,240
uh,

1898
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,600
of the Nazis or of the Lithuanians and
the Ukrainians who just started beating,

1899
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,690
beating Jews to death
and all along the way.

1900
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:24,531
But,

1901
00:42:24,531 --> 00:42:24,861
but,

1902
00:42:24,861 --> 00:42:25,320
uh,

1903
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,090
it wasn't just the western
states that had great,

1904
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:29,690
uh,

1905
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:30,860
instability,

1906
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:31,701
uh,

1907
00:42:31,701 --> 00:42:35,470
and the willingness and the
eagerness of people like who are,

1908
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,590
need to collaborate with,

1909
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,220
uh,

1910
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:37,971
uh,

1911
00:42:37,971 --> 00:42:39,050
with Hitler openly,

1912
00:42:39,051 --> 00:42:40,160
enthusiastically,

1913
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,180
uh,

1914
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:41,751
uh,

1915
00:42:41,751 --> 00:42:43,730
all the way through until the bitter end,

1916
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,610
as in part a result of,

1917
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:47,300
of,

1918
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:47,660
uh,

1919
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,051
that,

1920
00:42:48,051 --> 00:42:51,320
that these right wing movements
become mass movements in these places.

1921
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:51,541
And,

1922
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:52,960
and as they did in,

1923
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:53,871
in Germany,

1924
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:54,770
and as they did in,

1925
00:42:54,771 --> 00:42:55,071
in,

1926
00:42:55,071 --> 00:42:55,460
uh,

1927
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:55,880
you know,

1928
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,260
8% of the population of,

1929
00:42:57,261 --> 00:43:00,350
of the Netherlands votes
for their guy called Musa,

1930
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,390
who's their little fascist sky,

1931
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:03,260
uh,

1932
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:03,790
or in,

1933
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:04,730
in Belgium,

1934
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,440
in which is town of shopkeepers.

1935
00:43:06,441 --> 00:43:09,330
They support their guy who just
died about 10 years ago lug well,

1936
00:43:09,331 --> 00:43:10,164
who's a,

1937
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:11,400
who's a good luck,

1938
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,500
I can't remember what his name was.

1939
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:12,890
Uh,

1940
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,060
who died in the Costa Brava.

1941
00:43:14,061 --> 00:43:15,530
They all seem to dine in the Costa Brava.

1942
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:19,340
They all basically get away with it and
ended up going to Spain in a lot of them

1943
00:43:19,341 --> 00:43:20,870
protected by the Franco regime.

1944
00:43:20,871 --> 00:43:23,060
And they all seem to
Croak on the Costa Brava.

1945
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:23,421
But,

1946
00:43:23,421 --> 00:43:24,050
uh,

1947
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:24,710
anyway,

1948
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:25,543
well,

1949
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,410
I got away from the text,

1950
00:43:27,411 --> 00:43:28,221
but it doesn't matter.

1951
00:43:28,221 --> 00:43:28,610
I didn't really,

1952
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:29,220
I,

1953
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:29,670
uh,

1954
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:31,370
I think I've made my points anyway.

1955
00:43:31,371 --> 00:43:32,720
And the points are that,

1956
00:43:32,721 --> 00:43:33,081
that,

1957
00:43:33,081 --> 00:43:33,620
uh,

1958
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:38,620
that Europe is in a period of unstability
of instability that with the exception

1959
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:44,150
of the big powers in the
West between 1924 in 1929,

1960
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:44,480
uh,

1961
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,070
all of these places are in depression.

1962
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:46,521
Uh,

1963
00:43:46,521 --> 00:43:49,460
and that the sweeping away
of parliamentary regimes,

1964
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:50,180
uh,

1965
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:53,750
in places that had virtually no
parliamentary traditions at all,

1966
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:54,560
uh,

1967
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,910
was not all that surprising
and that it was compounded by,

1968
00:43:58,950 --> 00:43:59,420
uh,

1969
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,680
the outcome of World War One.

1970
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:01,640
Uh,

1971
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,241
that again,

1972
00:44:02,241 --> 00:44:03,200
as I've said before,

1973
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:04,750
at least twice that the demons of the,

1974
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,900
of the 20th century,

1975
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:06,321
you know,

1976
00:44:06,321 --> 00:44:10,000
emerged from the war and
nowhere more tellingly,

1977
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:11,390
more appallingly with greater,

1978
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:11,850
uh,

1979
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:12,360
uh,

1980
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:12,710
uh,

1981
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:13,940
with greater costs,

1982
00:44:13,941 --> 00:44:15,320
with greater devastation,

1983
00:44:15,321 --> 00:44:15,561
with,

1984
00:44:15,561 --> 00:44:15,980
with,

1985
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:16,500
uh,

1986
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,300
humanities thinking to an
all time low than that in,

1987
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,040
in a Nazi Germany.

1988
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,020
And that's what I'm
going to talk about next.

1989
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:24,590
Uh,

1990
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:26,210
Wednesday,

1991
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:26,330
Monday,

1992
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,470
another cheerful topic,

1993
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:28,423
stolen Islam.

1994
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:29,270
Uh,

1995
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:29,871
and,

1996
00:44:29,871 --> 00:44:30,081
uh,

1997
00:44:30,081 --> 00:44:30,920
we will go from there.

1998
00:44:30,921 --> 00:44:32,780
Have a wonderful weekend and I'll see you.
