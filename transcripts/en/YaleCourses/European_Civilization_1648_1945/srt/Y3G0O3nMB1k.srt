1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,573
Okay.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,700
I want the day to talk about about,

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,680
um,

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,561
cyber aeration,

5
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:11,430
but above all resistance in
Europe during World War Two.

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,670
And I'll talk mostly about France
because that's where there's been so much

7
00:00:14,671 --> 00:00:16,530
written about.

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,220
Um,

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,220
and also I,

10
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,420
because France coming to grips
with the Vichy past was not,

11
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:24,570
uh,

12
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,190
was not,

13
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:25,441
uh,

14
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:26,340
an evident thing.

15
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:27,900
It was something that took a long time.

16
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:32,580
There was a process of co
collective and official,

17
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:33,923
uh,

18
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,280
repression,

19
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:35,731
uh,

20
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:37,170
about what had happened.

21
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,470
And so I want to talk about
that cause it's again,

22
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,520
I mean histories have
their histories and that's,

23
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:44,940
uh,

24
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,650
I've been around here long enough that I,

25
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:47,101
that I,

26
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:47,340
I,

27
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:47,581
you know,

28
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,110
I can remember all of this happening,

29
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:50,310
not the war obviously,

30
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:50,960
but,

31
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,121
uh,

32
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:51,541
thank you.

33
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:51,751
But,

34
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:52,090
but,

35
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:52,800
uh,

36
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,101
uh,

37
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:53,341
but,

38
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:55,380
but France coming to grips with its past.

39
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:56,850
So I want to talk about that.

40
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,320
We haven't talked about
France and long time.

41
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,573
I want to talk about that.

42
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:00,031
Uh,

43
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:01,740
but first let me just say a couple things.

44
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,580
Um,

45
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,413
that,

46
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:03,961
I mean,

47
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:05,820
other countries had their resistance,

48
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:06,241
uh,

49
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:07,380
resistors as well.

50
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:07,921
Uh,

51
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:11,970
it was obviously the most successful
case of resistance was that of Yugoslavia

52
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,470
or ex Yugoslavia,

53
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:14,101
uh,

54
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:15,540
because you know,

55
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,560
well before the end of the war,

56
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,970
Tito Marshal Tito and his partisans,

57
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,290
um,

58
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,640
taking advantage of,

59
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:24,180
of,

60
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:24,780
uh,

61
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,021
uh,

62
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:29,670
the mountains of ex Yugoslavia where
we're able to pin down entire German

63
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:32,610
divisions and with a
weapons parachuted in,

64
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:32,960
uh,

65
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,890
by the allies and with entire,

66
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:35,250
you know,

67
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,630
moving hospitals,

68
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,230
uh,

69
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:37,570
uh,

70
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:38,670
we're able to,

71
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:39,240
uh,

72
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:39,631
uh,

73
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:41,010
to launch the most effective,

74
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:41,460
um,

75
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:41,760
uh,

76
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,593
resistance,

77
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,670
arguably a in Europe.

78
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,391
And of course,

79
00:01:45,391 --> 00:01:45,691
I mean the,

80
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:47,250
the case of the Soviet Union,

81
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:47,671
you know,

82
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:52,190
25 million people die during 25
million people died in World War Two,

83
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,220
uh,

84
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,510
most of them in the war,

85
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:54,871
uh,

86
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:56,290
but lots also installing,

87
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,110
installing these camps.

88
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,290
But La,

89
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,620
a lot of partisans,

90
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,360
uh,

91
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:01,650
uh,

92
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,560
lost their lives picking
off German soldiers.

93
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,600
In the case of Poland,

94
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,010
and it's a,

95
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:08,880
in the third edition,

96
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:09,930
there'll be more on on,

97
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,050
on this.

98
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:11,700
Um,

99
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,470
and they got scarcely a mentioned.

100
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:14,100
Uh,

101
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,480
the Polish had a home,

102
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,770
a home army,

103
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:17,940
as they called it,

104
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:19,470
of about 300,000 people.

105
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:20,520
By the end of the war,

106
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,431
uh,

107
00:02:21,431 --> 00:02:22,360
and the,

108
00:02:22,361 --> 00:02:22,950
um,

109
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,330
the Warsaw ghetto,

110
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,740
a rose up,

111
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,670
uh,

112
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:26,881
and,

113
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:31,410
and was crushed with 12,000 deaths and
with thousands of other people sent away

114
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:32,340
to the camps,

115
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,710
uh,

116
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,090
in 1943 and then the war saw uprising.

117
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:36,601
Uh,

118
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:37,940
one of the reasons that Warsaw,

119
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,740
the worst were all be on
Friday and go fairly often,

120
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,340
uh,

121
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:41,911
was just,

122
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:45,360
there was nothing left because
the uprising was crushed and,

123
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:47,340
and thousands and thousands of people,

124
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:47,910
uh,

125
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,743
lost,

126
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:48,930
uh,

127
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:49,980
lost their lives.

128
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,203
Um,

129
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,141
it was,

130
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:54,840
I just reviewed a book actually
for the Boston Globe about,

131
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,440
uh,

132
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,550
called Ghetto Washdot,

133
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,060
which is an interesting book by a man
called Gordon what to teach us in,

134
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:02,050
in Illinois.

135
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,070
Um,

136
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:03,801
and it's about the,

137
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:04,930
the low the woods,

138
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,620
uh,

139
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,420
Lod Dz ghetto.

140
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,621
And it's a,

141
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:08,801
you know,

142
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:09,011
it's a,

143
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:11,560
it's a tragic all too familiar tale.

144
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,020
It doesn't really do with resistance
because it was impossible,

145
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,310
but it was about the German ideas of
creating this area in the city in watts,

146
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:19,270
which was a big guy,

147
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,470
industrial town,

148
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,910
and still is in Poland.

149
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,910
And of course what they did is
they put all the juice into the,

150
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:26,170
get into the ghetto,

151
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:26,801
uh,

152
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:31,330
which was several kilometers a square
a and then puts them to work making

153
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:34,570
uniforms and ear muffs and all sorts
of things for the German troops.

154
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,300
Uh,

155
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,930
and the story really the most
horrific aspect of it is,

156
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,610
is that the people in the ghetto,

157
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,170
they don't really know.

158
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:43,690
There's all these rumors about
what's happening outside.

159
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:44,021
Of course,

160
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:45,460
what's happening is the killing fields,

161
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,150
uh,

162
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,230
3 million Jews,

163
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:47,441
uh,

164
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:47,621
you know,

165
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:48,910
disappear in Poland,

166
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:49,744
in World War II,

167
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,560
uh,

168
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:50,770
uh,

169
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,610
3 million,

170
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,623
3 million.

171
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:53,660
Um,

172
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,840
and I'm gradually that day,

173
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:56,111
you know,

174
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:59,260
and some people before
they're being killed by them,

175
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,830
by the Nazis are forced
to write postcards,

176
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:05,740
Cherry Postcard saying all
is well here in these camps,

177
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:06,830
everything is just delightful.

178
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:08,010
And of course then they're executed.

179
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:08,800
Um,

180
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,680
but gradually it's,

181
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:10,510
it's about the whore.

182
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,780
The mounting a horror of the people
who live there is that they see close,

183
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:18,010
stacked up outside the ghetto that they
could recognize as having been on people

184
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:18,460
they know,

185
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,070
they knew who had been
shipped away to the camps.

186
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:21,731
And it's really just,

187
00:04:21,731 --> 00:04:22,360
I don't know,

188
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,193
it's just an a,

189
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,100
it's the whole thing.

190
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:24,934
So all right.

191
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,160
So horrendous than it was with us today.

192
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,713
Um,

193
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,440
that obviously it was more a,

194
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:35,140
it was easier to resist in
places in which you can hide.

195
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,640
And when I talk about France,

196
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,291
the reason that,

197
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,520
and I sent this term around
you call the French resistors,

198
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,230
the Mucky,

199
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:45,230
sad or even just a lay McKee is because
they were able to hide in brought behind

200
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:46,474
brush,

201
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:46,900
uh,

202
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,830
called Mckee,

203
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,330
which are more about this later.

204
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:49,710
Uh,

205
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,160
so resistance in Belgium,

206
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:52,990
which is the flat country outside of,

207
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:54,100
around the Argon was very,

208
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:54,934
very difficult,

209
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,690
uh,

210
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,370
in,

211
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,260
because there was hardly a
hill this more than a hump in,

212
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,541
in,

213
00:04:59,541 --> 00:04:59,761
in,

214
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:00,430
in,

215
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,030
uh,

216
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,540
in,

217
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,050
uh,

218
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:02,831
in Denmark.

219
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:06,820
But yet it was the Danes I in
Copenhagen who saved the Jews,

220
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,270
who got them out with the
help of a German officer and,

221
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,661
and,

222
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:12,850
and was able to get them
to just across the very,

223
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:13,240
uh,

224
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,610
narrow straits to model in,

225
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:16,031
in,

226
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:16,690
um,

227
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:16,811
uh,

228
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:17,710
in Sweden.

229
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,050
Um,

230
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,680
and other countries had the,

231
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,690
had the resistances as well.

232
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:24,550
And all of those can't be recovered,

233
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,001
uh,

234
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:25,660
now,

235
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:25,870
uh,

236
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,130
in a short amount of time.

237
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:27,491
Why not us?

238
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:28,780
But to have this class here actually,

239
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:30,020
because it has a label on it,

240
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,000
not supposed to have
this glass here at all.

241
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,753
Um,

242
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,010
but so I guess what I'll,

243
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:42,190
what I'll do is I want to talk about
France and about the resistance there now

244
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,250
until about 1969,

245
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:50,140
1969 a year that I can remember Altamont,

246
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,693
uh,

247
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:52,480
you know,

248
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,390
the mets win the,

249
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,890
the series a but more important,

250
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:57,890
uh,

251
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,290
protests against the war
in the United States,

252
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:00,961
uh,

253
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,090
and moaning,

254
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,100
dissatisfaction with,

255
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,840
uh,

256
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,170
was United States foreign policy.

257
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:06,351
I mean,

258
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:07,031
I can remember that very,

259
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:07,790
very well,

260
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,500
but until 1969,

261
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:10,671
uh,

262
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:11,750
there in France,

263
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:14,390
the official line was
virtually everybody resisted.

264
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,741
A few elites,

265
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:16,640
a few notables,

266
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,630
rural Leitz,

267
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:18,440
uh,

268
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,150
collaborated period.

269
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,620
Um,

270
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,180
and the official line was one,

271
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:23,541
of course,

272
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:27,590
it was very closely tied to gall
ism because Charles de Gaulle,

273
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:28,424
the big guy,

274
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,420
uh,

275
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:29,961
he,

276
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:30,141
uh,

277
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:30,351
you know,

278
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:31,760
his voice crackles over,

279
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:32,330
uh,

280
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:32,631
uh,

281
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:33,710
June 18th,

282
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,440
uh,

283
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:34,821
you know,

284
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:35,930
an 1840,

285
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:37,990
and he calls on France to resist it.

286
00:06:37,991 --> 00:06:42,860
And a part of the myth that everybody
resisted or almost everybody in few people

287
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:43,694
collaborated,

288
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,830
I had to do with the
official goal is policy,

289
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:48,380
which is that the Gaullist resistant.

290
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:50,180
And they were that Charles de Gaulle,

291
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,350
this of mystical,

292
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:51,741
you know,

293
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:53,360
body of Charles de Gaulle,

294
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:56,660
the greater the body being greater
than the sum of all its parts,

295
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:57,440
uh,

296
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,460
led France,

297
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:58,791
uh,

298
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,680
which essentially liberated itself.

299
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:01,540
Um,

300
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,500
and of course that that's
completely not true.

301
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,220
And that also what that forgot about
was the fact that the communists were

302
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:11,870
enormously important in the resistance
and more about that in a while there was

303
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,531
a film made,

304
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:13,311
a documentary,

305
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:14,810
I think in about 1953.

306
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:16,040
I've never actually seen it.

307
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,080
And it had to do with the Jews.

308
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,840
It had to do with what happened
to the Jews and France.

309
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,770
It was conveniently forgotten that
the Jews in Paris who were arrested,

310
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:25,490
uh,

311
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,650
in the Monterey and the Jewish section of,

312
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,350
with Paris and in other places
too were arrested by the,

313
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,360
by the French police.

314
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,070
The Germans would have
been happy to do it,

315
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:37,370
but they didn't need to because the
French police were so eager to do that.

316
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,440
And in this film there was a,

317
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,130
uh,

318
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:43,910
Jews and other people and communists
and other people who were sent away were

319
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,070
packed off to a place called dual c,

320
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,031
which is a,

321
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:51,590
if you've ever taken the rer and from
the airport or to the airport to Wasi

322
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:54,050
airport in Paris who've
gone through John C,

323
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:55,400
and that was a transit camp.

324
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,840
And in transit camps,

325
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:58,670
rather like Mylene are Mechelen in,

326
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,250
in Belgium or vest Westbrook,

327
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,270
Westbrook,

328
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,380
I guess it's called an in,

329
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:03,920
uh,

330
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,820
in the Netherlands,

331
00:08:04,821 --> 00:08:05,870
quite near the German border.

332
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:09,890
These camps were run
by French Belgians and,

333
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,760
um,

334
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,130
uh,

335
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:11,963
and Dutch.

336
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,490
They were not run by the Nazis.

337
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:14,690
The Nazis would have been happy to do it.

338
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:14,851
But,

339
00:08:14,851 --> 00:08:17,120
but the local populations
and local collaborators,

340
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:17,961
collaborators,

341
00:08:17,961 --> 00:08:18,794
we're doing that.

342
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:19,640
Uh,

343
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,120
and in this film made
in 1953 in the original,

344
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:23,760
there's UCLA,

345
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,740
a French gendarme who's
guarding the Jews at drone.

346
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,920
See now in the documentary
that was finally released,

347
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:37,090
somebody has reached in and plucked him
from the film and he simply disappears.

348
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,550
It's doctored.

349
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,190
So the French gendarme with his friends.

350
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:48,191
Sharn dom had a gendarme hat isn't in
the film because the myth was a course

351
00:08:48,771 --> 00:08:49,041
that,

352
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,180
that the Jews were taken away and,

353
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:51,550
and,

354
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,370
and uh,

355
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,320
by the Germans and the Communists,

356
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:58,800
resistors were shot by the Germans and
the Gypsies and gay people were taken

357
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:01,920
away by the Germans were
arrested by the Germans and that,

358
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:03,240
that the France resisted in,

359
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:04,074
didn't collaborate.

360
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,090
Now two events.

361
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,301
Well,

362
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:07,590
let me also tell you a story.

363
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,323
Two stories.

364
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,290
Um,

365
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:10,831
when I was,

366
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:12,900
I hope I didn't say this the first day
when I was trying to get you interested

367
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:14,160
in learning about where we're too,

368
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,440
but when I worked at a place called Tula,

369
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:17,730
t u l l e,

370
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,110
a,

371
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:18,350
Iran,

372
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,280
I was doing my research for
my dissertation long ago.

373
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:21,060
And all that.

374
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,480
And,

375
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,290
um,

376
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,140
I would go down,

377
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:23,791
I couldn't have any money.

378
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:24,370
I go down by,

379
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:24,610
you know,

380
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,250
ice cream cone for lunch and,

381
00:09:26,251 --> 00:09:26,641
and,

382
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:27,080
uh,

383
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,511
every day.

384
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:30,040
And I started talking to this guy and
I didn't speak French very well and,

385
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:30,450
and,

386
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,010
uh,

387
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:31,710
um,

388
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:35,610
but I knew that there were a lot of
people hung their 99 men were hung.

389
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,571
And,

390
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:36,720
uh,

391
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,553
because the,

392
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,011
the,

393
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:38,844
the,

394
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,800
the Germans left the Maki,

395
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:42,390
the resistors are very active there.

396
00:09:42,391 --> 00:09:44,730
Andre model whole with a great
group of the great writer was,

397
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:46,070
was active and in place,

398
00:09:46,071 --> 00:09:47,760
what are some ta near there.

399
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,590
And one day the Germans
all left and then the,

400
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:53,280
everybody came out and started party and
the Germans came back and they hung 99

401
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:55,330
men from polls in two.

402
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,180
And one day I was there and,

403
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:00,060
and this guy was telling me this
story about how he had hidden,

404
00:10:00,061 --> 00:10:00,781
he'd gone up,

405
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:00,921
it's,

406
00:10:00,921 --> 00:10:01,250
uh,

407
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,130
it's a little what?

408
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:03,870
Real whiny town in a valley.

409
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:05,980
And he'd gone up and hidden with the,

410
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,181
you know,

411
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:07,170
you got house here.

412
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:08,550
And so he got room under the house.

413
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:10,920
And so he was able to hide
and escape because he was 16,

414
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:12,090
he would have been hung.

415
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,020
Um,

416
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,380
and this woman came up and I,

417
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,940
and I was eating my ice cream cone
and she ordered an ice cream cone.

418
00:10:17,941 --> 00:10:18,900
And so the guy suddenly said,

419
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:19,021
well,

420
00:10:19,021 --> 00:10:19,700
Madame Wa,

421
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:19,800
uh,

422
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,610
dupont,

423
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:20,701
uh,

424
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:21,540
you remember that day,

425
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,020
don't you?

426
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,171
Oh,

427
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:22,501
she said,

428
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:22,591
oh,

429
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,041
I sure do.

430
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,690
They hung my husband from that poll.

431
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:26,941
You know,

432
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:31,210
how every day you could
live with that and just,

433
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:31,531
you know,

434
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,610
talk about that as if you were
discussing where you would,

435
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:33,990
you know,

436
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,400
bought something in the sale.

437
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:40,170
But the next step to thinking about that
is who in France made all those things

438
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:40,711
possible?

439
00:10:40,711 --> 00:10:41,550
Who was helping the,

440
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,870
the Germans do that.

441
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,320
And the answer is that lots of people,

442
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:46,980
collaborative,

443
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,370
lots of people got what they wanted on
a platter because of the Nazi victory.

444
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,290
And the same people who were shrieking
better healers and bloom in 1936 got

445
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,880
exactly what they wanted.

446
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,440
And Marshall [inaudible],

447
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,240
who was a rabid anti-semite,

448
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:02,370
became his national revolution,

449
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,010
was essentially aim to do in,

450
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:10,050
to do in France what Hitler had done in
Germany and what other petty despots had

451
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:11,070
done in other places.

452
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,260
Some not so petty like Hitler.

453
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,670
They got what they wanted.

454
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,650
So how do the official line
gets shaken by reality?

455
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:20,371
Uh,

456
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:21,420
how did this happen?

457
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:22,980
Second story,

458
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:26,550
I have a friend who was still a lawyer
in Paris and I've known him for a long,

459
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:26,791
long,

460
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:27,624
long time.

461
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,070
And he was too young to remember,

462
00:11:29,071 --> 00:11:29,371
but his,

463
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:32,040
his older brother who's
dead now remembered when,

464
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,350
when the Germans came to
his house in the suburbs,

465
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:35,011
a place called Lupo,

466
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:38,280
who's her mom took away the
father who was a Greek Jew.

467
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,031
Uh,

468
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,650
and of course he was
taken away and it was,

469
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,281
was killed.

470
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:41,431
I mean,

471
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:42,570
he ended up in one of the camps.

472
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:44,340
They don't know what happened to them now.

473
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,040
The Germans didn't just come
to that house by chance.

474
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,660
The Guy was denounced as a Jew
by the policemen in that town.

475
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,770
And after the war,

476
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,190
every Saturday when,

477
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,820
uh,

478
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,031
you know,

479
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:56,440
this lady went to the widow,

480
00:11:56,441 --> 00:11:57,221
went to the market,

481
00:11:57,221 --> 00:12:00,370
she walked by and saw this
policeman directing traffic,

482
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:01,510
the same guy.

483
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,250
Nothing ever happened to him.

484
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,650
Nothing ever happened to him,

485
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:06,371
but it's,

486
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:06,491
well,

487
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:11,491
how did the official version
get eliminated by historical
reality histories have

488
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:12,670
their histories.

489
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:13,990
How did that happen?

490
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,620
Where there are two events that are
kind of key and they're both in,

491
00:12:16,621 --> 00:12:17,590
in what I sent around.

492
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,180
One is the movie,

493
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,830
the sorrow and the pity,

494
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:22,030
which I mentioned in here before,

495
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:26,350
which was described as a to six pack
movie in the old days when I used to show

496
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:27,184
it here,

497
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,960
because the last four and a half hours,

498
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,750
it was a documentary made
for French television,

499
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,250
uh,

500
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,300
by Max Office.

501
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:37,600
It was never shown on
French television till 1981.

502
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,643
Why?

503
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,400
Because it was a documentary
in which collaborators,

504
00:12:43,401 --> 00:12:46,210
there's a sort of a local notable
called Christiane dilemmas.

505
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:46,960
Yeah.

506
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,840
Who describes in his smoking,

507
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,550
smoking in his fancy
jacket in the chateau.

508
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:56,790
Why he fought alongside the Nazis on
the eastern front in the Waffen ss.

509
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,710
And it's about collaboration.

510
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:00,461
And resistance,

511
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:00,820
terror,

512
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,560
tales of,

513
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,020
of,

514
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,220
of true heroism,

515
00:13:03,221 --> 00:13:04,060
but also of,

516
00:13:04,061 --> 00:13:05,830
of repressed memory.

517
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:08,520
There's a great scene in which they're
walking through the school and,

518
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,191
and you know,

519
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:10,060
they ask about,

520
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:10,211
you know,

521
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:13,210
about the teacher teacher who disappeared
and they don't even remember about it.

522
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,110
They don't remember it.

523
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,190
The guys are being interviewed,

524
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,140
they've conveniently forgotten.

525
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,390
And so the sorrow and the pity,

526
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,250
the sugarhill a PTA,

527
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,700
I was never shown our French TV till 1981.

528
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,061
Uh,

529
00:13:26,061 --> 00:13:26,200
it,

530
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,411
I mean,

531
00:13:26,411 --> 00:13:28,120
it's a fantastic take us too long.

532
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:29,140
I should have never shown it.

533
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,730
I started showing it twice,

534
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,001
you know,

535
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:31,834
I mean in,

536
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,710
in sections,

537
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:32,921
I mean,

538
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:36,460
and also it's kind of dubbed and it's
very hard to understand that he either in

539
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:37,510
French or in English,

540
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,120
but it's,

541
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,040
it's a monument.

542
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:39,731
It's a monument,

543
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:40,600
not just because it's a,

544
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:41,280
you know,

545
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,420
a driving forceful documentary.

546
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:43,871
But if,

547
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:48,871
because it helped France rediscovers past
fabulous and talking about the role of

548
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:49,781
the,

549
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:50,770
of the Communist Party.

550
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:52,511
And again,

551
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,350
I'm not a communist,

552
00:13:53,351 --> 00:13:53,891
but I'm telling you,

553
00:13:53,891 --> 00:13:56,620
the Communist Party at an
enormous role and the resistance,

554
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,180
and there's a great scene where these two,

555
00:13:58,181 --> 00:13:59,230
these two peasants for it's,

556
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:00,670
most of it was about Claremont fit home.

557
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,720
The area is based on the,

558
00:14:02,721 --> 00:14:03,070
uh,

559
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,720
the Avaya town of Claremont Hall.

560
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:06,790
Um,

561
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,241
and,

562
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:07,331
uh,

563
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:10,120
there's this great scene where these
two peasants out in the countryside and

564
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:13,540
they say a nuisance who's
you'll come to a van were red,

565
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,830
like the wine we're drinking.

566
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:15,910
Uh,

567
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,381
and it,

568
00:14:16,381 --> 00:14:16,541
you know,

569
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:17,440
it's a fabulous,

570
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:18,274
fabulous,

571
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,181
fabulous thing.

572
00:14:19,181 --> 00:14:19,571
And of course,

573
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:23,400
there's the inevitable scene at the
end where we're pro were women who were

574
00:14:23,401 --> 00:14:24,730
called indelicately,

575
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,950
a horizontal collaborators,

576
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:27,790
uh,

577
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,031
were,

578
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:29,860
had their head shaved and we're being,

579
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:32,620
being paraded through the town
that happened all over the place.

580
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:33,130
They told him,

581
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,010
news is what you call it in
French than a marriage conference.

582
00:14:36,011 --> 00:14:36,281
But that,

583
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:36,690
but,

584
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:37,040
but,

585
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,870
and in the end there's,

586
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,490
there's a,

587
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:39,100
uh,

588
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,290
uh,

589
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,190
Mojica Chavela.

590
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,063
Yay.

591
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,170
Now your grandparents will know who
Maria [inaudible] was because he kind of

592
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:45,040
represented,

593
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,000
uh,

594
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,750
uh,

595
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,910
the front in the American imagination,

596
00:14:48,911 --> 00:14:49,780
what France was.

597
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:50,591
He was a crooner,

598
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:52,100
he was a singer who had,

599
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:52,970
was born in,

600
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,450
uh,

601
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,021
in many more,

602
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:54,411
Tom,

603
00:14:54,411 --> 00:14:55,041
which is in a,

604
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,440
in a proletarian edge of Paris,

605
00:14:57,441 --> 00:14:57,770
uh,

606
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,570
right near Radio,

607
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,420
pee off the singer was when
your grandparents will have
heard of also people way

608
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:03,254
before my time.

609
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,250
Um,

610
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,270
but at the end,

611
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:05,841
you know,

612
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:05,930
he,

613
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,681
at the end of the movie,

614
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:10,330
they have him and he's wearing this little
crooning suit and he says in English,

615
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:10,611
he says,

616
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:10,701
well,

617
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,151
you know,

618
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:12,920
there are these rumors that I was,

619
00:15:12,921 --> 00:15:13,470
uh,

620
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,820
that I was a singing for the Germans,

621
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,950
but I just want to tell you that
I was only singing for z boys.

622
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:19,783
That is for the,

623
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,110
the prisoners of war.

624
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:24,950
And he was dealing with
his own past as well.

625
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:25,660
And,

626
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,060
and,

627
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,700
uh,

628
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,111
Francois,

629
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:27,944
me to hall,

630
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,750
President of France,

631
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,650
14 years,

632
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:34,820
beginning in 1981 when he was inaugurated,

633
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:35,600
uh,

634
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,600
the cameras follow him through the Pontiac
and he follows him by where the heart

635
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:44,270
or some part of a genre
has this left but false.

636
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:44,781
Want me to Ron?

637
00:15:44,781 --> 00:15:45,740
When he was dying,

638
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,990
he came to grips with his own past.

639
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,220
When he was dying,

640
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,271
he too,

641
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,991
like France.

642
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,170
He said there was a moment
when I was not a resistor,

643
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:55,670
which he became a resistor,

644
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,110
but there was a moment that he had
celebrated Vishi and somebody had found a

645
00:16:00,111 --> 00:16:05,111
picture of him in a right wing rally in
1936 or 37 of which there were many in

646
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:05,991
Paris.

647
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:08,060
And he too came to grips with his past.

648
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,860
So this all started,

649
00:16:09,861 --> 00:16:12,980
the history of history
started in the 1970s.

650
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,150
Now I'm,

651
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,050
the second event,

652
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,250
uh,

653
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,000
was a book published by my
good friend Robert Paxton,

654
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,460
who's was about 10 years older than me,

655
00:16:22,461 --> 00:16:23,510
probably more than that.

656
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:29,110
And he wrote a book called
Vichy France published in 1972

657
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,030
and Vichy France was,

658
00:16:32,031 --> 00:16:36,890
could not use French archives
because they weren't available.

659
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,320
There's a 50 year rule
and French archives,

660
00:16:39,321 --> 00:16:40,270
but there is also a site,

661
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,900
we're talking about the mutinies that,

662
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:42,111
you know,

663
00:16:42,111 --> 00:16:43,280
the mutinies weren't available.

664
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:48,281
Well after 50 years had passed I after
after the mutinies in World War One,

665
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,131
he,

666
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:51,380
so he used captured German documents,

667
00:16:51,381 --> 00:16:54,560
not French documents because
they weren't available to them.

668
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:00,100
And what he did in this book was to
show what Vishi and pay Taz national

669
00:17:02,451 --> 00:17:06,740
revolution fuck they
were doing and why many,

670
00:17:06,741 --> 00:17:08,510
many people collaborated.

671
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,111
Uh,

672
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:09,481
there's a,

673
00:17:09,481 --> 00:17:11,320
a more recent book by
a guy called Phillip,

674
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:15,380
a big Aha that I use in the seminar in
Vichy that I do from time to time junior

675
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:16,214
seminar.

676
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:16,790
Uh,

677
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:21,170
which explores more deeply using
these archives that are now available.

678
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,940
The whole question of a collaboration.

679
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:28,300
But the point that Paxton made is that
he demolished the shield argument,

680
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,480
the argument that that pay town and the
national revolution had saved the French

681
00:17:36,111 --> 00:17:38,630
stake and that they were a shield.

682
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:43,631
If it wasn't for Vishi worst things would
have happened when Merissa Popol pap o

683
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:49,961
m I went on trial over 80 years of age
one on trial for having signed away the

684
00:17:50,311 --> 00:17:54,390
lives of many Jews and ball Dole
where he worked in the prefecture.

685
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,460
He said this made the same argument.

686
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:56,731
He said,

687
00:17:56,731 --> 00:17:58,050
I was a good bureaucrat.

688
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,970
My superiors liked me,

689
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,320
and if it hadn't been for me,

690
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:05,340
more Jews would have been been a shipped
away to draw SSI or more directly to

691
00:18:05,341 --> 00:18:06,180
the camps.

692
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,950
And he was condemned.

693
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,620
And he died a couple of years ago.

694
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,820
He was under house arrest.

695
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,380
The most amazing part of
the whole trial was when he,

696
00:18:14,381 --> 00:18:16,560
we managed to escape actually at age 80.

697
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:19,350
People drove him to the Swiss border
and they found him in a fancy Swiss

698
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:21,240
restaurant and brought him back.

699
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,680
But Paul had gone onto a very
distinguished career as a bureaucrat,

700
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,191
uh,

701
00:18:26,191 --> 00:18:26,720
in,

702
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:26,850
uh,

703
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,700
the fourth and fifth republics.

704
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,150
Uh,

705
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,460
it had as did a lot of other subtle,

706
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,820
a lot of other bastards
such as a honeyboo buscape,

707
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:36,421
uh,

708
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:36,901
who,

709
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:37,300
uh,

710
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,700
was a prefect of police.

711
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:39,870
Um,

712
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,060
but the argument was the shield argument,

713
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:42,900
if it wasn't for us,

714
00:18:42,901 --> 00:18:44,340
things would have been worse.

715
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:45,780
But as Paxton wrote,

716
00:18:45,781 --> 00:18:46,141
very,

717
00:18:46,141 --> 00:18:51,141
very memorably that that [inaudible]
might have provided continuity for the

718
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:53,490
French state,

719
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,580
but not for the French
nation and the French nation.

720
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,440
What was in his,

721
00:18:58,441 --> 00:18:58,860
I hope,

722
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,850
and I'm proud to say,

723
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:00,510
uh,

724
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,640
based on liberty fraternity equality,

725
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,700
and they take those off
the coins and it becomes,

726
00:19:05,701 --> 00:19:06,031
you know,

727
00:19:06,031 --> 00:19:06,660
uh,

728
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,310
uh,

729
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:07,520
uh,

730
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,353
[inaudible],

731
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:08,950
uh,

732
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:09,140
cove,

733
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,430
I,

734
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:09,780
uh,

735
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,200
uh,

736
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:10,651
family,

737
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:11,191
family,

738
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:11,700
uh,

739
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,150
uh,

740
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:12,361
you know,

741
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:13,290
country work.

742
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:13,891
Uh,

743
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:15,540
you can used to be when I was there,

744
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:15,871
you know,

745
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:18,330
and as a kid you could see these
still these little coins from,

746
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:20,850
from Vichy that they transformed into,

747
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:21,684
um,

748
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,000
into song team and Paxton's book packs.

749
00:19:25,001 --> 00:19:26,850
And once I saw him when I was in Brussels,

750
00:19:26,851 --> 00:19:28,440
I saw him on the TV show,

751
00:19:28,441 --> 00:19:29,274
my wife and I did.

752
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,470
And he knows where there's
typical French shows,

753
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:32,410
shows where they'll have,

754
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,440
it'd be about world war
one or World War Two.

755
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:35,130
And they'll have,

756
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:35,520
have,

757
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:35,790
uh,

758
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,050
somebody who remembered the war,

759
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,580
somebody who was in the war,

760
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,090
uh,

761
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,770
somebody who didn't even
know what was going on,

762
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:41,221
you know,

763
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:41,941
and all this stuff.

764
00:19:41,941 --> 00:19:44,700
And they interview them and some guy
got up this or right wing guy and there

765
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:45,800
were protests against packs,

766
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:46,580
is pro,

767
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,190
uh,

768
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,570
presence by skinheads.

769
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,740
And they got up and said,

770
00:19:49,741 --> 00:19:50,230
you know,

771
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,150
Mrs Paxton,

772
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:52,530
what could you possibly
know about the war?

773
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,360
You were only 12 years old during the war,

774
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,520
but Paxton became,

775
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,040
this was an important part
of the history of history.

776
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,140
And when he was introduced
at this all been,

777
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,100
uh,

778
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,160
he was introduced by a guy
called a historian called,

779
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:05,670
um,

780
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,503
Isaiah Ma.

781
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,470
And he said,

782
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:08,401
when he introduced me,

783
00:20:08,401 --> 00:20:08,611
he said,

784
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:09,080
Mr,

785
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,390
don't sign certain sauce,

786
00:20:10,391 --> 00:20:12,100
visit to the costume telephones.

787
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:12,790
You know,

788
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:16,170
in a certain sense you Paxton
are the conscience of France.

789
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,840
So these two events are,

790
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:19,651
are,

791
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:23,700
are important in the emergence
of what historian Adi was.

792
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:27,060
So Russell calls the Vichy syndrome.

793
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,150
And then if Vichy was
conveniently forgotten,

794
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,650
uh,

795
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,460
because of gall ism or because of not
wanting to remember the bad things that

796
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:36,294
happen,

797
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,230
uh,

798
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,430
the collaborators,

799
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,100
the eager Antisemites,

800
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,513
uh,

801
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,840
The v now have a sense
since the early 1970s,

802
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:50,841
people are obsessed with Vichy and there's
all sorts of good work been done on,

803
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,240
on Vichy,

804
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:52,661
uh,

805
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:55,240
in the whole period of
resistance and collaboration.

806
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:55,960
Paxton,

807
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,950
once he estimated in that book that
2% of the French population resistant,

808
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:00,641
uh,

809
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:04,270
my friend John Suites who did a book
called choices and Vichy France,

810
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,940
great title and which he looked at
Claremore fair home because that was what

811
00:21:08,941 --> 00:21:09,061
the,

812
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:09,491
the movie,

813
00:21:09,491 --> 00:21:11,410
the sorrow and the pity would focused on,

814
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,850
he estimates that it,

815
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:14,410
depending on how you define resistance,

816
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:16,990
people that refuse to get off the
sidewalk when a German officer,

817
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,100
a past or,

818
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:18,971
or people that you know,

819
00:21:18,971 --> 00:21:20,830
whistled it in the documentaries,

820
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,640
uh,

821
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,180
that the German newsreels
before the movie in the theater,

822
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,510
that there's something like
16 or 18% of the population,

823
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,230
uh,

824
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,063
uh,

825
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:30,700
uh,

826
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,533
resistant.

827
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,231
Uh,

828
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:34,450
it's a more charitable
definition of resistance,

829
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,020
but the fact is that I won't talk
more too much more about this,

830
00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:39,880
but the collaboration was widespread.

831
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,710
It was not simply an elite.

832
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,240
The elites were more apt to collaborate
earlier in the war later in the war.

833
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,340
The kinds of people who join the militia,

834
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,091
uh,

835
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:52,360
which formed in January,

836
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:52,540
1943,

837
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,550
which was the French
equivalent of the Gestapo,

838
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,600
uh,

839
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,200
uh,

840
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,760
tended to be sort of down and out.

841
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,200
There were the kinds of
people who in France,

842
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,750
in Germany joined the SS,

843
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,593
many of them,

844
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,140
you know,

845
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,960
in the 1920 sod as a
form of social mobility,

846
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:08,380
there's a really good film called lock
Luciana that I haven't seen in years

847
00:22:08,381 --> 00:22:09,214
about somebody who,

848
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,230
who between his ears
there wasn't very much.

849
00:22:11,231 --> 00:22:13,540
And the resistance doesn't want
him because he's just kind of a,

850
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,460
you know,

851
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,100
an idiot.

852
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,150
It doesn't believe in anything.

853
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:16,871
Uh,

854
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:18,550
but the militias very happy to have them.

855
00:22:18,551 --> 00:22:20,800
And it's about what happens to him in,

856
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,490
uh,

857
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,850
in the southwest of France
during the postpone trial,

858
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,980
which was maybe about eight years ago,

859
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:27,850
something like that.

860
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,610
Uh,

861
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:32,980
there was one time they interviewed a
German officer who is still alive and they

862
00:22:32,981 --> 00:22:33,341
said,

863
00:22:33,341 --> 00:22:34,091
well look,

864
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:34,580
uh,

865
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:34,770
you know,

866
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,710
what are your memories of,

867
00:22:35,711 --> 00:22:36,360
of a pop?

868
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,210
Oh and the militia,

869
00:22:37,211 --> 00:22:37,481
he said,

870
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,314
well we got,

871
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:38,901
we got a,

872
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:39,460
a guy,

873
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:39,701
you know,

874
00:22:39,701 --> 00:22:40,480
a guy,

875
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,760
we arrested a French guy
and we rather liked him.

876
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,200
We wouldn't turn him over to
the militia cause I mean these,

877
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,150
cause they would torture him.

878
00:22:46,151 --> 00:22:46,984
So hideously,

879
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,321
of course,

880
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:50,170
the Germans were capable of
and did all over the place.

881
00:22:50,171 --> 00:22:51,370
Torture people hideously,

882
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,570
no doubt about that,

883
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,160
but the militia were genuinely,

884
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,181
genuinely bad,

885
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:55,451
bad,

886
00:22:55,451 --> 00:22:56,284
bad guys.

887
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:56,831
Uh,

888
00:22:56,831 --> 00:22:57,670
and they,

889
00:22:57,671 --> 00:22:58,504
um,

890
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,530
uh,

891
00:22:59,531 --> 00:22:59,981
they,

892
00:22:59,981 --> 00:23:00,161
I mean,

893
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:02,320
you saw this in luck
home Luciana little bit.

894
00:23:02,321 --> 00:23:02,651
I mean that,

895
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:06,090
that restaurant scene is so
crucial in lacome Luciana.

896
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:06,640
That's,

897
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,170
that is really the essence of,

898
00:23:08,171 --> 00:23:08,620
of,

899
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,480
of that film is in Luke home.

900
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,030
Luciana is the restaurant
scene when they're,

901
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,170
when they're in there.

902
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:14,891
So,

903
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:15,580
um,

904
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:15,881
you know,

905
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:18,250
collaborators were
everywhere and you know,

906
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:19,330
at the end of the war,

907
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,260
um,

908
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,830
probably about 25,000
people were executed.

909
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,490
Uh,

910
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:28,330
after very short trials are simply
gunned down near where we live.

911
00:23:28,331 --> 00:23:30,160
In l dash a there was a priest,

912
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,120
um,

913
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,421
in a,

914
00:23:31,421 --> 00:23:33,280
in a village not too far away from us.

915
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,091
And He,

916
00:23:34,091 --> 00:23:34,924
um,

917
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:35,501
he had,

918
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:37,690
he had Dave [inaudible]
who was a real fascist,

919
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,231
uh,

920
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:38,801
to lunch.

921
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:40,000
And after the war,

922
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:40,840
uh,

923
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,240
they put them up against his
own church and gunned him down.

924
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:43,970
Uh,

925
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:44,111
have,

926
00:23:44,111 --> 00:23:47,300
I have an acquaintance a long
time ago with one of their,

927
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,350
um,

928
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,430
worked in the archives.

929
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:51,170
And the most where I
spent a lot of time and,

930
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:52,191
and he,

931
00:23:52,191 --> 00:23:52,311
uh,

932
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:52,640
was a,

933
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,930
a young man then,

934
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:55,850
and it was a refugee from an Ohioan.

935
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,170
And after the war,

936
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,750
everybody was celebrating where
he lived in a place called sadly,

937
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:00,600
or not alone,

938
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,130
the decor,

939
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,020
no blog,

940
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,711
which is near,

941
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:04,110
um,

942
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,250
uh,

943
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,020
limos and they're all partying.

944
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:07,310
And this little village,

945
00:24:07,311 --> 00:24:08,720
which is a little town really,

946
00:24:08,721 --> 00:24:11,180
that's the 12 kilometers
away from the emotion.

947
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:11,631
Somebody said,

948
00:24:11,631 --> 00:24:13,850
where's the gendarme was
sold people down the river.

949
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,631
And someone said,

950
00:24:14,631 --> 00:24:15,950
he's got an aunt in limos.

951
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,740
So they left all the cast
of wine that were left.

952
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,600
They marched into the most,

953
00:24:20,601 --> 00:24:21,560
went to the aunt's house,

954
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,300
get the guy hauled him out,

955
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,480
put him at the beginning of this,

956
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,020
this procession,

957
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,200
joyous but also deadly serious procession,

958
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,200
serving enraged Sharevari,

959
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:32,800
uh,

960
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,470
uh,

961
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,303
uh,

962
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,233
chair Avari.

963
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,200
Uh,

964
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,070
and they got him back to
where he'd done great damage.

965
00:24:39,071 --> 00:24:42,020
She put him against the wall and
then he went back to partying.

966
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,130
Uh,

967
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:43,820
so lots of,

968
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,530
there were lots of settling of scores.

969
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:45,711
I mean,

970
00:24:45,711 --> 00:24:48,350
sometimes not everybody who had
their scores settled deserved it.

971
00:24:48,351 --> 00:24:52,460
There were cases of people who were
misidentified or simply there were

972
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,390
rivalries,

973
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:54,200
but you know,

974
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,520
lots of people got theirs.

975
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,920
As for marshal Petain
what happened in p town?

976
00:24:57,921 --> 00:24:58,400
Of course you can,

977
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,450
he's put on trial.

978
00:24:59,630 --> 00:24:59,871
He,

979
00:24:59,871 --> 00:25:00,111
you know,

980
00:25:00,111 --> 00:25:01,040
he gave the original,

981
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:01,610
uh,

982
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,241
he was an old,

983
00:25:02,241 --> 00:25:02,871
old man.

984
00:25:02,871 --> 00:25:03,141
They said,

985
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:04,160
you can't execute an old,

986
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:04,940
old man.

987
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,350
He [inaudible] he wasn't at all.

988
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,100
Uh,

989
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,680
but you can't execute an old man
who was the hero Verdun done.

990
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:10,520
Can you,

991
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:10,970
uh,

992
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:11,571
so they,

993
00:25:11,571 --> 00:25:11,720
uh,

994
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,231
put them on.

995
00:25:12,231 --> 00:25:12,351
I,

996
00:25:12,351 --> 00:25:12,621
they,

997
00:25:12,621 --> 00:25:13,280
um,

998
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,113
uh,

999
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:14,730
put,

1000
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:15,280
um,

1001
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,580
can host confinement on an island and
there were still people trying to get to

1002
00:25:19,581 --> 00:25:20,091
the island,

1003
00:25:20,091 --> 00:25:23,420
which is off the coast of Brittany
and bring back his bones to veer done.

1004
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:25,850
That happened only about
10 or 12 years ago.

1005
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,050
And so France,

1006
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,860
uh,

1007
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,190
you know,

1008
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:32,520
it's took a lot longer than the kind
of gunning people down and the tribe,

1009
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,090
the trials that went on after the war,

1010
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:35,361
uh,

1011
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:40,361
for France to come to grips
with is past now resistance.

1012
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,340
I just do something wrong.

1013
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:43,770
What happened to,

1014
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:44,140
Oh,

1015
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:44,973
this is all right.

1016
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,003
All right.

1017
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,773
All right.

1018
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,193
Um,

1019
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,320
is that too loud?

1020
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,010
Sorry.

1021
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:52,310
Yeah.

1022
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:52,730
So,

1023
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,330
okay.

1024
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,080
Um,

1025
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,913
resistance.

1026
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,270
What do we know about resistance?

1027
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,141
First of all,

1028
00:25:57,141 --> 00:25:57,500
uh,

1029
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,750
obviously it was easier
to resist in the south,

1030
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,630
uh,

1031
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:03,080
than the north because of the topography.

1032
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,490
One of the reasons why the,

1033
00:26:04,491 --> 00:26:09,491
the Germans occupied so-called free
France in November of 1942 a was the fact

1034
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:12,470
that resistance that already started,

1035
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:12,981
uh,

1036
00:26:12,981 --> 00:26:14,870
the first active case of resistance,

1037
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:15,231
uh,

1038
00:26:15,231 --> 00:26:15,471
with,

1039
00:26:15,471 --> 00:26:20,471
with important consequences in Paris was
at the metro stop called Barb as well.

1040
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:21,314
Schwab,

1041
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:21,600
uh,

1042
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,420
which is not one of those
places where the police,

1043
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:25,230
especially as the Sarcozi was elected,

1044
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,990
I have these la flew where they,

1045
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:27,470
you know,

1046
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,680
anyone of color as immediately
asked for their id and you know,

1047
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,110
and,

1048
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:34,700
and made it to stand there and
be humiliated by the police.

1049
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:35,301
Uh,

1050
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:35,751
but anyway,

1051
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:36,950
back then somebody,

1052
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:38,720
a gun down a German officer,

1053
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,610
um,

1054
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:39,810
and,

1055
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:40,730
and gradually,

1056
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:41,380
uh,

1057
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,170
uh,

1058
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,860
gradually acts of resistance.

1059
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,370
Uh,

1060
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,270
I started,

1061
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:45,690
uh,

1062
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,010
I,

1063
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,040
to repeat what I said before,

1064
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,110
the word Maki comes from a brush,

1065
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:52,440
a very sick brush that's
in Corsica and in the,

1066
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:53,310
what they call them fringe,

1067
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:53,651
the guy.

1068
00:26:53,651 --> 00:26:56,520
He goes also in the sort
of rocky part of the south.

1069
00:26:56,521 --> 00:26:57,960
We have it wrong where we live too,

1070
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,190
but it was just a sort of a metaphor for
places that you could hide because you

1071
00:27:02,191 --> 00:27:03,360
had to be out there hiding.

1072
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:04,051
Uh,

1073
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:05,610
and by 1944,

1074
00:27:05,611 --> 00:27:09,240
by certainly the spring of 1944 and
in many places earlier than that,

1075
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,550
the mucky ruled at least at night,

1076
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,811
during the day,

1077
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:17,060
they didn't only twice in France
do they take on German foolish.

1078
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,360
They tried to take on German,

1079
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,980
a militarized units,

1080
00:27:19,981 --> 00:27:20,970
big units,

1081
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:22,230
one near Claremont for hall,

1082
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,850
and the other is [inaudible],

1083
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,990
which is near Grenoble.

1084
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:25,830
Uh,

1085
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,250
uh,

1086
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:26,440
you know,

1087
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,720
we're going over near the Alps.

1088
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,100
And of course they were just wasted.

1089
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,110
They were just destroyed
a in a village near Aasa,

1090
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:32,640
uh,

1091
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,740
somebody denounced a people who were,

1092
00:27:34,741 --> 00:27:35,430
uh,

1093
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:35,941
uh,

1094
00:27:35,941 --> 00:27:38,070
up in the hills up in
this event mountains.

1095
00:27:38,071 --> 00:27:38,671
And one day,

1096
00:27:38,671 --> 00:27:39,031
you know,

1097
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:41,550
the motorized units come
and the parachutes common,

1098
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,061
you know,

1099
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:43,260
they're toast as the end of it.

1100
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:46,170
And there were a bunch of slaughters
a down round where we live.

1101
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,210
People don't like to
talk about what happened.

1102
00:27:48,211 --> 00:27:51,000
I wanted to interview somebody
who was a resistor in our village.

1103
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:51,930
Um,

1104
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,100
even though our village wasn't,

1105
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,320
isn't where there were a
lot of resistance going on.

1106
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,190
Um,

1107
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:56,491
and I,

1108
00:27:56,491 --> 00:27:56,761
you know,

1109
00:27:56,761 --> 00:27:59,700
I wanted to talk to him cause I was
writing a book about our village called,

1110
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,420
um,

1111
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:00,870
uh,

1112
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,591
I don't remember what it's called,

1113
00:28:01,591 --> 00:28:01,880
but,

1114
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,460
uh,

1115
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:02,780
uh,

1116
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,770
meanwhile the Pierre,

1117
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:04,590
um,

1118
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:04,981
and,

1119
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:05,490
uh,

1120
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:05,731
he,

1121
00:28:05,731 --> 00:28:05,971
you know,

1122
00:28:05,971 --> 00:28:08,700
he agreed to come over and talk about
it and then he simply never showed up.

1123
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,800
People didn't like to talk
about things like that.

1124
00:28:10,801 --> 00:28:12,690
He never did want to discuss it.

1125
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:13,290
But,

1126
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:13,581
uh,

1127
00:28:13,581 --> 00:28:16,830
I would say more resistance was
in the south than in the north,

1128
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:18,910
though it's forgotten
often that there were,

1129
00:28:18,911 --> 00:28:22,080
it was a lot of resistance in Paris that
there was Jewish resistance in Paris

1130
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:22,690
too.

1131
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,180
I met a guy in Australia,

1132
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:24,541
uh,

1133
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:26,550
eight years ago who made a lot of money.

1134
00:28:26,551 --> 00:28:29,310
I'm making cakes and then went
back and got his phd in history.

1135
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,001
Uh,

1136
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:30,870
working with a friend of mine,

1137
00:28:30,871 --> 00:28:31,704
peer Mcphee,

1138
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:35,820
and he wrote a book on the
Jewish resistance published
by Oxford Jewish was just

1139
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:36,481
as in Paris,

1140
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:37,151
a guy called Jack.

1141
00:28:37,151 --> 00:28:37,950
God layer,

1142
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,460
uh,

1143
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,121
who is,

1144
00:28:39,121 --> 00:28:39,954
is happily,

1145
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,520
uh,

1146
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,400
still around.

1147
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,770
But the most famous cases
that you all know about,

1148
00:28:43,771 --> 00:28:44,510
of course,

1149
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:47,010
are these resisters who
are living off the land,

1150
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:47,880
uh,

1151
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,830
in Oceania or in,

1152
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:50,250
uh,

1153
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:50,430
uh,

1154
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,350
in the [inaudible] mountains or,

1155
00:28:52,351 --> 00:28:52,951
or a,

1156
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:53,161
I mean,

1157
00:28:53,161 --> 00:28:55,110
anywhere that you could
hide there would be,

1158
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,300
um,

1159
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:56,630
but they,

1160
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,140
they are often in French cities.

1161
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,900
You can see plaque saying
resistors met here,

1162
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:01,351
you know,

1163
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:02,460
to organize resistance.

1164
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:02,671
I mean,

1165
00:29:02,671 --> 00:29:03,504
that's what they did.

1166
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,470
And they took big,

1167
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,460
big chances,

1168
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:06,150
uh,

1169
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:06,891
because when they've,

1170
00:29:06,891 --> 00:29:07,351
for example,

1171
00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:08,580
blew up railroad tracks,

1172
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:08,881
that's what,

1173
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:09,900
there were so many communists,

1174
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:10,734
resistors,

1175
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,011
uh,

1176
00:29:11,011 --> 00:29:11,291
and,

1177
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:11,881
and the comic,

1178
00:29:11,881 --> 00:29:13,500
the Communist Party had a big,

1179
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,550
hold on,

1180
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:15,410
on the shammy.

1181
00:29:15,411 --> 00:29:15,640
No,

1182
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,800
we're railroad workers.

1183
00:29:16,801 --> 00:29:17,634
And so a lot of the,

1184
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,520
when you go to railroad stations
won't lead anywhere you go.

1185
00:29:20,521 --> 00:29:21,900
You see huge lists.

1186
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,730
Any railroad station you go to in France,

1187
00:29:23,731 --> 00:29:26,310
huge lists of people who
were killed during the war,

1188
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:29,640
either fighting the resistance who were
shot because they were involved with

1189
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:30,601
sabotage.

1190
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:31,560
It doesn't take much to,

1191
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,070
to blow up a track.

1192
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:33,640
Uh,

1193
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,240
and they did it all down
the Rhone valley constantly.

1194
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:40,020
There was a woman who was
a big time collaborator and
the northern part of the l

1195
00:29:40,021 --> 00:29:42,520
dash where the office Aviva came from to,

1196
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:43,540
with Ministry of Jua,

1197
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,040
Minister of Jewish affairs,

1198
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,030
totally unrepentant.

1199
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,080
Um,

1200
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,330
and that meant that he was
shipping Jews away to be killed.

1201
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:49,721
That's what,

1202
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:50,590
that's what he was doing.

1203
00:29:50,591 --> 00:29:54,610
And she was a collaborator and one day
she walked across the bridge and to go

1204
00:29:54,611 --> 00:29:57,520
shopping and other side of their
own and they blew her head away.

1205
00:29:57,521 --> 00:29:58,030
Uh,

1206
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:58,600
uh,

1207
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,860
but when you did that,

1208
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,090
you knew that they were good.

1209
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:02,800
They were going to pay you back so much.

1210
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,470
It's when the hydro at k when I
went to see where Heidrick ones,

1211
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,660
so it was assassinated near Prague.

1212
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,730
And when Heidrick was assassinated by,

1213
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:11,170
by a Czech resisters,

1214
00:30:11,171 --> 00:30:14,560
they took an entire village and killed
everybody in the village base called

1215
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:15,040
ladies.

1216
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,300
Everybody in the village,

1217
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,190
hundreds and hundreds of
people were massacred.

1218
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:21,190
They were capable of doing anything.

1219
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,400
But the point is that there were in all
these countries that were people who

1220
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:24,721
were very,

1221
00:30:24,721 --> 00:30:26,530
very happy to see that happen.

1222
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,240
And if you go to Budapest,

1223
00:30:28,241 --> 00:30:30,820
when you see the shoes of all
the people that were pushed,

1224
00:30:30,821 --> 00:30:35,080
shot or are just thrown into the and
swirling river of swirling water of the

1225
00:30:35,081 --> 00:30:35,800
Danube,

1226
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,071
you know,

1227
00:30:36,071 --> 00:30:38,020
as Hungarians pushing the Jews there.

1228
00:30:38,021 --> 00:30:40,090
And he was the Hungarian
shipping the Jews off to,

1229
00:30:40,091 --> 00:30:40,630
uh,

1230
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:40,901
uh,

1231
00:30:40,901 --> 00:30:41,734
to Os fits.

1232
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:42,430
Uh,

1233
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:45,610
so they were people in every place who
are happy to see these things happen.

1234
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,340
Uh,

1235
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:46,500
and,

1236
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,790
and the big lie of course in
Germany is people didn't know.

1237
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:49,151
Of course,

1238
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:49,900
people knew.

1239
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,733
They knew,

1240
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,151
and they knew.

1241
00:30:51,151 --> 00:30:52,090
And France to,

1242
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:52,990
uh,

1243
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:53,370
they,

1244
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,640
they knew absolutely.

1245
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,481
Uh,

1246
00:30:55,481 --> 00:30:58,270
and it fit into the xenophobia.

1247
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:03,280
It's fit into v She's vision of what
France would be a vision in which the

1248
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,840
Catholic Church would
have a much greater role.

1249
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,110
There were two people executed
for abortion during the time.

1250
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,600
A corporatist ethic where like
Mussolini's corporatism you delay,

1251
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:15,970
eliminate class struggle by having
everybody in vertical organizations.

1252
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:16,430
I,

1253
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:16,901
everybody's,

1254
00:31:16,901 --> 00:31:17,190
uh,

1255
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:17,440
you know,

1256
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,251
happy to be French,

1257
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,080
are having to be Italian
or happy to be German.

1258
00:31:20,081 --> 00:31:23,440
And you forget the fact that your employer
makes 10 times more than what you do.

1259
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,513
Um,

1260
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:28,000
the kind of embrace of peasants
TISM the resurgence of,

1261
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:28,571
of Joan,

1262
00:31:28,571 --> 00:31:29,280
of Arc,

1263
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:29,620
uh,

1264
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,640
because Joan of arc became identified
with pay tie as saving France and all of

1265
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,330
that.

1266
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:34,750
Uh,

1267
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,040
it's,

1268
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,700
it's all very familiar stuff,

1269
00:31:36,701 --> 00:31:39,820
but so they had a plan and
national revolution was
something they wanted to do.

1270
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,320
My good friend Eric Jennings,

1271
00:31:41,321 --> 00:31:45,850
who teaches a Toronto wrote a fantastic
book called Vichy in the tropics and he

1272
00:31:45,851 --> 00:31:46,930
looked at Guadalupe,

1273
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,291
uh,

1274
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:52,180
Indochina and Madagascar because in
those places Vishi you couldn't say,

1275
00:31:52,181 --> 00:31:52,331
well,

1276
00:31:52,331 --> 00:31:54,820
the Nazis made us do it because
there weren't any Nazis.

1277
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:55,241
They're there,

1278
00:31:55,241 --> 00:31:57,100
no German troops in those places.

1279
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,750
And yet they're in Vietnam.

1280
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:03,751
There were 27 Jews and they desperately
are trying to find these 27 Jews to send

1281
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:07,690
them to the death camp so far
away or to kill them themselves.

1282
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:08,710
So,

1283
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,280
uh,

1284
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,920
it was the shield argument doesn't work.

1285
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:12,431
Uh,

1286
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,720
they collaborated a,

1287
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:14,351
and in the end,

1288
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:15,960
a lot of them got with
it what they want it.

1289
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,980
Now as far as the resistance,

1290
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,371
uh,

1291
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:21,700
we've always focused on males because
the idea is you've got all these Spanish

1292
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:22,990
refugees from the civil war,

1293
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:23,824
from Franco,

1294
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:27,460
and you've got all a working class people
and you've got peasants and they're

1295
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:27,880
all,

1296
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,870
all these males.

1297
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,890
And they were there,

1298
00:32:29,891 --> 00:32:31,640
but somebody had to darn their socks.

1299
00:32:31,641 --> 00:32:33,280
Somebody had to provide them with food,

1300
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,950
somebody had to carry messages and,

1301
00:32:35,951 --> 00:32:36,700
and uh,

1302
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,200
it's more than just one of these old,

1303
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:38,531
you know,

1304
00:32:38,531 --> 00:32:39,440
movie things over.

1305
00:32:39,441 --> 00:32:43,280
The very young attractive woman
is carrying a message and the,

1306
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:43,500
and the,

1307
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,060
and charming the guards so
they don't a Frisker uh,

1308
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,410
or stop at all.

1309
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,520
But that happened.

1310
00:32:49,521 --> 00:32:49,701
I mean,

1311
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:50,101
you carry it.

1312
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:52,730
You never had be so stupid
as to have a written message,

1313
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:56,630
but you're carrying verbal messages in
place that you could hide foods such as

1314
00:32:56,631 --> 00:32:58,800
where we lived or out near where we live.

1315
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,150
[inaudible]

1316
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,560
somebody has to take these people food.

1317
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,550
Uh,

1318
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:04,310
and also the other thing is the
Catholic Church of it sounds like,

1319
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:04,720
uh,

1320
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,650
I mean business about
the pope helping Jews.

1321
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,890
It's just sheer nonsense and nobody
should ever be tricked by that.

1322
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:10,730
Uh,

1323
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:11,121
but,

1324
00:33:11,121 --> 00:33:11,920
but I,

1325
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,300
the complicated role of,

1326
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,420
of the Catholic Church,

1327
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:14,751
uh,

1328
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:16,610
in France there was the archbishop of,

1329
00:33:16,611 --> 00:33:19,010
of Toulouse who was a very
courageous guy who said,

1330
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,060
you know,

1331
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,240
don't hurt anybody who,

1332
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,840
who it was encouraging really resistance
implicitly and the Archbishop of Alby,

1333
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,580
which is only an hour drive
if that from Toulouse,

1334
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:31,340
he was an outright collaborator
and in many places,

1335
00:33:31,341 --> 00:33:33,050
Catholic clergy,

1336
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:33,900
uh,

1337
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:38,000
who are impinging leaders in their village
along with the school teachers were

1338
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:38,331
very,

1339
00:33:38,331 --> 00:33:40,280
very important in uh,

1340
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:41,114
in helping,

1341
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,191
helping give a,

1342
00:33:42,191 --> 00:33:46,130
a moral kind of stamp
to acts of resistance.

1343
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,200
There's a good book on the
resistance by a guy called HR QED,

1344
00:33:49,201 --> 00:33:49,851
word Rod,

1345
00:33:49,851 --> 00:33:50,684
QED word.

1346
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:50,990
Uh,

1347
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:51,860
he's got two books,

1348
00:33:51,861 --> 00:33:54,560
one about some resistance
and in urban areas,

1349
00:33:54,561 --> 00:33:57,620
particularly Leona and won't PDA
and how people kind of got together.

1350
00:33:57,621 --> 00:33:59,150
You had to be careful
about who you talk to.

1351
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:00,410
You're waiting for a train.

1352
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:02,510
The train is late cause it's the war,

1353
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:02,961
you know,

1354
00:34:02,961 --> 00:34:04,580
you're kind of feeling each other out,

1355
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,200
but you better be damn careful.

1356
00:34:06,201 --> 00:34:07,820
You're not talking to some denounced sir.

1357
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:08,750
Uh,

1358
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:09,411
and that you're,

1359
00:34:09,411 --> 00:34:09,591
you know,

1360
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:11,510
you're toast if you talk
to the wrong person.

1361
00:34:11,511 --> 00:34:12,470
But it's about how you,

1362
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,960
how you can make resistance happen.

1363
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:15,411
It's about,

1364
00:34:15,411 --> 00:34:16,244
for example,

1365
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,150
printing out,

1366
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:17,690
uh,

1367
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:18,260
uh,

1368
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,320
just um,

1369
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:19,970
uh,

1370
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:20,750
fi,

1371
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,410
uh,

1372
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:21,950
little,

1373
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:22,950
little typescript,

1374
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:25,130
things that say do not come in here.

1375
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:26,930
The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra,

1376
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,050
when they play in,

1377
00:34:28,051 --> 00:34:28,884
in Berlin,

1378
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:30,140
I've ever play in Leon.

1379
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,080
And all you do is you get on a
bus with those things and the bus,

1380
00:34:33,081 --> 00:34:34,160
you're in the back seat in the bus,

1381
00:34:34,161 --> 00:34:34,860
turns the corner.

1382
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,750
He just let them go.

1383
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,010
The wind takes them.

1384
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,060
Uh,

1385
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,180
but his other book that's really good
is called in search of the Mckee,

1386
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,410
which is about,

1387
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:42,590
uh,

1388
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,150
precisely when I'm talking about,

1389
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,390
it's about the resistance
in the south and looking at,

1390
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,680
at people who,

1391
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,400
uh,

1392
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:49,651
who,

1393
00:34:49,651 --> 00:34:50,630
who resisted.

1394
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,860
He has an interesting story.

1395
00:34:51,861 --> 00:34:52,291
There's a,

1396
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:55,130
a couple of lot of villages
that were Protestant villages,

1397
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:55,671
uh,

1398
00:34:55,671 --> 00:34:58,160
that suffered greatly during
all the wars of religion.

1399
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,660
And a couple were no worthy.

1400
00:34:59,661 --> 00:34:59,871
And that,

1401
00:34:59,871 --> 00:35:00,371
that during the,

1402
00:35:00,371 --> 00:35:04,220
after the wars of religion that the
king had these huge mission crosses,

1403
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:07,850
huge crosses of conquest
put up over the village,

1404
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,670
which were essentially Protestant
and remain Protestant villages.

1405
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,470
Did those signs help identify the
Catholic Church that had been the enemy of

1406
00:35:15,471 --> 00:35:17,990
those Protestants in the old days with,

1407
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:18,890
with Vichy?

1408
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,090
Quite possibly,

1409
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:23,270
but it's what John Suites
called choices in Vichy,

1410
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:24,104
France.

1411
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,290
Things happen that made you take a choice.

1412
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:27,801
Now,

1413
00:35:27,801 --> 00:35:28,970
what were one of those things?

1414
00:35:28,971 --> 00:35:30,560
The most important with the sto,

1415
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:31,443
the STL,

1416
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,350
the Soviets do two of Iob got 12,

1417
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,213
which I wrote in the,

1418
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,151
in the notes,

1419
00:35:35,151 --> 00:35:35,751
the service,

1420
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:35,931
uh,

1421
00:35:35,931 --> 00:35:36,111
the,

1422
00:35:36,111 --> 00:35:36,930
the uh,

1423
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:38,460
service in quotes,

1424
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:39,150
uh,

1425
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,890
obligatory work service.

1426
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,590
And the deal was basically that if you,

1427
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:45,210
if you agreed to go along to,

1428
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:45,760
uh,

1429
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,050
you know,

1430
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,460
to work in a German factory,

1431
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,011
uh,

1432
00:35:48,011 --> 00:35:48,661
that well,

1433
00:35:48,661 --> 00:35:52,140
they would let some prisoners of war going
all if it doesn't work out like that.

1434
00:35:52,141 --> 00:35:53,100
These people were fools.

1435
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:55,140
Two people from our village
want one was dead drunk.

1436
00:35:55,141 --> 00:35:57,100
He thought somebody told
me he's going to a party.

1437
00:35:57,101 --> 00:35:59,940
So we got on a bus and the
next stop is the Rhineland.

1438
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:00,541
And of course,

1439
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:01,950
those people are wasted by,

1440
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:02,380
uh,

1441
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:02,610
uh,

1442
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,331
by the bombing.

1443
00:36:03,331 --> 00:36:03,481
I mean,

1444
00:36:03,481 --> 00:36:04,140
cause the,

1445
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,300
cause the allies are
the masters of the air,

1446
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:07,140
uh,

1447
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,610
for the last couple of years of the war.

1448
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:11,040
And they systematically
devastate those factories.

1449
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:13,190
And a lot of those people in the Sto,

1450
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:13,890
uh,

1451
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,450
that went left.

1452
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:15,961
But what,

1453
00:36:15,961 --> 00:36:16,530
what the,

1454
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:16,891
what the,

1455
00:36:16,891 --> 00:36:17,091
I mean,

1456
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,750
are killed but left the earth.

1457
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:23,930
But what the Sto did is it made people
take a choice because if you didn't show

1458
00:36:24,481 --> 00:36:26,490
up on the 9th of February,

1459
00:36:26,491 --> 00:36:27,450
you pick the date,

1460
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,230
uh,

1461
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,460
Nike 44,

1462
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,080
you didn't go.

1463
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:31,501
I,

1464
00:36:31,501 --> 00:36:32,880
if you're sitting in your village,

1465
00:36:32,881 --> 00:36:33,840
they're going to come and take.

1466
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,520
So at that point,

1467
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,870
choices and Vichy France,

1468
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:38,910
I'm going to go into the resistance.

1469
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,553
Big Choice.

1470
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,120
You go into the resistance,

1471
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:42,631
you know,

1472
00:36:42,631 --> 00:36:43,800
you live off the land.

1473
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:44,310
Uh,

1474
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,570
sometimes just a couple of people,

1475
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:48,390
sometimes lots of people
of international mix.

1476
00:36:48,391 --> 00:36:49,560
Lots of polls were there,

1477
00:36:49,561 --> 00:36:50,400
lots of Spaniards.

1478
00:36:50,401 --> 00:36:50,621
But the,

1479
00:36:50,621 --> 00:36:51,990
most of the people were,

1480
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,890
were French.

1481
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:56,580
And one of the interesting things is
that the resistance itself did not,

1482
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,080
unlike almost everything,

1483
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,263
uh,

1484
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:03,390
every put a big political van
in France since the revolution,

1485
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,680
a to 1981 did not follow traditional lines
between right and left that left wing

1486
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:13,800
regions to not have a
monopoly on the resistance.

1487
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,160
There was tons of resistance in Brittany.

1488
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:21,620
There was tons of resistance and Normandy
Eisenhower after the war said the

1489
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:21,870
French Resistance,

1490
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:22,051
uh,

1491
00:37:22,051 --> 00:37:24,240
was worth an entire
division or to division.

1492
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:25,740
I can't remember exactly what he said.

1493
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,371
And of course,

1494
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:27,390
they help prepare their way,

1495
00:37:27,391 --> 00:37:30,990
enormity for the invasion of June 6th,

1496
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:31,370
1944.

1497
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:31,500
Uh,

1498
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,790
so that old left right dichotomy
does not work in terms of regions.

1499
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:41,030
It does work in terms of what people
were more likely to resist working.

1500
00:37:41,161 --> 00:37:42,990
People were more likely to resist,

1501
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,010
uh,

1502
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,870
because their unions had been broken,

1503
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:46,500
uh,

1504
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:46,891
by,

1505
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:47,310
uh,

1506
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:47,450
uh,

1507
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,360
by Vishi,

1508
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:48,810
uh,

1509
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,570
because there were more apt to
have supported the Popular Front,

1510
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,060
no to the France of the apparent TIF,

1511
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:54,600
uh,

1512
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,960
was the cry of the right in 1960 in 1936,

1513
00:37:57,961 --> 00:38:01,230
the no to the France of drinking
before lunch and all of this,

1514
00:38:01,231 --> 00:38:02,280
no to the France of,

1515
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,740
of the Jew blossom better Hitler then,

1516
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:04,941
then,

1517
00:38:04,941 --> 00:38:05,774
then bloom,

1518
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,330
uh,

1519
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:07,470
over and over again.

1520
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,280
Um,

1521
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,980
so working people and peasants who
liked the ones who said a new sound,

1522
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,990
who's you're coming to van,

1523
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:13,900
uh,

1524
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,281
Eh,

1525
00:38:14,281 --> 00:38:16,560
that I mentioned before
are more apt to resist.

1526
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:17,220
Now,

1527
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:21,780
why does the Communist Party have such a
privileged role in the existence of the

1528
00:38:21,781 --> 00:38:22,614
resistance?

1529
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,580
After the war?

1530
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:27,000
They call themselves the
Party of 75,000 martyrs.

1531
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:27,511
Now,

1532
00:38:27,511 --> 00:38:29,100
that may be an exaggeration,

1533
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,430
but not by much because
whenever there was a shooting,

1534
00:38:32,431 --> 00:38:35,220
whenever there was a Nazi gun down,

1535
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,610
whenever there was a railroad track,

1536
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,900
a blown up,

1537
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:38,620
uh,

1538
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,520
carrying munitions,

1539
00:38:39,521 --> 00:38:40,241
carrying soldiers,

1540
00:38:40,241 --> 00:38:40,961
carrying whatever,

1541
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:42,160
whenever they couldn't get through,

1542
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:45,730
who are the ones who are first being
when they go to the mayor and says,

1543
00:38:45,731 --> 00:38:49,240
who do you want shot communists
would be the first to go always.

1544
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,060
And the forts around parish,

1545
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,940
Tony's other places that were communists
put up against the wall all the time.

1546
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,490
They were the most likely to resist,

1547
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:57,930
uh,

1548
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:59,290
along with other Gaullist,

1549
00:38:59,410 --> 00:38:59,610
you know,

1550
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:00,780
Joel Moo loud dude.

1551
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,820
The prefect of the Illawarra
who is hideously tortured,

1552
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:04,180
uh,

1553
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,100
without revealing any secrets was,

1554
00:39:06,101 --> 00:39:06,610
was,

1555
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:10,180
was one who was sent out to
try to unify the resistance.

1556
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,980
But why were the communists so effective?

1557
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:12,251
Well,

1558
00:39:12,251 --> 00:39:15,880
because the Communist Party or
Aki are organized into cells.

1559
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,870
We still get little little,

1560
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,370
uh,

1561
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,890
notices in our mailbox saying
that the communist party,

1562
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:22,660
the sell of Bala Zuke where we live,

1563
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:23,350
you know,

1564
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:27,250
all four people in the communist party
are going to meet together and to drink

1565
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,240
illegal wine,

1566
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,340
to drink a wine called
clamp tall or whatever.

1567
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,760
And I was once asked to describe the,

1568
00:39:31,761 --> 00:39:34,270
the fall of capitalism
and how it had to say,

1569
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:34,401
well,

1570
00:39:34,401 --> 00:39:35,680
it's really not falling yet,

1571
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:36,220
but,

1572
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,210
but the point is,

1573
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:38,150
is that that,

1574
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:38,720
that the,

1575
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,720
they were already organized and that
these networks were not destroyed by the

1576
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:44,794
war,

1577
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:45,131
uh,

1578
00:39:45,131 --> 00:39:47,050
were not destroyed by they existed.

1579
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,870
The comradeship you,

1580
00:39:48,871 --> 00:39:49,780
if you were a communist,

1581
00:39:49,781 --> 00:39:51,610
you'd been a communist since the 1930s.

1582
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,320
You trusted those people,

1583
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,390
you are apt to fall in with them.

1584
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,470
There were two people,

1585
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,700
one of whom is still alive.

1586
00:39:57,701 --> 00:40:00,550
We spent a lot of time in prison in Paris,

1587
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,660
a painter who's now,

1588
00:40:01,661 --> 00:40:02,620
he's 95.

1589
00:40:02,621 --> 00:40:04,630
He's a friend of mine and he and his wife,

1590
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:07,090
the first vacations that they took,

1591
00:40:07,091 --> 00:40:08,050
a double bike,

1592
00:40:08,051 --> 00:40:08,861
they drove,

1593
00:40:08,861 --> 00:40:11,500
they paddled all the way from
Paris down to our village,

1594
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,570
which they had subsequently
made their home.

1595
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:17,980
They joined the Communist Party
in 1933 and 1935 and they,

1596
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:19,000
he was a big resister,

1597
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:19,710
big time resist,

1598
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,381
who was lucky.

1599
00:40:20,381 --> 00:40:22,060
Damn lucky to escape with his life.

1600
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,160
He was scheduled to be
executed and he wasn't.

1601
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,120
He painted people in the prison
and I've seen his paintings.

1602
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:28,990
Uh,

1603
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,450
now the socialists were
an organized and that way.

1604
00:40:31,451 --> 00:40:32,440
And so sometimes after the war,

1605
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:32,861
the comedy,

1606
00:40:32,861 --> 00:40:33,071
he said,

1607
00:40:33,071 --> 00:40:33,520
Aha.

1608
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,480
The Socialists don't,

1609
00:40:34,481 --> 00:40:34,990
uh,

1610
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:35,291
you know,

1611
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:36,550
they weren't the big resistors.

1612
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:36,881
Well,

1613
00:40:36,881 --> 00:40:37,340
many did.

1614
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,021
Individually.

1615
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:40,420
Leon Blum was lucky not
to have an executed.

1616
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:40,750
Uh,

1617
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,690
he survived the war in prison.

1618
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,700
He was put on trial at a
place called her and you know,

1619
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:46,190
right in there,

1620
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:46,761
20 more fit.

1621
00:40:46,761 --> 00:40:47,350
Huh?

1622
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:48,550
He survives the war.

1623
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,060
Uh,

1624
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,980
but there was a Catholic resistance also.

1625
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:52,630
I have a very old friends,

1626
00:40:52,631 --> 00:40:53,051
I mean old,

1627
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:53,920
much older than me,

1628
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,521
who,

1629
00:40:54,521 --> 00:40:54,940
uh,

1630
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:55,150
you know,

1631
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:55,960
went from the,

1632
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,380
the captain of the left wing Catholic
resistance into the Communist Party,

1633
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,040
you know,

1634
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,240
in the Socialist Party.

1635
00:41:01,241 --> 00:41:05,070
They kind of normal trajectory of
those things among militants and the,

1636
00:41:05,071 --> 00:41:05,681
and they were,

1637
00:41:05,681 --> 00:41:05,920
you know,

1638
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,430
they were,

1639
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,600
they were resistors.

1640
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,350
Uh,

1641
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:11,020
also Protestants were at where are more,

1642
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:11,460
no,

1643
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:11,601
are,

1644
00:41:11,601 --> 00:41:11,790
are,

1645
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:15,610
are more known for having resistant
because of some very famous events.

1646
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,061
Uh,

1647
00:41:16,061 --> 00:41:17,980
but remember only 5% of
the French population,

1648
00:41:17,981 --> 00:41:18,641
there's Protestant,

1649
00:41:18,641 --> 00:41:20,410
there's a village called Lou shamble,

1650
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,740
Su [inaudible],

1651
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,290
which is right near all dash.

1652
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:28,620
And they had a cottage industry of making
fake ID for Jewish children from the

1653
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:34,290
online insanity and who were kept in
this small village and who were saved,

1654
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,590
who were saved because of these people.

1655
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,120
And whenever the Germans
would come through,

1656
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:38,911
which wasn't that off,

1657
00:41:38,911 --> 00:41:39,560
often,

1658
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,090
they would hide the children or they'd go,

1659
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:42,890
they'd go to the Germans
to go through and said,

1660
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:43,311
my God,

1661
00:41:43,311 --> 00:41:44,091
there are a lot of children.

1662
00:41:44,091 --> 00:41:44,181
Well,

1663
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:45,380
these are practicing Catholics,

1664
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:45,711
aren't they?

1665
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:45,861
Well,

1666
00:41:45,861 --> 00:41:46,191
they weren't.

1667
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:47,550
They were PR practicing.

1668
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,080
Uh,

1669
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,500
uh,

1670
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,333
Protestants.

1671
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:49,970
Uh,

1672
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:50,360
but,

1673
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:50,601
uh,

1674
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:50,851
it,

1675
00:41:50,851 --> 00:41:51,291
it's,

1676
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:51,471
uh,

1677
00:41:51,471 --> 00:41:53,720
so those are the more famous cases.

1678
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:54,590
Uh,

1679
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,330
but lots of people resisted.

1680
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,740
Lots of people resisted.

1681
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:58,490
Uh,

1682
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:01,820
but lots of people collaborated and
many other people were in different.

1683
00:42:01,821 --> 00:42:02,654
That's the way it is.

1684
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,500
I want to close with a story of orders
are gone because somebody who wrote this

1685
00:42:06,501 --> 00:42:07,281
book called,

1686
00:42:07,281 --> 00:42:07,730
um,

1687
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:08,720
Margaret village,

1688
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:09,800
both in French.

1689
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,311
I got,

1690
00:42:10,311 --> 00:42:11,480
she got him out and in,

1691
00:42:11,481 --> 00:42:13,340
in English with cal press,

1692
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:17,310
with somebody who took this course
with me long time ago and wasn't as her

1693
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,343
college,

1694
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:18,711
uh,

1695
00:42:18,711 --> 00:42:19,550
Sarah Farmer.

1696
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,010
And she wrote a book.

1697
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,040
There is a village nearly Moje where,

1698
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:25,340
uh,

1699
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,690
when the Germans were leaving,

1700
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:27,730
uh,

1701
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:28,920
they were leaving,

1702
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:29,840
getting the hell out,

1703
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:33,650
going north after this
massacre in to that,

1704
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:34,484
I alluded to.

1705
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:38,960
Suddenly they show up in the village
and they shoot all the men and they put

1706
00:42:38,961 --> 00:42:39,221
them in,

1707
00:42:39,221 --> 00:42:41,480
in the women and the children in
the church and they killed them.

1708
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,770
They blow the church up.

1709
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:44,570
One woman escaped through
the little window,

1710
00:42:44,571 --> 00:42:49,400
very thin lady escaping through the little
window behind and they destroyed the

1711
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:50,420
entire village.

1712
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,390
And so people who had taken the tram to
the market and the most came back and

1713
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:54,224
there was enough.

1714
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,000
Everybody was dead,

1715
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:57,463
dead,

1716
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,440
and they left this village
standing the way it all,

1717
00:43:00,441 --> 00:43:01,970
it's still there now.

1718
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:03,080
There's a center of memory.

1719
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,970
One of my friends is the director of it.

1720
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:06,530
Sarah Farmer wrote a book about it,

1721
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:07,881
but the book,

1722
00:43:07,881 --> 00:43:10,940
what is important about it is
that this was the site chosen,

1723
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:16,040
the site chosen to commemorate the war.

1724
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:16,581
Why?

1725
00:43:16,581 --> 00:43:17,690
Because it was virgin.

1726
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,580
No collaborater supposedly no resistors,

1727
00:43:20,581 --> 00:43:23,060
supposedly martyred village.

1728
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,433
But what it,

1729
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,330
it turned out more complicated than that.

1730
00:43:26,331 --> 00:43:27,170
It's a wonderful book.

1731
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:27,951
Margaret Villa,

1732
00:43:27,951 --> 00:43:28,784
Sarah Farmer.

1733
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,270
But what chose the complexity of it is,

1734
00:43:32,271 --> 00:43:36,410
what happened afterward is that the people
in this village who were gunned down,

1735
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,570
the women and children's were killed,

1736
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:41,930
were killed by some Germans,

1737
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:47,380
but lots of them were Alsatian who were
brought directly into the German army.

1738
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:54,770
And so they went on trial in 1953 and
there were riots in the mile and straws

1739
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,930
Buhler that they should
ever be put on trial.

1740
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,250
They called themselves the
multigrain in spite of ourselves.

1741
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:02,660
Uh,

1742
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:05,030
and there were riots in the
most that the penalties were,

1743
00:44:05,031 --> 00:44:05,271
were,

1744
00:44:05,271 --> 00:44:05,540
were,

1745
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,230
were so mild that,

1746
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:07,640
that,

1747
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:12,640
that some of them were let go if they
had not joined voluntarily and the others

1748
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:13,670
went to jail.

1749
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,151
But that's what's,

1750
00:44:15,151 --> 00:44:15,330
and,

1751
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:16,940
and the man who ordered the massacre,

1752
00:44:16,941 --> 00:44:17,810
a guy called Lammerding,

1753
00:44:17,811 --> 00:44:19,700
there were various attempts
to kidnap him from the,

1754
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,010
from Germany and bring
them back to France.

1755
00:44:22,011 --> 00:44:25,970
But he died a natural death
in the 1970s or 1980s.

1756
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:27,650
But this was the enormous,

1757
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:31,710
ironic complexity of the whole thing of,

1758
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:33,840
of getting into the
history of the history,

1759
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:38,841
of trying to understand what happened
during those years that some of the

1760
00:44:39,541 --> 00:44:44,541
murderers in this case where else
session and therefore French until,

1761
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,630
until Hitler invades in 1940.

1762
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:52,260
So collaboration and resistance,

1763
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,270
great subjects for study,

1764
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:55,500
but heartbreaking.

1765
00:44:55,501 --> 00:44:55,731
Just,

1766
00:44:55,731 --> 00:44:57,600
just absolutely tragic.

1767
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,040
Uh,

1768
00:44:59,130 --> 00:44:59,731
and the,

1769
00:44:59,731 --> 00:44:59,971
you know,

1770
00:44:59,971 --> 00:45:00,091
the,

1771
00:45:00,091 --> 00:45:00,461
the,

1772
00:45:00,461 --> 00:45:02,400
the Nazis would be happy to do all,

1773
00:45:02,401 --> 00:45:04,440
all a of stuff on their own.

1774
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:06,030
But the xenophobia,

1775
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:11,460
the antisemitism led to those cases of
the guys going up the stairs and Paris

1776
00:45:11,461 --> 00:45:14,910
and other cities and all the
pop on signing lives away,

1777
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:15,600
uh,

1778
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,800
were French.

1779
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,370
And so France as another country's,

1780
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:22,770
it's happening and Belgians who
are coming to the grips with,

1781
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,300
with their past.

1782
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:27,900
So it's been a sad pleasure
to talk about that.
