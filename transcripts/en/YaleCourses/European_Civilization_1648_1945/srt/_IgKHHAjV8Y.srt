1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,010
I'm John [inaudible] and
this is history two o two.

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,520
And so I'm here every
Monday and Wednesday,

3
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:10,980
10 30 to 1120.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,170
And the way this course is that,

5
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:14,910
that these are all really major themes.

6
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:16,890
And I'm going to go over this a little
bit and I'm going to talk about some of

7
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:17,724
the themes,

8
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:18,361
uh,

9
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:23,160
and I kind of lecture on things that I
think that compliment what you're doing.

10
00:00:23,161 --> 00:00:24,240
Let me give you an example.

11
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:25,380
Uh,

12
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,180
when I talk about imperialism,

13
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,350
the new imperialism,

14
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,910
why it is that Europe,

15
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:30,630
uh,

16
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,980
basically took over the entire
world between the 1880s and in 19,

17
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:35,490
uh,

18
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,690
14,

19
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,290
uh,

20
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:37,501
I,

21
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:38,940
if you can read the chapter,

22
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,230
I have a history of modern Europe,

23
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:41,220
which I had fun writing.

24
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,120
Um,

25
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,020
but I left her on the boy scouts and
I often say that I lecture in the boy

26
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:49,200
scouts because I was thrown out
of the boy scouts and a Portland,

27
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:53,400
Oregon when I was a kid because I didn't
manage to accumulate a single badge and

28
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:55,560
was totally useless after sports seasons.

29
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:56,071
Uh,

30
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:56,950
ended up,

31
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,020
but that's not why I do it.

32
00:00:58,021 --> 00:01:01,980
Because to understand the new
imperialism one has to at what,

33
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:03,810
why Europe took over.

34
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:07,110
Essentially all of Africa that
had places were totally uncharted,

35
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:07,830
uh,

36
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,740
suddenly became a highly
contested between British,

37
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,350
French and German and Italian,

38
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:13,920
uh,

39
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,260
uh,

40
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,150
conquerors.

41
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:15,840
Uh,

42
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,920
that one has to understand that the
culture of imperialism and the origins of

43
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:24,210
the boy scouts in Britain
has a lot to do with that.

44
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,990
Why generations of British youth and
their counterparts in Germany and,

45
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,630
and even Australia and New
Zealand and other places,

46
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:31,763
uh,

47
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,190
began to think that it was important
to me to look at a map and their school

48
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:35,850
house,

49
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,271
uh,

50
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:36,661
that,

51
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:38,850
that had the color red for Britain.

52
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,241
Uh,

53
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:41,540
increasingly taking over
the map of Europe and,

54
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:42,810
and lots of other places.

55
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:43,051
I mean,

56
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:43,231
of,

57
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:43,770
uh,

58
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,011
uh,

59
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:44,360
of,

60
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:44,700
uh,

61
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,220
Asia and Africa and lots
of other places as well.

62
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:47,730
Uh,

63
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,530
so instead of at the very
beginning of that lecture,

64
00:01:49,531 --> 00:01:49,771
I'll say,

65
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:49,981
look,

66
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:52,290
there are three things you really ought
to know about the new imperialism.

67
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,124
Why,

68
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,210
why they did this.

69
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:55,200
And then I talk about,

70
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:55,910
uh,

71
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,370
uh,

72
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,910
the boy scouts so that those
two things will fit together.

73
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,940
Or when I talk about World War
One and we'll have two lectures.

74
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:05,940
My friend and colleague Jay
Winter is doing one of them,

75
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:06,331
uh,

76
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:08,250
on the great war and modern memory.

77
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,090
Uh,

78
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:09,420
I,

79
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,310
instead of trying to do the entire war,

80
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:12,144
and there's a,

81
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,700
I think quite sporty
chapter on that in the book.

82
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,510
Uh,

83
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,170
uh,

84
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,920
I'll talk about about trench warfare
and you'll see a film called paths of

85
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,850
glorious in early a Kubrick
film about the mutinies in 19,

86
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,481
uh,

87
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:29,340
in 1917 and I'll talk about the
mutinies in 1917 when people just said,

88
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:30,174
enough is enough,

89
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:30,661
you know,

90
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:31,980
there's no sense dying for nothing.

91
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,230
We won't go over the top.

92
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:34,831
So,

93
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:35,890
which is to say that,

94
00:02:35,891 --> 00:02:39,390
that it's important to come to lecture
and it's important to come to sections.

95
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,890
I've cut back on the reading.

96
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:43,620
I used to use about four
more books than I use now,

97
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,780
but it's better to concentrate
on what you're doing.

98
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,291
Uh,

99
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,990
the books are a history of modern Europe,

100
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:49,441
uh,

101
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:51,210
which I basically the second edition,

102
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:52,620
which I wrote for people like you.

103
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:53,843
Um,

104
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,800
and then you'll read Persian letters,

105
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:56,490
not all of it.

106
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,660
That would be a rather lengthy,

107
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,830
lengthy day or so,

108
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,191
uh,

109
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:02,890
you read excerpts in person
letters and Montesquieu,

110
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:03,281
you know,

111
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:07,570
talks about in a way it talks about
relations between West and east.

112
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:12,370
And it's really a phenomenal moment
in the history of the enlightenment.

113
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,533
Um,

114
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,460
and you have a pause where you,

115
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:15,761
you're,

116
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:17,380
you're basically just reading me,

117
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,340
uh,

118
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:18,461
uh,

119
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:18,740
for better,

120
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,091
for worse,

121
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:19,900
but I hope for better,

122
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,200
uh,

123
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,180
until you get to Emile Zola as
great novel as you know me now.

124
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:26,160
Uh,

125
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,650
which is,

126
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,100
uh,

127
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,430
which is the classic that a lot of
it was the first sort of naturalist,

128
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,820
a naturalist novelist,

129
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,610
uh,

130
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,950
at least in France.

131
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,690
And when he wrote Jeremy,

132
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:38,320
now,

133
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:38,590
Jeremy,

134
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,020
now it means budding like
the budding of trees,

135
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,540
but he means the budding of,

136
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,440
of people being aware of themselves as,

137
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,670
as workers.

138
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:49,270
He went down to the mines in the
north of France and the Amazon.

139
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,870
And one of the heroes,

140
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,510
uh,

141
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,880
of of the book is a woman called Kathleen,

142
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,450
who is 15 years old,

143
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:57,850
but it's seen a lot of life
from being 15 years old.

144
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,073
And when Zola,

145
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,800
uh,

146
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,251
uh,

147
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:01,084
wrote,

148
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,570
uh,

149
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:01,801
Jimmy,

150
00:04:01,801 --> 00:04:04,930
now he went down into the
minds to look at 15 year old,

151
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:05,470
uh,

152
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:05,861
uh,

153
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:06,694
young women,

154
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:07,240
uh,

155
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,970
barely older than girls
are working in the mines,

156
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:10,460
uh,

157
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:10,630
uh,

158
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,680
12 hours a day.

159
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,730
So it's a book that just,

160
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:12,901
you know,

161
00:04:12,901 --> 00:04:16,180
it rizzone's with reality and
it's really kind of an amazing,

162
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,253
amazing,

163
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,443
amazing book.

164
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,540
And I think you'll like that.

165
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,433
I hope you will.

166
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:20,890
Um,

167
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,980
and then helmet Smith's,

168
00:04:21,981 --> 00:04:24,880
the butcher tale is about accusations of,

169
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,570
uh,

170
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,111
uh,

171
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:28,240
of ritual murder in a German town.

172
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:28,990
It's about,

173
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,611
about the,

174
00:04:29,611 --> 00:04:30,900
the second German hike,

175
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,450
uh,

176
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,320
and it's about,

177
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:32,860
uh,

178
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,420
antisemitism in a small place
with bigger consequences.

179
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:37,991
Uh,

180
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:39,040
George Orwell,

181
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:44,070
I went off to fight the good fight in
Spain during the Spanish civil war.

182
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:45,641
Uh,

183
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:50,641
where was sort of a dry run for a even
more horrible war and even more horrible,

184
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:51,810
uh,

185
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:52,643
a fascist.

186
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:53,500
Um,

187
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,650
and it's about his engagement
and disillusionment,

188
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:57,281
uh,

189
00:04:57,281 --> 00:04:57,990
in,

190
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,290
uh,

191
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,290
this the Spanish,

192
00:04:59,291 --> 00:04:59,950
uh,

193
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,161
uh,

194
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:05,161
Republican forces of the loyalist
forces and about the tensions and the

195
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:06,500
duplicity of,

196
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:06,791
of,

197
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,170
of Stalin's folks,

198
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:08,680
uh,

199
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:08,830
uh,

200
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,550
undercutting the trustees and
are cutting the anarchists in it.

201
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,370
It's one of those classics as a
classic for a very good reason.

202
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,233
It's really a,

203
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:16,640
a,

204
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,680
a marvelous reed.

205
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,611
And finally,

206
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:19,780
there's the ordinary men.

207
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,650
Uh,

208
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,900
I go to Poland a lot in
the last couple of years.

209
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:24,250
I've been there four or five times for,

210
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,710
for various reasons.

211
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,180
And I'd never been to Auschwitz.

212
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:28,781
And,

213
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:29,410
uh,

214
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,810
I went to Auschwitz a a year ago.

215
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:32,051
I don't know.

216
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:33,430
Some of you would probably had been there.

217
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,840
And as you're going through this,

218
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:36,940
the horror of it all,

219
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,140
and as you're seeing,

220
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,530
you're seeing empty suitcases
with people's names on them,

221
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:42,940
that people don't exist anymore,

222
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:45,430
and you're seeing baby
shoes and things like that.

223
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,320
You think who could have done this,

224
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,030
who could have gone out,

225
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:49,690
uh,

226
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,523
and simply,

227
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,260
uh,

228
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,630
in assembly line way killed
people or in fields around woods,

229
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,150
which is a,

230
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,530
was a large industrial towns,

231
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:58,580
still live in Poland,

232
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,760
simply gone out and blown
the brains out of mothers,

233
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:02,241
babies,

234
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:02,751
grandmothers.

235
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,140
And anyway,

236
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,790
they found who could have done it.

237
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:05,361
Well,

238
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:06,440
the answer that Chris Brown,

239
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:11,441
he has his ordinary men and he had
the brilliant idea of looking at,

240
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:12,890
uh,

241
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,210
uh,

242
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,690
a German unit,

243
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,000
essentially policemen from Homburg,

244
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:17,710
uh,

245
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,030
the town,

246
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,360
the port town of Hamburg,

247
00:06:19,361 --> 00:06:21,020
old important Hanseatic port.

248
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,370
And he follows them from the
lives of very ordinary people,

249
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,020
uh,

250
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,940
into the killing fields.

251
00:06:27,941 --> 00:06:30,050
It was nothing less than that of Poland,

252
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:30,570
you know,

253
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,770
and it's also short here,

254
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,421
middle as long,

255
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:33,650
but these other ones are short and,

256
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:33,951
and,

257
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:34,490
uh,

258
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,130
uh,

259
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:35,280
it,

260
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,931
it's also,

261
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:36,051
you know,

262
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:36,651
it's gripping.

263
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:37,011
It's,

264
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:37,231
it's,

265
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:37,881
it's quite,

266
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:38,420
uh,

267
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,253
quite amazing.

268
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,041
So,

269
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:40,490
uh,

270
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,420
those are the books,

271
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:42,440
I think the history of modern Europe.

272
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:43,610
I hope it's fun to read.

273
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,350
Uh,

274
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,710
I think you'll enjoy that.

275
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,780
And the lectures kind of,

276
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,860
you see the themes as
speak for themselves.

277
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,760
Um,

278
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,920
sections that everybody likes.

279
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,900
Wednesday night sessions.

280
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:57,710
Uh,

281
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,200
one of my colleagues has only
Wednesday night sections.

282
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:00,921
Uh,

283
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:04,370
and we've got increasingly to that
because sometimes you don't find a large

284
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:06,230
audience on even Friday morning,

285
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:07,250
10 30 slots.

286
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,150
We've abandoned that.

287
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,630
So tentatively we're going
to have two at seven,

288
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:12,470
two at eight,

289
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,770
and then a Thursday at 1:30
PM and Thursday at 2:30 PM.

290
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:21,441
And I don't know,

291
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,670
when are we starting sections?

292
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,151
It doesn't,

293
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,650
sometimes we don't do
it till the second week.

294
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:25,461
It depends on what date,

295
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:26,600
what day is this Wednesday.

296
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,733
Um,

297
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,610
so I dunno,

298
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,750
maybe we'll start on next week.

299
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:30,141
We can,

300
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:30,801
maybe we won't.

301
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:31,221
Who knows?

302
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:32,180
But they will happen.

303
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:32,601
And,

304
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:33,434
and uh,

305
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,010
uh,

306
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,160
there's also a short
sporty paper assignment.

307
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,720
And by short,

308
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:39,830
I don't mean two pages.

309
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,580
Uh,

310
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:40,940
but,

311
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,330
uh,

312
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,770
but something like seven pages,

313
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:45,020
eight pages on something
that you want to write about.

314
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,920
Now let me give you some examples
just off the top of my head.

315
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,720
If you have any interest in,

316
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:51,261
in painting,

317
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:51,891
for example,

318
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:53,830
it would be interesting to take a,

319
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,620
uh,

320
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,620
to take a look by say the impression to
impressionist painters like Pizarro and,

321
00:08:00,241 --> 00:08:00,591
and,

322
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:01,190
uh,

323
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:01,641
um,

324
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:02,474
and when and wow,

325
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:06,680
and to see how they viewed the
transformation of 19th century Paris,

326
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:08,480
the big boulevards and all of that.

327
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,250
Or you could take another novel.

328
00:08:10,251 --> 00:08:10,800
I mean,

329
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,121
Jeremy,

330
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:11,421
now,

331
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:13,530
one of the interesting things
about it is that it's a,

332
00:08:13,531 --> 00:08:14,810
it's a document of history.

333
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,231
You know,

334
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:16,070
it's a novel.

335
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,750
So these are invented people,

336
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,341
but,

337
00:08:18,341 --> 00:08:20,510
but it's a document of
history in some ways,

338
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,870
as is lots of the great
literature on World War One.

339
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:27,260
And there isn't any period in
modern history that has so much,

340
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,800
so much gripping literature
about it as the great war.

341
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,710
The British war poets
like seek recess soon.

342
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,790
And a lot of these people were,

343
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:34,941
you know,

344
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:36,200
were dead after they wrote,

345
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:36,730
uh,

346
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,060
uh,

347
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,170
as soon wasn't least immediately.

348
00:08:39,171 --> 00:08:40,760
I can't remember if he
dies in 1918 or not,

349
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:41,210
but,

350
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:41,840
um,

351
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,380
uh,

352
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:42,801
to take,

353
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:46,910
to take some of the poetry or the writing
of the war and write a paper about it

354
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,160
or if you're in a diplomatic
history or something like that.

355
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,580
I mean,

356
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:49,890
I don't know.

357
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,660
I wouldn't counsel paper of reevaluating
the origins of the Crimean war.

358
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,830
I that might you put you to sleep before,

359
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,071
you know,

360
00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:57,090
it puts your ta to sleep,

361
00:08:57,091 --> 00:08:57,630
but don't know.

362
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,620
You could imagine a good,

363
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,040
uh,

364
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,880
a good paper on that.

365
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:00,001
I mean,

366
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:00,990
you can do whatever you want.

367
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,890
Um,

368
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,810
one of the lectures and
when I do the enlightenment,

369
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,030
a burn from my good friend Bob Darnton,

370
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:06,750
uh,

371
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:06,961
you know,

372
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:10,080
I'll do a thing at the beginning about
why the enlightenment was important and

373
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:10,914
what it is,

374
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,380
the secularization,

375
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,770
rational inquiry and all of that
stuff that you may already know.

376
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,281
Maybe not,

377
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:17,580
but it's the,

378
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,413
it's in the book.

379
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,070
But then what I do is
I look at some of the,

380
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,290
the third string,

381
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,130
kind of where the third division in the
European football sense of enlightenment

382
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,960
hacks,

383
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,420
uh,

384
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:32,420
and what they wrote about royalty in
about aristocrats and the way they kind of

385
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:37,380
undermine those traditional hierarchies
that would be swept away to a large

386
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:39,600
extent by the French revolution.

387
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,710
Or you can take somebody out of the French
revolution such as the steely sounds

388
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:48,180
used and who ran off with his mother's
silver at age 16 or something and one on

389
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:49,830
the grand tour of France.

390
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,251
And,

391
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:53,430
and talk about him and the Committee of
public safety that signed away the lives

392
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:54,264
of lots of people,

393
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,040
but may have also saved the revolution.

394
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,400
You can do whatever you want it.

395
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,170
Well,

396
00:09:59,170 --> 00:09:59,430
you know,

397
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,200
it should have something
to do with the course.

398
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,300
And in the time period
where we're talking about,

399
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:03,501
I mean,

400
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:03,760
I think I,

401
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:03,970
you know,

402
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,630
and on the red sox or something,

403
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:07,000
but,

404
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,450
uh,

405
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:07,980
uh,

406
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,650
you know,

407
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,470
work with your teaching participant in it.

408
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:10,671
You know,

409
00:10:10,671 --> 00:10:11,910
I'm an email animal.

410
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:15,090
I'm always available on email and I have
office hours as well that people don't

411
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:15,930
come to the much anymore.

412
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:19,530
I'm sitting there doing
nba.com because email is made,

413
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:20,970
office hours sort of oblivious,

414
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,260
I mean a a irrelevant,

415
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:22,801
not oblivious,

416
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:24,070
but uh,

417
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,770
people are oblivious to my office hours.

418
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,510
But anyway,

419
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,160
uh,

420
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:27,420
uh,

421
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:27,841
they are,

422
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:28,201
uh,

423
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:28,510
where,

424
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,550
when are they are Monday
is the one to two 30.

425
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,610
You used to be three,

426
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:33,720
but I sit there by myself,

427
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,460
one to two 30.

428
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:35,820
Uh,

429
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,140
in Branford College,

430
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,080
a k a k 13.

431
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,950
Um,

432
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,720
there are also two other movies when we
get to fascism when we get the odd off

433
00:10:45,721 --> 00:10:46,554
Hitler,

434
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,231
we and,

435
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:47,431
and,

436
00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:51,090
and he was only one of a
whole bunch of dictators.

437
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:53,690
There was hardly any
parliamentary regimes left in,

438
00:10:53,691 --> 00:10:53,941
in,

439
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:54,141
in,

440
00:10:54,141 --> 00:10:57,180
in continental Europe
by the time 1939 comes,

441
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,020
uh,

442
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:02,250
a woman called Leni Riefenstahl
who just died in 2002 at age 102,

443
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,390
uh,

444
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,230
she in,

445
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:07,350
when she was a young woman and did a
propaganda film for Hitler and Hitler.

446
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,300
Mussolini believed in high tech.

447
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:10,340
He's one of the first people to,

448
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,590
to use the radio.

449
00:11:11,591 --> 00:11:11,771
And we,

450
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,190
Franklin Roosevelt used the
fireside chat or the radio,

451
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,050
but Mussolini was already there,

452
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:16,560
you know,

453
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,340
uh,

454
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,100
piling fault.

455
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,260
So it upon false hood,

456
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:19,700
uh,

457
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,050
and,

458
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,980
and Italians who can barely afford
to eat a all had the radios.

459
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:24,020
And the same thing that happened in,

460
00:11:24,021 --> 00:11:25,140
in Germany as well.

461
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,370
And she did a book,

462
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,540
she did a movie called,

463
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,050
uh,

464
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,200
a documentary called triumph
of the will about Nuremberg.

465
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,660
And it is truly chilling is an amazing,

466
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,673
uh,

467
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,990
it looks like in on a political
convention or something.

468
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:37,530
Uh,

469
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:37,640
uh,

470
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,610
in some ways,

471
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,061
uh,

472
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:39,511
and it's,

473
00:11:39,511 --> 00:11:39,840
uh,

474
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,210
all of these movies you can
see in the privacy of your,

475
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,840
your,

476
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,070
uh,

477
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:47,640
luxurious suites and Branford or Pearson
College or wherever because they're

478
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:49,650
available now in ways I
don't even understand.

479
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:49,821
But,

480
00:11:49,821 --> 00:11:50,640
but on your,

481
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,271
on your Internet,

482
00:11:51,271 --> 00:11:52,740
we used to actually show them here.

483
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,540
Uh,

484
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,550
I used to use this movie,

485
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,740
a great movie called
the sorrow and the pity,

486
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,180
the show.

487
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,730
Glad I let PTA and it was
four hours long and the,

488
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:02,230
and people describe it as a two,

489
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:03,520
six pack movie.

490
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,201
I end,

491
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:07,240
the janitor is complaining because there's
so many rear bottles rattling around.

492
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:07,481
Of course,

493
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:09,130
this was before the drinking age was Lord,

494
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:09,780
of course,

495
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,350
a Lo of her was raised.

496
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:11,981
So of course,

497
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:12,390
uh,

498
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:12,590
uh,

499
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,580
I don't show that movie.

500
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:13,751
I,

501
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:14,650
I take that back.

502
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,341
I don't take that back,

503
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:15,731
but what the hell.

504
00:12:15,731 --> 00:12:16,330
But anyway,

505
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:16,600
uh,

506
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,230
I don't,

507
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:17,771
I don't,

508
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,120
I don't show that movie anymore,

509
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:19,490
but,

510
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:19,680
but,

511
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,450
but I do show a triumph of the will
and you can watch that at home.

512
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,230
Uh,

513
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,070
and that the other one is a of lollies
on phone because one of the last lectures

514
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:32,071
I talk about resistance and collaboration
in Europe and because I live in France

515
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,110
much of the time I talk about France,

516
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:35,981
uh,

517
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:36,520
and,

518
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,180
uh,

519
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,080
of Wiley's on fall.

520
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:38,560
Some of it.

521
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,490
Goodbye children.

522
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:39,940
Uh,

523
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,110
some of you have probably seen,

524
00:12:41,111 --> 00:12:44,170
it was made by Louis [inaudible]
who just died a couple of years ago.

525
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:44,621
Uh,

526
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:47,050
and it was about when he was college,

527
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:47,411
he was,

528
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:47,621
so,

529
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:49,630
he was equivalent of
seventh and eighth grade.

530
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,530
And there's a new boy shows up at school
during World War II in Fontainebleau,

531
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,600
which is just south of east of Paris.

532
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,040
And he's a boy who hadn't been
there before and he's a Jewish boy.

533
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,830
And it's about his
friendship with this boy.

534
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,650
And what happens at the end.

535
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,090
It's not a happy film,

536
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,481
but it's like,

537
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:07,901
it's a great,

538
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:08,734
great film.

539
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,873
Um,

540
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,863
what else?

541
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,270
But to say there's a midterm,

542
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,830
I don't like to waste the
lecture giving a midterm.

543
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,000
I would rather give a lecture,

544
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,380
but we have to have something,

545
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,430
uh,

546
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,290
to report to you.

547
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:20,830
Uh,

548
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:21,370
if you,

549
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,640
if you a tube.

550
00:13:22,641 --> 00:13:23,950
But if you don't do very well at all,

551
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,990
we don't count it as
much as if you do well.

552
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,980
Um,

553
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,390
I people ask these questions.

554
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,860
I know how much is it worth while,

555
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:30,131
I mean,

556
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:30,411
Geez,

557
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:31,390
if there's more to life than grades,

558
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:31,721
but it's,

559
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:32,170
uh,

560
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:32,610
uh,

561
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:32,910
it's,

562
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:37,910
it's something like 25% and the is 25%
and section participation is 10% whatever

563
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:39,214
we work out.

564
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:39,881
And then,

565
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:40,390
uh,

566
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,320
and then the final.

567
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,011
So,

568
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:42,760
um,

569
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,211
it's just,

570
00:13:43,211 --> 00:13:43,391
you know,

571
00:13:43,391 --> 00:13:45,550
it's an exercise in seeing how your,

572
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,180
uh,

573
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,013
how you're doing.

574
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,920
Um,

575
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,211
and it,

576
00:13:48,211 --> 00:13:48,400
you know,

577
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,051
it really is,

578
00:13:49,051 --> 00:13:49,211
is,

579
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:50,320
is no big deal,

580
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,370
but it will help you pull the themes of,

581
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:53,890
uh,

582
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:54,790
of the course,

583
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,420
uh,

584
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,170
together.

585
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,480
And it's no scary situation.

586
00:13:58,481 --> 00:13:58,661
I mean,

587
00:13:58,661 --> 00:14:02,930
we all live in the sort
of a minus B plus range,

588
00:14:02,931 --> 00:14:03,210
you know,

589
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:03,551
I'll tell you,

590
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,590
a couple of years ago
I ran into the student,

591
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,340
uh,

592
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,141
when I rented a student,

593
00:14:07,141 --> 00:14:07,410
something,

594
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:07,900
you know,

595
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,501
friendly guy.

596
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:09,221
And I see people say,

597
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:09,481
Hey,

598
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,121
well how are you?

599
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:10,241
How,

600
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:10,460
you know,

601
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,290
how are you?

602
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:11,720
And I ran it.

603
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,341
It's one person said,

604
00:14:12,341 --> 00:14:12,581
hi,

605
00:14:12,581 --> 00:14:13,330
how are you?

606
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,163
And she went,

607
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:15,401
oh,

608
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:16,234
hello.

609
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,780
Oh,

610
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,400
and I remembered her name and I went and
looked it up and there was a B plus and

611
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:21,971
it wasn't that,

612
00:14:21,971 --> 00:14:22,481
hi,

613
00:14:22,481 --> 00:14:23,620
how are you?

614
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:24,910
A minus or a one.

615
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:25,660
Uh,

616
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,140
but I mean,

617
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:26,560
whatever,

618
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,950
I'm sure she had all A's and the other
courses and a B plus is not the end of

619
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:30,491
the world.

620
00:14:30,491 --> 00:14:31,630
And most people get A's.

621
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:31,871
But,

622
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,350
uh,

623
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:32,710
uh,

624
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,250
whatever.

625
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,260
But you have to take the midterm.

626
00:14:34,261 --> 00:14:36,640
Just the way they run it
here and it's not my idea.

627
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:38,410
So that's what we're going to do.

628
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:39,370
Okay.

629
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,920
Now I'm going to talk about
seeing some of the themes.

630
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,070
And then at the end,

631
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,940
I'm going to read you
a poem because I got,

632
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,040
I started history in a way,

633
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,440
in a serious way because I read this poem,

634
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:52,790
so I'll leave that until the end of it.

635
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,390
Um,

636
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,260
I didn't go to Yale.

637
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,310
I went to University of
Michigan maize and blue forever.

638
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,203
Very sad,

639
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,310
eh,

640
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,220
since last weekend.

641
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,090
Um,

642
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:02,751
and uh,

643
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:03,140
I could,

644
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,891
I came from Portland,

645
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:04,724
Oregon.

646
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,410
I don't know if he would
come from Portland,

647
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:06,710
Oregon,

648
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,543
but that's where I'm from.

649
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,900
And when I went off to Michigan,

650
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,250
I had been at a Jesuit high school and
just what the high schools for it was a

651
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:14,570
sports factory in part.

652
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,240
Uh,

653
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:15,441
but,

654
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:16,400
but it was a very good school,

655
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:17,480
but it was very repressive.

656
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,750
And I went off to University of Michigan
after having gone to a Jesuit school

657
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:21,620
for four years.

658
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:22,850
And,

659
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:23,683
uh,

660
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,161
it was wine,

661
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:27,740
women and song and there weren't
enough of them in the middle.

662
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,600
Uh,

663
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,433
and

664
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,480
probably too much of the first
and my first semester I got,

665
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:33,770
um,

666
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:38,770
I got a 1.9300000000000002 grade point
average and my mother asked me if that

667
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,520
was under a two point scale,

668
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,490
you know,

669
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,333
I'm sure his,

670
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,353
and I had a,

671
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,440
I had an F.

672
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,050
I mean I'm not,

673
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,480
I shouldn't laugh at myself and my kids,

674
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:47,541
the,

675
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:47,951
Oh my God,

676
00:15:47,951 --> 00:15:49,040
not the same story again,

677
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:54,041
but I got an f and I got two cs and I
got a B and the people I hung around with

678
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,293
in Anarbor,

679
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:01,430
we're so unaccomplished some of them
anyway that they thought I was smart,

680
00:16:01,431 --> 00:16:02,570
can I got a B?

681
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,370
They say I go by in the dining room,

682
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,520
he got a B and they,

683
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,030
they asked me to tutor them.

684
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,050
Can you imagine that?

685
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,861
And so,

686
00:16:09,861 --> 00:16:10,041
I mean,

687
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,850
some of the people that I
hung around with were amazing.

688
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,830
You may even know people like that,

689
00:16:12,831 --> 00:16:13,430
but I don't think,

690
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,181
I don't think so.

691
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,650
But one of the guys that I knew,

692
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:17,120
I got to get back to
the topic in a minute,

693
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:19,190
but I just thought of this was a sure.

694
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,830
The King of Malapropisms and,

695
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:22,190
uh,

696
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,690
one day he was going on and on.

697
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,740
This is the people I hung around with.

698
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,660
He was going on and on
about this good meal at,

699
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:27,494
he'd had,

700
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:27,830
you know,

701
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:31,220
of one course after another and it
was fantastic and it was a really good

702
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:31,941
restaurant.

703
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:32,480
And,

704
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,021
and you know,

705
00:16:33,021 --> 00:16:34,760
somebody snuck him some wine and,

706
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,540
and financially I,

707
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,430
they're tired of the whole thing.

708
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:38,240
I said,

709
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,200
was it gratis?

710
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:39,801
And he said,

711
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:39,981
no,

712
00:16:39,981 --> 00:16:40,814
it was chicken.

713
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,133
And so those,

714
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,480
those are the people that I hung
around with the University of Michigan.

715
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,070
But I've tried here a long time.

716
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:46,501
Uh,

717
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:47,990
and I stand by maize and blue.

718
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:48,711
But I love Yale.

719
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:51,020
And one of the things I love about Yale's
being able to teach people like you,

720
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:51,500
and I mean,

721
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,340
and I love this course,

722
00:16:52,341 --> 00:16:54,230
so I hope that you will,

723
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,840
you will enjoy it if indeed you take it.

724
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,231
Now,

725
00:16:57,231 --> 00:16:58,940
what about some of the scenes?

726
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,260
What kind of stuff are we good?

727
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:00,951
Are we going to do,

728
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:01,640
could you get some,

729
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,390
uh,

730
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,223
um,

731
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,870
a syllabi for some of those
folks back there be great.

732
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:06,421
They're up to,

733
00:17:06,421 --> 00:17:07,850
they're up on the the thing.

734
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,713
Thanks a lot.

735
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,340
I'm a couple of scenes.

736
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,180
Um,

737
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,020
I don't believe in,

738
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:14,660
I've never believed that
history is a series of bins.

739
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,770
I guess I wrote that in the book,

740
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:18,710
but that you open up and you say
whether it goes enlightenment,

741
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,000
shut that baby down,

742
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:24,050
then you open up the next one and here
comes 18th century rivalries and you shut

743
00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:26,330
that baby and then French level Lucian,

744
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:26,720
while I'm on,

745
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,980
I know all about that now.

746
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,550
Pretty soon you'd go on to Russian
revolution eventually and all that,

747
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,630
that you know,

748
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,990
to do a course like this where you're
going to learn much of what is important

749
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:38,480
to know about Western civilization.

750
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,470
I do believe,

751
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,130
um,

752
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,410
to do the reading and stuff
and if you enjoy the lectures,

753
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,250
um,

754
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,990
there have to be some Fred's that no,

755
00:17:44,991 --> 00:17:45,920
they go to all the way through that,

756
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,740
that make it work then make it worth it.

757
00:17:48,741 --> 00:17:50,580
So you something and,

758
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:54,450
and one is certainly state making because
even if you take a sort of federalized

759
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,890
decentralized state,

760
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:59,970
like with this very bizarre electoral
system like the United in the United

761
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:00,330
States,

762
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:00,810
uh,

763
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:01,650
that the growth of,

764
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:03,120
of modern states,

765
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:03,391
you know,

766
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,250
it doesn't really just come
to the 20th century with,

767
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,240
with the welfare state beginning in
England and even before that in some other

768
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:09,811
places,

769
00:18:09,811 --> 00:18:11,610
insurance programs and things like that.

770
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,790
It begins with the
consolidation of state power,

771
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:15,240
uh,

772
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,550
in the late middle ages with,

773
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:18,150
with territorial monarchies,

774
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:19,020
the Spanish and the,

775
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,600
and the French and the English monarchies.

776
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,673
Uh,

777
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:26,490
it has a lot to do with the growth of
absolute rule and that's why I'm going to

778
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:27,540
talk about next time.

779
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,920
Absolute rule.

780
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:29,610
Uh,

781
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,540
absolutism,

782
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,170
uh,

783
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,790
the growth of standing armies,

784
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,170
huge standing armies,

785
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:35,400
never seen before,

786
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,150
uh,

787
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,760
force big forts built on frontiers.

788
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,450
Uh,

789
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,050
it has a lot to do with bureaucrats
who could extract resources from,

790
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,640
from ordinary people.

791
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,460
While the rich didn't pay anything
or hardly anything at all.

792
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,180
Uh,

793
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,590
it has to do with an allegiance,

794
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:52,890
the dynastic legions that
can be transferred later to,

795
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,310
to,

796
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,121
to a nation,

797
00:18:54,121 --> 00:18:55,230
the idea of a nation.

798
00:18:55,231 --> 00:18:56,880
And that starts in the 18th century.

799
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,680
It doesn't start in the 19th century.

800
00:18:58,681 --> 00:18:59,940
It starts in the 18th century,

801
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:00,991
at least in England.

802
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,430
And that's an argument that we in Britain,

803
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,780
and that's an argument that we'll make.

804
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,430
We'll make bef uh,

805
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,293
also,

806
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,571
you know,

807
00:19:06,571 --> 00:19:07,680
in 1500,

808
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:09,360
which is kind of when
that book gets rolling,

809
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:11,820
they only started about 1648.

810
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,003
Um,

811
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,600
there was about 1500 different terror,

812
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:20,840
Touro units in Europe and some are
no bigger than archbishops garden in,

813
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,720
in Germany.

814
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,580
And some were larger states.

815
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:25,860
Not yet what they are
now in terms of size,

816
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:26,940
such as France and,

817
00:19:26,941 --> 00:19:27,750
and uh,

818
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,583
Eh,

819
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,800
uh,

820
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,750
which expanded under Louis,

821
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:32,690
the 14th it into,

822
00:19:32,691 --> 00:19:32,881
you know,

823
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:33,611
Alsace and,

824
00:19:33,611 --> 00:19:33,801
and,

825
00:19:33,801 --> 00:19:34,290
and,

826
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,001
and Lauren and,

827
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:37,290
and various other places.

828
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:41,580
But there's about 1500
territorial units in 1890.

829
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,503
There were 30.

830
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,840
And so the consolidation of state power,

831
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:50,110
which is looking at it
from the state out or the,

832
00:19:50,111 --> 00:19:50,210
the,

833
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:55,210
the emergence of an identity where you
see yourself as German as opposed to a

834
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:59,340
Bavarian French as opposed
to Gaskell or Provence,

835
00:19:59,341 --> 00:20:00,174
Sal,

836
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:00,630
uh,

837
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,790
Spanish as opposed to Castilian,

838
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,630
uh,

839
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:09,710
or as opposed to cattle [inaudible] the
cat law language was illegal until 1975.

840
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:14,070
It's 75 until a Francisco
Franco finally Croak,

841
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:14,671
uh,

842
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,380
in 1975 and November.

843
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,160
Uh,

844
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,580
uh,

845
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,330
and so,

846
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:18,750
uh,

847
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,050
some,

848
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:19,371
somebody,

849
00:20:19,371 --> 00:20:20,340
this is a great phrase,

850
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:20,530
some,

851
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,720
I wish I had said it originally,

852
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:22,441
I don't know who said it,

853
00:20:22,441 --> 00:20:26,940
but someone once said that a language
is a dialect with a powerful army.

854
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,681
And that's it.

855
00:20:28,681 --> 00:20:29,430
That's true.

856
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,320
France at the time of
the French revolution,

857
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,000
half the people in France,

858
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,043
new French,

859
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,520
there was bilingualism.

860
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:36,860
You could know Katella.

861
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:37,321
You could,

862
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:38,530
you could know over in Europe,

863
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,300
Patois,

864
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,330
we live in the south of France where a
lot of people's old people still speak a

865
00:20:42,331 --> 00:20:44,790
patois though now that's mostly dying out.

866
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,600
Uh,

867
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,160
and how does it come that identity,

868
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:52,240
a sense of allegiance
to a state or a country?

869
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,440
Not everybody,

870
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,730
but how does it come to 1914 when
people marching off to get killed,

871
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:58,360
uh,

872
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,210
thinking they're Macias and
the French national anthem,

873
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:01,751
uh,

874
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:02,020
in,

875
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,360
in,

876
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,310
in pretty good French.

877
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:04,330
How does that happen?

878
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,690
How does the state increase its reach?

879
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,100
How does the modern world,

880
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,270
how is it created?

881
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,380
We call this process,

882
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,510
it's a clumsy world word,

883
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,463
but state making.

884
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:15,730
How does states form?

885
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:18,160
And the other side of this
is how do identities change?

886
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:18,761
If you,

887
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:18,941
you know,

888
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:19,780
in the 16th century,

889
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:21,550
17th century as somebody who we were say,

890
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:22,384
who are you?

891
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,661
And they say,

892
00:21:23,661 --> 00:21:23,891
well,

893
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:24,101
you know,

894
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:24,721
I am so,

895
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:27,160
so I'm of this family or I am Protestant.

896
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,150
If it was the 16th century or late
16th century or late 16th century,

897
00:21:31,151 --> 00:21:32,260
where anytime after 15,

898
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,510
twenties and thirties,

899
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,390
and parts of Germany,

900
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,293
I'm Protestant,

901
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:35,680
uh,

902
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,513
I am Jewish,

903
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,250
uh,

904
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:37,480
uh,

905
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,950
in much of the Balkans.

906
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:39,970
I am Muslim,

907
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:40,630
uh,

908
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,770
in most of Europe.

909
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,250
Uh,

910
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,770
I am Catholic and eaten in Eastern Europe.

911
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:45,041
I am,

912
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:45,251
you know,

913
00:21:45,251 --> 00:21:46,180
Russian Orthodox.

914
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:47,260
I live in a village,

915
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:47,980
Mir,

916
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,813
Mir,

917
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,220
uh,

918
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:49,370
uh,

919
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,203
in Russia.

920
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,510
How does it happen that by
the end of the 19th century,

921
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:55,090
people have you in Russia as
they're starving to death,

922
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,120
a starving in the famine that the Tolstoy,

923
00:21:58,121 --> 00:22:00,310
the great writer called
the world's attention to,

924
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:00,960
you know,

925
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,260
they,

926
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:05,560
a lot of them died and in fields thinking
only if the czar only knew that we

927
00:22:05,561 --> 00:22:08,530
were starving and that his
ministers were treating this bad,

928
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:09,910
how angry he would be.

929
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,241
Well,

930
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:10,841
they didn't get it.

931
00:22:10,841 --> 00:22:11,061
That the,

932
00:22:11,061 --> 00:22:11,210
you know,

933
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,450
that they didn't know that this
art could have given one damn.

934
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:13,990
Uh,

935
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:14,231
but,

936
00:22:14,231 --> 00:22:14,830
but the,

937
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,200
the allegiance to the czar,

938
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,880
that sense of being Russian,

939
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,780
uh,

940
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,440
or being dominated by the Russians are
something they had to be constructed as a

941
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,130
w.

942
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,590
So the state constructs its ability to,

943
00:22:26,591 --> 00:22:27,130
to,

944
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:27,850
to,

945
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:28,450
uh,

946
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,190
to extract taxes,

947
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,610
extract bodies for national armies,

948
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,290
also to provide resources.

949
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,180
But identities are transformed.

950
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:40,100
And so I give this as an
example cause state making is,

951
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,890
is one of the themes that kind
of ties everything together.

952
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:45,521
And you know,

953
00:22:45,521 --> 00:22:47,920
this course a ends in 1945 but look at,

954
00:22:47,921 --> 00:22:50,410
look at the problems and
the post communist world of,

955
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,110
of state making and look
what's going on in Georgia,

956
00:22:53,111 --> 00:22:54,370
which is more complicated than,

957
00:22:54,371 --> 00:22:54,910
than,

958
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:55,870
than the newspapers,

959
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,780
uh,

960
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,410
uh,

961
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:57,730
uh,

962
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:02,080
present in very many ways or look what
the horror show of of the Balkans in the

963
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:02,930
1990s.

964
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,510
So a lot of the issues,

965
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:04,870
uh,

966
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,880
religious hatreds that
we thought only were,

967
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,680
would be limited to Northern Ireland.

968
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:09,340
You know,

969
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,890
that's another theme that's very
important to the whole thing.

970
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:12,551
Another,

971
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:14,110
as of course is economic change.

972
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,990
Obviously this is not a
course in economic history,

973
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:17,770
uh,

974
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,420
but the rise of capitalism,

975
00:23:19,421 --> 00:23:19,631
I mean,

976
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:20,351
that's what it's called,

977
00:23:20,351 --> 00:23:22,840
capitalism or large
scale industrialization.

978
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,690
It changes in ways that,

979
00:23:24,691 --> 00:23:24,931
that,

980
00:23:24,931 --> 00:23:26,380
that will suggest in the reading.

981
00:23:26,381 --> 00:23:29,650
And then I'll talk about a little bit
the way people live in very fundamental

982
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:30,340
ways.

983
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,930
There's lots of continuity's,

984
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,700
but there's lots of big changes.

985
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,520
Everybody has an end up in
the assembly lines right away.

986
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,031
Uh,

987
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:38,140
and there are other ways of,

988
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,481
of,

989
00:23:38,481 --> 00:23:40,360
of other rural production.

990
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:40,770
Uh,

991
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,770
a women's work,

992
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,071
uh,

993
00:23:42,071 --> 00:23:42,910
remains terribly,

994
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:43,810
terribly important.

995
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:44,680
Uh,

996
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,340
and I'll spend some time doing that.

997
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,230
A very dear friend of mine,

998
00:23:48,231 --> 00:23:48,831
my mentor,

999
00:23:48,831 --> 00:23:50,000
Indeed Chuck Tilly,

1000
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:51,800
who just died a couple months ago,

1001
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,130
my great sadness once said that it's very,

1002
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,330
it's bitter hard.

1003
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,040
It's bitter hard to write
the history of remainders.

1004
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,790
And so lots of people who
were left out of all of this.

1005
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:06,110
I'll do one lecture when I talk,

1006
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,760
I talk about popular protest
and I'll take three examples of,

1007
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,190
of people rebelling and I,

1008
00:24:13,191 --> 00:24:14,660
I stand back and said,

1009
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:15,740
what does this mean?

1010
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,300
What is going on here?

1011
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,220
I take the example from,

1012
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,450
from the Pyrenees mountains,

1013
00:24:20,451 --> 00:24:21,800
a place called the edge.

1014
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,560
We're not responsible for
that name would never be,

1015
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:29,770
but we're suddenly men dressed as women
carrying guns or carrying pitchforks.

1016
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:32,960
Came down out of the
miss out of the snow and,

1017
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:37,220
and drove away charcoal burners
and drove away forest guards.

1018
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:37,641
Why?

1019
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:40,940
Because they'd lost access
to glean to pasture.

1020
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:41,171
They're,

1021
00:24:41,171 --> 00:24:42,560
they're miserable animals.

1022
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:43,070
Uh,

1023
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:48,070
because the wealthy big surprise got the
law on their side as the price of wood

1024
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:48,914
goes up.

1025
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,971
They didn't walk around and say,

1026
00:24:49,971 --> 00:24:50,151
well,

1027
00:24:50,151 --> 00:24:50,880
I'm a remainder.

1028
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,460
Eventually I'm going to
have to move to Toulouse.

1029
00:24:52,461 --> 00:24:53,120
And my grand,

1030
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,331
great,

1031
00:24:53,331 --> 00:24:56,900
great grandchildren will work in the
El Spatialos in the air industry.

1032
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,231
Uh,

1033
00:24:57,231 --> 00:24:59,900
there they didn't say I'm
remained a number 231,

1034
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:04,630
but they fought for their dignity and
for a sense of moral of justice that they

1035
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,180
thought existed at one time that had
been taken away by economic changes they

1036
00:25:08,181 --> 00:25:09,410
couldn't control.

1037
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,580
And then I take an example from the
south of England from the same time,

1038
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,810
1829,

1039
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,770
1830,

1040
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,770
when they say they're fine people that uh,

1041
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,690
dead with only dandelions and
their stomach dead of hunger.

1042
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,420
And then these people start marching.

1043
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:24,561
The poor,

1044
00:25:24,561 --> 00:25:28,400
the rich and poor rural labor start
marching and threatening people with

1045
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,300
threshing machines.

1046
00:25:29,301 --> 00:25:30,230
Why threshing machines?

1047
00:25:30,231 --> 00:25:34,280
Cause threshing machines was taking
away their work as harvesters.

1048
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:40,060
And one day they found a sign that said
revenge from the is on the wing from thy

1049
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,660
determined captain swing
suggested that there were many,

1050
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,340
they were righteous.

1051
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,660
They were just,

1052
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,310
they were armed.

1053
00:25:49,311 --> 00:25:51,290
They were ready to
Catherine's swing exist.

1054
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:52,543
Of course not.

1055
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:55,360
They were weak and they get lost there.

1056
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,810
They get defeated.

1057
00:25:56,811 --> 00:25:57,621
Some of them are Hong,

1058
00:25:57,621 --> 00:25:59,150
lots of them are sent to Tasmania.

1059
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,880
The prisoner at Port Arthur Tasmania,

1060
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,320
they're sent to Australia.

1061
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,930
That's why when the
Australians play the English,

1062
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,070
a lot of the Australian sing,

1063
00:26:07,071 --> 00:26:07,281
we,

1064
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:07,580
you know,

1065
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,050
that Old Beatles Song,

1066
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:10,070
yellow submarine now,

1067
00:26:10,071 --> 00:26:10,904
which you don't remember.

1068
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,090
I,

1069
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,080
which I vaguely remember,

1070
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:12,530
uh,

1071
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:12,960
we,

1072
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,160
you know,

1073
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,990
we all live in a convent colony,

1074
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:16,010
a convict colony,

1075
00:26:16,011 --> 00:26:16,970
a convict colony,

1076
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:17,640
uh,

1077
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,321
captain swing,

1078
00:26:18,321 --> 00:26:18,951
they lost,

1079
00:26:18,951 --> 00:26:20,150
but they went down fighting.

1080
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,820
And it's bitter hard to write
the history of remainders.

1081
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,500
But when you look up
from that and you say,

1082
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:25,000
look what the,

1083
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,210
what's going on here?

1084
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,340
When you look at people
fighting for grain,

1085
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:29,180
fighting for food,

1086
00:26:29,181 --> 00:26:32,030
they're fighting against the
larger process that they can't,

1087
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,070
they can't control,

1088
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,980
but it tells you a lot what's
going on over the big picture.

1089
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,510
So that's another one.

1090
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,280
And then there is just,

1091
00:26:40,281 --> 00:26:41,180
I'll just take one more,

1092
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:41,990
uh,

1093
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,980
maybe another 10.

1094
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,630
I'm going to read my poem and they then,

1095
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,411
then you can go.

1096
00:26:46,411 --> 00:26:47,280
But I hope you come back.

1097
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,690
Um,

1098
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:52,290
war war as a dynamic of change.

1099
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,730
Um,

1100
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:54,900
the 18th centuries,

1101
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,850
what warfare changes with Napoleon?

1102
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:57,511
Uh,

1103
00:26:57,511 --> 00:26:59,370
there were already changes
in the 18th century,

1104
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:03,080
but it was still basically professional
armies are people getting conscripted

1105
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:05,340
into the British navy because they
were drunk at the wrong place,

1106
00:27:05,341 --> 00:27:06,091
at the wrong time,

1107
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,010
outside of a tavern in
Portsmith or something.

1108
00:27:08,011 --> 00:27:08,611
And next thing they know,

1109
00:27:08,611 --> 00:27:09,930
they're throwing up on a,

1110
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,820
on a ship bobbing off,

1111
00:27:11,821 --> 00:27:12,420
uh,

1112
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,060
it sort of the English empire,

1113
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,060
uh,

1114
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:15,511
but,

1115
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:18,330
but warfare changes with the nation state.

1116
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,890
The French called it [inaudible].

1117
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,510
That's her mass conscription,

1118
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,640
the sense of defending the nation.

1119
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,240
And there's this magic moment where
the artisans of Paris defeat the,

1120
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:27,630
you know,

1121
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:31,650
highly professional art lies army
at a windmill called Vat and me,

1122
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:32,460
uh,

1123
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,660
in the east of France.

1124
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,220
And it changes the way things were.

1125
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:38,250
A Napoleon is arguably
the first total war,

1126
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:38,580
uh,

1127
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,710
because of a war against civilians,

1128
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,370
uh,

1129
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:41,821
in,

1130
00:27:41,821 --> 00:27:42,300
uh,

1131
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:42,571
uh,

1132
00:27:42,571 --> 00:27:45,060
where they're no longer the traditional
limits between fighting against

1133
00:27:45,061 --> 00:27:47,000
civilians in fighting against the,

1134
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:47,760
uh,

1135
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,110
against armies and other,

1136
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,210
those limits hadn't existed
in the 30 years war.

1137
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,320
And I'll talk a little bit about that,

1138
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,140
uh,

1139
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:53,281
uh,

1140
00:27:53,281 --> 00:27:54,450
a next time around,

1141
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:54,890
but,

1142
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,040
but the wars are very different.

1143
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,281
You know,

1144
00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:56,910
there were,

1145
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,560
there's famous Goya paintings of,

1146
00:27:58,561 --> 00:28:01,690
of a peasants being gunned
down by French soldiers and,

1147
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,890
and atrocities against
the peasants in Calabria,

1148
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:05,910
in the south of Italy.

1149
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,770
So warfare really changes,

1150
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:09,390
but it becomes a dynamic of change.

1151
00:28:09,391 --> 00:28:12,540
If you think about the
Russian revolution of 1917,

1152
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:16,500
the Russian revolution was not
inconceivable without world war one a,

1153
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:20,820
but it was sort of inconceivable
without the Russian revolution of 1904,

1154
00:28:20,821 --> 00:28:21,230
nine,

1155
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:24,860
I have 1905 in the feet in
Japan by the Japanese and,

1156
00:28:24,861 --> 00:28:25,860
and an extraordinary,

1157
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:26,580
uh,

1158
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,720
shocking event for,

1159
00:28:27,721 --> 00:28:29,330
at least for Europeans in,

1160
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,080
in 1904 1905.

1161
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:36,080
And World War One provides opportunities
for dissidents in Russia to put forward

1162
00:28:36,451 --> 00:28:37,284
their claims.

1163
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,770
So when the whole thing
collapses on the czar's head,

1164
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,191
uh,

1165
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:42,780
in February,

1166
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,370
1917 and the Bolsheviks come to power,

1167
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:47,970
the war itself with the
dynamic of change as well.

1168
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,260
And what a war,

1169
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:49,980
uh,

1170
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,820
what wars,

1171
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:51,031
I mean,

1172
00:28:51,031 --> 00:28:52,320
there had been nothing ever like it.

1173
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,720
A few journalists who had been in,

1174
00:28:54,721 --> 00:28:55,320
uh,

1175
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,080
the Russian Japanese
war had seen trenches,

1176
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:58,651
uh,

1177
00:28:58,651 --> 00:28:58,851
in,

1178
00:28:58,851 --> 00:29:00,990
in Manchuria that had been built,

1179
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:04,110
but nobody could have imagined that
the ward was supposed to be over in six

1180
00:29:04,111 --> 00:29:04,740
weeks,

1181
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,810
was going to destroy four empires.

1182
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,290
Uh,

1183
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:07,730
that is the,

1184
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:07,871
the,

1185
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,120
the Ottoman Empire,

1186
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,310
the Austro-hungarian Empire,

1187
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,870
the German empire,

1188
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,550
and the Russian empire.

1189
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,980
And arguably this,

1190
00:29:16,981 --> 00:29:17,791
we can talk about this.

1191
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:18,511
We can debate this,

1192
00:29:18,511 --> 00:29:19,560
the British empire,

1193
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:23,400
because lots of people
who had fought in India,

1194
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:23,970
oh,

1195
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,590
Indians who had fought in the war,

1196
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,470
or people now we'd call Pakistani's
who'd fought in the war,

1197
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,690
or people from Kenya
who fought in the war,

1198
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,070
uh,

1199
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,910
are no longer going to be satisfied with,

1200
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,893
was simply,

1201
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,390
you know,

1202
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,730
arguing that they're part of the,

1203
00:29:35,731 --> 00:29:36,630
of the great empire,

1204
00:29:36,631 --> 00:29:37,230
even though they have,

1205
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:37,531
have,

1206
00:29:37,531 --> 00:29:37,830
uh,

1207
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,380
hardly any rights and no
money and simply work for the,

1208
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:40,681
uh,

1209
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:41,530
for the big guy.

1210
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,550
Um,

1211
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:45,370
and so the war transforms,

1212
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,120
uh,

1213
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:46,691
uh,

1214
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:48,730
Europe by destroying these empires.

1215
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,120
What it also does and is
very possible to argue this.

1216
00:29:52,121 --> 00:29:52,251
And,

1217
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:52,541
and,

1218
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:53,350
um,

1219
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,730
and my friend Jay Winter,

1220
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:58,300
who is great expert on world war one and
Bruno and combine also who's on leave

1221
00:29:58,301 --> 00:29:59,770
this year would agree with this.

1222
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,780
You can see the whole period in 1914,

1223
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:06,781
1945 as a new and more karabal 30 years'
war because Europe is in depression all

1224
00:30:08,651 --> 00:30:10,270
through the 1920s and thirties,

1225
00:30:10,271 --> 00:30:10,841
agriculture,

1226
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:11,980
depression the whole time,

1227
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:12,850
uh,

1228
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,310
only between 1924,

1229
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,020
1929 is it not big industrial depression,

1230
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:17,710
uh,

1231
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,870
the poisoning of the political atmosphere.

1232
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,291
I'll give,

1233
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:20,741
I'll talk.

1234
00:30:20,741 --> 00:30:24,210
I'm going to do a whole lecture on Hitler
and the National Socialists Cause War.

1235
00:30:24,211 --> 00:30:25,600
Ro One created Hitler.

1236
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:30,670
He was already just as pathetic a guy
with great grandiose plans with no friends

1237
00:30:30,671 --> 00:30:30,941
and,

1238
00:30:30,941 --> 00:30:33,460
and that sort of a sad sack
going to the theater and uh,

1239
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:37,690
and a of droning on and on
about all I knew about Wagner,

1240
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:40,750
who we loved and in the theater
and in a threadbare coat,

1241
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,770
but world war one transforms
him into an anti-semite.

1242
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,250
He was already an anti socialist.

1243
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,640
It transforms a Munificent,

1244
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,220
anti-semite people,

1245
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,570
the troops that came back,

1246
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,910
many of them simply kept on marching.

1247
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,410
They'd survived the war,

1248
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:54,970
and they kept on marching,

1249
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,540
marching and the poisoning
and the political atmosphere
was something that was

1250
00:30:58,541 --> 00:30:59,590
simply extraordinary.

1251
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,860
And you have to under understand fascism.

1252
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:02,591
This is terribly,

1253
00:31:02,591 --> 00:31:03,424
terribly important.

1254
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,090
Uh,

1255
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,820
you have to understand what
happens in world war one.

1256
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,280
Great expectations dashed,

1257
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:09,730
uh,

1258
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:10,840
the treaty of Versailles,

1259
00:31:10,841 --> 00:31:12,520
which only the great British thinker,

1260
00:31:12,521 --> 00:31:16,180
John Maynard Keynes really got right
predicting the disaster that came out of

1261
00:31:16,181 --> 00:31:16,600
it.

1262
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,700
If there's no more
fascinating period in history,

1263
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,660
uh,

1264
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:19,790
uh,

1265
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,561
in my mind,

1266
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:20,740
it's,

1267
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,510
it's absolutely a fantastic,

1268
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,500
and what a war.

1269
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:24,911
It's all obvious.

1270
00:31:24,911 --> 00:31:26,290
Everybody's seen these films,

1271
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,090
imperial or war museum,

1272
00:31:28,091 --> 00:31:29,560
which has been kind of wreck
the way they've done it.

1273
00:31:29,561 --> 00:31:30,730
Now it's sort of too high tech,

1274
00:31:30,731 --> 00:31:32,110
but a in London.

1275
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:32,890
Uh,

1276
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:33,400
but it,

1277
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:38,400
I leave you with just a couple of thoughts
that the battle of the Somme in 1916

1278
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:42,400
that started in July 1st when they blow
the whistle and say over the top guys,

1279
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,360
uh,

1280
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,360
there are more British soldiers killed
and wounded in the first three days of

1281
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:49,990
the battle of the Somme,

1282
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,210
Som m e three days,

1283
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,943
three days.

1284
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,230
Then there were Americans
killed in world war one,

1285
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:01,270
Korea and Vietnam combined in three days.

1286
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,950
Whereas where are the great British
leaders in the 1920s in the 1930s,

1287
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,240
they're all dead.

1288
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,220
They're hung up on that old Barb wire.

1289
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:13,090
It's one of the war poets put it there
are hung up on that old Barb wire.

1290
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,493
One guy,

1291
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:15,940
a soccer player.

1292
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:16,871
I said,

1293
00:32:16,871 --> 00:32:16,961
well,

1294
00:32:16,961 --> 00:32:17,530
I'm gonna,

1295
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,200
you know,

1296
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:18,410
we'll,

1297
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:18,800
we'll,

1298
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,140
we'll get some enthusiasm.

1299
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,140
He drives to dribble a ball across,

1300
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:23,350
you know,

1301
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,570
these trenches and things
like across the bow,

1302
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,220
the craters and he doesn't make it.

1303
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,670
He's,

1304
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,950
he's killed in 1950,

1305
00:32:29,951 --> 00:32:31,540
1914 and Christmas Day.

1306
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,561
The Germans and the,

1307
00:32:32,561 --> 00:32:32,951
and the,

1308
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:33,860
and the British soldiers,

1309
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:37,290
I'm to say enough of this stuff for the
day and they sing to each other and they

1310
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:38,140
actually play soccer.

1311
00:32:38,141 --> 00:32:38,980
They play football.

1312
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,071
1915,

1313
00:32:40,071 --> 00:32:42,290
or British soldiers says let's do the
same thing and you put him against the

1314
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:44,660
wall and shoot him 19,

1315
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:45,770
the war,

1316
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,030
the horror of the war.

1317
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,233
Uh,

1318
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:48,630
uh,

1319
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:48,831
it,

1320
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:49,880
it transforms Europe.

1321
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,140
Every aspect of Europe.

1322
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,621
Uh,

1323
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:54,230
it's impossible to understand
the growth of the agrarian,

1324
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:59,120
a sort of semi fascist regimes in
eastern Europe and very much under Nazi

1325
00:32:59,121 --> 00:32:59,954
influence,

1326
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:00,470
uh,

1327
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,360
without understanding World War One.

1328
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,170
Uh,

1329
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:06,170
the war that the supposed to end all wars,

1330
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:10,310
of course it doesn't do that at all.

1331
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:11,990
And that's a big stop on,

1332
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:12,051
uh,

1333
00:33:12,051 --> 00:33:12,884
on our uh,

1334
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:13,660
uh,

1335
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,780
on our agenda as well.

1336
00:33:14,781 --> 00:33:15,230
We did,

1337
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,000
we used to read all quiet
on the western front,

1338
00:33:17,001 --> 00:33:20,420
but everybody's read that and then we
read Robert Graves rather long and self

1339
00:33:20,421 --> 00:33:21,051
indulgent,

1340
00:33:21,051 --> 00:33:21,561
a good bite,

1341
00:33:21,561 --> 00:33:22,394
all of that.

1342
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,390
So that was pretty long.

1343
00:33:23,391 --> 00:33:24,260
So we don't do that,

1344
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,580
but we do,

1345
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,413
we will,

1346
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,650
we will try to rock.

1347
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,410
Let me just read you my
poem and then you can,

1348
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,043
then you can go,

1349
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,100
uh,

1350
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:33,340
Lincoln,

1351
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:33,831
whatever you want.

1352
00:33:33,831 --> 00:33:34,670
But anyway,

1353
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,321
but I remember this,

1354
00:33:36,321 --> 00:33:37,460
I remember reading this poem,

1355
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,330
uh,

1356
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,650
back in University of Michigan,

1357
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:40,190
uh,

1358
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:40,540
on,

1359
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,373
uh,

1360
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:42,500
uh,

1361
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:46,280
on two o'clock on a Saturday trying to
figure out what it does in the night

1362
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:46,281
before,

1363
00:33:46,281 --> 00:33:47,114
but ain't we know,

1364
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,953
um,

1365
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,273
this is Brett,

1366
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:49,970
the great,

1367
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:50,540
uh,

1368
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,430
East German East German poet,

1369
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:55,340
and it's called a worker reads history.

1370
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,330
And let me begin by saying that we're
going to study quote unquote great.

1371
00:33:59,331 --> 00:33:59,661
I mean,

1372
00:33:59,661 --> 00:34:01,400
really quote unquote great men,

1373
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,383
great women.

1374
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,010
Uh,

1375
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,430
Hitler is obviously not a great man,

1376
00:34:04,431 --> 00:34:05,300
but he's a,

1377
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:05,630
you know,

1378
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,051
awful,

1379
00:34:06,051 --> 00:34:06,531
just awful.

1380
00:34:06,531 --> 00:34:09,920
But the people who were thought
to a made history in Napoleon,

1381
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:10,251
uh,

1382
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:10,551
Peter,

1383
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:11,330
the great,

1384
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:11,630
uh,

1385
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:15,690
other people I do talk about the folks
that you read about and in textbooks,

1386
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:16,760
including mine,

1387
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:21,470
but I asked the same question and post
you the same question that Breck poses,

1388
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:22,760
and it's a short poem.

1389
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,593
So just hang on.

1390
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,320
Who built the seven gates of thieves?

1391
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,920
The books are filled with the names of
kings was at kings who hold the craggy

1392
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:38,620
blocks of stone and Babylon
so many times destroyed.

1393
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:44,170
Who built the city up each
time in which of Lima's houses?

1394
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:51,070
The city glittering wood with gold lived
those who built it in the evening when

1395
00:34:53,121 --> 00:34:54,920
the Chinese wall was finished,

1396
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,870
where did the masons go?

1397
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,980
Imperial Rome is full of Arcs of triumph.

1398
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,840
Who reared them up over whom
did the Caesar's triumph?

1399
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:10,880
Byzantium lives in song
where all her dwellings,

1400
00:35:10,881 --> 00:35:11,714
palaces,

1401
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:16,040
and even in Atlantis of the legend,

1402
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:21,820
the night to see rushed in the drowning
men still bellowed for their slaves.

1403
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:28,190
Young Alexander conquered India.

1404
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,630
He alone,

1405
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,510
Caesar beat the goals.

1406
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,610
Was there not even a cookie in his army.

1407
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:40,230
Philip of Spain wept as his
fleet was sunk and destroyed.

1408
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,570
Were there no other tiers?

1409
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,460
Frederick the great triumphed
in the seven years war.

1410
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,590
Who triumphed with him?

1411
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:54,570
Each page a victory at whose expense?

1412
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,080
The victory ball every 10 years.

1413
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,400
A great man who paid the Piper.

1414
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,680
So many particulars.

1415
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,960
So many questions,

1416
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,720
and if you hang with us this semester,

1417
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:11,580
we'll get at some of those.

1418
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,073
Yep.

1419
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:15,480
Thank you.
