1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,790
So today what I want to do was talk
about the revolutions of 1848 and read,

2
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:05,941
you know,

3
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:06,631
read the chapter.

4
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:07,650
It's not very long.

5
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:08,520
Um,

6
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,520
and I want to talk principally about why
there was no revolution in Britain in

7
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:17,730
1848 since there were
revolutions in France,

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,640
in Austria in the halfway or domains of,

9
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:20,951
of,

10
00:00:20,951 --> 00:00:21,480
uh,

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:21,931
of,

12
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:22,560
um,

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:22,741
you know,

14
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:25,380
the Austrian empire of
what would become an 1867,

15
00:00:25,381 --> 00:00:25,741
Austria,

16
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:26,574
Hungary,

17
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,211
uh,

18
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:27,810
in,

19
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,321
uh,

20
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:29,190
in Prussia,

21
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:29,911
uh,

22
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:33,570
and in the Rhineland and in I,

23
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:35,220
in northern Italy,

24
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:36,480
and even central Italy,

25
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,960
but not in Britain and
want to talk about that.

26
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,820
But before I do that,

27
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:42,870
um,

28
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,740
let's just think about revolution
in general and how revolutions work.

29
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,750
And I'll mention this
again when we get to,

30
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:49,500
um,

31
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:49,651
uh,

32
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:50,820
to the Russian revolution.

33
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,730
And if you think about what you know
about the French Revolution in this

34
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:54,564
context,

35
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:54,880
uh,

36
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,220
hopefully it'll make some sense.

37
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,293
And in the 18th,

38
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,220
in the 1960s,

39
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,080
um,

40
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,151
uh,

41
00:01:00,151 --> 00:01:00,984
people,

42
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,810
social scientists
believe that revolutions,

43
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,080
many social sciences,

44
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:08,610
it's not all believe that revolutions
hurricane when pressure builds up and

45
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:11,310
you've got pretty soon
intellectuals bailing out,

46
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,330
leaving the regime and then you've got
all this tension building up and then

47
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:15,721
boom,

48
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:17,130
you've got your basic revolution.

49
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,810
But revolutions don't work like that.

50
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,980
If you think about revolutions,

51
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:20,191
you know,

52
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:24,450
anything about the Iranian revolution
in 1979 would be a good example.

53
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,230
Or,

54
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:25,740
um,

55
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,260
the revolutions we're going to
talk about today a little bit,

56
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,380
it's you're reading about
1848 or the French revolution.

57
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,690
What happens is that,

58
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,650
uh,

59
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,330
in the case of 1848 or in the case of,

60
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,370
of the other ones that I've
mentioned is that there is a,

61
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,091
you know,

62
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:44,070
a seizure of power by a group,

63
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,880
uh,

64
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,880
who may have come together because
they oppose the policies of,

65
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:50,520
of,

66
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,610
of the establish of the government in,

67
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:53,580
in power.

68
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But it's at that point that you've got
an increase in social and political

69
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:00,294
tension,

70
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,400
and it's at that point
that you've got this,

71
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:02,730
this,

72
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,420
that,

73
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:03,721
that,

74
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:05,520
that tension really increases and,

75
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:07,680
and all sorts of interesting
things begin to happen.

76
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,640
Um,

77
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,160
so in the case of 1917,

78
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,491
uh,

79
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:13,800
in Saint Petersburg in February,

80
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,290
uh,

81
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,470
the bread lines are very long a,

82
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:18,540
they're not a lot of troops
around there at the front.

83
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:19,920
They're not a lot of police around.

84
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,461
Uh,

85
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:21,540
and suddenly,

86
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,230
uh,

87
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:22,591
uh,

88
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:22,951
the,

89
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:26,700
the czar czarist regime is just
sort of swept away like that.

90
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,130
And it's at that point
that things heat up.

91
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,060
Um,

92
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,650
the 1917 things weren't any,

93
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,090
you know,

94
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,120
tenser than were 19,

95
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:34,050
16 and,

96
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:35,250
and there's a lot of things happen.

97
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,870
A visa vi the war that,

98
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:38,880
that help people mobilize,

99
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:43,330
tried to imagine a post czarist
world or a reformed czar,

100
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,200
uh,

101
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,110
czarist autocracy.

102
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:46,740
Um,

103
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,210
in the case of 1848,

104
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:48,481
you know,

105
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:49,500
you've got your basic,

106
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:50,050
uh,

107
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:50,883
uh,

108
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,990
uh,

109
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,330
you've got demonstrations
in Paris in February.

110
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:55,770
It's rains all the time in Paris.

111
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:56,251
In February,

112
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:57,084
it's gray.

113
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:57,870
Uh,

114
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,890
people want a electoral reform.

115
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:02,770
And then the troops opened up
and shoot a bunch of people.

116
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:06,460
The same thing that happens in
Berlin that long after that.

117
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:09,580
And at that point then you've
got the regime was swept away.

118
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,120
But what's interesting about revolutionary
process is that after you've got this

119
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:18,640
kind of basic provisional
government in the case of all,

120
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:23,641
which is what were the constitutional
monarchy in 1789 and 1790 becomes,

121
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,390
uh,

122
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:25,810
uh,

123
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,180
and in the case of currencies,

124
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:32,220
provisional government in 1917 and
in the case of this kind of moderate

125
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:33,304
republic,

126
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:33,580
uh,

127
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,480
in France,

128
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,020
uh,

129
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,160
it's at that point,

130
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:37,750
or in Germany or in Austria,

131
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:38,830
you still got the monarchy,

132
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:42,790
but did you have all these contenders
for power who are saying at that point,

133
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,790
we want to take advantage
of the situation,

134
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,061
uh,

135
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:48,890
so that we will have a republic or the,

136
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,990
in the case of France,

137
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:53,710
that women will have more rights or
the workers will have more rights.

138
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,050
Uh,

139
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:54,761
in the case of,

140
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:55,331
of a,

141
00:03:55,331 --> 00:03:56,164
of Germany,

142
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:56,621
uh,

143
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:57,970
of the German states,

144
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:58,450
uh,

145
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,140
people who want a unified Germany
put forth their claims at that point.

146
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:02,950
Uh,

147
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,910
in the case of France,

148
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,200
people who want the monarchy,

149
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:05,491
uh,

150
00:04:05,491 --> 00:04:08,920
the borbons that is the legitimate
who were chased out in 1830.

151
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:09,760
Do you want them back?

152
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:11,080
They could in their claims,

153
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,300
you've got your basic
moderate Republicans.

154
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:13,661
They're saying,

155
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:14,860
we want a moderate republic.

156
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:15,880
Uh,

157
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,481
uh,

158
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:17,680
and in the case of,

159
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:18,071
of,

160
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:18,610
uh,

161
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:18,971
of,

162
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:19,990
of Australia,

163
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:22,840
you've got all these Vini
students and they want reforms.

164
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:24,250
They want to progressive regime.

165
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,700
So it's at that point that the sort of
social tension and political tension

166
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,760
increases and what the
revolutionary process does is it,

167
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and what's important about 1848 is that
it brings for the first time lots more

168
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:38,650
people into the political process.

169
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,400
Uh,

170
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,720
that in the case of France,

171
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:41,940
my a friend Maurice Og,

172
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:42,640
you know,

173
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,200
has called the second republic.

174
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,630
That is 1848 to 18 of,

175
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,200
well fifth,

176
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,940
December 2nd,

177
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,800
1851 and really 1852,

178
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,280
uh,

179
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,540
the apprenticeship of the republic
because now you've got universal manhood,

180
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:56,141
suffrage.

181
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:57,310
All men can vote.

182
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:58,600
Lots of women want to vote tool,

183
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:00,160
but that it's not a dominant discourse,

184
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:01,150
but it's still important,

185
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,661
uh,

186
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:02,494
in Paris.

187
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,100
Um,

188
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:08,100
and so you have a politicization of
ordinary people and you have this in the

189
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:08,981
German states.

190
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:12,550
You have it in the Italian states
as well and you haven't Austria,

191
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,593
Hungary,

192
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:13,990
um,

193
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,190
in the case of lost you're hungry.

194
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:15,700
Cause then you've got,

195
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:15,881
you know,

196
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:17,560
Hungarians putting four claims,

197
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:20,150
special claims within
the Hasbrook domains and,

198
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,320
and the national question
surfaces in central Europe.

199
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,040
Uh,

200
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,873
and in,

201
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,151
uh,

202
00:05:25,151 --> 00:05:27,910
in Italy where people can
imagine a unifying Italy,

203
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:28,870
a unified Italy,

204
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:31,360
which would mean you have to get rid
of the Austrians basically there.

205
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:34,180
And you can read about
what happened subsequently.

206
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,260
But so you have these,

207
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:35,710
these,

208
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,200
these people putting forth their claims.

209
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:40,210
And so you have this
remarkable politicization.

210
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,680
In the case of Paris,

211
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,011
you know,

212
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:43,240
the barricades go up,

213
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,830
which happened in February.

214
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,900
And then the June days follow,

215
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:47,501
which is a sort of a,

216
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:51,220
basically a class war in which
lots of people get killed,

217
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:51,940
uh,

218
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,950
and put in prison and massive,

219
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:54,581
massive,

220
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:55,090
uh,

221
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:55,480
uh,

222
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,900
unrest in the law three days in June,

223
00:05:59,900 --> 00:05:59,901
1848.

224
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:03,200
And that's a much more violent
confrontation and telling confrontation.

225
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:08,410
Then the initial revolutionary seizure
of power by groups who don't necessarily

226
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:10,100
agree on what's going to happen.

227
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,780
But in the case of France,

228
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:12,270
which is a,

229
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:12,891
again,

230
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:13,940
the best documented,

231
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:18,470
you've got all of these newspapers that
begin publishing because now suddenly

232
00:06:18,471 --> 00:06:21,650
you can publish things and you've
got all these political clubs.

233
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:23,270
Just as an 1848,

234
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:24,950
you've got Neil Jacobin clubs,

235
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:25,560
you've got,

236
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:25,970
you know,

237
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,110
clubs of women,

238
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:27,770
uh,

239
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,350
that you've got the club of
the two sexes as it's called.

240
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:30,760
Uh,

241
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,030
and,

242
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,160
and so this beef becomes a way of,

243
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:33,311
of,

244
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:35,240
of politicizing ordinary people.

245
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,750
So when men go to the polls in 1848,

246
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,090
I in April for the first time,

247
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:42,950
and they elect a relatively,

248
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,053
um,

249
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,050
conservative indeed monarchists
leaning National Assembly,

250
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:49,070
but they do so with,

251
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:49,371
with,

252
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:50,000
uh,

253
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,570
uh,

254
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,240
with a considerable
knowledge about what the,

255
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,561
what,

256
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:53,780
what,

257
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:53,931
you know,

258
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:54,741
what they want.

259
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:54,891
I mean,

260
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:56,000
they want school teachers,

261
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:57,560
they want credit available.

262
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:58,490
Uh,

263
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:58,731
you know,

264
00:06:58,731 --> 00:06:59,870
they want the right to vote.

265
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,150
And so this politicization or
the apprenticeship of republic,

266
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,400
it would finally be,

267
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,930
be permanent.

268
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:07,730
Starting in the 1870s,

269
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:08,540
uh,

270
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,060
is one of the most important aspects of,

271
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,140
of the revolution.

272
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,430
The same thing of the Russian revolution,

273
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:14,600
which I'll come back and talk about.

274
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:14,901
You've got,

275
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:15,041
you know,

276
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:15,950
you've got Mensheviks,

277
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:16,880
you got Bolsheviks,

278
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:18,890
you've got socialist revolutionaries.

279
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:20,570
These are three big radical groups.

280
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,230
Uh,

281
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,420
you've got constitutional democrats.

282
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:23,901
Uh,

283
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,160
you've got monarchists,

284
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:28,220
you've got people who want the czar and
have all the power that he had before,

285
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:31,040
and a lock off the heads of those people
who are against him and that kind of

286
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:31,580
thing.

287
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,150
So,

288
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,540
uh,

289
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,370
and then the case of
the Russian revolution,

290
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:39,430
how you get from the February revolution
to October when the Bolsheviks seized

291
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:40,221
power is,

292
00:07:40,221 --> 00:07:41,750
is really very fascinating.

293
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,530
Um,

294
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,660
so that's just the way of
thinking about revolution.

295
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:46,070
And you can think about
other revolutions that,

296
00:07:46,071 --> 00:07:46,820
you know,

297
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,300
uh,

298
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:47,720
but,

299
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,320
uh,

300
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,520
the point is that it,

301
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:49,911
that,

302
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:54,911
that the revolution as a
process it's brings into a,

303
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:56,450
brings into play,

304
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:56,880
uh,

305
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,510
the aspirations of a lot more people.

306
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,590
And in the case,

307
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,670
the French case,

308
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,450
uh,

309
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,000
which I,

310
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,010
which is fascinating,

311
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:05,840
is what begins as kind of an urban,

312
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,270
it's her middleclass revolution.

313
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:10,610
And people fought by artisans as usual,

314
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,090
uh,

315
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,440
who want the right to vote.

316
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,770
And the up in December,

317
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,540
1851 after Napoleon's nephew,

318
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,880
Louis Napoleon Bonaparte,

319
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:21,080
Louis Napoleon Bonaparte,

320
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,090
who had become good old Napoleon third,

321
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:23,960
not so good old,

322
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,620
but he destroys the republic where he
completes the process of repression that

323
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:28,221
he'd already,

324
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:28,730
uh,

325
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,180
as President France elected
on the 10th of December,

326
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,013
1848 initiated.

327
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:33,650
Um,

328
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,300
but that very ordinary people,

329
00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:36,140
peasants,

330
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:36,561
uh,

331
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:37,430
for the most part,

332
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:40,400
but also rural artisans and
particularly in the south,

333
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,770
and not necessarily
speaking French at all,

334
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,520
rise up to try to defend the
republic or what they call it,

335
00:08:46,521 --> 00:08:47,320
a lot better.

336
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,580
Uh,

337
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,650
the beautiful one,

338
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,420
uh,

339
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:49,600
uh,

340
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,620
against the rape as they called it,

341
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,100
uh,

342
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,550
uh,

343
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,210
by,

344
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:53,600
uh,

345
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,390
by the repressive apparatus
centered in Paris.

346
00:08:57,391 --> 00:08:58,141
And so this,

347
00:08:58,141 --> 00:08:58,950
this rural,

348
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,090
there's urban revolution ends up with
over 100,000 people taking arms in the

349
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:06,120
largest national instruction
in France in the 19th century,

350
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:11,300
trying to defend the republic against
its abolition by Louis Napoleon Bonaparte

351
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:12,750
who would not be,

352
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,750
would not be able to stand for a second
term as president of the republic.

353
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,260
And that's really fascinating.

354
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:20,070
Especially,

355
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,311
Jeez,

356
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:20,851
a long time ago,

357
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,100
I used to read all these
interrogations of people,

358
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:24,720
including what the uncle or great,

359
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:24,931
great,

360
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,340
great uncle of one of our neighbors,

361
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:27,070
you know,

362
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,800
and it's being translated from,

363
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:29,941
from Oak,

364
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:30,540
see Tom,

365
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:30,931
which is,

366
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:31,081
you know,

367
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:34,740
the language of that part of the south
in the French by some translators.

368
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:35,730
He's being interrogated.

369
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:37,530
When did you join the secret society?

370
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,490
When did,

371
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,550
who did you initiate into
the secret society to defend,

372
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,160
you know,

373
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,200
defend the republic,

374
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,370
the social and,

375
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,091
uh,

376
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:45,540
the,

377
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,480
the democratic and social republic,

378
00:09:47,481 --> 00:09:50,400
a social republic that's going to
provide more things to more people,

379
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:50,791
et Cetera,

380
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:51,270
et cetera.

381
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:51,991
Fascinating.

382
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,730
The politicization of this.

383
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,840
Now in the case of,

384
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:55,111
of,

385
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:58,020
of Germany and Italy,

386
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,123
um,

387
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,580
it,

388
00:09:59,580 --> 00:09:59,791
you know,

389
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:00,041
it's a,

390
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,380
it's a different kind of,

391
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:02,130
of,

392
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:02,641
of,

393
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:03,290
um,

394
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:03,440
uh,

395
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,680
of revolution.

396
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:06,640
It still had its kind of liberal and,

397
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,670
and democratic component.

398
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,750
Um,

399
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,830
but you had this scene,

400
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:11,461
for example,

401
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:11,600
in the,

402
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,361
in Frankfurt,

403
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,620
in the Frankford parliament,

404
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:14,454
which was this,

405
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:14,881
you know,

406
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:15,691
sort of basically,

407
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:16,190
uh,

408
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:16,350
uh,

409
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,350
a lot of professors and lawyers debating
long into the night in Saint Paul's

410
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:21,810
Church.

411
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:22,050
You know,

412
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,380
and they imagine the
unification of Germany,

413
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:25,951
uh,

414
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:26,790
what they called them,

415
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,980
the spring time of the peoples,

416
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:29,461
uh,

417
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:30,360
that Germany,

418
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,520
the German states in which pressure,

419
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:32,850
you know,

420
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,180
sacs knee a Bavaria were
where the inadvertent Berg,

421
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,010
where the most important of these states.

422
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,580
Um,

423
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,990
but all these other little states,

424
00:10:39,991 --> 00:10:41,790
two are going to be unified along,

425
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,590
um,

426
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:42,850
uh,

427
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,130
a liberal ospices.

428
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:44,551
And of course,

429
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:45,480
they were just dreaming.

430
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,141
Uh,

431
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:48,000
and in the end they
were kind of dismissed.

432
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:48,580
Uh,

433
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,320
uh,

434
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:49,531
Eh,

435
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:49,861
you know,

436
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:50,720
as a,

437
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:54,240
a servant who was not
wanting to be kept on by,

438
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:54,960
by the,

439
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,370
at the big house anymore.

440
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:56,760
Uh,

441
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,960
they're sort of dismissed,

442
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,970
but they debate far into the night.

443
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:00,541
Uh,

444
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,900
and the significance of all of this
is when you read the chapter on,

445
00:11:03,901 --> 00:11:06,120
please do on the second Republican,

446
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,080
you see what happens in the,

447
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:12,081
in the case of the German states is that
when Germany would be unified and that

448
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:16,800
unification is proclaimed in January,

449
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,430
uh,

450
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,610
1871 in Versailles,

451
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:22,170
in the chateau Versailles,

452
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,910
after the Franco Prussian war,

453
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,760
it would not be a liberal unification.

454
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,470
It would not be a Germany,

455
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:29,400
United by,

456
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,070
by lawyers and professors,

457
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:32,820
uh,

458
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,830
meeting in a frock for church,

459
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:35,640
uh,

460
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,730
with what would become
eventually the German flag,

461
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,910
the colors of it through
hanging all around the rafters.

462
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,391
Uh,

463
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:44,340
it would be unified as Bismark,

464
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:49,341
accurately put it by blood and
iron in the context of depression.

465
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,860
Uh,

466
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,140
aristocracy,

467
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,010
the nobles,

468
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,940
the Yonkers,

469
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,060
a term you already know,

470
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:55,720
Yonkers,

471
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,021
j.

472
00:11:56,021 --> 00:11:57,400
U.

473
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:57,400
N.

474
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:57,400
K.

475
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:57,400
E.

476
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:57,400
R.

477
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:57,670
S,

478
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,720
the Prussian Nobles.

479
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,710
Um,

480
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,830
and that basically unified Germany,

481
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,251
uh,

482
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:05,620
would be as some wag once put it,

483
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,370
uh,

484
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,980
an army with a state trailing behind it.

485
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:09,851
Uh,

486
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:12,340
and Germany would not be a republic.

487
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:13,450
It would be an empire.

488
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,321
Uh,

489
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:17,920
and because one of the things that happens
with empires is an emperor's can do

490
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:20,770
whatever they damn well
please just the czar's Ken.

491
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,590
And you might've had an assembly
called though high stock,

492
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,560
which had a lot of the
which socialists became the,

493
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:28,810
the leaders are the most dominant,

494
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,440
uh,

495
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,780
it numerically by 1914,

496
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:36,100
but power rests in the hands
of a thoroughly irresponsible,

497
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,930
intellectually lazy.

498
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,270
So mad cap,

499
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:39,580
uh,

500
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,390
ridiculous guy who happens
to be the Kaiser Wilhelm.

501
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,850
The second and so over the long run,

502
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:48,580
the cost to Europe of that fact,

503
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:49,420
uh,

504
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,070
would be in retrospect,

505
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,780
given what happens in the 20th century,

506
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:54,280
which is the one that follows the 19th,

507
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,210
uh,

508
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,890
would be one thing that,

509
00:12:56,891 --> 00:13:01,540
that historians would go back and
say very a very obvious things is,

510
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,070
are cliches like,

511
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:03,760
well,

512
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,200
in 1848,

513
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:05,920
uh,

514
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,150
history in Germany reached its
turning point and failed to turn,

515
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:10,810
uh,

516
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:14,200
that Germany unification
would not come because of,

517
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,043
um,

518
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,720
because of professors and,

519
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,500
and Liberals and merchants in
Homburg and this sort of thing.

520
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,220
And that the middle class is a German
middle classes would in a way abdicate

521
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:28,000
their political responsibility and
not having much political power.

522
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:30,220
And the state would be
really run by a bunch of,

523
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:30,820
uh,

524
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,181
of,

525
00:13:31,181 --> 00:13:31,540
uh,

526
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:36,070
Younkers a of military officers with
dueling scars and veterans of the

527
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:37,090
fraternity's of the,

528
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,720
uh,

529
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,120
of,

530
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,820
uh,

531
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,520
uh,

532
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:39,821
uh,

533
00:13:39,821 --> 00:13:40,240
of,

534
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,600
uh,

535
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:40,751
you know,

536
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:43,110
the Prussian universities
and pressure was,

537
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:43,721
isn't just,

538
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:48,470
or it wasn't just Pomerania in
Brandenburg and sort of the marshes of,

539
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:48,941
of,

540
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:49,721
of northern,

541
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:50,320
uh,

542
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,720
uh,

543
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,600
of North Eastern Europe,

544
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,150
but Prussia also controlled the Rheinland.

545
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:55,810
Uh,

546
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:56,481
but the,

547
00:13:56,481 --> 00:13:57,840
the kind of magnates of,

548
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,530
of industrializing,

549
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,000
uh,

550
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,160
uh,

551
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,880
pressure,

552
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,810
we're not going to be the ones who are
running the show in the case of Italy.

553
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:05,051
I mean,

554
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:07,000
the news you could read
about that too is that,

555
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:07,630
uh,

556
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:07,960
you know,

557
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,590
there are a lot of people running around
saying long live United Italy and all

558
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:12,250
of this business.

559
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,510
But that was to be very hard to,

560
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:17,610
because in order to unify
Italy under any auspices I,

561
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,930
most people wanted under liberal ospices,

562
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,770
um,

563
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,470
you have to get rid of who you have to
get rid of the Austrians because the

564
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:25,540
Austrians control much of,

565
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:28,900
almost all of northern Italy
and much of central Italy too.

566
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,430
So there are lots of,

567
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,610
of impediments to Italian unification.

568
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,380
Uh,

569
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,213
none of the,

570
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,810
not the least of which was the
fact that the vast majority of,

571
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:38,690
of people in,

572
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,870
in Italy did not speak Italian.

573
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:42,040
That itself was not a,

574
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:42,880
uh,

575
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,331
not a,

576
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:43,700
you know,

577
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:43,931
a,

578
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:45,610
a major impediment.

579
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:46,050
But it,

580
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:46,410
you know,

581
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:51,040
I guess it was to only about four or 5%
of the people in Italy spoke what now is

582
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,273
to be Italian,

583
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,570
which I guess is,

584
00:14:53,571 --> 00:14:54,500
I don't speak Italian,

585
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:58,940
but I guess that's essentially
the language of Tuscany
or the area around around

586
00:14:58,941 --> 00:14:59,774
Florence.

587
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,970
And they spoke all sorts
of other dialects and,

588
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:02,141
and,

589
00:15:02,141 --> 00:15:06,200
and the Tuscan language was virtually
unknown in the south of Italy or

590
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:08,150
insistently and was identified with,

591
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:08,510
you know,

592
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:12,350
sort of money grabbing tax collectors
coming down from the north.

593
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:13,070
And so,

594
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:13,640
uh,

595
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,361
after the,

596
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:15,690
the tide of the,

597
00:15:15,691 --> 00:15:19,580
the springtime of the people or somebody
once called the great illusion also,

598
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,330
uh,

599
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,590
of 1848,

600
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:23,180
after that tide had passed,

601
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:24,380
what you had is still,

602
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,250
uh,

603
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:25,431
uh,

604
00:15:25,431 --> 00:15:25,651
the,

605
00:15:25,651 --> 00:15:26,390
the,

606
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:26,630
uh,

607
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,251
lots of,

608
00:15:27,251 --> 00:15:27,490
of,

609
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:31,010
of fervin hopes and dreams that
Italy was going to be unified,

610
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:31,730
um,

611
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,140
along liberal ospices.

612
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:37,340
And indeed that is what happens even
though it's a monarchy and unification

613
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,460
comes because of basically the expansion
of the state of Piedmont Sardinia,

614
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:44,720
which was that most influenced by,

615
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:49,490
by the French wave in the times
of the French revolution and of,

616
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:50,241
of Napoleon.

617
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,520
And also the wealthiest part of Italy,

618
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,060
uh,

619
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:53,290
in,

620
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,800
in the case of Austria,

621
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:55,731
Austria,

622
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:56,564
Hungary.

623
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,291
Well,

624
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:57,471
I mean,

625
00:15:57,471 --> 00:15:59,330
there's a long story and
you can read about it,

626
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:00,920
but the springtime of the people's meant,

627
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:01,850
uh,

628
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,820
the dreams first of number
of nationalities now talk
about nationalism and the

629
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:10,460
weaker to who suddenly think that
now they too will have their time.

630
00:16:10,461 --> 00:16:10,641
And,

631
00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:11,530
and the somebody,

632
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:11,991
people,

633
00:16:11,991 --> 00:16:15,710
a bunch of check nationalists were
sitting in a room rather like this and

634
00:16:15,711 --> 00:16:16,670
somebody looked up and said,

635
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:17,091
Jesus,

636
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:18,800
if this ceiling collapses,

637
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:20,750
that's the end of the
Czech national movement.

638
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:21,770
Uh,

639
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,180
and two or something to that.

640
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,650
So the springtime of the peoples,

641
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,400
uh,

642
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,660
would not bring,

643
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,300
you know,

644
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,360
we're not bring an
independent check state.

645
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:30,260
It wouldn't bring a,

646
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:30,441
you know,

647
00:16:30,441 --> 00:16:33,170
a checklist of lochea
which only lasts til,

648
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:33,890
uh,

649
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:34,580
uh,

650
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,660
1993,

651
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,980
despite with John Mccain thinks,

652
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:37,760
uh,

653
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,593
um,

654
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,021
you know,

655
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:40,790
it doesn't come told 19,

656
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:41,890
uh,

657
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,360
1918 after world war one.

658
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:44,571
But,

659
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:46,430
but in the Austrian Guerin empire,

660
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:46,940
you know,

661
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,660
everybody says,

662
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:47,951
well,

663
00:16:47,951 --> 00:16:48,381
you know what,

664
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:51,600
what if we have a independent
Felicia or what if we,

665
00:16:51,601 --> 00:16:51,980
you know,

666
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,721
Poland is,

667
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,500
is independent in the parts of,

668
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,131
of,

669
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:55,580
uh,

670
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,460
of a Russian and Austrian Poland.

671
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,150
Uh,

672
00:16:59,150 --> 00:16:59,540
uh,

673
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,710
we'll be independent.

674
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:01,010
But these,

675
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:01,641
these are,

676
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:02,960
these are pipe dreams and,

677
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:03,251
and,

678
00:17:03,251 --> 00:17:03,681
and,

679
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:04,130
uh,

680
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:04,401
uh,

681
00:17:04,401 --> 00:17:05,900
and national awareness and,

682
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:09,380
and great power of politics will mean
that this isn't going to happen until

683
00:17:09,381 --> 00:17:09,741
later.

684
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:10,101
Pull them,

685
00:17:10,101 --> 00:17:13,850
becomes independent in 1918 for
reasons that you already know.

686
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,531
And that the,

687
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:14,691
the,

688
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:16,700
when the chill of reaction,

689
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,091
I mean,

690
00:17:17,091 --> 00:17:18,020
revolution,

691
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,100
reaction,

692
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:20,060
repression,

693
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:20,870
uh,

694
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:21,471
is the,

695
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:23,400
is what really happens in the,

696
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:27,260
that's the theme running through the
whole thing besides the big hopes of,

697
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:32,000
of the spring of 1848
and the kind of Austrian,

698
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:32,834
uh,

699
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:36,740
the Austrian imperial system a run.

700
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,310
And I'll come back and talk about Austria.

701
00:17:38,311 --> 00:17:39,260
Hungary quite a bit,

702
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,900
run in German in the polyglot,

703
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,050
Austrian Hungarian Empire where
they're at least 15 major languages,

704
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:45,950
uh,

705
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,690
will be the story of Austria,

706
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,670
Hungary in the 1850.

707
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,140
And of course the Hungarians get,

708
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:52,531
get,

709
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:52,920
uh,

710
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,420
get separate status,

711
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,080
uh,

712
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,110
equal status in principle as of 18,

713
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:58,561
uh,

714
00:17:58,561 --> 00:17:59,760
1867.

715
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,500
And of course one of the strange,

716
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:02,251
not strange,

717
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:05,670
but one of the interesting things about
the Austrian gerund period is that it's

718
00:18:05,671 --> 00:18:10,671
an 1848 that friends funds Joseph
becomes emperor of Austria,

719
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:11,754
Hungary,

720
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,320
and he is in power until 1916.

721
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:21,650
He is around even longer than
Victoria than Queen Victoria.

722
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,770
Uh,

723
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:27,660
and I mean the world changes
in such dramatic ways
between riff between 1848 and

724
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:29,700
1916 when I was younger than you.

725
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,720
Um,

726
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,720
I was in Vienna for the first time and
I was sitting in some coffee shop as one

727
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:37,560
does there and a cafe,

728
00:18:37,561 --> 00:18:42,240
and this is a very old man started talking
to me and he had actually seen when

729
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:42,970
he was young,

730
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,610
had seen funds Yosef.

731
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,400
And that was the most amazing thing for
me to actually meet somebody who had

732
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:48,560
seen when he was a boyfriend.

733
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,050
Joseph.

734
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:49,201
I mean,

735
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:50,370
that's just extraordinary continuity.

736
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:50,911
But anyway,

737
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:51,690
that's another story.

738
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,040
Oster Henry's another story and it's an
interesting one and a that we're going

739
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:55,531
to come back to,

740
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:56,640
but I can't do that now.

741
00:18:56,641 --> 00:18:58,530
We've got to talk to go
back to the question of,

742
00:18:58,531 --> 00:18:58,861
of,

743
00:18:58,861 --> 00:18:59,610
of uh,

744
00:18:59,610 --> 00:18:59,830
of,

745
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,663
of England,

746
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,120
but,

747
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,670
but also another of the,

748
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,850
I mean of the legacies of this is that,

749
00:19:05,851 --> 00:19:06,031
you know,

750
00:19:06,031 --> 00:19:07,500
after this tide of reaction,

751
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:12,501
what it does is it sends waves of
political refugees to places like this.

752
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,130
Not New haven so much.

753
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,431
But yeah,

754
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:16,460
and there were some Italians
end up in new haven who,

755
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,050
Italian political refugees in that period,

756
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,650
but lots of Germans who are of course
thrown out of the German states,

757
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:23,580
uh,

758
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,110
and had better not come back.

759
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:28,890
They ended up where they end up in
Philadelphia or in New York and lots of

760
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:29,431
Irish,

761
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:29,531
well,

762
00:19:29,531 --> 00:19:30,630
I'm going to talk about it in a minute.

763
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,310
Ends up in obvious places,

764
00:19:32,311 --> 00:19:33,144
Boston,

765
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:33,900
New York,

766
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,830
those two above all,

767
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:36,000
but also Philadelphia.

768
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,380
And so the,

769
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:40,410
the glacial wave of
repression sends these people,

770
00:19:40,411 --> 00:19:41,244
a lot of them to,

771
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:41,500
uh,

772
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,660
the United States,

773
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,230
uh,

774
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:43,501
that,

775
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:45,210
that itself is an interesting stories.

776
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:45,751
So,

777
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:49,230
although the revolutions of 1848
failed and you should read about that,

778
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:49,801
please do.

779
00:19:49,801 --> 00:19:49,981
God,

780
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:50,701
I love this stuff.

781
00:19:50,701 --> 00:19:51,534
Talking about this,

782
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,080
uh,

783
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,270
the political legacies that they left our,

784
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:54,910
um,

785
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:55,450
you know,

786
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,270
extremely important and these,

787
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:02,540
these demands for political rights would
be something that would last for a very

788
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,550
long time.

789
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,350
And again,

790
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,520
to repeat into and this little
part of what we're doing home.

791
00:20:10,521 --> 00:20:13,050
My goodness now I,

792
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:16,920
that that German unification would come
under very different auspices that,

793
00:20:16,921 --> 00:20:21,630
that those than that of
the revolutionaries in 1848
what they wanted and that,

794
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,320
that the,

795
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:22,720
the,

796
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:22,900
the,

797
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,900
the king of Prussia rejects this crown
offered from the gutter as he called it

798
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:33,350
to unify Germany under a
liberal monarchical auspices.

799
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,520
That ain't going to happen and it doesn't.

800
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:36,683
Okay.

801
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,830
There's revolution and
all these places in 1848,

802
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,240
the big wave,

803
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,730
but why not in

804
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,440
or why not?

805
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,290
You probably already
know some of the answers.

806
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:50,891
Now,

807
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:51,850
the context,

808
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:52,100
uh,

809
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,880
they're really two major
context in all of this.

810
00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:00,230
The first is that the reform act
of 1832 opens the drawbridge,

811
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,700
puts down the drawbridge
and opens it to more voters.

812
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:04,780
More people can vote.

813
00:21:04,781 --> 00:21:05,530
Now,

814
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:05,860
uh,

815
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,310
again,

816
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:09,850
voting was based upon
property qualification.

817
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:10,983
Uh,

818
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:11,890
you,

819
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,371
you,

820
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:12,990
um,

821
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:13,580
uh,

822
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,260
uh,

823
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:14,951
I guess it was Fergus,

824
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:15,041
Oh,

825
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:15,290
con,

826
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:15,590
uh,

827
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,780
O'connor who was a,

828
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,320
uh,

829
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,130
Irish,

830
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:18,670
uh,

831
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:22,390
in move chartist and we'll
talk about in a minute.

832
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:22,880
Uh,

833
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,251
he,

834
00:21:23,251 --> 00:21:24,860
he didn't even have the right to a,

835
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,040
he is dis not disbarred,

836
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,000
but he's really tall,

837
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,440
thrown out of,

838
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,980
of parliament because it doesn't
make enough money in order to,

839
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:34,420
to actually qualify to vote himself.

840
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,050
Uh,

841
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:38,560
you could vote if you paid
x number of pounds in,

842
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:38,981
uh,

843
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:39,641
in shillings,

844
00:21:39,641 --> 00:21:40,720
in taxes.

845
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:41,320
Uh,

846
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,350
and so what happens is the 1832 opens up,

847
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,070
uh,

848
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:45,310
the,

849
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,440
the drawbridge and more people can vote.

850
00:21:47,441 --> 00:21:51,910
The political arena expands a little bit
in the same thing happens in France in

851
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:52,900
1830.

852
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,891
As you know,

853
00:21:53,891 --> 00:21:54,490
in France,

854
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,970
the revolution of 1830 doubled the
number of people that could vote.

855
00:21:57,971 --> 00:22:00,700
But it still leaves lots of
people on the outside looking in.

856
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:06,060
And in 1867 they would pass
a second reform bill that
lets more people in and an

857
00:22:06,681 --> 00:22:10,450
1884 they pass another one that
lets almost everybody in a,

858
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:15,370
except for I think a domestic servants
and and maybe rural proletarians I can't

859
00:22:15,371 --> 00:22:20,080
remember exactly but so what the political
arena is expanding and the point of

860
00:22:20,081 --> 00:22:20,551
this is,

861
00:22:20,551 --> 00:22:25,551
is expanding through reform that
Britain reforms and that the self image,

862
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,740
the self identity of the
free born Englishman tracing,

863
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:35,981
you know,

864
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:38,140
more or less at least in the imaginary,

865
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:42,190
I antecedents back to June 15th,

866
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,740
1215 at Runnymede near London.

867
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:49,770
The idea that the free born Englishman
has rights and that we British citizens,

868
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,170
our identity,

869
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,700
we reform.

870
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,950
We don't rebel.

871
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:01,750
And clearly as I will demonstrate in
a minute a drawing on the work of John

872
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,750
Belcher and other people to uh,

873
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:04,790
that what happens in,

874
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,091
in,

875
00:23:05,091 --> 00:23:10,091
in 1848 is when there might have
been a revolutionary moment in,

876
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:14,620
in Britain that France has sneezed in.

877
00:23:14,621 --> 00:23:18,310
Europe is catching a cold as they
like to say over and over again.

878
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,640
It doesn't come to a Britain,

879
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,790
but that British national identity,

880
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:30,150
like all national identities have
to be systematically reinvented and

881
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,140
reconstructed.

882
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:37,950
And that this happens in 1848
in subsequent years as well.

883
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,760
That the sense that we are
respectable and respectability,

884
00:23:42,761 --> 00:23:44,080
I've written up on the board,

885
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:44,770
uh,

886
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:45,603
that,

887
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:47,743
um,

888
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:48,201
uh,

889
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:52,100
it means reform and not revolution now.

890
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,410
Uh,

891
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:57,410
and that the aristocracy of labor
who were craftsmen and artisans slash

892
00:23:58,161 --> 00:24:03,161
craftsman who could be seen
walking through Hyde Park
with their ladies on their

893
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:07,850
arms wearing suits of
all things on Sundays,

894
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,790
that bourgeois respectability,

895
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:11,600
uh,

896
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,650
had a political,

897
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,260
uh,

898
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:13,511
uh,

899
00:24:13,511 --> 00:24:15,560
a political aspect of it too.

900
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,270
And so in 1848,

901
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,550
Britain does not,

902
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,480
uh,

903
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,890
w does not rebel.

904
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,640
Um,

905
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,350
now the other ad out more
about this in a minute,

906
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,011
the eye,

907
00:24:25,011 --> 00:24:27,930
the other context that of
course charters ism would,

908
00:24:27,931 --> 00:24:31,430
you should read about
now Chartis campaign.

909
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:36,860
There were campaigns to get ordinary
people to sign an enormous charter with

910
00:24:38,841 --> 00:24:41,270
millions and millions of names.

911
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,210
There's a too big waves
in the 1830s and forties.

912
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,970
And what they do is
they sign and they say,

913
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:47,271
Oh,

914
00:24:47,271 --> 00:24:48,090
humble,

915
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:48,341
we,

916
00:24:48,341 --> 00:24:49,400
we the humble,

917
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:51,200
poor we ordinary people.

918
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,880
We in treat you,

919
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:53,390
you know,

920
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,010
big time lords,

921
00:24:55,011 --> 00:25:00,011
property owners of great distinction
who are representing a property in

922
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:00,891
parliament.

923
00:25:00,891 --> 00:25:05,210
We entreat you to give us political
rights and they bring these petitions,

924
00:25:05,211 --> 00:25:06,380
these huge petitions.

925
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:10,010
They bring in them on wagons
signed by Zillions of people,

926
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:14,540
many of whom can only mark an x instead
of write their names and they bring them

927
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:17,180
to parliament in the rain as always.

928
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,890
And parliaments says,

929
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,341
Gee,

930
00:25:19,341 --> 00:25:19,851
thanks a lot.

931
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:20,840
We don't want to see that.

932
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:22,551
And then they say,

933
00:25:22,551 --> 00:25:23,810
oh well we'll do it again.

934
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:24,441
Oh Great.

935
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:26,420
Lords give us political rights.

936
00:25:26,421 --> 00:25:27,530
And so they sign,

937
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:27,981
you know,

938
00:25:27,981 --> 00:25:29,870
they don't pick up their blunder buses.

939
00:25:29,871 --> 00:25:31,080
They sign a,

940
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,060
in 1830,

941
00:25:32,061 --> 00:25:35,330
the French middleclass was more than
happy to turn the artisans loose on the

942
00:25:35,331 --> 00:25:38,570
street to fight their battles
for them for political reform.

943
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,530
And delicate was famous painting
liberty leads the people,

944
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,630
the bourgeois with his top hat.

945
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:45,380
Uh,

946
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,440
it doesn't have any in
this romantic picture.

947
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:53,620
Romanticized view of revolution does not
have any place there because the bush

948
00:25:53,691 --> 00:25:53,961
was,

949
00:25:53,961 --> 00:25:57,200
he does not fight unless you
consider art master artisans,

950
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:57,800
you know,

951
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,880
petty bourgeois.

952
00:25:59,090 --> 00:25:59,781
But in England,

953
00:25:59,781 --> 00:26:00,890
that's never going to happen.

954
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,580
And the charters campaign
remains respectable.

955
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:05,301
It is,

956
00:26:05,301 --> 00:26:05,660
uh,

957
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,020
uh,

958
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,620
it is,

959
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:06,941
it,

960
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:07,081
you know,

961
00:26:07,081 --> 00:26:10,030
it's class based to the extent
that most people who signed the,

962
00:26:10,031 --> 00:26:13,070
the chartist petitions
are ordinary people.

963
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:13,811
But what,

964
00:26:13,811 --> 00:26:14,361
what really,

965
00:26:14,361 --> 00:26:16,790
they saw themselves as moral reformers.

966
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:18,410
They see themselves as trying to do,

967
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,090
and it cuts across class lines.

968
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,600
They're trying to get the
government to do the right thing,

969
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,730
to pass more reforms.

970
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:26,120
The,

971
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:26,301
the,

972
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:31,301
the reform act of 1832 was passed by a
conservative government because they knew

973
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:34,640
that negatively it was gonna it
was going to have to be passed,

974
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,810
or who knows?

975
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:38,000
It would create more
lords in order to end.

976
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:38,840
You'd have these sort of,

977
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,790
not real lords were there.

978
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:43,800
So the bill gets passed and so it's
passed by a conservative government.

979
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,850
And then everybody says,

980
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:45,001
oh,

981
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:45,661
well we British,

982
00:26:45,661 --> 00:26:46,440
we reform,

983
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,790
we've opened up the drawbridge more.

984
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,020
More people can vote.

985
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:49,411
Now.

986
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:54,411
There was a component of Chartis who
are called physical force chartists and

987
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:55,110
the,

988
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,411
and they,

989
00:26:55,411 --> 00:26:55,890
you know,

990
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,060
they're not so sure that,

991
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:57,300
that,

992
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:57,480
that,

993
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:57,721
that,

994
00:26:57,721 --> 00:26:59,820
that reform without
revolution as possible,

995
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:04,560
but they are a minority
within the charter movement.

996
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,720
They are a very small minority,

997
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:08,580
the physical force charters.

998
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:14,090
So what you've got in 1848 is you
got two things that are going on.

999
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,081
First of all,

1000
00:27:16,081 --> 00:27:16,251
you,

1001
00:27:16,251 --> 00:27:17,820
you don't have a revolution.

1002
00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:19,530
There's this big date in,

1003
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,190
um,

1004
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,001
in April,

1005
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:22,290
I think it's April 10th,

1006
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:24,450
where there's going to be
this huge march in London.

1007
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,840
So what the government does is it
deputizes 25,000 men of property,

1008
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,850
they become sheriffs to become,

1009
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:33,450
you know,

1010
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,091
I don't know what you call them.

1011
00:27:34,091 --> 00:27:34,201
Yeah.

1012
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:34,771
I get sheriffs,

1013
00:27:34,771 --> 00:27:35,430
I guess.

1014
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,910
And Louis Napoleon Bonaparte
who happened to be in,

1015
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:38,790
you know,

1016
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,200
we had not yet returned to France.

1017
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:40,750
He was worth,

1018
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:40,930
it was,

1019
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,050
it was actually deputized as a sheriff.

1020
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,080
And so the business people in the city,

1021
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:46,621
which is what,

1022
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:46,831
you know,

1023
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,130
the financial capital of,

1024
00:27:48,131 --> 00:27:48,460
of the,

1025
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,010
the overlooks the British empire,

1026
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,600
I was increasingly called,

1027
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:56,790
they come with their hunting rifles to
work and they get those file cabinets

1028
00:27:56,791 --> 00:28:00,450
ready to barricade the door and with
their rifles and they're going to blow

1029
00:28:00,451 --> 00:28:02,880
apart anybody who rises up,

1030
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:03,600
uh,

1031
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,940
and would challenge a British,

1032
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:06,730
uh,

1033
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:07,290
uh,

1034
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,900
who had tried to bring revolution to,

1035
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,630
uh,

1036
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,280
uh,

1037
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:11,491
to,

1038
00:28:11,491 --> 00:28:12,001
to Britain it,

1039
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:13,800
and there's 25,000 of these people,

1040
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,610
uh,

1041
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,020
and the number of marchers was,

1042
00:28:16,021 --> 00:28:16,711
was far,

1043
00:28:16,711 --> 00:28:17,850
far small to that.

1044
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:20,340
And it's a smaller than that
and it's a very peaceful march.

1045
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,960
There is no revolution in Britain in 1848.

1046
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,780
But if there hadn't been a revolution,

1047
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,370
where would it come from?

1048
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:29,970
From,

1049
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:33,790
from where would the
revolutionaries ranks have come?

1050
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,730
And that is the interesting question.

1051
00:28:35,731 --> 00:28:39,900
That's the by far the most interesting
question and all of this because what I

1052
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:43,410
said before about 1848 helps the British,

1053
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:44,723
um,

1054
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,790
re invent or reconfigure,

1055
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:52,791
reconstruct their identity that there
has to be an unwanted other there who's

1056
00:28:54,481 --> 00:28:55,710
frightening them,

1057
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:01,040
who makes them convinced even more
that they're doing it the right way.

1058
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,220
And,

1059
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:02,610
um,

1060
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:07,350
I alluded before when we talked about
the British identity in the 18th century,

1061
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:10,920
I said with the British
in the 17th century,

1062
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:15,921
what they weren't help determine who
they thought they were and what they

1063
00:29:16,141 --> 00:29:18,510
weren't was absolutist.

1064
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:23,190
They reform what they weren't with Kath,

1065
00:29:23,191 --> 00:29:24,780
not they're not Catholic.

1066
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,980
And the biggest riots in the 18th
century where the Gordon riots,

1067
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,810
which were anti-catholic riots,

1068
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,820
they are not the French,

1069
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,410
not at all.

1070
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:39,740
France has a centralized state and France
is full of Catholics and many of the

1071
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:41,410
Protestants who would,

1072
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:46,630
who had left France after the
relocation of the edict of not in 1685,

1073
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:47,980
uh,

1074
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,610
come not just to the Netherlands,

1075
00:29:51,611 --> 00:29:54,280
but come to a Britain as well.

1076
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:59,910
So this may have already tipped you off
on who is the unwanted dangerous other

1077
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,010
in the British,

1078
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,150
particularly upperclass,

1079
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:07,450
but not just a upperclass imaginary.

1080
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:11,890
And they are the Irish Irish.

1081
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:17,430
And so what happens in 1848
and the subsequent years
is that British nationalism

1082
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,720
is redefined again or reinfused with a
sense of what we are not and we are not

1083
00:30:26,141 --> 00:30:28,510
Catholic and we are not Irish.

1084
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,440
And so if there was going to be a
revolution in April or any other month in

1085
00:30:35,681 --> 00:30:36,940
1848,

1086
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:42,370
the components would be from the point
of view of the upper classes and from the

1087
00:30:42,371 --> 00:30:43,300
police,

1088
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,000
the Irish and um,

1089
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:53,590
and groups of physical force chartists
or revolutionaries who might join forces.

1090
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:02,470
Now Chartis look to Irish
to get them to sign a,

1091
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,440
the big petitions they see them as allies.

1092
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,380
And remember because of
the of the Irish famine,

1093
00:31:08,381 --> 00:31:11,020
potato famine in the 1840s,

1094
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,500
that tens of thousands of Irishmen,

1095
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,920
hundreds of thousands of Irishmen.

1096
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:17,440
Indeed,

1097
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:17,861
I think the,

1098
00:31:17,861 --> 00:31:18,910
I have it in the book somewhere,

1099
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:23,530
but the number of people who leave Ireland
in 1840 is in the millions along with

1100
00:31:23,531 --> 00:31:25,120
all those who just simply die,

1101
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:25,781
you know,

1102
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:30,781
die in the fields and they go to where
they go to the United States and they go

1103
00:31:31,481 --> 00:31:32,680
to England,

1104
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,050
particularly Liverpool.

1105
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,330
It's why I Liverpool,

1106
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,340
this has nothing to with
anything we have while Vec,

1107
00:31:39,341 --> 00:31:42,910
but the Liverpool soccer team
is very much perceived as,

1108
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:43,301
you know,

1109
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,550
a Catholic team in the way that in,

1110
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:46,870
in Glasgow,

1111
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,201
uh,

1112
00:31:47,201 --> 00:31:52,201
that the Celtics are the Catholic team
because so many Irish immigrants went to

1113
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,400
Glasgow and to Scotland.

1114
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,770
And the Rangers are the Protestant team,

1115
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,020
very anti-catholic.

1116
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:00,640
And that's why these people
were brawling in 1900.

1117
00:32:00,641 --> 00:32:03,180
They've played before
100,000 people in 1900,

1118
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:06,010
100,000 people at a
soccer game in about 1900.

1119
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:07,630
And they hate each other's
guts and they still do.

1120
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,560
Um,

1121
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,380
so all these Irish are
going to London also,

1122
00:32:11,381 --> 00:32:13,360
and they live in the Irish neighborhoods.

1123
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:17,560
And so from the point of
view of the ruling classes,

1124
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:17,980
uh,

1125
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,100
and from the point of view of British
nationalism in front of the point of view

1126
00:32:21,101 --> 00:32:22,150
of the police,

1127
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,460
the possibility was there that the
Irish can federation who are extremely

1128
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:28,294
militant,

1129
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,170
uh,

1130
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:29,471
uh,

1131
00:32:29,471 --> 00:32:31,060
one of the important Irish leaders,

1132
00:32:31,061 --> 00:32:32,200
Daniel O'Connor,

1133
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,000
a O'Connell,

1134
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:36,190
Daniel O'connell who is in the book,

1135
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:36,460
uh,

1136
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,950
he dies in 1847 but you,

1137
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,990
you've got these more people
that are far more militant,

1138
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:42,820
uh,

1139
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,280
uh,

1140
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:43,880
who,

1141
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,210
uh,

1142
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,290
who believe in the only rate.

1143
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,440
Many of them believed that the only way
Ireland is ever going to be independent

1144
00:32:48,441 --> 00:32:50,750
is by rising up and rebelling.

1145
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,490
And that's what happens,

1146
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:53,120
isn't it?

1147
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,700
That's what eventually happens.

1148
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,420
So they were right about that.

1149
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,570
But what if they start rebelling in 1848?

1150
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,250
And what if you had,

1151
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,001
for example,

1152
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:02,400
you had the,

1153
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,970
your basic Peter Lou
massacre as they called it,

1154
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:05,650
uh,

1155
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,580
playing on the word Waterloo where the,

1156
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:08,030
you know,

1157
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:11,240
British troops shoot down a well dressed,

1158
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:11,840
uh,

1159
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,190
demonstrators,

1160
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:13,700
uh,

1161
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,990
in Manchester.

1162
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:15,711
Uh,

1163
00:33:15,711 --> 00:33:16,131
what is it,

1164
00:33:16,131 --> 00:33:17,840
1817 or 1816,

1165
00:33:17,841 --> 00:33:18,561
1817.

1166
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:19,400
I don't remember.

1167
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,270
Um,

1168
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,550
what if the people who said,

1169
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:27,470
we ain't ever going to get anywhere if
we don't do what our French colleagues

1170
00:33:27,471 --> 00:33:30,710
have done and that is take
arms against these people.

1171
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:36,100
So there is a potential for an alliance
between militant in the physical force

1172
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:37,760
chartist movement,

1173
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,400
uh,

1174
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:38,900
you know,

1175
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,160
other radicals,

1176
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:40,490
uh,

1177
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,210
and,

1178
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:41,630
uh,

1179
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:45,920
members of the Irish confederation
now because it never happens.

1180
00:33:45,921 --> 00:33:46,131
I mean,

1181
00:33:46,131 --> 00:33:47,360
there are a few marches,

1182
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:48,470
there's a few skirmishes,

1183
00:33:48,471 --> 00:33:53,180
but basically the only news
is no news does not mean that,

1184
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:53,860
uh,

1185
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,120
that,

1186
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,290
that,

1187
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:54,621
that,

1188
00:33:54,621 --> 00:33:55,131
that,

1189
00:33:55,131 --> 00:33:55,964
uh,

1190
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:59,070
that this wouldn't have a big
effect on the reinvention of,

1191
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,560
of British nationalism.

1192
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,930
I'm British self identity.

1193
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:06,560
And what do I mean by that here?

1194
00:34:06,561 --> 00:34:10,370
One of the interesting things is that a
John Belcher told me a long time ago on

1195
00:34:10,371 --> 00:34:11,060
a train,

1196
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,630
uh,

1197
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,463
in Germany,

1198
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:12,951
uh,

1199
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:15,020
from coming back from a
conference in Verse Berg,

1200
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:20,030
that there were more boxes of
documents in the public record office,

1201
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:20,550
uh,

1202
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:25,550
about their surveillance of ships coming
into the ports of Port Smith and above

1203
00:34:25,641 --> 00:34:29,510
all Liverpool than there were any other
documents about any other aspect of

1204
00:34:29,511 --> 00:34:30,500
1848.

1205
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,873
Why,

1206
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:32,923
what are they doing?

1207
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:38,700
Where is the potential insurgency or
infusion of militants for Irish coming

1208
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:40,034
from?

1209
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,900
It's coming from the United States.

1210
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:45,020
And one of the interesting
things about this,

1211
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:48,320
and you could see also in
that time of the troubles,

1212
00:34:48,321 --> 00:34:48,531
you know,

1213
00:34:48,531 --> 00:34:50,310
in the 1970 I was in Ireland,

1214
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:53,840
ironically when they all
started up again in 1969,

1215
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,183
um,

1216
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:55,530
uh,

1217
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,250
that,

1218
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:56,510
uh,

1219
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,140
you know,

1220
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,100
when all this,

1221
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,280
there was at a time they
were really worried about,

1222
00:35:01,281 --> 00:35:01,790
about,

1223
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,860
about the IRA and there
was a lot to worry about.

1224
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:08,210
Then the IRA was getting all sorts of
money from a Irish pubs in New York and

1225
00:35:08,211 --> 00:35:08,810
Boston,

1226
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:09,770
just tons of money,

1227
00:35:09,771 --> 00:35:12,560
big bucks all the time to buy weapons.

1228
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:13,400
Um,

1229
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,090
now,

1230
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:14,923
uh,

1231
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,580
in 1848,

1232
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:19,400
one of the interesting things that Belcher
and other people have discovered is

1233
00:35:19,401 --> 00:35:21,260
that the real Irish militants,

1234
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,700
the most committed were Irish immigrants,

1235
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:29,990
immigrants to immigrants from Ireland
living in Boston and New York.

1236
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:35,650
And what they had done is taken the
notion of American liberty in quotes and

1237
00:35:35,811 --> 00:35:36,051
saying,

1238
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:36,884
all right,

1239
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,650
our role will be that of the French
revolution to carry liberty in principal

1240
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:42,600
across the borders and Free Europe from,

1241
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:43,260
uh,

1242
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,100
from Knoebel's,

1243
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:44,761
from priests,

1244
00:35:44,761 --> 00:35:45,071
et Cetera,

1245
00:35:45,071 --> 00:35:45,904
et cetera.

1246
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:46,471
Uh,

1247
00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:48,810
and what we will do as Irish,

1248
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,540
first generation Irish living in New York
and Philadelphia and Boston and maybe

1249
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,413
Connecticut too,

1250
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,610
is we will,

1251
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,270
uh,

1252
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:02,270
we will raise money and we will make Irish
independence and we will achieve this

1253
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:04,644
with violence,

1254
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,813
with guns.

1255
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,953
Uh,

1256
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:12,080
and so every ship that came into any port
that was coming from the United States

1257
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,960
was thoroughly searched for,

1258
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:16,973
uh,

1259
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,260
now for weapons and for money.

1260
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,330
And so,

1261
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:21,811
uh,

1262
00:36:21,811 --> 00:36:22,644
these,

1263
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:27,510
these Irish immigrant immigrants
to the United States where,

1264
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,200
uh,

1265
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,820
we're the most militant,

1266
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,280
arguably within the Irish,

1267
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:32,940
uh,

1268
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,773
um,

1269
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,910
a political movement for independence.

1270
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,420
Now,

1271
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:36,871
for one thing,

1272
00:36:36,871 --> 00:36:38,400
they had more means.

1273
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,260
Some of them have had come to Ireland,

1274
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:40,531
I mean,

1275
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,000
from Ireland come to the United States.

1276
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,350
I'm maybe going through England,

1277
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:43,980
maybe not,

1278
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,210
but they had jobs and the,

1279
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:47,130
and the people in Ireland
himself were just starving.

1280
00:36:47,131 --> 00:36:47,281
I mean,

1281
00:36:47,281 --> 00:36:48,480
they were dying in the fields.

1282
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:48,840
Uh,

1283
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,070
there were ending up in London,

1284
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,540
living with other Irishman,

1285
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:52,530
which is not surprising,

1286
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:53,430
uh,

1287
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,870
maintaining these kinds of,

1288
00:36:54,871 --> 00:36:56,820
of patterns by county,

1289
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,500
Cork and all this.

1290
00:36:58,650 --> 00:36:59,130
Uh,

1291
00:36:59,130 --> 00:36:59,770
and,

1292
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:01,410
and the Catholic Church was terribly,

1293
00:37:01,411 --> 00:37:02,244
terribly important,

1294
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:02,880
uh,

1295
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,391
in,

1296
00:37:03,391 --> 00:37:03,760
uh,

1297
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,593
uh,

1298
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:05,520
in,

1299
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,660
in their lives.

1300
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,231
Terribly,

1301
00:37:07,231 --> 00:37:08,190
terribly important as you know,

1302
00:37:08,191 --> 00:37:09,720
means of charity and all of this.

1303
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:15,500
But what it meant for the upper classes
is that the unwanted other Catholic,

1304
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:17,910
remember Nate eight in 1798,

1305
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:19,260
they tried to ally with the French.

1306
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,120
What happens in World War One,

1307
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,620
Roger Casement,

1308
00:37:22,621 --> 00:37:24,750
who was Irish militant,

1309
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,620
who was absolutely against the
exploitation of workers in,

1310
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,020
in,

1311
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,210
in Peru and an African everywhere else.

1312
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,440
Roger casement.

1313
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:32,130
Uh,

1314
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:32,371
you know,

1315
00:37:32,371 --> 00:37:33,510
he ends up being a,

1316
00:37:33,511 --> 00:37:38,220
being a set off with a little boat off
of submarine off the coast of Carrie.

1317
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,740
And he tries to stop
the eastern selection.

1318
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:44,670
And of course he's rested within
about 25 minutes and Hong later.

1319
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,330
But what he had tried to do was,

1320
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,250
was,

1321
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:51,930
was organize in prisoner
of war camps in Germany,

1322
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,220
Irish militants to fight the
good fight and to free Ireland.

1323
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,410
So there was always,

1324
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,680
this was again looking later,

1325
00:37:58,681 --> 00:38:02,460
but there was always this potential fear
among the British upper classes is that

1326
00:38:02,461 --> 00:38:03,294
they,

1327
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,510
these Catholics who are no
longer just across the channel,

1328
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,170
they're not,

1329
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:07,470
you know,

1330
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,600
over an Ireland across a very choppy,

1331
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:10,800
gray freezing,

1332
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:11,281
you know,

1333
00:38:11,281 --> 00:38:12,114
see,

1334
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:12,780
uh,

1335
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,360
they are living in Liverpool and huge,

1336
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:16,194
huge numbers.

1337
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,310
They are living in,

1338
00:38:17,311 --> 00:38:17,581
in,

1339
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:22,380
in London and even bigger numbers and
they are there and they are dangerous.

1340
00:38:22,381 --> 00:38:23,790
And if they ally with these,

1341
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:27,030
this satisfied workers from
the chartist movement movement,

1342
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:30,060
all hell is going to break out.

1343
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,210
And so during the next time,

1344
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:34,260
and I don't have a,

1345
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,310
I don't have much time at all but,

1346
00:38:36,311 --> 00:38:36,890
but just to,

1347
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:37,240
to,

1348
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,980
and I knew it didn't even
use this well anyway.

1349
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,580
Um,

1350
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:39,911
you see,

1351
00:38:39,911 --> 00:38:40,570
you see the point,

1352
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:43,540
this potential alliance never occurs.

1353
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:46,360
But one of the interesting things about,

1354
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,480
uh,

1355
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:47,850
the,

1356
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:52,270
the reinvention or the reconstruction
of British new identity,

1357
00:38:52,271 --> 00:38:53,380
self identity,

1358
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:57,400
and it's one shared not just
by nobles and big time Gentry,

1359
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,140
but by ordinary workers,

1360
00:38:59,141 --> 00:39:00,130
Tory workers,

1361
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:01,660
we tended to call them dismissively.

1362
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:02,520
Uh,

1363
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,240
those are those who can
stand Margaret Thatcher,

1364
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:04,900
uh,

1365
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,360
you know,

1366
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,480
and always were amazed to go through it,

1367
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:07,630
you know,

1368
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:11,620
and working class parts of Britain and
see these miserable of council houses

1369
00:39:11,621 --> 00:39:15,370
when these big pictures of Margaret
Thatcher or the royal family,

1370
00:39:15,371 --> 00:39:16,204
you know,

1371
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:17,800
anyway,

1372
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,490
it's just amazing.

1373
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:18,641
But,

1374
00:39:18,641 --> 00:39:20,080
but these Tory workers,

1375
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:20,690
uh,

1376
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:20,911
in,

1377
00:39:20,911 --> 00:39:20,981
uh,

1378
00:39:20,981 --> 00:39:21,940
not just Tory workers,

1379
00:39:21,941 --> 00:39:22,321
but they,

1380
00:39:22,321 --> 00:39:22,731
they,

1381
00:39:22,731 --> 00:39:25,150
they see themselves as respectable.

1382
00:39:25,151 --> 00:39:26,790
They see themselves as British and,

1383
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,520
and they increasingly see this sort
of unwanted enemy within Catholic.

1384
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:35,670
And I mean within as the Irish and the
newspapers are full of cartoons and

1385
00:39:37,481 --> 00:39:42,481
characatures of the Irish who are
portrayed in variably as drunken,

1386
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,650
as stupid.

1387
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,590
And as Lazy Patty,

1388
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:51,370
Pa d d y becomes a for
the character trust in,

1389
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,031
uh,

1390
00:39:52,031 --> 00:39:53,680
in British newspapers,

1391
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:54,131
uh,

1392
00:39:54,131 --> 00:39:56,530
in 1848 and subsequent years,

1393
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,130
uh,

1394
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:58,410
he is portrayed,

1395
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:03,450
Patty is portrayed as the
unwanted other who is a threat to,

1396
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:08,791
and it has no place being in except to
do menial jobs or fat or fat as a factory

1397
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:11,201
operative if,

1398
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:11,631
if they,

1399
00:40:11,631 --> 00:40:12,430
if they,

1400
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:12,880
uh,

1401
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,880
if they maintain respectability and don't
try to out their Irishness too much.

1402
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,340
And so if anyone wants to know why
these issues become so extraordinarily

1403
00:40:21,341 --> 00:40:22,174
bitter,

1404
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:25,870
it almost anytime you can think of
all stir in the 70s ultra in the,

1405
00:40:25,871 --> 00:40:26,411
in the 80s,

1406
00:40:26,411 --> 00:40:26,711
I mean,

1407
00:40:26,711 --> 00:40:27,570
the 1970s,

1408
00:40:27,571 --> 00:40:28,330
in 1980s,

1409
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,740
or even into the 1990s,

1410
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:30,311
uh,

1411
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:30,970
or,

1412
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:31,360
uh,

1413
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,580
Ireland in 1916,

1414
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,270
uh,

1415
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:36,520
1848 plays a major role in that.

1416
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:36,791
Now,

1417
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:38,140
this is not to say that all,

1418
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:38,321
you know,

1419
00:40:38,321 --> 00:40:41,590
all people who saw themselves
as British were necessarily,

1420
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:42,071
you know,

1421
00:40:42,071 --> 00:40:42,761
nasty,

1422
00:40:42,761 --> 00:40:44,170
aggressive people.

1423
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,540
But it does simply remind us.

1424
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:47,291
And here again,

1425
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:49,390
I council Linda Colley's
book called Britain's,

1426
00:40:49,391 --> 00:40:49,840
uh,

1427
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,980
as it very eloquent,

1428
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,580
uh,

1429
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,300
um,

1430
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:52,511
you know,

1431
00:40:52,511 --> 00:40:53,650
summary of all of this,

1432
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,460
uh,

1433
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,070
that part of the construction
of any kind of identity.

1434
00:40:57,071 --> 00:40:59,410
And I'll talk more about this when I
talk about Eastern Europe and central

1435
00:40:59,411 --> 00:41:04,411
Europe is what you're not and what you're
not for the British in 1848 afraid of

1436
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:09,790
catching this cold coming
from the continent was again,

1437
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,330
uh,

1438
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:10,860
you,

1439
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:10,990
uh,

1440
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:13,630
you are not French and
you are not Catholic.

1441
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:13,840
And,

1442
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,471
and this,

1443
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:16,540
if anything was going to further sour,

1444
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:16,871
uh,

1445
00:41:16,871 --> 00:41:20,530
the relations between Irish
and British authorities,

1446
00:41:20,531 --> 00:41:24,880
particularly given the fact that the
British Protestants own the land in,

1447
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,571
in Ireland.

1448
00:41:25,571 --> 00:41:27,100
I was someplace the other
day and I heard a talk,

1449
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:27,580
uh,

1450
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,340
as in New York the other day and I heard
a talk in and saw some pictures of,

1451
00:41:30,341 --> 00:41:35,341
of these marvelous kind of called
mass or mass rocks that were in the,

1452
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:35,820
uh,

1453
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,230
in rural Ireland were,

1454
00:41:37,231 --> 00:41:40,460
were priests in the 17th and 18th century.

1455
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,620
And in the 16th century for that matter,

1456
00:41:42,621 --> 00:41:43,580
at the end of the 16th century,

1457
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,950
said mass in secret,

1458
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:46,670
uh,

1459
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,650
using the slab rocks,

1460
00:41:48,651 --> 00:41:50,890
rocks that they happen to find his alters.

1461
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,490
Because,

1462
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:53,720
because being practicing
your religion was,

1463
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,101
was illegal.

1464
00:41:55,101 --> 00:41:56,330
And the Protestants have,

1465
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:56,840
uh,

1466
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,580
the law on their side and they own,

1467
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,391
they own the land.

1468
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,050
Anyway.

1469
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,310
So 1848,

1470
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,750
there was no revolution in,

1471
00:42:02,751 --> 00:42:04,220
in Britain in 1848.

1472
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:04,820
Uh,

1473
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,360
you know,

1474
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,040
clearly why this is not the case.

1475
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:07,400
Uh,

1476
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,100
it's almost surprising to think that
they could have imagined that alliance

1477
00:42:10,101 --> 00:42:13,040
between the Irish Confederation
and other Irish groups,

1478
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:13,431
uh,

1479
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:14,360
and physical force,

1480
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,070
uh,

1481
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:15,590
uh,

1482
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,400
Chartis,

1483
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:16,910
uh,

1484
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,350
but 1848,

1485
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:19,270
uh,

1486
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:19,910
has,

1487
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:20,070
uh,

1488
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:20,890
another,

1489
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:21,200
uh,

1490
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,940
role to play in British identity and
that I've tried to convey to you today.

1491
00:42:25,941 --> 00:42:26,691
Have a wonderful weekend.

1492
00:42:26,691 --> 00:42:27,221
See you on Monday.

1493
00:42:27,221 --> 00:42:27,470
Bye.
