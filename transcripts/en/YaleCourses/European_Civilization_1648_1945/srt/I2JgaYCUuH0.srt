1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,071
Okay.

2
00:00:02,071 --> 00:00:03,910
I'm going to talk about Napoleon.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:05,670
I today,

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,500
it was about,

5
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:11,310
or maybe 10 years ago at
during the French Open,

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,600
before the French Open,

7
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:12,751
you know,

8
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:17,640
the tennis tournament that
a band pay puts on every,

9
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:18,474
uh,

10
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,770
every late spring.

11
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:20,940
Uh,

12
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,980
they took one of the American players,

13
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,210
female player,

14
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:24,960
uh,

15
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,310
on a quick limousine,

16
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:27,131
a tour of,

17
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:28,770
of Paris of a full day.

18
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,091
And at the end,

19
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:30,331
they,

20
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:32,810
if someone asked her a French,

21
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,713
uh,

22
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,070
host Asco,

23
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,950
what did you like best
about the tour of Paris?

24
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,720
And she said,

25
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:40,554
uh,

26
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,380
the best thing was the tomb
of the little dead dude.

27
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,140
I couldn't make that up.

28
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,100
Uh,

29
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,491
uh,

30
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:50,670
and Napoleon continues
to fascinate though,

31
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:51,870
not necessarily me.

32
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,153
Um,

33
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,720
either the straight,

34
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,830
the coverage in the,

35
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:56,950
in what you're reading is,

36
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,080
is straight forward.

37
00:00:58,081 --> 00:01:01,290
So today I'm gonna talk
about a couple of themes.

38
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:01,861
Uh,

39
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:02,694
first of all,

40
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:03,391
uh,

41
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:04,530
what was Corsican,

42
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,900
what remained Corsican about Napoleon,

43
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,131
uh,

44
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:09,900
and then maybe discuss a,

45
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:13,410
a question raised by David Bell of late,

46
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,610
um,

47
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,640
was the revolutionary period
in particularly Napoleon,

48
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:18,060
the,

49
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,680
the first total war,

50
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,310
uh,

51
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,160
in the sense that 20th century folks,

52
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:24,990
and at least you were
born in the 20th century.

53
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,460
I have come to,

54
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,320
uh,

55
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,670
to understand and then the end,

56
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:31,620
just don't ramble a bit,

57
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:34,350
but just talk about what the
most important contributions of,

58
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:35,070
uh,

59
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,260
of Napoleon.

60
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,020
Um,

61
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:37,640
uh,

62
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:37,871
what,

63
00:01:37,871 --> 00:01:38,131
what,

64
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:38,431
what the,

65
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:38,820
what the,

66
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,660
what they were,

67
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,063
um,

68
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,390
somebody counted up,

69
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:43,290
not me.

70
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,161
Uh,

71
00:01:44,161 --> 00:01:44,731
that,

72
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:45,564
uh,

73
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,820
by 1980,

74
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:48,654
there had been two,

75
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:53,690
at least 220,000 books and articles
published on Napoleon in a variety of

76
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:56,184
languages.

77
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,390
Um,

78
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,560
three recent books,

79
00:01:58,561 --> 00:01:59,340
which just if you,

80
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,470
if your Napoleon buffs or simply want to,

81
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,190
uh,

82
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:02,941
read about him,

83
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:03,110
that are,

84
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:03,320
that are,

85
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,820
that are quite good in English are,

86
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:06,360
uh,

87
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,190
my old friend Steven England's book,

88
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:08,820
uh,

89
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,660
Napoleon,

90
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,111
uh,

91
00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:11,220
a political history,

92
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:15,780
which came out three or four years ago
and was recently translated into French

93
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,790
Philip Dwyer's a,

94
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,560
a book on Napoleon,

95
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:20,250
uh,

96
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:20,521
uh,

97
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:22,740
up to 1799.

98
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:23,574
I filliped wire,

99
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:23,761
you know,

100
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:24,690
hates Napoleon.

101
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:25,440
Uh,

102
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,580
but it's a pretty interesting,

103
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:27,060
um,

104
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,880
uh,

105
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,231
uh,

106
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,030
look at,

107
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,121
uh,

108
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:30,210
the early career.

109
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:30,811
Uh,

110
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:31,650
and finally,

111
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,070
uh,

112
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,200
I suppose mostly most controversially,

113
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,280
a David Bell's a book,

114
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,100
the first total war,

115
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,031
uh,

116
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:41,400
which I'll discuss some
of the themes in a while.

117
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,980
It was only about six or seven years ago.

118
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:44,791
I remember this,

119
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,070
that they discovered in Lithuania.

120
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,570
Um,

121
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,620
a whole,

122
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,873
uh,

123
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,530
a whole bunch of,

124
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:52,831
of,

125
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:56,220
of bones of dead bones
with bones are dead.

126
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:56,701
I guess I'm going,

127
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:58,170
if they've been there for
200 years or whatever,

128
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,250
but of of um,

129
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,940
uh,

130
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,460
not a grave site because they
were never probably buried,

131
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:03,701
but,

132
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:04,001
but,

133
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:04,390
uh,

134
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,860
a place where expired in the snows of,

135
00:03:06,861 --> 00:03:07,510
uh,

136
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,410
of 18,

137
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:09,191
12,

138
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:09,480
uh,

139
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,060
uh,

140
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,810
a good number of soldiers of
Napoleon has gone down on me.

141
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:14,620
The big,

142
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,161
uh,

143
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,030
the big army.

144
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,303
Um,

145
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,671
and so,

146
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:18,931
I mean,

147
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:19,370
ninth,

148
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:19,841
18,

149
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:20,141
12,

150
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:20,570
still,

151
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,240
uh,

152
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,480
I still,

153
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:22,811
uh,

154
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:23,620
goes on.

155
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:23,980
Um,

156
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,401
there was,

157
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:24,510
uh,

158
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,880
there was a book also interesting book
if you're looking for paper topics,

159
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:28,900
uh,

160
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,471
that I,

161
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:33,670
I sometimes assign in the French course
called diary of a Napoleonic foot

162
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,050
soldier a.

163
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,280
And by the time of 18,

164
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:36,851
12,

165
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:37,660
uh,

166
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,550
the majority of the going on me were,

167
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:42,040
were really people who'd
been conscripted or,

168
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:42,881
uh,

169
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:43,691
impounded,

170
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:44,500
if you will,

171
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:44,710
uh,

172
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,960
in various allied states.

173
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:48,550
But it's a quite interesting account of,

174
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:49,510
of what it was like,

175
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:50,110
uh,

176
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:50,770
uh,

177
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:55,750
in Napoleon's armies as he invaded
a further and further into,

178
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:56,090
um,

179
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:56,680
uh,

180
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,513
eastern,

181
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:57,910
uh,

182
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,743
Europe.

183
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,583
Um,

184
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,341
by the way,

185
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:01,174
among the,

186
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,163
uh,

187
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:02,801
you know,

188
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:05,020
I just did a subject
search on Napoleon once.

189
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:05,860
I don't know why,

190
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:06,071
but,

191
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:06,310
but,

192
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:06,850
uh,

193
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,480
um,

194
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,970
of the 220,000 books,

195
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:11,290
you probably will want to,

196
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:11,950
um,

197
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:12,783
uh,

198
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,880
not read the tantalizing a 1894
classic Napoleon and the fair sex,

199
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,060
uh,

200
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,100
or Napoleon and his women friends,

201
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,930
which was from 1927.

202
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,130
Napoleon in love.

203
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:24,401
I mean,

204
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:26,890
there are lots of those 1959,

205
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,170
and the Polian seen my Canadian,

206
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,651
uh,

207
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:30,484
published in,

208
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,061
in,

209
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:31,960
in 19,

210
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,561
uh,

211
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:33,394
30,

212
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:33,761
uh,

213
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:34,594
seven.

214
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,071
So,

215
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:36,904
um,

216
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,281
and I,

217
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:39,330
I talk a lot about Napoleon's life in,

218
00:04:39,331 --> 00:04:39,571
in,

219
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:39,940
in,

220
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,211
in,

221
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:41,044
in the textbook.

222
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:41,650
But let's,

223
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,000
let's look at the theme of,

224
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:43,750
uh,

225
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,790
of Napoleon and Corsica.

226
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,420
I once took a whole flock
of Yale Alumni to see,

227
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:50,050
uh,

228
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:50,411
uh,

229
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:55,411
Napoleon's house in [inaudible]
where he was born on the 15th of,

230
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:56,584
um,

231
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:56,970
uh,

232
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:57,541
of,

233
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:58,374
of August.

234
00:04:58,810 --> 00:04:59,380
Um,

235
00:04:59,380 --> 00:04:59,630
he,

236
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:04,540
he wrote in a letter to the course that
can patriot with whom he subsequently

237
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:04,990
broke,

238
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:05,410
uh,

239
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,243
poly.

240
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,120
Uh,

241
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,610
he wrote on the 12th of June,

242
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,090
1789,

243
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,570
I was born when the French
were vomited upon our coasts.

244
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,720
That is the coast of Corsica drowning,

245
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,030
the thrown of liberty
and torrents of blood.

246
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,450
Such was the odious spectacle
that first met my eyes.

247
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,310
The cries of the dying,

248
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,610
the groans of the oppressed tiers
of despair surrounded my cradle,

249
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,350
uh,

250
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,400
at my birth.

251
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,570
Uh,

252
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,201
of course it guys,

253
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:35,861
I'm sure you know,

254
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:37,180
it is an island,

255
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:38,110
a big island,

256
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:38,321
a,

257
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:43,150
it's a north of Sardinia
a which belongs to Italy.

258
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,523
Um,

259
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,040
he at first gloried in
his Corsican origins,

260
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,690
I hating the French who
had conquered his island.

261
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,411
Of course,

262
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:55,930
the French revolution would change all
that and that's why it's a good idea to

263
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:58,730
look at him as you look at
Robespierre and others and see what,

264
00:05:59,510 --> 00:05:59,690
uh,

265
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,580
what difference a,

266
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,610
there were French revolution,

267
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,090
uh,

268
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:07,090
made between a 1785 near I'm
drawing on Dwyer and 1795.

269
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,220
That is between the age of 16 and 26.

270
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,230
He wrote a number of,

271
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:15,710
of notes and sketches and short stories,

272
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,400
uh,

273
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,850
that reveal much about
his attachment to Corsica,

274
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,043
but also the,

275
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,060
that suggests the dramatic nature of the
change as he embraces the revolution.

276
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:27,861
Uh,

277
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:30,740
and France now he spoke Corsican,

278
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,510
uh,

279
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,860
and,

280
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,910
and not French,

281
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,710
so French with a second language.

282
00:06:34,711 --> 00:06:35,220
And,

283
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,240
and Corsican is a,

284
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:36,471
is,

285
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:36,980
uh,

286
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,131
you know,

287
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:37,671
it's a language,

288
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:38,660
it's a Patois,

289
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,141
uh,

290
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:40,160
that is closer,

291
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,730
more closely tied to a
Patois or dialect of,

292
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:44,564
of northern,

293
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,290
uh,

294
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,010
northern Italy.

295
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:46,311
In fact,

296
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:47,570
when you drive around in Corsica,

297
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,610
most of the radio
stations that you can get,

298
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:49,731
or,

299
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:49,941
you know,

300
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:50,121
our,

301
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:50,954
our Italian,

302
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:51,561
uh,

303
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:52,220
and,

304
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:52,731
and not,

305
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:53,630
not French.

306
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:54,470
Um,

307
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,130
he learned French and he made
errors even at the end of his life.

308
00:06:58,131 --> 00:06:58,851
He made errors.

309
00:06:58,851 --> 00:06:59,361
And French,

310
00:06:59,361 --> 00:07:00,140
though he wrote,

311
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:00,973
wrote French,

312
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,290
uh,

313
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:01,701
uh,

314
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:02,540
very well.

315
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,260
Um,

316
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,250
so he was bilingual,

317
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:05,810
but he never lost his accent.

318
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,441
And,

319
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:06,920
uh,

320
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,290
uh,

321
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,990
one of the things about northern French,

322
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:09,890
uh,

323
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,950
people in particular is that
they're less likely to forgive.

324
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,170
It's southern accents.

325
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:15,331
And,

326
00:07:15,331 --> 00:07:15,471
and,

327
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:16,071
and of course,

328
00:07:16,071 --> 00:07:17,260
one of the stereotypes of course,

329
00:07:17,261 --> 00:07:17,571
Atkins,

330
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:19,370
is they all become policemen in Paris.

331
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,330
Uh,

332
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,470
and as many of them have,

333
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:23,080
I have eyes at the end of the law,

334
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,251
uh,

335
00:07:23,251 --> 00:07:24,320
of their name,

336
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,220
uh,

337
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,110
and they have a very strong,

338
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,160
uh,

339
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,930
southern French accent that it,

340
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:30,471
that is,

341
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:32,150
it's not really a Toulouse accent,

342
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:32,781
uh,

343
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:33,231
or,

344
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:33,680
you know,

345
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,550
are part of a,

346
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:34,911
uh,

347
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,240
France.

348
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,360
And our Desha accident where you can
always tell if those of you know French,

349
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:38,631
and again,

350
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:39,220
if you don't have fringe,

351
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,160
doesn't make a slight bit of difference,

352
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:44,480
but somebody who says the Coteau Vanga
instead of cuts or VA or cast sang

353
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:45,231
instead of the,

354
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:45,890
uh,

355
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:46,580
uh,

356
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,260
the great a human rights
advocate to a knee,

357
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,343
a Casa,

358
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,060
the Sangha or a Vang on which want to,

359
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:53,930
via the Vanga,

360
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:54,231
you know,

361
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:56,230
a glass of wine instead of vap.

362
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,350
Uh,

363
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,861
so of course,

364
00:07:57,861 --> 00:07:58,440
I mean,

365
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,530
it's a famous story about
Napoleon and when he,

366
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:04,520
when he goes off to military school as
a very young boy that they made fun of

367
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:05,354
his accent.

368
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,393
Uh,

369
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,910
and one more about that,

370
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,430
um,

371
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:08,481
uh,

372
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:09,081
in a while.

373
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:09,870
But anyway,

374
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,430
um,

375
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,500
at the beginning he,

376
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:13,070
he hated the French and,

377
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:13,520
um,

378
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:13,761
uh,

379
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:15,380
espouse to the fact that he was,

380
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,060
uh,

381
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,761
a course it can,

382
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:18,770
he felt culturally marginal.

383
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,210
Um,

384
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,830
and this was compounded by his personal
loneliness when he was assigned to

385
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,531
Veloce,

386
00:08:25,531 --> 00:08:26,060
uh,

387
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,660
uh,

388
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,580
which could make anyone
sort are mildly depressed.

389
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,530
Um,

390
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:29,780
uh,

391
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,130
I lost on the Rhone River.

392
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,160
He contemplated suicide quite seriously.

393
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,360
Uh,

394
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:35,871
he,

395
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:36,110
uh,

396
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,590
spent a lot of time in sort of reading
and just sort of hanging out by himself

397
00:08:39,591 --> 00:08:39,961
and,

398
00:08:39,961 --> 00:08:40,101
and,

399
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:40,460
and the,

400
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,870
through much of a zoo early days,

401
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,441
uh,

402
00:08:42,441 --> 00:08:42,891
lacked.

403
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:43,280
Um,

404
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,571
he,

405
00:08:43,571 --> 00:08:44,121
he lacked,

406
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:44,770
uh,

407
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:45,600
um,

408
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,433
uh,

409
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:46,881
he liked,

410
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:47,900
he liked friends.

411
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,980
Um,

412
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,830
in 1768 Corsica,

413
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,180
which had been part of,

414
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,430
of the Republic of,

415
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:54,431
of,

416
00:08:54,431 --> 00:08:54,641
of,

417
00:08:54,641 --> 00:08:57,300
of that is the port city of Genoa,

418
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:57,571
just,

419
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:57,860
you know,

420
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,230
foss,

421
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,411
I mean,

422
00:08:58,411 --> 00:08:59,370
really across the,

423
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,820
the sea gave up course it could
to France or really sold it.

424
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,840
The French state actively work to try to
create a loyal horse that can nobility

425
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,280
and thus the family of Napoleon,

426
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,320
the bone of paths.

427
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,750
And p o n a p a r t,

428
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:16,740
e s,

429
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:17,520
uh,

430
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,880
who had a you that he
subsequently took out of his name,

431
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,660
uh,

432
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:21,871
uh,

433
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:23,430
in the first four letters,

434
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:23,970
uh,

435
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,550
were ennobled in 1771,

436
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,150
uh,

437
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,050
by the French.

438
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:29,431
But I mean,

439
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:31,290
all nobles aren't rich as you know.

440
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:35,000
And so he was sort of what you'd call
in French and Oba Ho sort of rapport,

441
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,950
a noble a four of Carlo that his,

442
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:38,191
his,

443
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:38,910
his dad,

444
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,060
uh,

445
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,360
Bonaparte's eight children received
scholarships to study in France,

446
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,550
including Napoleon who,

447
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:44,820
uh,

448
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,710
was sent to a place called blue hen.

449
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,650
It doesn't matter.

450
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:47,790
Uh,

451
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,440
in the north of France,

452
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:54,441
50 of the hundred and 10 students in
the school were called royal scholars.

453
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:55,350
So here again,

454
00:09:55,351 --> 00:09:56,610
here's kind of a comparison to,

455
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,450
uh,

456
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:57,991
to,

457
00:09:57,991 --> 00:09:58,470
uh,

458
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,270
that case of downward mobility.

459
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:00,810
Uh,

460
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,643
Hovis piano,

461
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:01,890
uh,

462
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,660
who was also a scholarship,

463
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,140
uh,

464
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:04,591
a guy.

465
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:06,630
And there was nothing wrong with that
at all except that there were a lot of

466
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:08,490
fancy noble offspring there too,

467
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,360
who had another reason to knock two mock,

468
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:12,880
uh,

469
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,360
uh,

470
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:13,530
uh,

471
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,363
an Napoleon.

472
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,503
Um,

473
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:16,921
and so,

474
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:17,430
um,

475
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:22,430
he wrote in [inaudible] where he was when
he was posted to violence again on the

476
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,450
Rhone River about an hour now by car,

477
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:25,021
south of,

478
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:25,261
of,

479
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:25,620
of uh,

480
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,453
legal.

481
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:26,670
Uh,

482
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,320
he wrote that life was a burden,

483
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,040
uh,

484
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,040
because there was no pleasure is nothing
but pain is a burden because the men

485
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:37,680
and women with whom I live and
probably will always have to live,

486
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:43,010
have customs that are as far from mine
as the light of the moon is different

487
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,540
from the light of the sun.

488
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:46,661
But yeah,

489
00:10:46,661 --> 00:10:49,650
there was yet there was
French influence in his life.

490
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,050
He read the fill the sof,

491
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,990
he had whoso Voltaire,

492
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,990
Montesquieu and in 1791,

493
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,041
again,

494
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,850
I don't want to push this comparison
because he was different in many ways then

495
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,693
what was the piano?

496
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,030
But like Robespierre he had,

497
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:07,800
ed enters an essay contest
sponsored by an academy,

498
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,420
an academy in this case,

499
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:10,410
the Academy of,

500
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,453
of Lille.

501
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:12,600
Um,

502
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,860
but his writings,

503
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,530
um,

504
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,730
mostly reflect an
obsession with his origins.

505
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:20,010
I haven't read a lot
of his early writings,

506
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:20,880
but Philip Dwyer,

507
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,241
uh,

508
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:22,074
has,

509
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,063
um,

510
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,970
one of his colleagues in
school drew a cartoon of,

511
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,800
of Napoleon rushing to
Corsica to aid the course.

512
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,800
It can revel rebel Paoli and he must've
discussed this with his friends.

513
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,580
And he also battled with those as he
saw us as rivals a long time ago in the

514
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:42,391
1920s,

515
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:43,224
I guess it was,

516
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:43,980
uh,

517
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,210
the producer about gos produced
this three and a half hour film,

518
00:11:48,211 --> 00:11:49,830
which actually is extremely boring,

519
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,140
called Napoleon wall,

520
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:51,810
uh,

521
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:52,950
with without sound.

522
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,920
But the most famous scene in it arguably
is a snowball fight where Napoleon,

523
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,390
uh,

524
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,550
it takes a snowball fight to
a more serious dimension and,

525
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,560
and tries out tactics and,

526
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:03,394
and uh,

527
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,301
and all of this,

528
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:04,781
but in a way,

529
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:04,961
you know,

530
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:05,920
is fighting for his,

531
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:06,450
his,

532
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:06,640
you know,

533
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,360
his independence and the status as a,

534
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:08,870
as,

535
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,320
as,

536
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:09,641
as,

537
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:10,020
uh,

538
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,121
uh,

539
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:14,890
non-French Corsican but who been
washed up on the shores of France by,

540
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:15,550
uh,

541
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,080
by a fortune,

542
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:18,310
a good or a bad.

543
00:12:18,311 --> 00:12:18,971
And at that point,

544
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,830
he wasn't really too sure,

545
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,430
uh,

546
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,390
what it was.

547
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,850
He began to write a history of Corsica,

548
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:25,481
uh,

549
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:27,130
less than a hundred pages,

550
00:12:27,131 --> 00:12:32,131
which he thought took seriously enough
to begin to revise in the early 1790s

551
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,790
after the French revolution.

552
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:34,624
And in it,

553
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,980
according to Phil Dwyer,

554
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:37,870
he portrays Corsicans as courageous,

555
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,770
even heroic,

556
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,810
and throwing off the rule of Genoa
and battling the French for over 24

557
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:44,650
centuries.

558
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,120
He wrote the same scenes,

559
00:12:46,121 --> 00:12:48,310
had been repeated without interruption.

560
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,880
The same assisted tutes,

561
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,980
the same misfortunes,

562
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,420
but also the same courage,

563
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,910
the same resolution,

564
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,840
the same,

565
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:55,961
uh,

566
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:56,794
Udacity.

567
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:57,910
Um,

568
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,421
but you know,

569
00:12:58,421 --> 00:13:01,750
his letters in his writings reveal
the folks that he was writing.

570
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,640
I reading that is the influence of the,

571
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:04,630
of the philosophic,

572
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,380
uh,

573
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,213
portraying,

574
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:06,521
you know,

575
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:07,360
Corsica,

576
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,360
uh,

577
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,700
seeking liberty,

578
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,221
uh,

579
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:12,490
in the shadow of a,

580
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,540
of oppression,

581
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,141
uh,

582
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:16,180
in opposition to royal authority,

583
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:16,890
um,

584
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:17,090
based.

585
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:20,050
So he links kind of Phyllis
the themes of the philosophic,

586
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:20,680
uh,

587
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,520
in the fence.

588
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,660
Of course it can,

589
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:23,410
uh,

590
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:23,801
of course,

591
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:25,780
it gets fight for a freedom.

592
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,093
Um,

593
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,140
so even in the 1790s,

594
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:29,710
if this is true,

595
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,060
interpretation is correct.

596
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:31,420
Uh,

597
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,680
he did not see his,

598
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,370
uh,

599
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,530
identity is both Corsican in French,

600
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:35,981
uh,

601
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,510
but rather as,

602
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,590
as Corsican.

603
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:39,880
Uh,

604
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,700
but by 1799,

605
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,390
uh,

606
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,500
when he,

607
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,010
with the help of the Wiley Ab Aca,

608
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,770
yes.

609
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,603
Uh,

610
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,720
comes to power.

611
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,910
I am on the 18th of Bouman.

612
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:52,580
Uh,

613
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,790
the French identity had overwhelmed,

614
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,241
uh,

615
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:56,630
his course can identity.

616
00:13:56,631 --> 00:13:57,371
And so the question is,

617
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:59,140
did he merely catch the nearest way?

618
00:13:59,410 --> 00:13:59,621
Uh,

619
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:00,850
is it opportunism?

620
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:01,331
Uh,

621
00:14:01,331 --> 00:14:06,331
or was it his belief that the French
revolution and the better Fos France,

622
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:07,750
uh,

623
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,560
uh,

624
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,560
offered a liberating possibilities for,

625
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,220
uh,

626
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,360
for humanities?

627
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,493
Um,

628
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,020
uh,

629
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,611
in a,

630
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:19,570
in a short story that he wrote in the
summer of 1789 rather important summer,

631
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,200
uh,

632
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,420
the French were portrayed as,

633
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,790
as tyrants still in his story
called the nouvelle costs or the,

634
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:27,550
the new,

635
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,020
uh,

636
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,150
uh,

637
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,983
Corsica.

638
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,123
Um,

639
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,631
and he,

640
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:32,380
um,

641
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,700
he used violence and his life
would be one characterized by,

642
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,960
by violence,

643
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:38,591
uh,

644
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,470
as a way of increasing
sympathy for the course.

645
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:44,500
It can people also as
a cultural expression,

646
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:44,981
of course,

647
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:45,940
it conventions,

648
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:46,510
you know,

649
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,343
Corsica,

650
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:47,860
uh,

651
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,431
because of,

652
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:48,641
I mean,

653
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:49,810
this isn't just a stereotype,

654
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:49,961
but,

655
00:14:49,961 --> 00:14:50,200
but,

656
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,440
uh,

657
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,140
because of this,

658
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,440
of flashing knives of
clan and family rivalries,

659
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,250
uh,

660
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,020
there so many crimes in Corsica,

661
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:57,590
uh,

662
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,780
in the 19th century that
the island of Corsica,

663
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:01,400
which became a depot and they pop them.

664
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:01,581
Oh,

665
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:02,414
now it's too,

666
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,450
but one of the departments of
France had to be excluded when,

667
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:05,721
when,

668
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:06,210
uh,

669
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:06,320
uh,

670
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,390
somebody was doing a,

671
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:07,650
uh,

672
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,271
study of,

673
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:08,541
of,

674
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:08,741
of,

675
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,574
of crime.

676
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:10,100
Uh,

677
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,250
I,

678
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,230
because there's so many
more crimes in Corsica,

679
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,591
in fact,

680
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:13,190
still,

681
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:13,610
uh,

682
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,500
their tradition of flat
flashing lives of knives and,

683
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:16,761
and,

684
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:17,270
uh,

685
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:17,930
uh,

686
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:18,201
uh,

687
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:18,411
you know,

688
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:19,990
the course getting independence movements,

689
00:15:19,991 --> 00:15:20,691
still places,

690
00:15:20,691 --> 00:15:22,380
bombs sometimes in blows up there,

691
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,080
various independence
movements and blows up,

692
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:24,590
uh,

693
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:24,860
uh,

694
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,940
Luci small or a,

695
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:26,181
you know,

696
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:28,370
a housing development being built for,

697
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:28,940
uh,

698
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,061
uh,

699
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:29,301
you know,

700
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:31,760
Parisian or Maasais lawyers
or something like that.

701
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,630
Um,

702
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,040
and it was still are these,

703
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,933
these kinds of,

704
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:35,180
uh,

705
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,050
resentments.

706
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:36,920
Um,

707
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,480
so in the beginning he still
identified with Paulie,

708
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,040
but he would break a po
with Paho leak to a poly.

709
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:43,340
I,

710
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:43,911
the course can.

711
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:46,250
Patriot was sort of the scene
as the George Washington of,

712
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:46,491
of,

713
00:15:46,491 --> 00:15:46,811
of,

714
00:15:46,811 --> 00:15:47,300
uh,

715
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:47,511
uh,

716
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:48,320
of his,

717
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,591
his,

718
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:49,430
his island.

719
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,360
Um,

720
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,380
and he was a,

721
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:55,470
Napoleon was constructing a vision
of what he saw it he could become,

722
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,240
that is to help liberate
Corsica from French rule.

723
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,253
Uh,

724
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,220
how ironic his father Carlo had,

725
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:04,940
uh,

726
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,700
had in his own view
that is Napoleon's view,

727
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:08,534
betrayed,

728
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,320
uh,

729
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:09,681
uh,

730
00:16:09,681 --> 00:16:13,670
the course can cause by going over to,

731
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:13,961
uh,

732
00:16:13,961 --> 00:16:14,281
uh,

733
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:15,114
the French.

734
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,980
Um,

735
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,940
and so in a way,

736
00:16:16,941 --> 00:16:17,091
I mean,

737
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:20,030
you could argue that he's
rebelling against his father.

738
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,013
Um,

739
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,351
uh,

740
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:21,891
at least in the,

741
00:16:21,891 --> 00:16:23,120
in the early stages.

742
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,000
But the revolution did bring a change.

743
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,601
Obviously,

744
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:29,600
it transformed the relations
between France and Corsica.

745
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:30,890
In 1789,

746
00:16:30,891 --> 00:16:32,030
there were four deputies,

747
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:32,790
uh,

748
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:32,991
uh,

749
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:33,824
elected,

750
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,101
uh,

751
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:35,600
to the estates general.

752
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,220
And in 1790,

753
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:41,240
Corsica is recognized as a
Depop tomorrow as a department,

754
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,020
uh,

755
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:46,100
of course against demanded a royal decree
that would recognize the island as an

756
00:16:46,101 --> 00:16:47,420
integral part of France,

757
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,410
subject to the,

758
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,670
to the laws of France,

759
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:50,450
um,

760
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:54,260
and declared that those who had fought
against France ought to be permitted to

761
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:55,580
return to,

762
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,170
uh,

763
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:56,880
of their,

764
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,140
uh,

765
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:57,980
homeland.

766
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,630
On the 27th of December.

767
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:01,100
There were celebrations and all,

768
00:17:01,101 --> 00:17:01,641
of course it can.

769
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:02,474
Churches,

770
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,080
uh,

771
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,390
and the Polian had a banner hung in,

772
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:08,270
is not inconsiderable house in a jock CEO,

773
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:09,830
the family house viva,

774
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,550
Viva [inaudible],

775
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,080
Aviva [inaudible] bull.

776
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:13,670
Uh,

777
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:13,961
who had,

778
00:17:13,961 --> 00:17:14,630
so who was,

779
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,630
who had supported the decree long
live the nation long loop polity,

780
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,890
long live in Mujer Hobo.

781
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:19,400
He's trying to,

782
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,710
he's trying to play it both ways.

783
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,270
He wrote from now on,

784
00:17:23,271 --> 00:17:23,661
we,

785
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:26,000
that is Corsica and France
have the same interests,

786
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,560
the same concerns.

787
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,330
The sea no longer,

788
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,050
uh,

789
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:30,920
separates us.

790
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,371
Indeed.

791
00:17:31,371 --> 00:17:31,521
I mean,

792
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:33,320
that's hardly the case because even today,

793
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:33,771
of course,

794
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:34,604
the cup,

795
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,380
there have to be subventions,

796
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:36,831
uh,

797
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:37,490
to,

798
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,030
uh,

799
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,863
to help,

800
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:38,991
uh,

801
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:43,040
keep the cost of food down in Corsica
because of the enormous cost cost of

802
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:43,874
transporting,

803
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:44,660
uh,

804
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,430
things that are not produced locally.

805
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:46,581
I mean,

806
00:17:46,581 --> 00:17:47,510
you can't just live on,

807
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:50,430
on goat's cheese and
things like that and wine,

808
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,580
a red wine produced in course it goes.

809
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:52,710
So,

810
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:52,920
I mean,

811
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,550
the sea,

812
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:53,910
uh,

813
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,301
does,

814
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:54,700
uh,

815
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:54,930
uh,

816
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:55,620
matter,

817
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,180
uh,

818
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:56,590
uh,

819
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,080
uh,

820
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,511
uh,

821
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:58,344
all of that.

822
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,460
But the revolution helped
Napoleon reconcile some of
the contradictions that had

823
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:05,550
bothered him a all the way along.

824
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,511
So at this point,

825
00:18:06,511 --> 00:18:07,920
he'd become a French,

826
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,030
a Corsican.

827
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,000
He renounced publishing
some of his letters,

828
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:12,900
uh,

829
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,450
and began to enter these,

830
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:15,661
uh,

831
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,310
political struggles,

832
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:17,701
uh,

833
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:18,840
in the revolution.

834
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:19,710
Uh,

835
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,191
and he,

836
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:20,671
indeed,

837
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:21,421
he was lucky.

838
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:21,601
I mean,

839
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,440
one of the amazing things about
Napoleon was his luck because it,

840
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,200
uh,

841
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,380
when he might've well been
guillotined as being as Jacoba,

842
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:28,801
uh,

843
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:30,600
he was in Corsica or,

844
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,080
uh,

845
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,580
in the south of France,

846
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,540
uh,

847
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,290
uh,

848
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,330
he was always seemed to
be in the right place.

849
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:37,290
And this was true in his,

850
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:37,970
his,

851
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:38,310
uh,

852
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,570
in his battles as well.

853
00:18:39,571 --> 00:18:41,730
He is tremendously courageous guy.

854
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,510
Uh,

855
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,160
and he,

856
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,250
the guards are always trying to,

857
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:44,930
his bodyguards,

858
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:45,840
always trying to get them to,

859
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:46,051
you know,

860
00:18:46,051 --> 00:18:48,920
move back in the traditional way as,

861
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:49,260
uh,

862
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,180
an officer or commander,

863
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,650
which he was the commander,

864
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,130
uh,

865
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,000
from the battles.

866
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:54,211
And,

867
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:57,030
and he in fact is only
wounded very lightly,

868
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,350
two or three times.

869
00:18:58,351 --> 00:18:59,310
So He's pretty lucky.

870
00:18:59,311 --> 00:18:59,700
They wouldn't,

871
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,580
bodies are falling in,

872
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,870
horses are falling all around him.

873
00:19:03,871 --> 00:19:04,051
I mean,

874
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:04,260
he,

875
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,093
he remained a,

876
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:05,640
uh,

877
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,680
an extremely lucky guy.

878
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,630
And this also accounts for his,

879
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:10,950
uh,

880
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,341
uh,

881
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:12,000
his,

882
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,181
uh,

883
00:19:12,181 --> 00:19:12,780
success.

884
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,530
Though even though for
the 18th premier in 1799,

885
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,800
clearly it would be a military person
who is going to put an end to what has

886
00:19:21,991 --> 00:19:25,410
been in delicately called
the war of the chamber pots.

887
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,360
That was the directory.

888
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:30,520
That is the period of
the Post Thermador uh,

889
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,470
the directory.

890
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,250
Uh,

891
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:32,790
and,

892
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,330
uh,

893
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:33,811
you know,

894
00:19:33,811 --> 00:19:35,650
the battle between left and right and,

895
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,300
and,

896
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,180
and the revolution made military men,

897
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,170
uh,

898
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,003
uh,

899
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,420
extraordinarily important.

900
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:42,571
I mean,

901
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:43,740
there wasn't a king anymore.

902
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,470
Uh,

903
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,970
uh,

904
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:45,760
and the war,

905
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,810
the chamber pots and the sort of
sleaziness of the period though it was

906
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:49,401
important in,

907
00:19:49,401 --> 00:19:49,831
in the end,

908
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:54,831
giving France some sort of parliamentary
experience in a meaningful way meant

909
00:19:55,231 --> 00:19:57,870
that some military person was going to,

910
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:58,740
uh,

911
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,320
is going to be imposing order in quotes.

912
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:01,971
I,

913
00:20:01,971 --> 00:20:02,431
and,

914
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,640
uh,

915
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,090
when,

916
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,480
when Ebay cas who had
survived and he have the,

917
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,170
what is the third estate who had also
survived all of this institute of the

918
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:10,980
revolution.

919
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,570
When he thinks about one general,

920
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,610
one of another military man says,

921
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:15,661
there's your man,

922
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:17,250
there's Napoleon who is again,

923
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:18,090
in the right place,

924
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,860
he's going to do a better coup d'etat,

925
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,720
then the other guy could've done.

926
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,900
And so Napoleon there happened
to be a lucky fellow as well.

927
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,940
In 1793,

928
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:30,481
uh,

929
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:31,130
the,

930
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:35,430
the followers of poly broke with the
convention during the federalist revolts,

931
00:20:35,431 --> 00:20:36,360
which you know about,

932
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:37,690
and during the expulsion of the,

933
00:20:37,691 --> 00:20:39,930
as you hone down from the convention,

934
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:40,830
uh,

935
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,640
and then,

936
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:41,911
uh,

937
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:42,810
the uprisings,

938
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,231
uh,

939
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:44,530
come in in Leo,

940
00:20:44,531 --> 00:20:45,180
say,

941
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:45,870
Boldo,

942
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:46,500
Tutto,

943
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,050
et Cetera,

944
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:47,883
et cetera.

945
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:48,670
Um,

946
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,510
and those on the outs
with Pau [inaudible],

947
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,860
including Napoleon,

948
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,160
now embraced the Jacoby,

949
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:58,350
uh,

950
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,210
uh,

951
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,453
because,

952
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,061
uh,

953
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:04,020
the course can assembly in a jock CEO,

954
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,413
uh,

955
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:05,741
by the way,

956
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:10,741
he's age a Ajaccio eight
j a c c I o Ajaccio,

957
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,430
uh,

958
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,050
turn,

959
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:13,470
uh,

960
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:13,740
they,

961
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,720
they condemn the Bonaparte's who
had dropped the U in their name,

962
00:21:16,721 --> 00:21:17,200
by the way.

963
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,670
That's in the book as having been born
in the mud of despotism despotism.

964
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,331
Uh,

965
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:22,901
and he turned,

966
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:26,830
so Napoleon turned his back
on the independence movement
to which he'd pledged

967
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,570
in the privacy of his room and,

968
00:21:28,571 --> 00:21:31,420
but also in other places
and Brienne of fidelity.

969
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,880
And he now hated poly for whom he,

970
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,450
uh,

971
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,860
blamed for having turned,

972
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:36,490
uh,

973
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:36,880
uh,

974
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,990
so many Corsicans Atkins,

975
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:38,381
uh,

976
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:39,190
against,

977
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:39,371
uh,

978
00:21:39,371 --> 00:21:40,510
against France.

979
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,111
Again,

980
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:44,200
is this the opportunism had he
merely caught the nearest way?

981
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,273
Uh,

982
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,091
but you know,

983
00:21:46,091 --> 00:21:50,320
he had embraced the national identity
of being French and he did take ideas

984
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:51,154
seriously.

985
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:51,911
Uh,

986
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:52,511
and,

987
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:52,760
uh,

988
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,030
it's our,

989
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,060
it's possible to argue,

990
00:21:55,061 --> 00:21:56,110
I wouldn't believe this,

991
00:21:56,111 --> 00:21:56,211
that,

992
00:21:56,211 --> 00:21:56,561
that,

993
00:21:56,561 --> 00:21:57,000
uh,

994
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,201
the,

995
00:21:57,201 --> 00:22:02,201
the philosophic eventually a one out and
he saw the revolution as a liberating

996
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,990
experience for France
and the construction of,

997
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:05,191
of,

998
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:05,950
of a new,

999
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,600
of a new way of imagining the state.

1000
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,613
Of course.

1001
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,750
Like he turns that into,

1002
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:11,460
uh,

1003
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,730
into out and out,

1004
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,270
uh,

1005
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:13,850
uh,

1006
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:14,080
uh,

1007
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,000
political repression,

1008
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,940
his own country,

1009
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:16,571
uh,

1010
00:22:16,571 --> 00:22:17,200
and,

1011
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,291
uh,

1012
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,101
the conquest,

1013
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:19,120
the megalomaniac,

1014
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,700
a megalomaniac,

1015
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,661
what is over there?

1016
00:22:22,661 --> 00:22:23,141
Actually with that,

1017
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:23,974
I can't even think of it.

1018
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:28,720
A conquest of all of these other places.

1019
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:29,470
Um,

1020
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,610
and when he married,

1021
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,360
uh,

1022
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:31,760
you know,

1023
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,530
Josephine,

1024
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:37,210
who once somebody said would have drunk
a goal out of the skull of any of her

1025
00:22:37,211 --> 00:22:38,020
lovers,

1026
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,470
uh,

1027
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,060
he made sure that the French,

1028
00:22:40,061 --> 00:22:40,540
uh,

1029
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:40,691
uh,

1030
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:41,051
that the,

1031
00:22:41,051 --> 00:22:43,420
that the French spelling,

1032
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,141
uh,

1033
00:22:44,141 --> 00:22:45,730
on the mirrored certificate,

1034
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,121
ah,

1035
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:47,120
was there and not,

1036
00:22:47,121 --> 00:22:47,531
and that the,

1037
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:49,000
you are the course that can,

1038
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:52,000
you had been taken out of his name,

1039
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:53,140
um,

1040
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:57,430
on the island of Saint Helena on in the
middle of nowhere where he had a lot of

1041
00:22:57,431 --> 00:22:58,264
time to sink.

1042
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,470
Um,

1043
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,303
he wrote,

1044
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,050
I am more shump in Wa.

1045
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,940
That was Shampine pinea where Britain,

1046
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,340
the town of Brianne was
his military school.

1047
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:06,460
Uh,

1048
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:06,750
you know,

1049
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,880
grass upon the champagne
and all these good things.

1050
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:14,110
I am more sharp in Wa then Corsican
because from the age of nine,

1051
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,120
I was raised in Brianne.

1052
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:20,590
It would have displeased the French if
I had surrounded myself with Corsicans.

1053
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,790
On the contrary,

1054
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:24,040
I want it to be absolutely to be French.

1055
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,450
Of all the insults I have had
heaped upon me in so many pamphlets.

1056
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:29,170
Uh,

1057
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:33,040
the one to which I was most
sensitive was that of being Corsica.

1058
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,120
Nope.

1059
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,040
Napoleon was an inveterate liar,

1060
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:36,910
uh,

1061
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,880
particularly when he was trying
to craft was quite clear.

1062
00:23:39,881 --> 00:23:40,960
He was already ill.

1063
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:41,590
Uh,

1064
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:46,160
his legacy and much of what he wrote
on the island about is eternal,

1065
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:46,910
uh,

1066
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:47,510
uh,

1067
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:52,190
devotion to the principles of Liberty
Fraternity inequality was I trying to plan

1068
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:56,570
these 220,000 articles and books
that will be written about him until,

1069
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:56,811
uh,

1070
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:57,644
1980.

1071
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:58,190
Uh,

1072
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:02,720
and this was a sheer invention of the
past because the record is quite clear in

1073
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:04,720
his writings and what he
said that he can sort of,

1074
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,613
so of course it can,

1075
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,500
but yet,

1076
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:06,830
uh,

1077
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:10,670
the French ness of the revolution
overwhelmed that in him.

1078
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,160
And in the end he remained a Frenchman,

1079
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,600
like very many people,

1080
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:14,931
uh,

1081
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:15,764
with a,

1082
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:16,270
uh,

1083
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,810
a strong accent.

1084
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,440
Uh,

1085
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,220
and in his case that of Corsica.

1086
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:22,641
Now,

1087
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:24,590
there were some other obvious
things that of course,

1088
00:24:24,591 --> 00:24:25,700
it can about him,

1089
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,001
uh,

1090
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:26,751
that remained.

1091
00:24:26,751 --> 00:24:27,081
And again,

1092
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:29,180
this is part of the
stereotype every when France,

1093
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,171
like other countries,

1094
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:33,470
one has stereotypes about
different regions in France.

1095
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:33,921
People think,

1096
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:34,431
for example,

1097
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,270
that th those from the
center of France from Vannia,

1098
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,120
uh,

1099
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,953
are cheap.

1100
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,450
Got Down in France that they're cheap.

1101
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,593
Uh,

1102
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,200
or that people in Maasais exaggerate.

1103
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:46,310
If you say something in French,

1104
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:46,940
uh,

1105
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,351
you're from,

1106
00:24:47,351 --> 00:24:47,781
I say,

1107
00:24:47,781 --> 00:24:48,231
aren't you?

1108
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:49,630
After they just said that they caught out,

1109
00:24:49,631 --> 00:24:50,220
you know,

1110
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,850
a thousand pound perch
or something like that,

1111
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:53,001
or,

1112
00:24:53,001 --> 00:24:53,271
or,

1113
00:24:53,271 --> 00:24:53,630
or,

1114
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,290
uh,

1115
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:54,951
uh,

1116
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:55,191
you know,

1117
00:24:55,191 --> 00:24:57,710
their mousay had just scored
the goal of the century.

1118
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,101
I mean,

1119
00:24:58,101 --> 00:25:00,440
there's a tendency and people
are Maasais to exaggerate.

1120
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,553
And these sort of,

1121
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,190
these sort of stare at regional
stereotypes are part of a,

1122
00:25:04,191 --> 00:25:04,640
of,

1123
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:04,840
of,

1124
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,560
of any of any country.

1125
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,880
So one of the stereotypes.

1126
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,230
So there's something to do this,

1127
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:09,880
uh,

1128
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,713
uh,

1129
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,100
truth with this is the
idea of family loyalty.

1130
00:25:13,101 --> 00:25:13,281
I mean,

1131
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:14,600
most people are loyal to the families,

1132
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:17,000
but Napoleon took the kind of clan,

1133
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:17,410
uh,

1134
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,243
identity,

1135
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:18,520
uh,

1136
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,000
a bit,

1137
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,140
uh,

1138
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,060
a bit strong.

1139
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:20,631
And of course,

1140
00:25:20,631 --> 00:25:22,220
what he does is he purchased his,

1141
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:22,610
uh,

1142
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,500
various brothers on the Thrones of,

1143
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:25,880
of almost everywhere,

1144
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:26,630
uh,

1145
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,980
this kind of family loyalty.

1146
00:25:27,981 --> 00:25:31,610
But it's not just people from Corsica who
might given that situation do the same

1147
00:25:31,611 --> 00:25:32,270
thing,

1148
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,370
but also there's the settling of scores.

1149
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,300
Uh,

1150
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,260
and Napoleon,

1151
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,370
uh,

1152
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,120
you know,

1153
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,680
I'll talk about this in a while.

1154
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:41,930
If you do believe that the period is,

1155
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,240
we can see the origins of total war there.

1156
00:25:44,241 --> 00:25:47,090
I'm a little skeptical about this.

1157
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:47,721
Nonetheless,

1158
00:25:47,721 --> 00:25:49,940
when people turned against Napoleon,

1159
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:50,960
uh,

1160
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,670
or against the French armies,

1161
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,740
his reaction was,

1162
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,431
we will,

1163
00:25:55,431 --> 00:25:59,270
we're going to pay him back and we're
going to get them not with flashing

1164
00:25:59,271 --> 00:26:00,104
knives,

1165
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,420
but with executions,

1166
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,420
uh,

1167
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:07,190
burning of villages in Palestine and
more about this later in the south of

1168
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,024
Italy.

1169
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,740
And then the two holes in the,

1170
00:26:09,741 --> 00:26:11,420
in the mountains of Austria.

1171
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,770
And whether,

1172
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:17,120
whether vengeance is more of a
course that can thing than a,

1173
00:26:17,121 --> 00:26:17,361
you know,

1174
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:19,400
a shop in Waf thing or a Leo ne thing,

1175
00:26:19,401 --> 00:26:20,810
or Brett tall thing,

1176
00:26:20,811 --> 00:26:23,480
or a north German thing or
Polish thing or whatever,

1177
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,793
one can't say,

1178
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:25,550
but yet,

1179
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,540
I know lots of the,

1180
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,690
of the thinking about Napoleon's looks
for things that remained course a can of

1181
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,533
course that can,

1182
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,420
um,

1183
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:32,601
uh,

1184
00:26:32,601 --> 00:26:33,260
of course it can,

1185
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:33,461
uh,

1186
00:26:33,461 --> 00:26:35,450
about him now.

1187
00:26:35,451 --> 00:26:36,284
Um,

1188
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,320
and I,

1189
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,460
having said all of that,

1190
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,360
what should we do?

1191
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:41,781
Let's,

1192
00:26:41,781 --> 00:26:41,991
yeah,

1193
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:44,760
let's now turn to this
question of whether,

1194
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:45,570
uh,

1195
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,470
we think,

1196
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:46,630
uh,

1197
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,150
and it's just a rhetorical question,

1198
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,940
whether a,

1199
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,210
my different David Bell is right,

1200
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:51,391
that,

1201
00:26:51,391 --> 00:26:51,690
that,

1202
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:52,523
uh,

1203
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,040
uh,

1204
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:58,040
that you can see the origins
of total war in this period.

1205
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:03,000
That one thing I'm a little skeptical
about is that if you compare this to the

1206
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:03,960
30 years' war,

1207
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:04,651
uh,

1208
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:07,710
and you saw those
ghoulish a illustrations,

1209
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:08,120
uh,

1210
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,290
uh,

1211
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:12,900
before of different ways you could perish
at the hands of enemies determined for

1212
00:27:12,901 --> 00:27:15,630
no particular reason in many
cases is simply destroy you.

1213
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:16,590
Uh,

1214
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:16,880
it,

1215
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,171
it's,

1216
00:27:17,171 --> 00:27:17,941
it's,

1217
00:27:17,941 --> 00:27:19,350
it's not clear whether that,

1218
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:21,290
the revolutionary period and the,

1219
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,080
uh,

1220
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,710
and,

1221
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,070
uh,

1222
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,570
the Napoleonic wars,

1223
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,433
uh,

1224
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,870
really it was the first,

1225
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,950
um,

1226
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,570
but yet if we think allow,

1227
00:27:30,571 --> 00:27:31,560
and that's what I'm doing.

1228
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:31,831
Uh,

1229
00:27:31,831 --> 00:27:35,910
if we see the origins of
total war in world war one,

1230
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:41,210
where the mobilization of state resources
as much as possible to the war and,

1231
00:27:42,851 --> 00:27:43,291
and again,

1232
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:44,580
in World War Two,

1233
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,450
uh,

1234
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:45,751
uh,

1235
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:46,380
and,

1236
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,213
uh,

1237
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,930
particularly in world war two,

1238
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:50,100
the breaking down of,

1239
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:50,820
of,

1240
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:50,940
uh,

1241
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,230
the differentiation between
civilians and non civilians.

1242
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,200
That happens a little bit
in 1914 but not that much.

1243
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,490
It happens in,

1244
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,600
in the massacre that Turkish massacres
of the Armenians in 1895 and 1915 that

1245
00:28:04,771 --> 00:28:05,640
happens too.

1246
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,690
Uh,

1247
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:07,230
but,

1248
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,063
um,

1249
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,240
it is possible to argue that the
revolutionary and particularly in the

1250
00:28:12,241 --> 00:28:13,260
pollyannic period,

1251
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,453
uh,

1252
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,900
from that point of view,

1253
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:16,800
the mobilization of,

1254
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:16,951
of,

1255
00:28:16,951 --> 00:28:17,131
you know,

1256
00:28:17,131 --> 00:28:19,260
burning down or melting church bells and,

1257
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:19,740
and,

1258
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,190
and,

1259
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:20,341
you know,

1260
00:28:20,341 --> 00:28:21,240
transforming,

1261
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:22,441
uh,

1262
00:28:22,441 --> 00:28:22,651
you know,

1263
00:28:22,651 --> 00:28:26,760
almost every available industrial
site into war production and,

1264
00:28:26,761 --> 00:28:29,310
and turning down all these
cannonballs and all these,

1265
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,780
all these rifles,

1266
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,420
uh,

1267
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:31,771
uh,

1268
00:28:31,771 --> 00:28:34,440
and all these swords
and all these band nets,

1269
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,341
uh,

1270
00:28:35,341 --> 00:28:35,871
with the,

1271
00:28:35,871 --> 00:28:37,830
the total resources of the state,

1272
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,060
um,

1273
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,400
directed toward war.

1274
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,091
That,

1275
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:42,391
I mean,

1276
00:28:42,391 --> 00:28:42,590
there,

1277
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,250
there is a a point there.

1278
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:46,050
So there's really two
sides of that argument.

1279
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:46,660
Uh,

1280
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,790
that that's one,

1281
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,320
the mobilization of resources,

1282
00:28:49,321 --> 00:28:50,210
the Levee en masse,

1283
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:50,400
the,

1284
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:50,870
the,

1285
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:50,990
uh,

1286
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,440
mass military conscription,

1287
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,071
uh,

1288
00:28:53,071 --> 00:28:54,390
that all citizens,

1289
00:28:54,391 --> 00:28:57,690
the male citizens are going to be part of,

1290
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:58,050
uh,

1291
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:58,321
of the,

1292
00:28:58,321 --> 00:28:59,850
are going to be in the army.

1293
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,241
Uh,

1294
00:29:00,241 --> 00:29:03,670
this starts with the French
revolution after all voted me was the,

1295
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,531
the battle.

1296
00:29:04,531 --> 00:29:07,020
And you're the windmill
near shuttle on some fine.

1297
00:29:07,021 --> 00:29:07,281
Yeah.

1298
00:29:07,281 --> 00:29:08,400
And the east of France,

1299
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,160
uh,

1300
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,460
the song culottes going to a war was,

1301
00:29:11,461 --> 00:29:11,881
was,

1302
00:29:11,881 --> 00:29:12,390
uh,

1303
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:12,810
uh,

1304
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:13,020
you know,

1305
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,310
was the Levee en masse.

1306
00:29:14,311 --> 00:29:15,480
We're ordinary people,

1307
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:15,900
uh,

1308
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,161
are,

1309
00:29:16,161 --> 00:29:18,840
are full of enthusiasm and singing.

1310
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:20,520
Patriotic songs are heading off to,

1311
00:29:20,521 --> 00:29:21,000
uh,

1312
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,211
uh,

1313
00:29:21,211 --> 00:29:21,571
to,

1314
00:29:21,571 --> 00:29:22,060
um,

1315
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,893
uh,

1316
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:23,610
uh,

1317
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,660
to fight the enemy.

1318
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,780
But the other side of this
total war story is of course,

1319
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:28,430
uh,

1320
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:28,980
um,

1321
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,191
you know,

1322
00:29:29,191 --> 00:29:32,100
what happens to this
feeling in population and,

1323
00:29:32,101 --> 00:29:32,431
and,

1324
00:29:32,431 --> 00:29:32,881
and,

1325
00:29:32,881 --> 00:29:33,420
uh,

1326
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,253
uh,

1327
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,730
Napoleon once said,

1328
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,593
uh,

1329
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,870
in one of his rare moments of,

1330
00:29:39,871 --> 00:29:42,340
of a real introspection,

1331
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:43,121
I,

1332
00:29:43,121 --> 00:29:44,350
that he didn't give a damn if,

1333
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:44,921
if a,

1334
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:48,900
a million men are a million
people died because of them.

1335
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,373
Uh,

1336
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,041
he,

1337
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:51,874
um,

1338
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:52,610
uh,

1339
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:52,881
he,

1340
00:29:52,881 --> 00:29:54,800
he believed every part of his,

1341
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,041
you know,

1342
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:56,350
a great failing is great.

1343
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:57,910
There's a great weakness and,

1344
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,031
and,

1345
00:29:58,031 --> 00:29:58,201
and,

1346
00:29:58,201 --> 00:29:58,711
and the,

1347
00:29:58,711 --> 00:30:01,130
the suffering of humanity
because of it was his identity.

1348
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:01,520
The,

1349
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,100
his sense that no matter what he did,

1350
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:03,911
there was the right thing to do.

1351
00:30:03,911 --> 00:30:08,860
He has is the sort of hallucination
moment in about 1896 after one of his

1352
00:30:08,861 --> 00:30:09,281
battles.

1353
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:10,750
I think it's our call where,

1354
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,430
where he sees after himself,

1355
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:15,310
he sees themselves transported
in the air and the,

1356
00:30:15,311 --> 00:30:18,940
and that the whole world seemed to be
like you're taking off on an airplane.

1357
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:19,840
Uh,

1358
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,640
the whole world is beneath him.

1359
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:22,750
And at that point,

1360
00:30:22,751 --> 00:30:24,430
he has this sort of sense that,

1361
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:29,520
that what he would will as a human being
would inevitably because become reality

1362
00:30:29,531 --> 00:30:30,850
because he willed it.

1363
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:35,200
And the other half of the sort
of total war aspect is that,

1364
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:35,830
you know,

1365
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:38,260
to be sure and not only,

1366
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:38,830
uh,

1367
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:42,100
did something like one of every French
males born who would have been eligible

1368
00:30:42,101 --> 00:30:47,101
for military Terry Service die during
the revolution and Napoleonic wars.

1369
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,000
Uh,

1370
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,581
but the,

1371
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:50,690
the sort of meaning out of,

1372
00:30:50,691 --> 00:30:51,060
of,

1373
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:51,410
of,

1374
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:56,170
of a brutal vengeance more than just
in a course that consents to people who

1375
00:30:56,171 --> 00:30:57,640
crossed his will,

1376
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,830
does anticipate in some ways,

1377
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:00,461
if you will.

1378
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:02,350
And I'm not even sure
you know how much I shop.

1379
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:02,861
I leave that,

1380
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,694
believe this,

1381
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,240
but,

1382
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:04,301
uh,

1383
00:31:04,301 --> 00:31:05,500
the 20th century,

1384
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,310
um,

1385
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:09,790
because on one hand is as the difference
between soldiers and civilians are,

1386
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:10,540
uh,

1387
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,280
are being eliminated,

1388
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:12,761
uh,

1389
00:31:12,761 --> 00:31:13,750
with the sort of,

1390
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,350
uh,

1391
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:18,400
the end of the really just professional
army of the 18th century as hospital get

1392
00:31:18,401 --> 00:31:20,170
a lot of people killed
in the 18th century to,

1393
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:20,930
uh,

1394
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,180
and that those professional,

1395
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:22,830
uh,

1396
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,663
uh,

1397
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,150
army wars and,

1398
00:31:25,151 --> 00:31:26,560
and all that business,

1399
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,340
uh,

1400
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:27,940
but,

1401
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,320
but victims to,

1402
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:29,981
uh,

1403
00:31:29,981 --> 00:31:31,720
are not just military people.

1404
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:32,171
And of course,

1405
00:31:32,171 --> 00:31:35,890
the worst atrocities
committed by French troops,

1406
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:36,401
uh,

1407
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:37,120
were,

1408
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,810
uh,

1409
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:38,111
uh,

1410
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:41,200
in this sort of madcap Egyptian,

1411
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:41,380
uh,

1412
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,370
Middle Eastern,

1413
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:42,940
uh,

1414
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,730
adventure when he goes off
with a boat packed with,

1415
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,450
with scientists as well as munitions and,

1416
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,600
and lots to eat.

1417
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,770
And it goes off to Egypt.

1418
00:31:50,771 --> 00:31:52,600
And imagine the conquering India.

1419
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,391
I mean,

1420
00:31:53,391 --> 00:31:55,810
and he had an idea how far India was away.

1421
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:56,621
And of course,

1422
00:31:56,621 --> 00:31:58,300
when people don't put up with this,

1423
00:31:58,301 --> 00:32:00,040
then he massacres them in Palestine.

1424
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:00,431
They just,

1425
00:32:00,431 --> 00:32:01,600
they raised villages.

1426
00:32:01,601 --> 00:32:02,590
And that's the end of that.

1427
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,330
And as I said before,

1428
00:32:04,331 --> 00:32:07,030
the examples before
would be a in Calabria,

1429
00:32:07,031 --> 00:32:07,841
in the south of,

1430
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:08,111
of,

1431
00:32:08,111 --> 00:32:08,471
of,

1432
00:32:08,471 --> 00:32:08,980
uh,

1433
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,401
of,

1434
00:32:09,401 --> 00:32:10,234
um,

1435
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,330
of Italy when there,

1436
00:32:11,331 --> 00:32:12,820
when there is persistent,

1437
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,300
so rebellions resistance
to French rule and why not?

1438
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:16,900
Uh,

1439
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,150
then they just start massacring people.

1440
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:19,900
Uh,

1441
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,680
and of course the famous
case of Spain where you have,

1442
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,320
uh,

1443
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:23,831
that are,

1444
00:32:23,831 --> 00:32:24,011
you know,

1445
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:26,950
forever on these magnificent
canvases of Goya,

1446
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:27,850
uh,

1447
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:28,210
uh,

1448
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:31,720
that were French troops are
shooting down Spanish peasants,

1449
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,500
uh,

1450
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,020
who are resisting in the peninsular war.

1451
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:35,411
You know,

1452
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:35,951
these two.

1453
00:32:35,951 --> 00:32:38,080
But I guess by more modern definitions,

1454
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:38,860
uh,

1455
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:38,960
uh,

1456
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,300
not contemporary ones
necessarily from that period,

1457
00:32:41,301 --> 00:32:42,950
but we would be classified as,

1458
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,210
as massacres.

1459
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,970
So it's possible this isn't
too far fetched to imagine,

1460
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:47,590
uh,

1461
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,100
the,

1462
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,140
the sort of total war is
as being part of that,

1463
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,250
of that experience.

1464
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:53,270
And W from seventh,

1465
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:53,630
from,

1466
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:53,961
whoa,

1467
00:32:53,961 --> 00:32:55,100
really from 1792,

1468
00:32:55,101 --> 00:32:55,580
two,

1469
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:55,761
two,

1470
00:32:55,761 --> 00:32:56,151
18,

1471
00:32:56,151 --> 00:32:56,601
15,

1472
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:58,100
the experience of ordinary people,

1473
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:58,480
uh,

1474
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,870
in much of Europe was war.

1475
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:00,890
Uh,

1476
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:01,521
so,

1477
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:01,870
uh,

1478
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:02,270
you know,

1479
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:02,811
there is,

1480
00:33:02,811 --> 00:33:03,200
uh,

1481
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,800
uh,

1482
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,131
you know,

1483
00:33:04,131 --> 00:33:04,271
there,

1484
00:33:04,271 --> 00:33:04,491
there,

1485
00:33:04,491 --> 00:33:04,731
there,

1486
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:06,110
there is that too,

1487
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,100
and you know,

1488
00:33:07,101 --> 00:33:07,641
in a,

1489
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:09,380
in Napoleon's reaction to all of that,

1490
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:09,980
uh,

1491
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,341
was,

1492
00:33:10,341 --> 00:33:10,481
I mean,

1493
00:33:10,481 --> 00:33:11,090
as you're [inaudible],

1494
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:11,360
I mean,

1495
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:11,551
he,

1496
00:33:11,551 --> 00:33:12,260
he,

1497
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,400
he didn't really care.

1498
00:33:13,401 --> 00:33:14,750
And after every big defeat,

1499
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:15,560
uh,

1500
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,350
the next step was to
plant plan the next war.

1501
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,390
And the most famous
example of course is when,

1502
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,340
uh,

1503
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,210
you've got hundreds of
thousands of people that are,

1504
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:23,451
you know,

1505
00:33:23,451 --> 00:33:25,940
that are picked off by Russian partisans.

1506
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:26,930
And why not,

1507
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:27,590
uh,

1508
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:31,010
or freeze to death in the Russian winter.

1509
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:31,500
I,

1510
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:36,500
when Napoleon with this as sort of a
ragtag band of survivors when they,

1511
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:36,980
uh,

1512
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,131
uh,

1513
00:33:37,131 --> 00:33:37,281
you know,

1514
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:38,540
when they get back to France,

1515
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,200
uh,

1516
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,650
uh,

1517
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:44,030
one can see why that French expression
to lie like a military bulletin comes

1518
00:33:44,031 --> 00:33:46,460
into existence because
the military Woolton that,

1519
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,301
that people,

1520
00:33:47,301 --> 00:33:51,110
that church people had to read
that priest had to read in a,

1521
00:33:51,111 --> 00:33:53,690
at mass said that,

1522
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,200
uh,

1523
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,030
the emperor's health
and never been better.

1524
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,010
And of course that was true enough.

1525
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:58,850
Uh,

1526
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,830
and he immediately begins to start,

1527
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,160
uh,

1528
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,700
planning,

1529
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:01,940
uh,

1530
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,870
another war.

1531
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,591
And of course,

1532
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:04,161
when he,

1533
00:34:04,161 --> 00:34:04,790
uh,

1534
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,320
when you know caustics,

1535
00:34:06,321 --> 00:34:06,740
uh,

1536
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,170
are,

1537
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:07,450
are,

1538
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:11,600
are camped on [inaudible] and indeed start
the first Russian restaurant in Paris

1539
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,790
in 1814 and he's packed off to,

1540
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:15,950
to the island of Elba,

1541
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:16,401
uh,

1542
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:18,110
not too far from the Italian coast,

1543
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,770
and he makes his hundred days
escape and lands at Frazier in the,

1544
00:34:21,771 --> 00:34:23,000
in the south of France.

1545
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:23,510
Uh,

1546
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:27,830
and Marshall Ne a famously throws himself
into his arms after having been sent

1547
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:28,664
to arrest him.

1548
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:29,210
Uh,

1549
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:31,430
Napoleon is immediately
planning the next war.

1550
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,030
Uh,

1551
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,020
and then that ends,

1552
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:33,830
uh,

1553
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:36,200
and I'll happily for the
rest of Europe at Waterloo,

1554
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:37,130
uh,

1555
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,360
when Napoleon,

1556
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:38,830
uh,

1557
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:43,670
typically does not designate or delegate
enough authority and Marshall Gushi

1558
00:34:43,671 --> 00:34:48,170
does not come to to rescue him and
he's rounded up and sent so far away.

1559
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,003
It's a little,

1560
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,670
it's a little different difficulty to
plan the next year of Korean War if the

1561
00:34:52,671 --> 00:34:55,940
closest port is some 600
miles away and is in PR who,

1562
00:34:55,941 --> 00:34:58,040
or someplace like that.

1563
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:58,641
So,

1564
00:34:58,641 --> 00:34:59,120
um,

1565
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,420
I,

1566
00:34:59,420 --> 00:34:59,830
I mean,

1567
00:34:59,830 --> 00:34:59,950
I,

1568
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:00,300
I,

1569
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,760
I made this part of what I'm saying
today and it's kind of a rhetorical way.

1570
00:35:04,761 --> 00:35:05,920
I'm posing a question,

1571
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:06,140
you know,

1572
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,390
cause I don't really have
a good answer to that.

1573
00:35:08,391 --> 00:35:08,751
But if you,

1574
00:35:08,751 --> 00:35:09,320
if you,

1575
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,360
I don't believe that history
runs on railroad tracks,

1576
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:14,750
and all you need is the timetable
to see when modern times show up.

1577
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,230
But if you look at the horrors
of the 20th century and you know,

1578
00:35:19,231 --> 00:35:19,730
the,

1579
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:19,940
uh,

1580
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,320
the butchery of civilians,

1581
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:21,741
uh,

1582
00:35:21,741 --> 00:35:21,921
well,

1583
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:26,390
1895 they Armenian massacre
or the butchery of civilians
after the Paris commune

1584
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,890
of 1871,

1585
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,770
it's not too hard to see all of this.

1586
00:35:30,771 --> 00:35:33,350
We're not yet talking
about about the Holocaust.

1587
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,420
We're not talking about World War Two,

1588
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,110
uh,

1589
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,740
but yet some of that,

1590
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:38,460
uh,

1591
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,530
some of that was out there and,

1592
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,250
uh,

1593
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:41,860
that,

1594
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:41,910
uh,

1595
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:42,151
you know,

1596
00:35:42,151 --> 00:35:42,321
I,

1597
00:35:42,321 --> 00:35:42,691
again,

1598
00:35:42,691 --> 00:35:43,720
one more point to is,

1599
00:35:43,721 --> 00:35:44,580
is that I ran,

1600
00:35:44,581 --> 00:35:46,710
I'm not obviously not defending
the know French soldiers,

1601
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,000
uh,

1602
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,520
in the,

1603
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,360
it's very unusual for me not to
be defending lafond everything,

1604
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,373
all things French,

1605
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:52,710
but,

1606
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,543
but nonetheless,

1607
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,030
uh,

1608
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:54,331
you know,

1609
00:35:54,331 --> 00:35:58,560
one of the cases that you might say
total war comes before Napoleon,

1610
00:35:58,561 --> 00:35:59,071
and this of course,

1611
00:35:59,071 --> 00:35:59,791
is the Von Day,

1612
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,230
which I alluded to the other day.

1613
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:01,581
Uh,

1614
00:36:01,581 --> 00:36:02,850
the civil war in the West,

1615
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,610
because there you had cases of
them simply razing villages and,

1616
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,700
and lining people up against the wall and,

1617
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:08,871
and,

1618
00:36:08,871 --> 00:36:13,010
and gunning down priests and drowning
nuns and this sort of extremely antiques,

1619
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,500
uh,

1620
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,300
a social antisocial behavior.

1621
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,200
Uh,

1622
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,520
but one of the things that,

1623
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:17,761
uh,

1624
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:18,391
about,

1625
00:36:18,391 --> 00:36:18,600
you know,

1626
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:23,010
these civil wars and the case was what
was the true in Spain is that from point

1627
00:36:23,011 --> 00:36:23,850
of view of soldiers,

1628
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,490
anybody who was a PR in a guerrilla war,

1629
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,260
anyone was,

1630
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:28,980
uh,

1631
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,241
uh,

1632
00:36:29,241 --> 00:36:30,450
a potential,

1633
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:30,610
uh,

1634
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:31,443
assailant.

1635
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,311
Uh,

1636
00:36:32,311 --> 00:36:33,071
and so again,

1637
00:36:33,071 --> 00:36:36,510
and this is not excusing
what French troops did,

1638
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:37,080
uh,

1639
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,190
in the von day,

1640
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,050
but two made it a big political issue,

1641
00:36:40,051 --> 00:36:42,240
which people did in 1989,

1642
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:46,020
the 200th anniversary of the French
revolution and say as the first genocide,

1643
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,060
which is what the far right was saying,

1644
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,470
a traditional far right,

1645
00:36:49,471 --> 00:36:50,640
not Le Pen and [inaudible].

1646
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,170
And those folks who would be happy to,

1647
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:52,381
you know,

1648
00:36:52,381 --> 00:36:53,001
massacre,

1649
00:36:53,001 --> 00:36:53,400
uh,

1650
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,230
almost anybody who they
didn't view is French,

1651
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:55,680
but,

1652
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,100
uh,

1653
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,331
uh,

1654
00:36:56,331 --> 00:36:57,200
I mean it is,

1655
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,100
sure is his sheer nonsense.

1656
00:36:59,101 --> 00:36:59,470
It's a,

1657
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,690
it's simply not the case.

1658
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,350
So,

1659
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:01,681
I mean,

1660
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:02,430
there are some,

1661
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:05,010
there are some contexts that
that should be provided,

1662
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:05,570
uh,

1663
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,080
uh,

1664
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,250
in,

1665
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,650
in thinking about that.

1666
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,870
But it's an interesting theme
and it's worth discussing.

1667
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:10,261
And when you're,

1668
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:11,094
when you're doing,

1669
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:11,550
uh,

1670
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,061
this reading,

1671
00:37:12,061 --> 00:37:13,440
which I hope you will do,

1672
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,100
um,

1673
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:14,611
that,

1674
00:37:14,611 --> 00:37:14,791
uh,

1675
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:17,160
that's not a bad idea to think about.

1676
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,210
Okay.

1677
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,043
Um,

1678
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,580
let me just make a,

1679
00:37:20,581 --> 00:37:20,880
you know,

1680
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,810
a few points.

1681
00:37:21,811 --> 00:37:23,070
We have about 10 minutes left,

1682
00:37:23,071 --> 00:37:24,900
and this is just to amplify what,

1683
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,470
uh,

1684
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,880
what you're reading about.

1685
00:37:26,881 --> 00:37:27,151
I mean,

1686
00:37:27,151 --> 00:37:27,631
because,

1687
00:37:27,631 --> 00:37:28,260
um,

1688
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:28,411
you know,

1689
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:30,810
anyone who's ever had to
wait in line at a prefecture,

1690
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,290
uh,

1691
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,440
in France for a driver's license,

1692
00:37:34,441 --> 00:37:35,101
or in our case,

1693
00:37:35,101 --> 00:37:36,960
our are a French identity cards,

1694
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:37,800
uh,

1695
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,311
or,

1696
00:37:38,311 --> 00:37:38,850
uh,

1697
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:39,900
almost anything else.

1698
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:40,470
Uh,

1699
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:41,850
we'll be cursing Napoleon,

1700
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,450
uh,

1701
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,220
for having,

1702
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:43,500
uh,

1703
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,610
maintain this sort of centralization
that emerged out of absolutism,

1704
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:48,330
uh,

1705
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,380
and was honed,

1706
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:49,800
uh,

1707
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,920
in defense of the republic
by folks like the,

1708
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,920
of public safety.

1709
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:53,490
Uh,

1710
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,260
but we're Napoleon,

1711
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:55,620
uh,

1712
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,370
founded,

1713
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:56,721
uh,

1714
00:37:56,721 --> 00:37:56,901
you know,

1715
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:57,691
a rational,

1716
00:37:57,691 --> 00:38:00,870
enlightened way on honor gimme in quotes,

1717
00:38:00,871 --> 00:38:02,060
enlightened way out of the,

1718
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,230
out of the enlightenment
way of organizing a state.

1719
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:04,920
Um,

1720
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,131
and,

1721
00:38:05,131 --> 00:38:05,940
and certainly,

1722
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,270
uh,

1723
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:06,990
Napoleon,

1724
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:07,291
uh,

1725
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:08,540
who,

1726
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,030
you know,

1727
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:13,770
whether he snatched the crown out of the
Pope's hand and crowned himself or let

1728
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:14,940
the pope crown him,

1729
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:15,301
uh,

1730
00:38:15,301 --> 00:38:16,200
is not the issue.

1731
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:16,411
I mean,

1732
00:38:16,411 --> 00:38:18,360
Napoleon could have pretty
much done whatever he wanted.

1733
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:18,930
Uh,

1734
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:19,441
but in fact,

1735
00:38:19,441 --> 00:38:21,030
what he does is he maintains,

1736
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:21,710
uh,

1737
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:21,870
uh,

1738
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:24,050
they did the departments
that each pop come,

1739
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:24,630
all,

1740
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,110
uh,

1741
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:25,650
and,

1742
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:26,483
um,

1743
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,380
the department is created in 1790.

1744
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,790
They send a prefect,

1745
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,510
uh,

1746
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:30,961
who is,

1747
00:38:30,961 --> 00:38:31,070
uh,

1748
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:31,300
you know,

1749
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,240
like the intendant,

1750
00:38:32,241 --> 00:38:32,940
but w w,

1751
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,360
uh,

1752
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,030
uh,

1753
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:34,290
uh,

1754
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,590
even more centralized,

1755
00:38:35,591 --> 00:38:38,140
the all chrome dome to
each day pop them all,

1756
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,213
uh,

1757
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,050
in 1800.

1758
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:46,180
And they keep the same kind of
top down centralized organization.

1759
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:46,810
Uh,

1760
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:47,051
you know,

1761
00:38:47,051 --> 00:38:47,770
if somebody wants to,

1762
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:51,730
the gall was divided up into three parts.

1763
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:51,941
One,

1764
00:38:51,941 --> 00:38:53,020
thinking about France,

1765
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:53,421
uh,

1766
00:38:53,421 --> 00:38:55,680
at the time of Napoleon or
anytime afterward could say,

1767
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:56,800
take the same thing that,

1768
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:57,370
that,

1769
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,050
that France was divided up into,

1770
00:38:59,250 --> 00:38:59,420
uh,

1771
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,650
the Ministry of the interior
of the Ministry of Justice
and the Ministry of war.

1772
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:03,360
Uh,

1773
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:03,850
and he,

1774
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,830
he Napoleon who ruthlessly,

1775
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:06,790
uh,

1776
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:10,030
censored newspapers and they're
forced them out of business.

1777
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,280
And made the costs of their continuation.

1778
00:39:12,281 --> 00:39:13,450
So extremely difficult.

1779
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:13,990
Uh,

1780
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:14,451
wow.

1781
00:39:14,451 --> 00:39:17,830
Organizing or orchestrating
the cult of Napoleon,

1782
00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:20,080
whether it be through
sort of paid artists,

1783
00:39:20,081 --> 00:39:20,531
some of them,

1784
00:39:20,531 --> 00:39:20,710
you know,

1785
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,970
extremely great artist,

1786
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:22,630
uh,

1787
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,230
or,

1788
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:23,780
uh,

1789
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,090
lesser versions.

1790
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,720
Uh,

1791
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,553
uh,

1792
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:26,951
uh,

1793
00:39:26,951 --> 00:39:27,381
he,

1794
00:39:27,381 --> 00:39:29,760
he maintains the kind
of centralization that,

1795
00:39:29,761 --> 00:39:29,921
that,

1796
00:39:29,921 --> 00:39:31,390
that became important in,

1797
00:39:31,391 --> 00:39:31,801
in,

1798
00:39:31,801 --> 00:39:32,230
uh,

1799
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:32,710
uh,

1800
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,770
in France and in places where we're,

1801
00:39:34,771 --> 00:39:35,190
we're,

1802
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:35,740
uh,

1803
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,311
uh,

1804
00:39:36,311 --> 00:39:36,511
the,

1805
00:39:36,511 --> 00:39:39,250
the waves of French troops
at Liberty Fraternity,

1806
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,050
equality and all of that in quotes,

1807
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:41,890
uh,

1808
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:42,310
uh,

1809
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,210
and ended up,

1810
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:43,610
I mean,

1811
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:43,811
that,

1812
00:39:43,811 --> 00:39:45,070
that may maintains,

1813
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:45,860
um,

1814
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,780
is maintained.

1815
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:47,450
Um,

1816
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:47,690
he,

1817
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:50,230
he liked to think that
the Napoleonic code,

1818
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:50,801
uh,

1819
00:39:50,801 --> 00:39:51,250
was,

1820
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,083
um,

1821
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,410
was his greater,

1822
00:39:53,411 --> 00:39:53,790
uh,

1823
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:53,930
uh,

1824
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,030
greatest contribution.

1825
00:39:55,031 --> 00:39:56,060
He wanted him to be the,

1826
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:57,340
the modern Justinian.

1827
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,121
And in fact,

1828
00:39:58,121 --> 00:40:00,490
he does oversee lots of the beatings of,

1829
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:00,930
of,

1830
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,220
of lawyers and,

1831
00:40:02,221 --> 00:40:02,660
and,

1832
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,120
and,

1833
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:03,330
you know,

1834
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,930
jurists and specialists.

1835
00:40:04,931 --> 00:40:05,380
And,

1836
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:05,640
you know,

1837
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:05,951
I mean,

1838
00:40:05,951 --> 00:40:07,450
it's classic looking back from our view.

1839
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:07,661
I mean,

1840
00:40:07,661 --> 00:40:09,580
it's patently ridiculous
that there were many,

1841
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:12,850
many more times articles
dealing with the sale of cattle.

1842
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,050
Then there were a,

1843
00:40:14,051 --> 00:40:15,100
of the rights of women.

1844
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:15,401
Now,

1845
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:16,870
this isn't too surprising because,

1846
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,200
uh,

1847
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,030
Napoleon,

1848
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:18,480
uh,

1849
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,140
uh,

1850
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:19,411
uh,

1851
00:40:19,411 --> 00:40:23,140
as many dictators are including much
more egregious ones that Mussolini and

1852
00:40:23,141 --> 00:40:23,591
Hitler in the,

1853
00:40:23,591 --> 00:40:23,831
in the,

1854
00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:24,700
in the 20th century,

1855
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:25,360
uh,

1856
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,630
viewed women as nothing more than
machines for producing babies.

1857
00:40:28,631 --> 00:40:29,350
And he said this,

1858
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,210
he said this exactly like that.

1859
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:32,140
Um,

1860
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:32,973
and so,

1861
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,590
uh,

1862
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:33,850
but,

1863
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:34,450
but yet,

1864
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:34,871
yet,

1865
00:40:34,871 --> 00:40:35,031
and,

1866
00:40:35,031 --> 00:40:35,441
and I mean,

1867
00:40:35,441 --> 00:40:36,340
that's a big yet,

1868
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,000
uh,

1869
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,190
the Napoleon on a code survives and,

1870
00:40:39,191 --> 00:40:42,580
and remains in many cases the
basis for the French legal system.

1871
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,390
Uh,

1872
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,201
and so again,

1873
00:40:44,201 --> 00:40:45,820
this is an enlightenment,

1874
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,970
a enterprise in many ways gone,

1875
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,620
right?

1876
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,150
Uh,

1877
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,260
and it is there,

1878
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,010
um,

1879
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:51,221
uh,

1880
00:40:51,221 --> 00:40:52,980
among the other side of contributions,

1881
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:53,710
uh,

1882
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,101
I mean,

1883
00:40:54,101 --> 00:40:55,090
we don't have really time to talk about,

1884
00:40:55,091 --> 00:40:57,910
and it's obvious about this sort
of nationalism and that that one's,

1885
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:03,180
one's value comes from service to the
state as opposed from royal blood.

1886
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:04,340
Uh,

1887
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,790
though he creates this noon ability,

1888
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:07,510
uh,

1889
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:07,691
uh,

1890
00:41:07,691 --> 00:41:09,550
based upon service to the state.

1891
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:11,180
And the service of the state was a,

1892
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:12,960
was a bubble,

1893
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:13,450
uh,

1894
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:14,261
through the army.

1895
00:41:14,261 --> 00:41:16,210
So a lot of these people who
become marshals and all of this,

1896
00:41:16,211 --> 00:41:19,870
if they were lucky enough to
survive all these ridiculous wars,

1897
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:20,380
uh,

1898
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:20,960
our,

1899
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,151
our,

1900
00:41:21,151 --> 00:41:22,600
our military types.

1901
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,320
Uh,

1902
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:23,741
but,

1903
00:41:23,741 --> 00:41:24,220
um,

1904
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:24,551
I,

1905
00:41:24,551 --> 00:41:25,240
he,

1906
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:25,511
he,

1907
00:41:25,511 --> 00:41:25,781
you know,

1908
00:41:25,781 --> 00:41:27,020
the deployment of code and,

1909
00:41:27,021 --> 00:41:27,231
and,

1910
00:41:27,231 --> 00:41:28,450
and this new sort of service,

1911
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:29,140
uh,

1912
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,790
a nobility are important things.

1913
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,200
The [inaudible] he does,

1914
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:32,410
uh,

1915
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,050
uh,

1916
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:33,770
uh,

1917
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:34,670
a very important thing.

1918
00:41:34,671 --> 00:41:34,861
And He,

1919
00:41:34,861 --> 00:41:36,300
and he makes peace with,

1920
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:36,710
uh,

1921
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,120
with,

1922
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,150
with the Catholic Church.

1923
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,230
Uh,

1924
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:39,800
and,

1925
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,633
um,

1926
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,770
he realized that,

1927
00:41:41,771 --> 00:41:42,080
that,

1928
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:46,240
that as long as you had this potential
contrast between during priests and non

1929
00:41:46,241 --> 00:41:47,074
during priests,

1930
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:47,850
uh,

1931
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,310
and that I,

1932
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,870
you would still have lots of,

1933
00:41:50,871 --> 00:41:51,111
of,

1934
00:41:51,111 --> 00:41:51,561
of,

1935
00:41:51,561 --> 00:41:56,561
of Middleton Catholics who wanted some
sort of royalist a restoration and indeed

1936
00:41:56,841 --> 00:41:58,040
him and the king was dead.

1937
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:58,730
Uh,

1938
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:01,130
and his son had died also in prison,

1939
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:01,600
uh,

1940
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:01,730
uh,

1941
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:02,450
in Paris.

1942
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:03,283
But you've still got,

1943
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:03,950
uh,

1944
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:04,131
you know,

1945
00:42:04,131 --> 00:42:05,720
still got the king's brother out there.

1946
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:06,350
And,

1947
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:06,800
uh,

1948
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:06,951
uh,

1949
00:42:06,951 --> 00:42:07,731
so it's a very,

1950
00:42:07,731 --> 00:42:08,990
very shrewd move.

1951
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,441
Of course,

1952
00:42:09,441 --> 00:42:12,140
he uses the church for his
own propaganda devices.

1953
00:42:12,141 --> 00:42:12,291
And,

1954
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:12,760
and,

1955
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,310
and,

1956
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:13,731
and,

1957
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:14,060
uh,

1958
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:14,271
you know,

1959
00:42:14,271 --> 00:42:15,170
the tr church,

1960
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:16,820
it continues to tradition of the,

1961
00:42:16,821 --> 00:42:18,920
really the civil constitution
of the French clergy,

1962
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:19,760
uh,

1963
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,121
uh,

1964
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:21,920
the relationship between the Church and,

1965
00:42:21,921 --> 00:42:22,371
and,

1966
00:42:22,371 --> 00:42:22,910
uh,

1967
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:23,511
uh,

1968
00:42:23,511 --> 00:42:26,150
and the regime and the planet regime.

1969
00:42:26,151 --> 00:42:27,110
But this is an important,

1970
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,063
very important,

1971
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:29,040
clever,

1972
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:29,873
a step,

1973
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:30,520
uh,

1974
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:30,710
uh,

1975
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:30,951
that,

1976
00:42:30,951 --> 00:42:32,770
that basically ends the,

1977
00:42:32,771 --> 00:42:33,011
the,

1978
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:33,251
the,

1979
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:34,310
the turmoil,

1980
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:34,940
uh,

1981
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,773
within,

1982
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:36,590
um,

1983
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:41,060
within France at least in and add that
to the extent and the old revolutionary

1984
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:43,370
calendar of Jeremy Nolen
voluntold this and,

1985
00:42:43,371 --> 00:42:43,760
and,

1986
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,310
uh,

1987
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:44,900
uh,

1988
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,950
uh,

1989
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:46,581
Thermador he,

1990
00:42:46,581 --> 00:42:46,761
I mean,

1991
00:42:46,761 --> 00:42:49,730
that all disappears and is
replaced by the basic calendar.

1992
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:50,540
Uh,

1993
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:50,721
you know,

1994
00:42:50,721 --> 00:42:51,250
people,

1995
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:51,570
uh,

1996
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,001
still in,

1997
00:42:52,001 --> 00:42:52,161
you know,

1998
00:42:52,161 --> 00:42:54,650
in 1796 and 95,

1999
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,220
uh,

2000
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,240
in rural France,

2001
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:56,660
uh,

2002
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,790
are not thinking of,

2003
00:42:57,791 --> 00:42:58,050
you know,

2004
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:00,200
10 day units called Decky d,

2005
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:00,830
uh,

2006
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:01,641
something like that.

2007
00:43:01,641 --> 00:43:01,781
They're,

2008
00:43:01,781 --> 00:43:03,770
they're thinking of
weeks and they still are,

2009
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:04,320
uh,

2010
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:04,700
are,

2011
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,120
are,

2012
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,710
are having math said secretly,

2013
00:43:06,711 --> 00:43:08,000
which was the case in our village.

2014
00:43:08,001 --> 00:43:08,420
Uh,

2015
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:08,601
uh,

2016
00:43:08,601 --> 00:43:10,130
even in 1794,

2017
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:11,031
until they finally,

2018
00:43:11,031 --> 00:43:11,760
the priest,

2019
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,260
uh,

2020
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:12,861
has to,

2021
00:43:12,861 --> 00:43:13,280
uh,

2022
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:13,431
uh,

2023
00:43:13,431 --> 00:43:14,420
it has to go away.

2024
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:14,900
Uh,

2025
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,081
but,

2026
00:43:15,081 --> 00:43:16,460
but the comb corp did this,

2027
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:17,780
this creation of,

2028
00:43:17,781 --> 00:43:18,190
of,

2029
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:19,023
um,

2030
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:19,901
maybe this piece with,

2031
00:43:19,901 --> 00:43:20,170
uh,

2032
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:22,940
with the churches is obviously
very important thing.

2033
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:23,690
Um,

2034
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:27,230
and so is it is really the
establishment of the basis of,

2035
00:43:27,231 --> 00:43:30,620
of the French educational system
that's remain for better or for worse,

2036
00:43:30,621 --> 00:43:31,070
the,

2037
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:31,580
uh,

2038
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,090
uh,

2039
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:32,930
the same until today.

2040
00:43:32,931 --> 00:43:34,610
I'm a big believer in the,

2041
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,031
uh,

2042
00:43:35,031 --> 00:43:36,170
in the French educational system.

2043
00:43:36,171 --> 00:43:37,640
My kids were in the front schools for,

2044
00:43:37,641 --> 00:43:38,540
for three or four years,

2045
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,140
uh,

2046
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:39,681
and,

2047
00:43:39,681 --> 00:43:39,861
uh,

2048
00:43:39,861 --> 00:43:41,120
there's no higher sort of,

2049
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:41,860
uh,

2050
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,030
a good result of,

2051
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,720
of humanity's collective,

2052
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:46,520
a good deeds than a,

2053
00:43:46,521 --> 00:43:50,420
than a French kindergarten or first or
second grade and begins to fall apart.

2054
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,010
By the time you get to least say a,

2055
00:43:52,011 --> 00:43:53,060
He created the least day,

2056
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:53,811
the high schools.

2057
00:43:53,811 --> 00:43:54,261
And then of course,

2058
00:43:54,261 --> 00:43:55,100
the university system,

2059
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:55,700
uh,

2060
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,080
is now in total chaos and,

2061
00:43:57,081 --> 00:43:57,210
and,

2062
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:57,561
and,

2063
00:43:57,561 --> 00:43:58,040
uh,

2064
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:58,371
uh,

2065
00:43:58,371 --> 00:43:58,881
Sarcozi.

2066
00:43:58,881 --> 00:44:02,810
We'll probably make it even worse if he
gets this way about creating this sort

2067
00:44:02,811 --> 00:44:06,470
of American like hierarchy of institutions
and will be really be at the expense

2068
00:44:06,471 --> 00:44:07,041
of kind of,

2069
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:07,490
uh,

2070
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:07,680
of,

2071
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,513
of the,

2072
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:09,650
not the lower level,

2073
00:44:09,651 --> 00:44:10,730
but the more modest,

2074
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:11,230
uh,

2075
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:11,710
uh,

2076
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:11,960
uh,

2077
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,090
universities in [inaudible]
in the French system,

2078
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,260
but be that as it may,

2079
00:44:15,261 --> 00:44:17,060
Napoleon and may or may
not be true that he wants,

2080
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:20,630
that he could look at his watch and see
what everybody is studying at any given

2081
00:44:20,631 --> 00:44:21,230
moment.

2082
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:21,650
Uh,

2083
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:22,930
and there are lots of problems with,

2084
00:44:22,931 --> 00:44:23,680
with a French,

2085
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:23,811
uh,

2086
00:44:23,811 --> 00:44:24,441
a system,

2087
00:44:24,441 --> 00:44:24,621
but,

2088
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:26,870
but the division of France into academy,

2089
00:44:26,871 --> 00:44:27,141
again,

2090
00:44:27,141 --> 00:44:30,320
this has nothing to do with the
academies have been talking about before,

2091
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,210
but into,

2092
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:36,210
as a geographic way of organizing all
education from the universities down to,

2093
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:37,620
uh,

2094
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,870
down to kindergarten or
even to crash even to,

2095
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,310
to nursery schools,

2096
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:42,140
uh,

2097
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:42,510
uh,

2098
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:43,980
organized by region.

2099
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:44,570
Uh,

2100
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:46,470
it has lasted through all this time.

2101
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:46,931
I mean,

2102
00:44:46,931 --> 00:44:48,840
that really is an
extraordinary accomplishment.

2103
00:44:48,841 --> 00:44:49,321
And Academy,

2104
00:44:49,321 --> 00:44:49,801
for example,

2105
00:44:49,801 --> 00:44:52,080
now would be the academy of
the most or the Academy of,

2106
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:53,460
of Gun Oberlin.

2107
00:44:53,461 --> 00:44:53,600
And,

2108
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,360
and it would,

2109
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:54,810
uh,

2110
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:57,570
or the Academy of Maasais
or the Khan Academy of,

2111
00:44:57,571 --> 00:44:58,420
of straws bull.

2112
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:00,250
And it covers two or three,

2113
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:00,961
three or four,

2114
00:45:00,961 --> 00:45:01,950
depending on the region,

2115
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:02,371
uh,

2116
00:45:02,371 --> 00:45:03,204
departments.

2117
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:03,811
And,

2118
00:45:03,811 --> 00:45:04,080
uh,

2119
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:04,231
you know,

2120
00:45:04,231 --> 00:45:06,330
it's almost impossible to
get a school teacher fired,

2121
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:06,691
by the way.

2122
00:45:06,691 --> 00:45:06,901
I mean,

2123
00:45:06,901 --> 00:45:07,731
that's another thing is,

2124
00:45:07,731 --> 00:45:08,050
is that,

2125
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:08,220
I mean,

2126
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:11,280
I shouldn't go into be very indiscreet
to go about this into this too much,

2127
00:45:11,281 --> 00:45:11,670
but,

2128
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:12,000
but,

2129
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:12,151
you know,

2130
00:45:12,151 --> 00:45:14,190
if you're trying to get a school
teacher in a village fired,

2131
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:14,431
I mean,

2132
00:45:14,431 --> 00:45:15,180
you can't,

2133
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:15,570
uh,

2134
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:15,781
you know,

2135
00:45:15,781 --> 00:45:16,680
it has to go through the,

2136
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:19,440
the head of the whole academy
who is called the rector,

2137
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:20,990
the rector or the rec placement.

2138
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:22,800
I'm not like Theresa Missoula director.

2139
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:23,600
Uh,

2140
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:23,810
uh,

2141
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:24,240
it's,

2142
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,440
it's very impossible.

2143
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:26,490
But there are problems with that.

2144
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:27,301
But nonetheless,

2145
00:45:27,301 --> 00:45:28,021
the reason that,

2146
00:45:28,021 --> 00:45:28,231
that,

2147
00:45:28,231 --> 00:45:30,090
and here I tell them that this is
a very pro French thing to say,

2148
00:45:30,091 --> 00:45:33,120
but the reason that friend's children
as finished children and his children,

2149
00:45:33,121 --> 00:45:33,954
almost a,

2150
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:34,920
in most of European countries,

2151
00:45:34,921 --> 00:45:38,790
tested a very much higher level
than those in the United States.

2152
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:39,391
At any level,

2153
00:45:39,391 --> 00:45:40,224
you can imagine.

2154
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:40,471
Uh,

2155
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:41,160
it's because,

2156
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:41,361
uh,

2157
00:45:41,361 --> 00:45:43,380
of they have centralized education system,

2158
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,240
which does not believe
that you should have,

2159
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,470
you know,

2160
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:47,580
wealthy communes,

2161
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:50,640
a wealthy parts of France
having all of the advantages.

2162
00:45:50,641 --> 00:45:52,890
And then schools that have very low,

2163
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,340
uh,

2164
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,620
limited financial resources have a,

2165
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:55,921
uh,

2166
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:57,390
have not the same,

2167
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:58,050
uh,

2168
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:59,550
the same possibilities,

2169
00:45:59,740 --> 00:45:59,971
uh,

2170
00:45:59,971 --> 00:46:01,410
for exceptional advancement.

2171
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:02,311
And this,

2172
00:46:02,311 --> 00:46:02,521
I mean,

2173
00:46:02,521 --> 00:46:03,550
France has the goal,

2174
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:04,021
they call it.

2175
00:46:04,021 --> 00:46:04,440
I mean,

2176
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:04,950
uh,

2177
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:05,430
uh,

2178
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:05,641
the,

2179
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:06,930
the big time,

2180
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:07,330
uh,

2181
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:07,860
uh,

2182
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:08,610
big,

2183
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:08,991
big,

2184
00:46:08,991 --> 00:46:10,200
a high powered,

2185
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:10,710
uh,

2186
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:11,940
elite schools,

2187
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:13,350
elite universities,

2188
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:14,251
they've got their,

2189
00:46:14,251 --> 00:46:15,200
their equivalents of,

2190
00:46:15,201 --> 00:46:17,520
of the fancy places of
which you're all in,

2191
00:46:17,521 --> 00:46:18,420
in one now.

2192
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,050
Uh,

2193
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:19,320
but,

2194
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:19,560
but,

2195
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,393
but nonetheless,

2196
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:20,970
uh,

2197
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:23,940
Napoleon does create a
system which is long lasting,

2198
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:24,481
uh,

2199
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:25,200
and which,

2200
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:25,650
uh,

2201
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,240
allowed over time,

2202
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,020
uh,

2203
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,250
the educational structure of,

2204
00:46:29,251 --> 00:46:30,240
of France to,

2205
00:46:30,241 --> 00:46:31,710
to advanced and very,

2206
00:46:31,711 --> 00:46:32,940
very meaningful ways,

2207
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:33,720
uh,

2208
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,910
in the whole course of the period.

2209
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:38,220
So no matter what you think
about the fact that he,

2210
00:46:38,221 --> 00:46:38,391
in,

2211
00:46:38,391 --> 00:46:38,881
in the end,

2212
00:46:38,881 --> 00:46:41,690
he was a megalomaniac and lots of
people get killed because of them.

2213
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:42,250
Uh,

2214
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:43,410
there's no doubt about that,

2215
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:44,000
but,

2216
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,730
but the wave of the French revolution
and the deploy manic period,

2217
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:48,031
uh,

2218
00:46:48,031 --> 00:46:49,680
has long lasting results,

2219
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:50,101
uh,

2220
00:46:50,101 --> 00:46:50,910
almost everywhere.

2221
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:52,740
To take an example of
unification of Italy,

2222
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:55,410
Italy will become unified in the 1860s,

2223
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:56,300
uh,

2224
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:56,610
uh,

2225
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:59,130
in early 1870s unified in quotes,

2226
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,500
a metro nick said it was
a geographic expression,

2227
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:02,401
a only,

2228
00:47:02,401 --> 00:47:03,061
and to an extent,

2229
00:47:03,061 --> 00:47:03,894
he may have been,

2230
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:04,350
uh,

2231
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:04,890
uh,

2232
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:05,550
correct.

2233
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:07,810
The unification comes through Piedmont,

2234
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:08,581
Piedmont,

2235
00:47:08,581 --> 00:47:09,241
Sardinia,

2236
00:47:09,241 --> 00:47:12,030
which was the most prosperous
part of Italy's and the north,

2237
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:12,960
uh,

2238
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:13,160
uh,

2239
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:13,891
and,

2240
00:47:13,891 --> 00:47:14,310
uh,

2241
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:14,940
uh,

2242
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:15,451
uh,

2243
00:47:15,451 --> 00:47:20,370
they had the benefits of
this French bureaucracy of
this administration that was

2244
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:21,290
centralized,

2245
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:21,990
uh,

2246
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:24,690
that allow them to be
more prosperous than,

2247
00:47:24,691 --> 00:47:26,310
than other parts of Italy.

2248
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,390
And it contributes to that.

2249
00:47:27,391 --> 00:47:28,500
They had other advantages,

2250
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,010
uh,

2251
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:29,771
to and,

2252
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:30,370
and,

2253
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:30,850
uh,

2254
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:31,180
uh,

2255
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:35,530
so the Napoleonic wave did
make a difference though.

2256
00:47:35,531 --> 00:47:36,101
It's hard to,

2257
00:47:36,101 --> 00:47:38,110
when you go to Paris and
if you go to the Louvre,

2258
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:38,860
uh,

2259
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:43,720
it's hard to not think of the fact that
the many of the treasures that are there

2260
00:47:43,721 --> 00:47:44,680
were simply alluded,

2261
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:45,280
uh,

2262
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,113
from,

2263
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:46,540
uh,

2264
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:47,080
from,

2265
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:47,913
from Italy.

2266
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:48,640
Uh,

2267
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,520
I loaded a,

2268
00:47:49,521 --> 00:47:50,960
a not in a trains as,

2269
00:47:50,961 --> 00:47:51,791
as Gooding,

2270
00:47:51,791 --> 00:47:52,210
uh,

2271
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:52,750
uh,

2272
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:56,230
and gribbles and those folks looted
art treasures during World War II.

2273
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:56,680
Uh,

2274
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,510
but put very carefully packed on,

2275
00:47:58,511 --> 00:48:01,630
on a military wagons
and returned to Paris.

2276
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,370
So we can debate about Napoleon,

2277
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,060
uh,

2278
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:04,960
and all of that.

2279
00:48:04,961 --> 00:48:06,970
My view was already probably fairly clear.

2280
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:07,510
Uh,

2281
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,950
but one has to admit that,

2282
00:48:08,951 --> 00:48:09,201
that,

2283
00:48:09,201 --> 00:48:09,460
that,

2284
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:13,660
that besides just the romance of his life
and a career open to talent and all of

2285
00:48:13,661 --> 00:48:14,290
that,

2286
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:14,740
uh,

2287
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:15,190
that,

2288
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:15,730
uh,

2289
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:16,270
uh,

2290
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:20,290
that he made a huge difference and
thus was worth spending some time on.

2291
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:21,363
Have a good weekend.

2292
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,330
I'm going to Saint Louis.
