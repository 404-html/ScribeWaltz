1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:01,411
Um,

2
00:00:01,411 --> 00:00:06,411
so what I want to do today is resist the
temptation to talk about anarchism the

3
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:09,300
entire time.
Um,

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,890
and I sent around the terms for today
of which I only forgot one or two. Uh,

5
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:17,300
so what I think I'll do at the beginning,
and I'm going to talk about, um, uh,

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,990
very quickly about socialism and the
difference between Revolutionary Socialism

7
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:25,770
and Reform Socialism,
add cynical ism to the mix.

8
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:27,360
And these are all terms
that I sent to you.

9
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,670
So I'm not going to write them on
the board because I need the board.

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,220
And then for most of the lecture,

11
00:00:31,221 --> 00:00:35,760
I'm gonna talk about anarchism up because
anarchist didn't want to reform the

12
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:36,594
state.

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,780
They didn't want to seize control of
state either by revolution or by electoral

14
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:45,240
process.
They wanted to destroy the state.

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,890
And so I'm going to talk about
those guys, uh, for a while. And,

16
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:53,040
and most anarchists were not terrorists,
but at the end, I'm going to talk about,

17
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:57,420
uh, a guy that I followed her
on for four or five years, um,

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,310
who was a terrorist and arguably,
uh, as a book I just finished. Uh,

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,340
we can find the origins of
modern terrorism in this
guy who's called Amy on me.

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,740
And this will fit into Paris is obviously
sort of a sub theme in this course. Um,

21
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,140
and so as the state of the
capitalism and, and, uh,

22
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:20,670
this particular person and
me all, he set out to, uh,

23
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:21,391
uh,

24
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:26,391
to bomb and to kill and his
targets changed the name
of the game for terrorists.

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,460
And so that's obviously what I'm,
uh, uh, can't wait to talk about.

26
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:35,340
But first I'm going to just
review briefly for you.

27
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,480
It's getting brief or every second day.
Think about this. Uh, the socialist stuff,

28
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:44,360
which you can read about,
uh, and, uh, as, uh, the,

29
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:48,840
the rise with the rise of
mass politics in Europe, uh,

30
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:53,280
in the 1880s and 1890s, uh,
there was the rise of mass,

31
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,780
uh, socialist parties. Now
basically just to review,

32
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,630
uh,
there are two kinds of socialism.

33
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,250
There were the Revolutionary
Socialists, uh, who believed that,

34
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,210
uh, of which marks, this was an obvious
example. Uh, and his son in log,

35
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,850
Paul [inaudible] a name.

36
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:16,650
You don't have to retain a who brought
Marx's theory to France who believed

37
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:21,120
that, um, revolution would come when
the proletariat was class conscious.

38
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,370
Uh,
and uh,

39
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,840
after a bourgeois revolution of which he
basically thought 1848 had been a good

40
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:32,841
example following in 1789 and they're
proletariat would rise up and break their

41
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,710
chains and bring this brave new world.

42
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,200
Um, and so there were revolutionary
socialists, uh, in Italy,

43
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:46,890
in Spain and in France and
even a few in Germany. Um,

44
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,000
and then reform socialist said,
look,

45
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,170
states are becoming stronger
and stronger and can,

46
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,700
can break revolutions, uh, very easily.

47
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,640
Look what happened to the Paris commune
of 1871 went about 25,000 people are

48
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:07,630
massacred men,
women and children are gun down.

49
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,630
And that the way to bringing social
reform and abolishing the abuses of

50
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,360
capitalism is to reform.

51
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,290
And this is the reformist
tradition in Germany.

52
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,030
It's identified with somebody who in the
book, Barron's team, Edward Branch team,

53
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,560
and you can see this in the
growth of the SBA day, the,

54
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:32,230
the German Socialist
Party reformist party,

55
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,560
which was the largest party.
And there I stock, um,

56
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,300
in 1914 when war breaks out.

57
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,910
And so what you do is if you organize,

58
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,230
you can pat get get legislatures.
If you, if you have enough, uh,

59
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:52,060
socialists and enough, a well meaning
other people in, uh, in, uh, the,

60
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,940
uh, legislatures. And then
when I stock or in the show,

61
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:58,990
I'm the deputy or the other parliaments
and places that had parliaments,

62
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,740
then you can vote in law.

63
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:05,810
You can vote in a mine safety regulations
because mine's killed so many people.

64
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:07,960
Mining accidents killed so many people.

65
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,380
There's one of the [inaudible] were
hundreds and hundreds of people as a

66
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,910
thousand people get killed in one
accident. And about 1910 or 1911, uh,

67
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:20,320
you, uh, you can pass a, an
eight hour day or a 10 hour day.

68
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:24,220
You can pass laws making it a harder
and harder to employ children,

69
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,060
particularly in dangerous
tasks. Uh, you can, uh,

70
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,670
you can do things for women. You
could do things for families. Uh,

71
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,040
if you elect the right kind of people,
um,

72
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,270
you can have a revolution through reform,

73
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,440
through the ballot and the great
socialist leaders such as Berenstein,

74
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:45,820
whom I just mentioned, or the
Great John Shaw has, whose death,

75
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,190
whose death on the 31st of July.
Uh,

76
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,760
1914 was really the end of an era
and the beginning of another era,

77
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:00,370
uh, scary year of the war. And then
people had that sense, uh, you know,

78
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:05,260
he was the one who in France unified the
socialists and, and, and the revolution,

79
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:08,090
the reform socialists and
revolutionary socialists. Uh,

80
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,180
though there are still a fishers in
their, in their approaches. And of course,

81
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:18,010
the old revolutionary socialists would
become the communists after 1920 when the

82
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:20,290
social economy, the French
Communist Party is, uh,

83
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,980
is begun in the wake of the Russian
revolution, which seemed to be a Rev. Uh,

84
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,770
even though it was one
revolution, uh, in a,

85
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:31,120
in a very complex situation that seemed
to say that you can't have a revolution.

86
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:36,240
Uh, but anyway, uh, so reform,
socialists dominate in Germany, uh,

87
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,680
they dominate in France.
They dominated in Belgium,

88
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:41,110
the Socialist Party is
terribly important, uh, in,

89
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:44,140
in Italy they become more
important and in Spain as well.

90
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,030
And so those are the two big,
uh, big, uh, uh, traditions. Um,

91
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,670
now some of the tensions
between Revolutionary
Socialists and reform socialists

92
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:57,100
can be seen in the fact that
Revolutionary Socialists said, look,

93
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,690
if you are working in that you're in the
right stock and you're trying to get a

94
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,070
better insurance plans. Ironically, it
was Bismarck who Bismarck's Germany.

95
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:11,870
That gives really the first substantial
insurance program for, for workers.

96
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,870
Um, what's you're doing is you're
propping up the bourgeois state,

97
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:17,920
you're buying into it,
you're, you're, uh, uh,

98
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,340
you're supporting indirectly their armies,
uh, that crush workers and strikes.

99
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:25,460
And they did. And the heroic
age of symbolism were more
about that in a minute.

100
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:28,880
1895 to about 1907 in France.

101
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:32,720
But in other countries it's about the
same thing. Um, so you're propping up the,

102
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:36,800
uh, the bourgeois state by
participating in electoral politics. So,

103
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:40,160
but lots of revolutionary socialists.
And this is Alma Book. Uh,

104
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,540
so don't worry about this, but a lot
of them sort of say, well, look, we've,

105
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:46,070
if we don't run candidates and elections,
how are they going to know about us?

106
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,370
So they, they too would run
candidates in elections.

107
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,200
So there put it really kind of class,
same.

108
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,710
They're really sort of stuck between a
rock and a hard place because they're

109
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:59,290
running candidates in elections
in which they do not believe. Um,

110
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,620
so,
uh,

111
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:03,470
I'm not here talking about Russia
because that is more complicated with the

112
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:06,200
Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks and
the socialist revolutionaries.

113
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:10,400
And we will come back to them. I'm
talking basically about, uh, uh,

114
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:13,850
about western Europe and you have to
imagine that lending and the other,

115
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,270
the other Russian socialist is, or
our serve walking around, uh, uh,

116
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:23,020
the lakes of Geneva and in Missouri can
in exile and trying to imagine this, uh,

117
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:27,050
this future. But that's the big difference
between a, a socialist reform and, uh,

118
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,520
uh, in Revolutionary Socialists. Now
to make things even more complicated,

119
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,930
you have a group called syndicate lists
and the word Cindy, a cynical list.

120
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:38,780
It's an English word syndicate list,
which I sent along on your,

121
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:43,160
I know a friendly email from
yours. Truly, I'm a cynic.

122
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:45,590
Lists of word comes from
the French word for unions,

123
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:50,000
which is a San Diego [inaudible].
And what they said it, hang on,

124
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:54,110
they kind of lead with the revolutionary
socialist at saying if you get involved

125
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:58,400
in electoral process, you are propping up
this crop borzois state. You are a con,

126
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,270
you're propping up this dynamic
duo of the state and capitalism.

127
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,150
And they say cynically say,
look,

128
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:10,160
we will organize from the ground up
beginning in the shop, the shop floor,

129
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:15,310
the factory and that that will be not
only a means to obtain a revolution,

130
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,300
it will be a means.
It's a way of,

131
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,860
of seeing what the future world will
life will be like when everybody to twice

132
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:25,940
everybody or dues everybody. Uh,
and, and the kind of relations,

133
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:29,780
the friendly equal relations
of the shop floor, uh, uh,

134
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:34,400
become after the revolution become
the way the world will be organized.

135
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:39,140
And in the south of Europe and Italy
and in Spain, these folks are called,

136
00:08:39,141 --> 00:08:42,200
and I sent this around too,
and our co cynical lists,

137
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:46,150
you'll see a transition here and
our coasts into dickless, uh,

138
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,460
and because they're rejecting the state
and they're looking in the future.

139
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,870
And the decentralized
organization, uh, is part of it.

140
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:59,220
And anarcho lists, uh, have
considerable influence in, in, uh,

141
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:00,870
in Spain and Italy.
Uh,

142
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:04,230
they believe in direct action
and sabotage and strikes,

143
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:09,300
but in union organization, uh,
and one of the most interesting,

144
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:10,620
I mentioned him in the book, but, uh,

145
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:15,480
for now I'm Poo ta who was sort of
theorist a, p, e, l, l, O, u, t, I,

146
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:19,950
e r pollute Aa a who wrote a
book called the dying society,

147
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,910
was one of the theoreticians of Anarcho
Syndicate, colorism of syndicate wisdom.

148
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,920
And he himself was dying. He was dying
of TB, though he was not a worker,

149
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,430
tuberculosis. What's working
class disease? Go to Pennsylvania,

150
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,420
go to West Virginia, you know,
tuberculosis, the ravages of the minds.

151
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:39,160
And the United States were just
incredible. And in, you know,

152
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,590
porcelain factories and all sorts
of places, uh, glass factories,

153
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,150
uh,
all over the place.

154
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:49,040
And Pilou ta a crate sees thing is
called Labor or he's one of the,

155
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:54,180
the people who come to these things called
Labor exchanges and wants to provide,

156
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,850
you call them in French,
but labor exchanges,

157
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,120
which were towns where you had municipal
socialists in power at the municipality

158
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:06,670
level, the municipal level and
you did in some cities, uh, are,

159
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,960
are giving municipal funds to
start these labor exchanges,

160
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,100
which are buildings you can still see
them. Uh, when I was invited to, you know,

161
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,800
limos to give a big talk about
the book by the Confederation,

162
00:10:17,801 --> 00:10:18,800
which I don't know how to do,
to go via,

163
00:10:18,801 --> 00:10:21,270
I mean the first we started
the APP at a whole, you know,

164
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:24,870
the first round of drinks about noon
in the labor exchange and amaze on,

165
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:26,850
do put up the host of the people.

166
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,480
And they were places where workers coming
from other places could come and get a

167
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:34,000
meal, get some money and above
all find out about jobs. So,

168
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,400
so for says Sin Nicholas,

169
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:39,480
the way of imagining the future and
preparing for this brave new world of post

170
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:42,840
revolutionary, uh, relationships, uh,

171
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,530
that has an important privileged
place in the way they view the world.

172
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,500
And there was an engineer
called the Joshes.

173
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:54,460
So Hella whose name I should've sent
you around, sor, e, l, a, s, O, r, e,

174
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:59,100
l. And he comes to the notion of the
general strike that one day, all workers.

175
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:02,940
So simply simply put down their tools
and say, hell with you, capitalism.

176
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,160
Hell we you the state, uh, and they
will bring in capitalism to its knees.

177
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,910
It doesn't really ever work out
that way, does it, you know,

178
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:14,490
the capitalists and
the state when the day.

179
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:18,390
So having rushed through all of that,

180
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:22,440
let me talk about what I want to talk
about and that is anarchism of which

181
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:23,990
there's only a couple,
uh,

182
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,730
short and I hope sprightly
paragraphs in which you're reading.

183
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,890
And I am not an anarchist.

184
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,640
I was unsorted sometimes
when I give talks, you know,

185
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:36,330
various places of Saint Louis recently
and other places, people at the end,

186
00:11:36,331 --> 00:11:36,900
we'll think,

187
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,990
hopefully they'll never think I'm a
terrorist because I'm certainly not. Uh,

188
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:44,670
and when I talk about this guy, I do not,
so with affection or admiration, but I,

189
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:48,870
I know him because I followed him
around. I followed him around. Um,

190
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,350
uh, but I want to have taco and
most anarchists. We're not, uh,

191
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:55,450
we're not terrorists.
And when one wants to make that clear,

192
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,640
it's not surprising that,
that the,

193
00:11:57,641 --> 00:12:02,641
the great strengths of anarchism are in
Spain and Catalonia and an under Lucilia

194
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,950
in the south of Spain
and in southern Italy.

195
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,593
Why?

196
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:15,810
Because that's where the Italian and
the Spanish states have very limited

197
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:19,030
success in convincing people
that they're Spanish or Italian.

198
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,520
And why should they believe
they're Spanish or Italian?

199
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,630
With his southern Italians thought that,
that the republic was a, or the monarchy,

200
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,490
but the progressive
monetary so called was, uh,

201
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:32,110
was a plot launched by tax collectors
and industrial capitalist in the north of

202
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:36,670
Italy and in under Lucilia, uh,
and, and in, in Catalonia where,

203
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:40,660
or the garden Savella who were attended
to me from Galicia of conservative part

204
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:44,070
of Spain.
Where were the odious Franco was from a,

205
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:49,120
or from a custody, uh, you know, the
area around Madrid, huge area run Madrid.

206
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:49,840
Uh,

207
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,170
it was easy to see how they associated
the state was something that they didn't

208
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:56,410
want. But in, in writing about anarchism,

209
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:01,420
I tried to put myself in to try to
think of how anarchist viewed the world.

210
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,840
And I'm going to tell you a
story that's a true story,

211
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,050
but if you're trying to
imagine how anarchist, uh,

212
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:13,120
viewed the world of this story
is not a bad one. It's about,

213
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,770
um,
a core coworker,

214
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:20,310
cork worker making corks for bottles
of Sherry in the south of Spain.

215
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,113
And he's dying.

216
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:27,930
And He'd been an anarchist his entire
life and he hated the state and he hated

217
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:33,430
capitalism and he hated
the church and he's dying.

218
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,280
He's not as death bit.

219
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:41,470
And he had married a woman from a
religiously practicing Catholic family.

220
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,450
And so in the scene in this room in which
he's dying in one part of the room is

221
00:13:50,131 --> 00:13:53,350
his,
his family who hated organized religion,

222
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,920
who view it as a prop for
capitalism and the state.

223
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,900
And then the other side of the room where
people who are not so sure they went

224
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:06,610
to church sometime who knew the priest
and when he's lying there,

225
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,200
the end is near.
His wife's family says,

226
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,403
Pedro,

227
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:20,100
don't you want me to bring a lawyer
in a lawyer who will take your will,

228
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,230
your last will?

229
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,380
And our kids don't have wills and
they don't have very much property.

230
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,880
This is the other side of the
room's just utter terror, horror.

231
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,200
How can they suggest such a thing
that Pedro's going to make a will?

232
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:37,660
That's a bourgeois thing
to do to make a will.

233
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,510
And then somebody else from his wife's
family says, Pedro, the end is near.

234
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,670
Don't you want us to get a
priest for the last rites?

235
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:54,510
He never set foot in a church and proudly
so consternation on the other side of

236
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:58,580
the room.
How will it all end?

237
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,420
How will Pedro ended his life
with a lawyer and a priest.

238
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:08,840
And so Pedro looks up and he says, go
and get me a lawyer, bring me a lawyer.

239
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:13,880
And then he says,
go and tell father the Qa,

240
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:17,330
the priest to come to see me.

241
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,830
Joy,
utter consternation.

242
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,530
Pedro's lying in a bed in the middle.

243
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:29,630
So pretty soon the lawyer comes
dress dressing his little suit.

244
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,270
He doesn't yet have a calculator to tote
up the bill, but he's got his legal pad.

245
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,880
He's never been in that house before.
And he comes down,

246
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:43,340
he by the bed and he says,
Pedro,

247
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:46,220
you have a few possessions of fork,
a knife,

248
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,750
a couple of plates.
Don't you want to give me your will now?

249
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,890
And Pedro says, wait a
minute, wait a minute,

250
00:15:56,030 --> 00:16:00,350
wait a minute. And then the priest
comes and he's has his red is,

251
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,980
it's a purple, because I remember
this from Jesuit high school days.

252
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,890
He has his purple,
uh,

253
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,030
thing that they were on Easter
and he has his little case also,

254
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,360
which he has the holy oil to bless
Pedro and give him the last rites.

255
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,670
And he comes close and he
says, Pedro, the end is near.

256
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,270
You've led a good life,

257
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:30,200
but I haven't seen you in church
very much or ever for that matter.

258
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:35,000
And your children are not baptized.
Don't you want to make a confession?

259
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,580
You're going to make,
meet your maker soon.

260
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:42,350
Don't you want to make a confession to me
right now? Nobody, they can't hear you.

261
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,770
Don't you have something you
want me to tell you that you did?

262
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:49,760
You want to tell me in? There's
something I can tell you. I mean,

263
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:51,770
you can tell me and I
will tell you whatever.

264
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,340
And so consternation in one side,

265
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,030
silent joy and the other.

266
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:04,370
And so Pedro says to the lawyer,
he says, come here Senor. He says,

267
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:06,980
I want you to stand on
the left side of my bed.

268
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,230
And he says to the priest,
father, father, come here please.

269
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:17,240
I want you to sit or stand
on the right side of my bed.

270
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,920
And then he smiles,
a smile of utter contentment.

271
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,330
And he says,

272
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:28,460
now you can all see to both sides
of the family that like Christ,

273
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,900
I am dying between two
thieves and he died.

274
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:38,950
And to imagine the kind of hate that
anarchist had of soldiers and priests and

275
00:17:42,471 --> 00:17:45,800
of officials and if could
Stiliyan Garda Savita,

276
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,240
that was how anarchism was born.
Now when was anarchism born?

277
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,880
There's a couple of antecedents
in the 18th century,

278
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:56,030
but they're terribly relevant
people that hardly anyone read,

279
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,850
including a British one.
It really starts with poodle.

280
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,610
A name I sent around pl has
was f, a poodle, p, r, O, u,

281
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:10,350
d. H. O. N. And he was
from the east of France,

282
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:14,160
from around Bezel,
from Desmond's hall in the East.

283
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:15,750
And the mountain is function conte.

284
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,740
And he believed that if you didn't have
the state than people could live pretty

285
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:24,720
much as with a little bit of prosperity,
that they had a few chickens,

286
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:29,160
a little piece of land. Uh, people
tended to live like that. There.

287
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:31,080
It was a place where nobody had very much,

288
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:34,020
but everybody had enough
to get along and he writes,

289
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:36,060
the following is my lecture notes

290
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,520
to be governed is to be watched,
inspected,

291
00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:48,070
spied upon directed, law-driven,
numbered, regulated, enrolled,

292
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,730
indoctrinated, preached at controlled,
checked, estimated, valued, censored,

293
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:57,140
commanded by creatures who have neither
the right nor the wisdom northern virtue

294
00:18:57,141 --> 00:19:01,940
to do so to be governed at every
operation that every transaction noted.

295
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:06,290
Registered, counted, tax stamped,
measured number to assess, licensed,

296
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,850
authorized admonish, prevented,
forbidden, reformed, corrected,

297
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:15,410
punished under the pretext of the use
of public utility and the name of the

298
00:19:15,411 --> 00:19:19,610
general interest and it's been placed
under taxes, drilled, fleeced, exploited,

299
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,750
monopolized, extorted from
squeezed, hoped and robbed.

300
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:27,080
And that decided this resistance that
the first word of complaint to be

301
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:31,580
repressed, fired, vilified, harassed,
hunted down, abused, clubbed,

302
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:36,560
disarmed, bound, choked, imprisoned,
judged, condemn, shot, deported,

303
00:19:36,561 --> 00:19:40,760
sacrificed, sold, betrayed and
to crown. All mocked, ridiculed,

304
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:45,830
derided, outraged, dishonored that
has government that it's as justice,

305
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,910
that it's morality.
He wrote a book,

306
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:55,170
a pamphlet in 1841 called what
is property? Question Mark.

307
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,130
And his answers property is theft.
Now,

308
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,960
he didn't mean it all property was theft.

309
00:20:00,961 --> 00:20:04,800
What he meant was too much property was
theft or unearned property was theft.

310
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,670
And Perdomo had lots of
influence among some hesitance,

311
00:20:08,671 --> 00:20:11,960
but mostly artisans in the
world by the way, that that, uh,

312
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,090
the great painter Gustava Akuna Bay,
uh,

313
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,740
painted a lot in the area around Besan
zone or no burial of or known lots of

314
00:20:19,741 --> 00:20:23,400
really marvelous, uh, uh, paintings
of people at work, the stone breakers,

315
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:27,360
people just working their guts out
for very little and Perdomo. Uh,

316
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,510
in 1848, it said, he went
down in Paris and put, put a,

317
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:35,660
a brick on a barricade and threw up
nauseated by the thought of violence of

318
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:39,390
revolution and his successors.

319
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,180
So the leaders of the anarchist
movements were Michael Bakunin,

320
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,990
whose name is in there,
be a kit, k, u, N, I,

321
00:20:49,991 --> 00:20:54,190
N and enormously tall bearded,

322
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,140
heavy drinking, heavy eating,
heavy sweating, Russian noble,

323
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:03,430
a prince who was an anarchist who
said the revolution will come.

324
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:08,020
It will come with a single spark and all
the hundreds of millions of toilers to

325
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:13,021
surf will rise up and they will slay
their social betters and create this new

326
00:21:13,721 --> 00:21:18,220
brave world based upon their
village harmonies. And he said,

327
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,910
destruction is a creative passion,

328
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:28,050
quote unquote honored gimme
destruction is a creative passion.

329
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,010
And in 1848,
he led police on a merry chase.

330
00:21:33,011 --> 00:21:37,720
He spent a time in the Russian slam air.
He escapes through Japan,

331
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,860
goes through the United States, ends
up back in London, terrified people,

332
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,540
his image,
I mean,

333
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,810
this is before photographs
are just photographs are
just starting out and there

334
00:21:46,811 --> 00:21:47,950
are photographs of him.

335
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:52,330
And he met marks who he
hated and Mark's hated him.

336
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,330
He thought that Marx was ruining class.

337
00:21:55,331 --> 00:22:00,331
Struggle was ruining
revolution by preaching over
and over again about waiting

338
00:22:00,371 --> 00:22:02,740
for revolution class conscious workers.

339
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:06,610
What you need is peasants to
rise up as they had in Pooka,

340
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:10,450
Jeff's rebellion and all the other
rebellions in the early to 17th and 18th

341
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:15,290
century. He dies in the
early 1870s, you know,

342
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:19,780
a phenomenal, uh, a character
and the other Russian,

343
00:22:19,781 --> 00:22:23,530
a gentle man, a geographer,
Peter Kropotkin,

344
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,880
k Oop, Ots, k, I, n.

345
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,750
K. R. O. P. Kropotkin. Yeah.

346
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,300
Kropotkin is in the book. And he
wrote a pamphlet that, that, uh,

347
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,870
called the anarchist morality.
When you get rid of the state,

348
00:22:37,871 --> 00:22:40,600
people are basically good anarchist.
Believe that people are good.

349
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,930
If there's a tradition from loose
sold by the way there to who,

350
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:48,580
so who lived in east of France or what
would become France around Shambhavi who

351
00:22:48,581 --> 00:22:52,420
believed in the primitive and our kiss
believed that primitive social relations

352
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:56,120
and even primitive ways of producing
things. Uh, uh, Oregon, you know,

353
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:00,930
just associations. You enter in
because you want to, uh, we're the,

354
00:23:00,931 --> 00:23:01,870
we're the future.

355
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,270
And Kropotkin who at the end of his life
was once toasted by the King of England

356
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,150
and who had turned against
the Russian revolution.

357
00:23:10,151 --> 00:23:14,950
He dies and I think 1921 or 22,
he was terrified by it,

358
00:23:14,951 --> 00:23:17,440
just as disgusted by
the Russian revolution,

359
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:21,010
which was already creating a
centralized state. That's what he hated.

360
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:26,050
He hated states, you must destroy
the state. But he was a gentle man,

361
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,390
yet he and a guy called Paul Boosie,

362
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,030
you don't have to remember who became
a socialist leader and then went nuts

363
00:23:31,031 --> 00:23:35,830
later. Uh, uh, he was just
in a very clinical term, but
he had big problems. Uh, uh,

364
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,940
later,
uh,

365
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,410
they create the term
propaganda by the deed.

366
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:46,800
What is a deed?
A deed is a bomb or Adidas,

367
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,420
an attack. It's the murder of
an official. Now, they weren't,

368
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:52,400
the anarchist weren't the
only one doing this stuff.

369
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:56,300
And there was a Russian group briefly
mentioned called neurod Novela Vola who

370
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:59,930
believed in kind of a hierarchical system,
post revolutionary system.

371
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,270
And what they want to do is
set out and kill officials,

372
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:07,760
but soda of anarchist terrorists
and they killed officials.

373
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,580
One of which you've heard of already.
You probably heard some of the others.

374
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,760
President Mckinley 1901 buffalo,

375
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:17,670
New York is killed by somebody
who's got received funds from a, uh,

376
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:21,170
an anarchist organization in New
Jersey, I think in Paterson, New Jersey.

377
00:24:21,171 --> 00:24:25,020
Where is that brushy at
anyway? Brushy kills, um, cane.

378
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:29,090
When beer till the second of Italy,
another anarchist assassination,

379
00:24:29,091 --> 00:24:33,800
they kill five or six, uh,
uh, leaders. Uh, during this
period of anarchist heyday,

380
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:37,640
really the late 19th century,
uh, king owned be octo.

381
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:42,350
The second of Italy said that he
considered a assassination or professional

382
00:24:42,351 --> 00:24:43,184
risk.

383
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,740
There were two attempts on his life and
the third one nails him and Alexander

384
00:24:48,741 --> 00:24:53,390
the second who liberated
the serfs. He is killed. Uh,

385
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:57,350
when he gets out of a sled to look at a
bomb that doesn't work. And Elizabeth,

386
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,460
the emperor of Austria,

387
00:24:58,461 --> 00:25:01,790
Hungary who couldn't stand fronds
Yosef and lived apart from him,

388
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,860
she is assassinated as well.
But most anarchist,

389
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:10,760
we're not. Uh, we're not killers.
Now, if you think of American history,

390
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:14,660
those of you who've had Glenda's course
or David Blights, other people here,

391
00:25:14,661 --> 00:25:15,910
you might know about Haymarket,

392
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:20,300
the Haymarket affair and the 1880s and
there they hang for anarchists who are

393
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:23,060
called late Poland do in France. He had
enormous influence. The pointed with,

394
00:25:23,061 --> 00:25:27,920
ah Ha, the ha the hang is
there swinging in the breeze.

395
00:25:27,921 --> 00:25:30,380
And the Chicago prison yard.
Uh,

396
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,850
they were anarchists and they inspire
someone like Emma Goldman who was a

397
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,160
Russian Jewish immigrant,
an immigrant to the United States.

398
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,170
It becomes an important
American anarchist,

399
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,990
but anarchist set off to
kill a policeman or to kill,

400
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:49,750
to kill heads of state
or to kill generals,

401
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,010
propaganda by the deed, the spark
that will ignite this revolution.

402
00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:00,080
But the man you see before you,
and I've become today a very modern man.

403
00:26:00,081 --> 00:26:04,160
I want to tell you,
cause this is my first try at PowerPoint.

404
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:08,960
The person I see you that you see before
is the guy who been following around.

405
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,110
And I got interested
in him for two reasons.

406
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,850
One is that he is the first
really along with a bombing at,

407
00:26:15,851 --> 00:26:20,851
at an opera in Barcelona at the list
you'll in Barcelona to target ordinary

408
00:26:21,411 --> 00:26:22,244
people.

409
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:26,300
And to say that people have a social
class were guilty because they were who

410
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:31,010
they were. And that the spark does not
necessarily have to be lit by killing,

411
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:36,200
killing a ahead of a state as
study carnow who would get his,

412
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,370
uh, in 1894 on the route of
the road public in, in Lille,

413
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,870
president of France.

414
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:47,650
He takes the decision to kill ordinary
people and lots of terrorists since then

415
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:52,580
have taken that decision, that
kind of a classic example, uh,

416
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,730
insurgents in, in, in, in, you
know, in Puente job and in, in,

417
00:26:56,770 --> 00:27:01,000
in India and in the 1920s, you
know, bombing officers' clubs.

418
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,730
There's terrifying scene in that.

419
00:27:02,731 --> 00:27:05,730
Fantastic but very difficult movie
because of the torture scene.

420
00:27:05,731 --> 00:27:10,030
I can't even use it in the French history
course, the battle of Algiers. Uh,

421
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:10,500
where you,

422
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,220
that you are with this woman
who's planting a bomb and
a cafe and she sees the

423
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:15,240
people who are going to die.

424
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:20,340
She sees babies with their mother or
she sees people having a drink, uh,

425
00:27:20,341 --> 00:27:23,880
in the French community there and she
takes the decision to place the bomb.

426
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,970
I believe that it kind of started
with this guy, and this is, again,

427
00:27:26,971 --> 00:27:31,500
not somebody I admire. I know him. I
followed him everywhere. He has lived.

428
00:27:31,501 --> 00:27:33,340
I haven't been.
Um,

429
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,930
and I guess if you're going to write
a book about somebody as a prism on

430
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:39,870
something, whether it's good to pick
somebody who only lived to be 21,

431
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:45,290
because the shorter book
he was guillotined in May,

432
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,840
1894, uh, and again, I do not admire him,

433
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:53,730
but I'm going to tell you about them
anyway with the help of PowerPoint.

434
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:57,270
And so how the hell do I do this? I got
to remember how to do this. All right,

435
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,820
that's a meat on me.

436
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:04,590
His father was a commune out who
is commit condemned to death.

437
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,180
Somebody who'd fought in the commune.

438
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:11,550
And so this guy is born in Spain and his
father contracted and mercury poisoning

439
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:16,470
in Spain and comes back to France
after the amnesty and dies.

440
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,380
And he has an older brother
and a younger brother.

441
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:25,560
And what he does is a,
an a day in 1894,

442
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:30,360
he sets out with a bomb
and he goes down to,

443
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:35,190
uh, he walks in the fancy
boulevards that for him, uh,

444
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,150
uh,

445
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:41,150
re represent all of the class differences
between wealthy and poor people,

446
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:46,290
center versus periphery and all of that.
He goes down to the cafe Termi News,

447
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:50,570
which is on your right.
It's those awnings there near the Garth's.

448
00:28:50,571 --> 00:28:55,380
Now those are the cafe terminus. I've had
the rather odd experience of twice, uh,

449
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:59,820
once with friends and once with my son
having eaten in the restaurant that my

450
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:04,680
book's subject blew up because it's still
there and sitting at the same table.

451
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,550
He goes to four or five cafes, but they're
not enough innocent people in them.

452
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:12,210
So it goes to the terminus where
there was a gypsy orchestra playing,

453
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,670
pays for two beers.

454
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:19,350
That seems a little odd anarchist paying
for beer because the right to theft was

455
00:29:19,351 --> 00:29:21,900
something that they still believed
in. Many of them, not all,

456
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,490
and most were not terrorists.
Remember that? Uh,

457
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:28,440
he goes in to the cafe to
look something like that.

458
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,020
I though what's happening here,
mass,

459
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,770
you know, uh, so am I'm supposed
to say things like that. Anyway,

460
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,640
he goes in to the cafe term, he knows,
and then he a cigar. He lights the fuse,

461
00:29:42,641 --> 00:29:47,560
he throws it up toward a chandelier and
it blows up killing one and wounding

462
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:52,420
about 18 people. That's not him. And
this anarchist that's called Mala Testa,

463
00:29:52,421 --> 00:29:55,900
who doesn't look particularly scary there,
but Amit,

464
00:29:55,901 --> 00:30:00,901
all he had gone back to Paris or to
the Paris region is his mother had a,

465
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,130
um, had a, a very pitiful, oh bears.

466
00:30:06,131 --> 00:30:11,020
This is the era of bomb attacks in the
early 1890s. That's a Ma, Amit, that's a,

467
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:14,860
as bombs are sometimes
called. Um, and he, uh,

468
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,840
he became an anarchist.

469
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,950
His brother had already
become an anarchist and to
put yourself into the early

470
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:25,870
1890s in Paris,
ordinary people,

471
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:29,470
but not so much as the
elites were terrified of.

472
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,640
And our cusp bombers Raba Shola a
name I sent around who was a poor,

473
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,970
pathetic in many ways, but extremely poor
guy who'd been sent out to beg by his,

474
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,230
by his mother.
Uh,

475
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:44,920
they had almost no money there from
place called Sasha Mall near Santa Tn.

476
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,370
Ahava shoal, uh, um,

477
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,880
was a counterfeiter and finally a
murderer. He suffocated to death.

478
00:30:51,881 --> 00:30:55,780
A hermit who had had a mini
fortune hidden in his bizarre,

479
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,480
a cottage,
a near Santa Tn.

480
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:02,530
He escapes from the police
and he goes to Paris in 1891.

481
00:31:02,531 --> 00:31:07,030
Police beat the hell out of
three anarchists in a march.
I'd rather one sided, uh,

482
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,740
a brawl. Uh, and two of them are
condemned to big time sentences.

483
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:17,040
A robble shoal decides to go and to kill
the prosecuting attorney and he places

484
00:31:18,071 --> 00:31:22,660
a bomb not knowing where the apartment
was and the bomb blows up. Uh,

485
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:26,560
and um, then he, uh, he
had said other bombs to,

486
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:29,410
and then after having done this,
he goes to a restaurant and he,

487
00:31:29,411 --> 00:31:34,080
and he eats rather well, and he engages
a waiter in conversation and he cries.

488
00:31:34,081 --> 00:31:37,420
He convinced the waiter to be an anarchist
and the waiter cc has a scar on his

489
00:31:37,421 --> 00:31:39,640
left hand.
Robert Shoulder did.

490
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:43,210
And then he stupidly goes back later
and eats in the same restaurant.

491
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,310
And the set of bringing the second course.

492
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:49,360
The waiter brings the police
and after a tremendous struggle,

493
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,190
Hava shoal is captured,

494
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,180
put on trial for his life
and he memorably holds up.

495
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,480
God Damn it.
How do you work this thing?

496
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,110
I'm supposed to talk like that.
Anyway, he is load. All right. He is.

497
00:32:05,111 --> 00:32:08,920
He is Ghia teen and he's really kind of
a bastard. I mean not more than that.

498
00:32:08,921 --> 00:32:11,080
He turned and he had killed
other people too probably,

499
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,710
but he finally has guillotine.
But what happens is the two things happen,

500
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,140
and not only in Paris but in other places,

501
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,400
is that over that the people of means
living in the fancy quarters are extremely

502
00:32:21,401 --> 00:32:24,550
frightened and they're all sorts of
death threats that get sent around,

503
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:28,870
but we'll have a shool to those anarchists
terrorists. He becomes a martyr. Look,

504
00:32:28,871 --> 00:32:33,580
I'm here as the head is in the, in the, in
the, in the is framed by the guillotine.

505
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:37,240
Rava shoal who'd been betrayed by a,
an anarchist friend,

506
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,130
dies at age 33.

507
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:44,480
Christ died at age 33,
betrayed by a friend.

508
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,500
And so he becomes the serve,
not for radical anarchist.

509
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:53,501
He becomes a vision of how life should
be and their songs called La have ashore

510
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:58,580
or, and there's another one called
the dynamite polka being son,

511
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:03,200
because dynamite from the point of view
of anarchists leveled the playing field.

512
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:08,860
And they viewed dynamite rather as the
way in which muskets helped in the domain

513
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:11,810
of feudalism.
Uh,

514
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,740
it levels the playing field and
dynamite after all was invented by who?

515
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,560
By no bell,
as in the Nobel prize.

516
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:23,200
And so the people who support diamond
dynamite in French or called the Dean Dean

517
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:27,250
and me tie the dynamite and the
dynamite polka in [inaudible].

518
00:33:27,251 --> 00:33:30,210
And where you have a lot of
anarchist writers and artists, um,

519
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:34,500
Pizarro is an anarchist,
uh, and the literary, uh,

520
00:33:34,501 --> 00:33:37,120
the art critic and literary and
art critic above all art, uh,

521
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:41,750
Felix defend y'all who was a friend of
a meat only as an Arnica anarchist, uh,

522
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:46,620
as well. So it's end of this world
that, uh, the young Amy agree,

523
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,750
here you go. Here's this one
of, I read hundreds of these
things. Uh, this, it said,

524
00:33:50,751 --> 00:33:53,270
you, you, you've always been a
hard with your domestics. Uh,

525
00:33:53,271 --> 00:33:55,910
you're going to be blown
up a desk to the richest.

526
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:58,220
There are hundreds of these things.
They're all sent all over Paris,

527
00:33:58,221 --> 00:34:01,340
not just the fancy neighborhoods. And
there are many times, not many times,

528
00:34:01,341 --> 00:34:03,740
but I didn't, I had been in
hundreds and hundreds of times,

529
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:07,670
but at the airport you hear
these explosions sometimes
as they blow up suitcases

530
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:10,720
that haven't been claimed.
That's the first known, you know,

531
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,500
machine that blows up a suspect items
including lots of bad jokes and when

532
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:19,490
sardine cans with a little bit of a powder
left in them and that kind of thing.

533
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,181
Um,

534
00:34:20,181 --> 00:34:25,181
so it's in this world that [inaudible]
learns to hate and that he certainly,

535
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:30,770
uh, he certainly does. That's
where his mom had her obash. Uh,

536
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,680
ironically it's near
Youhow Disney, uh, now,

537
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:36,620
but then it was a village that's not the
one that was up the street a little bit.

538
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,060
So I did follow them around.
You can see,

539
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:42,200
and there's his mother there and up on
the right is the place he lived in. Um,

540
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:47,720
one of the places he lived always around
except for one occasion around we'll

541
00:34:47,721 --> 00:34:52,280
mask. And that's his, his
girlfriend. He had unrequited love.

542
00:34:52,281 --> 00:34:55,760
She had the disadvantage of being married
to another anarchist and he writes her

543
00:34:55,761 --> 00:35:00,260
clumsy poems. He falls in love with her.
She blows him off. Uh, but in the end,

544
00:35:00,261 --> 00:35:04,040
she wanted to take full credit before
the press for having been the lover of

545
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:08,170
Immuno knee after his deeds,
his bombs. But he wasn't a,

546
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,500
and that's one of the places he worked
at Paris. I love that because see,

547
00:35:10,501 --> 00:35:11,870
you hear that,
that's a beautiful sign.

548
00:35:11,871 --> 00:35:13,880
And that company hasn't
existed since World War One,

549
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,920
but you can follow him around.

550
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:20,240
And then in 1892 and meet
on Henri two years earlier,

551
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:25,310
he had killed before there was a strike
in the south and France and Camo glass

552
00:35:25,311 --> 00:35:26,690
workers in Camo.

553
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:32,090
And so the third block on
the left is number 11, and
that's where the company is.

554
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:37,190
And, uh, they found a bomb. They're
placed about 11 in the morning, uh,

555
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:40,080
right there. That's not the way it
looked. Then I've gotten in there,

556
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:43,500
I've gotten in there twice a to
see where he placed the bomb.

557
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,400
My son gets a little tired dad, we have
to look at another one of these places.

558
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:52,320
Uh, they find the bomb and they carry
it down to uh, uh, the police station,

559
00:35:52,321 --> 00:35:55,770
which is still there and
it was a reversible bomb,

560
00:35:55,771 --> 00:35:58,890
which means I'm in the chemicals
running together. Boom. And it blew.

561
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:03,840
It kills five people,
terribly. Five policemen in a
secretary among them, you know,

562
00:36:03,841 --> 00:36:07,590
body parts just all over
the place and meet Henri is,

563
00:36:07,591 --> 00:36:08,700
that's one of the places he lived.

564
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:12,630
He is eliminated from the list of suspects
because they said he could not have

565
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:17,190
gone on the two errands is his boss sent
that day from near the station of the

566
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:19,530
north down toward the center of Paris,

567
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:24,710
then up toward the Arc de Triomphe gone
back to [inaudible] and gotten the bomb,

568
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:28,410
placed the bomb and got back in two
hours and 15 minutes when he went to his

569
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:33,000
trial for his life. When he went on trial
for his life in 1894, uh, detective said,

570
00:36:33,001 --> 00:36:35,550
yeah, he could have done that
in two hours and 15 minutes.

571
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,790
So being a bit of an impure
assist, I did it. Uh,

572
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,020
and I replaced Treadway and Omani
booths with a bus and with a metro.

573
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,560
I never take cabs, but I took a
instead of a carriage, of course not,

574
00:36:46,561 --> 00:36:50,220
didn't take that I took a cab and I
subtracted 11 minutes when my cab couldn't

575
00:36:50,221 --> 00:36:54,540
turn left on the Avenue
Lopez. Um, and, um, he did it.

576
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,710
There's no question about it.
In fact,

577
00:36:55,711 --> 00:36:57,690
when they did the
reconstitution of this building,

578
00:36:57,691 --> 00:37:00,600
he knew every single part
of this building. He did it.

579
00:37:00,601 --> 00:37:05,160
There's no question about it. Um, and why
did he hate so well, part of it, again,

580
00:37:05,161 --> 00:37:06,930
that this is the theme
we've talked about before,

581
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:09,450
was the social geography of Paris.

582
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:14,130
Everywhere he lived with one exception
that you just saw was in people's Paris

583
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,520
and all of the facades are still there.
Um,

584
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,960
that's where he lived on the roof
of that home. It doesn't name,

585
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:21,600
that's where he lived in the very top
floor. That's where the poor lived.

586
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:26,780
He gets the bomb there in 1892 and they
hated sock recur for reasons you already

587
00:37:26,821 --> 00:37:31,821
know because it was a symbol of penance
for the Franco Prussian war and pennants

588
00:37:33,031 --> 00:37:35,220
for the commune.
And his father was,

589
00:37:35,221 --> 00:37:38,730
was one of the people condemned to death
who have lucky enough to get out and

590
00:37:38,731 --> 00:37:43,350
not be executed. And there isn't a Zoloft,
no novel that's very underappreciated,

591
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,660
called Paris published in 1898.

592
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,700
It's about a priest who to take an
rem song is losing his religion.

593
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:56,040
Uh, and his brother is an
anarchist Guillaume and he
has fantasies about blowing

594
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:59,630
this place up. I think
it's ugly as hell, but,

595
00:37:59,631 --> 00:38:01,240
and I once went with my wife to,
uh,

596
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:05,220
see where they cast the huge bell that
would drive people nuts and still does

597
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,610
called the Stavo. Yeah. But that
bill wasn't there. But as a symbol,

598
00:38:08,611 --> 00:38:12,960
you can't walk around with masks
and not see it from various places.

599
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:17,490
And so he becomes a terrorist because
the people that he sees around him are

600
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,120
very rapport. And he convinces himself,
even though he's an intellectual,

601
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:24,500
he's a bourgeois. He could've
gotten into the coal, uh,

602
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:28,920
po putting technique, which
is a super, uh, groans a cold.

603
00:38:28,921 --> 00:38:32,610
It's a big engineering school. He's a
great student. He's an intellectual.

604
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:35,010
And that's the other thing
besides picking innocent people,

605
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:38,140
quote unquote innocent people. All people
are innocent. But you know what I mean?

606
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:43,150
Uh, he, the other thing is about, he
is not a sad sack or dangerous one.

607
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,170
Like Ravi Shoal.

608
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:48,550
He is not a guy called [inaudible] who
places a little teeny tack bomb and

609
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,670
frozen the Chamber of Deputies,
uh,

610
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:54,030
to call attention to the plight
of the poor and his guillotine.

611
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:57,670
The first person in the 19th century
Ghia teen who did not kill somebody.

612
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:00,550
And so this guy goes out to kill.

613
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:05,520
There's a scene in an old Balzac
novel called um, um, oh, all of us up.

614
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:08,290
Balzac novels by definition
are old obviously, but,

615
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:13,470
but called the old [inaudible] hill in
which [inaudible] who sort of this down

616
00:39:14,171 --> 00:39:15,250
and out noble who,

617
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:18,820
who wants to make the bid time big time
in Paris by sleeping with all the right

618
00:39:18,821 --> 00:39:22,580
people. Uh, after go, he'll dies. Um,

619
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:27,100
he's up in the northeast quadrant of
Paris at parallel [inaudible] cemetery and

620
00:39:27,101 --> 00:39:31,930
he waves his arms down his hand
down toward the fancy quarters down,

621
00:39:31,931 --> 00:39:36,610
ironically near where the cafe terminus
would be the fancy quarters even before

622
00:39:36,611 --> 00:39:39,550
their boulevards. And he
says the equivalent and
it's war between you and me.

623
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:43,540
Now baby, it's not, it's a rough
translation, but that's what he said.

624
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:48,220
Immune Henri walking around on the
hills and seeing people walk down to be

625
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:49,780
domestics because they
couldn't afford the,

626
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,890
to take the Tom way or the Omni boost
or draw a horse drawn carriages.

627
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:57,880
He waves his hand and says, it's
war between you and me, baby.

628
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:02,830
And I will ignite the spark
that kills you MFS right away.

629
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,160
And that's what he does.
And when he walked out of his apartment,

630
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,240
he looked down and you what?
Happily,

631
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,750
he didn't have to see the
tour Montparnasse which
hadn't been built after huge

632
00:40:13,751 --> 00:40:17,560
payoffs in the early
1970s. This disgusting. Uh,

633
00:40:17,561 --> 00:40:22,150
but what he could see his he symbols of
capitalism, the state and the church.

634
00:40:22,151 --> 00:40:26,470
What did he see? He saw the top Eiffel
Tower, which was five years old,

635
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:30,670
a symbol of the Republican and the
bourgeois revolution as he saw it.

636
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:35,020
He sees the Ponti on where they buried
all these Napoleonic Marshall's who'd

637
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:39,130
basically got a lot of people killed
if they didn't get themselves killed.

638
00:40:39,131 --> 00:40:42,910
And he sees North Dakota Dom and he says,

639
00:40:42,911 --> 00:40:47,020
it's war between you and me. And this is
the facade. I mean, I love this stuff.

640
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:51,100
The inside building where he loved
his, where he lived isn't, uh,

641
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:55,090
isn't there anymore. And now it's kind
of an area that's a little bit sketchy.

642
00:40:55,091 --> 00:40:57,430
There's a lot of drug dealing.
When I got myself into there,

643
00:40:57,431 --> 00:41:00,280
I had to kind of didn't want to
look like a plain clothes policemen.

644
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:04,210
Do I rate risk looking like a
plainclothes policemen? No. Did I did,

645
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,850
I didn't want to look like a
tourist, you know, sort of slumming.

646
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,440
I don't look like that much either.

647
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:11,080
And when I went by these guys who were
sort of hanging out there, I said,

648
00:41:11,081 --> 00:41:14,010
said Lou, they got, or something
like that, or hi guys, what's up? Uh,

649
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,480
and I got myself in there to
see where he wants had lived.

650
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:20,110
But the point of that is
that you can see what he saw.

651
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:25,150
And that gate is exactly the same is that
day when he walked out to kill for the

652
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:30,151
second time and his bomb that he
threw into the terminal newest.

653
00:41:31,081 --> 00:41:33,830
Now this is back in 1894.
This is where we started.

654
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,790
It hit a chandelier and exploded.
And he said,

655
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,370
he said at his trial
that he threw it too low.

656
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,980
You should have thrown into higher.
It would have killed more people.

657
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:48,020
Only one died. He'd already killed five
before. Um, and then people are terrified.

658
00:41:48,021 --> 00:41:51,230
They run all over the place. Uh,
it was speculated that it was,

659
00:41:51,231 --> 00:41:56,210
his was sort of an indirect suicide
because his unrequited love this,

660
00:41:56,211 --> 00:42:01,210
this lady you live and the Boulevard
Voltaire, uh, whose name was Elise, um,

661
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,470
at least, uh, really, uh, and, but no,

662
00:42:03,471 --> 00:42:07,310
because he tries to escape in order
to kill again and they chase them.

663
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:11,480
They catch them. A Barbara helps catch
'em. Uh, a controller on the, on the, uh,

664
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:16,250
tramway hits him with the control
mechanism that punches tickets. Just like,

665
00:42:16,251 --> 00:42:17,720
you know,
in the old days on those things,

666
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,250
not that I ever was in a
horse drawn carriage. Um,

667
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,840
and they get them and they take him.
Um,

668
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,840
he's arrested for murder and
we all agree, uh, and uh,

669
00:42:26,841 --> 00:42:31,040
is put on trial.
That's where he's writing his mother.

670
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:35,000
We know a lot about him because, uh, cause
they kept all these, these documents.

671
00:42:35,001 --> 00:42:39,020
So this is just, it was so fun doing this.
I love stuff like that, you know, and,

672
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,510
and his mother was devastated as you can.
Well,

673
00:42:41,511 --> 00:42:45,140
imagine she could not believe that her
a meal immediate could've done this.

674
00:42:45,141 --> 00:42:49,130
He was her pride and joy after
the death of the, uh, uh,

675
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,420
of the father and he's put in the sea.

676
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:54,920
Those of you have been to Paris will
recognize this as the concierge of me. Uh,

677
00:42:54,921 --> 00:42:58,760
this is where Louis the 16th
don't tone hopes. Pierre,

678
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:02,390
a Marie Antoinette and other
is a weighted. They put
their head in between the,

679
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:02,871
you know,

680
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:07,550
the little window as they used to say
that petite [inaudible] to be gay teen.

681
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:11,300
It's also got one of the three amongst
magnificent gothic halls anywhere, uh,

682
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,200
in France.

683
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:17,440
And his guards took notes every single
day about what he said in the anarchist

684
00:43:17,871 --> 00:43:20,080
songs. He, he, cause they want to be,

685
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:22,970
they want to prove that he had that
somebody else was involved in this.

686
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:27,500
And there probably was somebody else in
the 1892 attack who helped him close the

687
00:43:27,501 --> 00:43:32,050
bomb. Um, so, uh, I mean long,

688
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,610
he goes on trial in,

689
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:38,150
in April of 1894 and he,
um,

690
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,470
he has, it makes the famous dex
declaration in which he says,

691
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:45,350
you have hung us in Chicago Haymarket.

692
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:50,720
You have guaranteed us that slowly
strangling us in Barcelona. Uh,

693
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:55,130
when Franco was croaking in 1975 a,
they were guaranteeing an anarchist,

694
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:58,820
even at that time,
1975 in Barcelona,

695
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:02,810
you've shot us in Germany. Uh, you have,
I don't know how they killed him in Italy,

696
00:44:02,811 --> 00:44:07,340
but you have killed us in Italy.
And he says, um, you, uh, you,

697
00:44:07,341 --> 00:44:11,780
the bourgeois, uh, who were in this cafe,
you're not innocent this because of you.

698
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:13,850
The petty bourgeois you support,

699
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:17,640
they grow the big ones on
every possible occasion. Uh,

700
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:21,920
you forget about us when you, uh,
when your factory owners throw us out,

701
00:44:21,921 --> 00:44:24,650
when we can no longer work any longer,
uh,

702
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:29,360
or women workers happy not to have had
to prostitute themselves in order to pay

703
00:44:29,361 --> 00:44:33,810
their rent and their husbands rent
by the, uh, by the end of the month.

704
00:44:33,811 --> 00:44:38,811
But would you can ever do is destroy
anarchism is roots are too deep.

705
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:43,710
And he on the 22nd of May,
1894,

706
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,860
so I said about writing a book by
somebody doesn't live very long. Uh,

707
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,520
he is executed at rural cat in Paris,

708
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:55,620
which was by intent the place
where the state, uh, uh,

709
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:59,400
met it out justice right in the
heart of working class Paris.

710
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:04,470
That was not an idol selection of a
space. And we have his notes, you know,

711
00:45:04,471 --> 00:45:07,800
up to the,
up to the very end of his life.

712
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:11,520
This guy de Blair is the executioner.
Uh,

713
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:15,520
Mr Piney and Mr Depakene,
uh, uh, this is, uh,

714
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:20,100
the execution or a meeting out in quotes,
justice.

715
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,470
The last public execution
by the way in France would,

716
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:26,470
does that mean I said this already
was in 1934 through 36 at side.

717
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:31,480
The last execution was in 1974 and I'm
constantly asked by people all sorts of

718
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:36,470
political opinions in France where
we're, uh, executions public, uh, uh,

719
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,930
capital punishment is reputed by most
everybody. How that we still have it here.

720
00:45:39,931 --> 00:45:42,540
This is not a political,
a political diatribes.

721
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:44,490
So I won't say anything about
that anyway, but deep, deep there,

722
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:49,580
his son was the last public execution
or did the last public execution back

723
00:45:50,761 --> 00:45:53,010
when, uh, there he is.

724
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,240
There's somebody else being putting
their head through the little window.

725
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:02,220
That's what I mean by that. Uh, and
uh, at all, no, we got to go back.

726
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:07,800
Okay. And that's is the equivalent
of his mugshot. Uh, uh, so,

727
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:08,550
uh,

728
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:13,550
he was wrong about the d the about
anarchism the roots of anarchism being too

729
00:46:13,561 --> 00:46:17,820
deep. What clearly happens is
that, uh, there is a trial, uh,

730
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,530
the next, uh, uh,

731
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:23,610
during that same summer where they put
a lot of intellectuals on trial who did

732
00:46:23,611 --> 00:46:24,421
nothing you can say,

733
00:46:24,421 --> 00:46:28,230
except to say that there were anarchists
or criticized the state and what my

734
00:46:28,231 --> 00:46:30,750
book is really a book also
about state terrorism.

735
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:34,440
It's about the over exaggerated
that overreaction of states would,

736
00:46:34,441 --> 00:46:38,940
our state is a good example of that.
And, and the tendency to try to, to, uh,

737
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:42,090
denigrate anyone who doesn't agree
with us as being terrorists, uh,

738
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:44,180
whether they were or they're not,
and the intellectuals,

739
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:49,090
the jury sees through it in 1894, and,
and only a couple of thieves are, are,

740
00:46:49,091 --> 00:46:53,030
are condemned and them, uh,
and then not to death. Um,

741
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:58,000
anarchism you know, there's the anarchist
in 1968 in Paris. They're anarchist.

742
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:02,720
There's a band of anarchist in about
19 nine, 1910, 1911 that hold up, uh,

743
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,050
uh, stores with most modern tools,
shotguns and things like that.

744
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:10,800
But the anarchist attacks were over.
There was no question about that.

745
00:47:10,801 --> 00:47:14,490
That doesn't make any meal on re less
interesting as an intellectual at the

746
00:47:14,491 --> 00:47:18,780
cross class kind of, and you see this
and in Middle Eastern terrorism too. Uh,

747
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:23,850
but my book is also about state
terrorism. What stops anarchism, uh, uh,

748
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:28,590
in, in well start stops
anarchist attacks in, uh,

749
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,680
in Spain is the fact that the public
becomes aware that the police were

750
00:47:32,681 --> 00:47:36,160
hideously torturing people who did not
agree with the politics of the state.

751
00:47:36,161 --> 00:47:40,040
They were torturing them. Um, you'll see
where this one could go in a political,

752
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:44,940
uh, uh, uh, diatribe, which this isn't a,
in Italy, when the state overreacts, uh,

753
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:49,210
anarchist, uh, attacks, uh, virtually end.

754
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,880
Now anarchism does not end in Spain.
It does not.

755
00:47:51,881 --> 00:47:55,600
And also for reasons that are perfectly
clear already in Buenos Aires.

756
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:00,520
And there's still huge anarchist community
of exiles from these western European

757
00:48:00,521 --> 00:48:04,030
countries from all over the place.
Uh, living in London. Ironically,

758
00:48:04,031 --> 00:48:06,610
in one of the more she,
she have played parts of London,

759
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,470
which was then very poor
on Charlotte Street,

760
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:11,650
where you can't afford to have
a pint of beer anymore. Uh, and,

761
00:48:11,651 --> 00:48:14,560
and that's where they lived.
But so he was wrong about that.

762
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:18,970
The roots of anarchism, uh, were too
great. But the connection, you know,

763
00:48:18,971 --> 00:48:21,730
that I would make obviously, and this,
and especially since it's being filmed,

764
00:48:21,731 --> 00:48:26,020
was not the place to do it. But when
states, including our own overreact, uh,

765
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,690
what they attend to do is to,
uh,

766
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:31,410
and lash out in ways and
in prison unjustly and in,

767
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:35,770
and torture and don't give legal
rights. What they do is tend to, uh, uh,

768
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:40,460
increase, uh, the number of those
people, uh, who, uh, despise us.

769
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,780
Uh, and if you look back,
and again, the communist,

770
00:48:42,781 --> 00:48:44,440
not in a bad way of thinking about this,

771
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,220
somebody figured out that of all the
victims of anarchism or of terrorist

772
00:48:48,221 --> 00:48:52,380
attacks, no matter how you define
them, the ratio to between victims, uh,

773
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:56,350
of overreaction by states to
victims of anarchist tear.

774
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,720
And I'm not apologizing for Atticus tear.
I hate it.

775
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:02,260
I'm not apologizing for
terror of any kind. I hate it.

776
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:05,200
But the ratio is 260 to one.

777
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:10,020
So I suppose there's a lesson to
be learned there or somewhere. Uh,

778
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:14,350
but it was fun to follow Amy
the Henri, uh, around, even
though I don't admire him.

779
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,020
Uh,

780
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:20,020
and to try to give you a sense of how
people felt when they hated in the 1890s

781
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:25,270
and, and that their answer was
not the same answer. A socialist,

782
00:49:25,271 --> 00:49:28,930
which are to take power mostly
through electoral processes,

783
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:33,400
but to smash the state by blowing it up.
See you on Monday.
