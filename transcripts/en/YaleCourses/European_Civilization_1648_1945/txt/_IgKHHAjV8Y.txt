Speaker 1:          00:02          I'm John [inaudible] and this is history two o two. And so I'm here every Monday and Wednesday, 10 30 to 1120. And the way this course is that, that these are all really major themes. And I'm going to go over this a little bit and I'm going to talk about some of the themes, uh, and I kind of lecture on things that I think that compliment what you're doing. Let me give you an example. Uh, when I talk about imperialism, the new imperialism, why it is that Europe, uh, basically took over the entire world between the 1880s and in 19, uh, 14, uh, I, if you can read the chapter, I have a history of modern Europe, which I had fun writing. Um, but I left her on the boy scouts and I often say that I lecture in the boy scouts because I was thrown out of the boy scouts and a Portland, Oregon when I was a kid because I didn't manage to accumulate a single badge and was totally useless after sports seasons.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Uh, ended up, but that's not why I do it. Because to understand the new imperialism one has to at what, why Europe took over. Essentially all of Africa that had places were totally uncharted, uh, suddenly became a highly contested between British, French and German and Italian, uh, uh, conquerors. Uh, that one has to understand that the culture of imperialism and the origins of the boy scouts in Britain has a lot to do with that. Why generations of British youth and their counterparts in Germany and, and even Australia and New Zealand and other places, uh, began to think that it was important to me to look at a map and their school house, uh, that, that had the color red for Britain. Uh, increasingly taking over the map of Europe and, and lots of other places. I mean, of, uh, uh, of, uh, Asia and Africa and lots of other places as well.

Speaker 1:          01:47          Uh, so instead of at the very beginning of that lecture, I'll say, look, there are three things you really ought to know about the new imperialism. Why, why they did this. And then I talk about, uh, uh, the boy scouts so that those two things will fit together. Or when I talk about World War One and we'll have two lectures. My friend and colleague Jay Winter is doing one of them, uh, on the great war and modern memory. Uh, I, instead of trying to do the entire war, and there's a, I think quite sporty chapter on that in the book. Uh, uh, I'll talk about about trench warfare and you'll see a film called paths of glorious in early a Kubrick film about the mutinies in 19, uh, in 1917 and I'll talk about the mutinies in 1917 when people just said, enough is enough, you know, there's no sense dying for nothing.

Speaker 1:          02:32          We won't go over the top. So, which is to say that, that it's important to come to lecture and it's important to come to sections. I've cut back on the reading. I used to use about four more books than I use now, but it's better to concentrate on what you're doing. Uh, the books are a history of modern Europe, uh, which I basically the second edition, which I wrote for people like you. Um, and then you'll read Persian letters, not all of it. That would be a rather lengthy, lengthy day or so, uh, you read excerpts in person letters and Montesquieu, you know, talks about in a way it talks about relations between West and east. And it's really a phenomenal moment in the history of the enlightenment. Um, and you have a pause where you, you're, you're basically just reading me, uh, uh, for better, for worse, but I hope for better, uh, until you get to Emile Zola as great novel as you know me now.

Speaker 1:          03:25          Uh, which is, uh, which is the classic that a lot of it was the first sort of naturalist, a naturalist novelist, uh, at least in France. And when he wrote Jeremy, now, Jeremy, now it means budding like the budding of trees, but he means the budding of, of people being aware of themselves as, as workers. He went down to the mines in the north of France and the Amazon. And one of the heroes, uh, of of the book is a woman called Kathleen, who is 15 years old, but it's seen a lot of life from being 15 years old. And when Zola, uh, uh, wrote, uh, Jimmy, now he went down into the minds to look at 15 year old, uh, uh, young women, uh, barely older than girls are working in the mines, uh, uh, 12 hours a day. So it's a book that just, you know, it rizzone's with reality and it's really kind of an amazing, amazing, amazing book.

Speaker 1:          04:18          And I think you'll like that. I hope you will. Um, and then helmet Smith's, the butcher tale is about accusations of, uh, uh, of ritual murder in a German town. It's about, about the, the second German hike, uh, and it's about, uh, antisemitism in a small place with bigger consequences. Uh, George Orwell, I went off to fight the good fight in Spain during the Spanish civil war. Uh, where was sort of a dry run for a even more horrible war and even more horrible, uh, a fascist. Um, and it's about his engagement and disillusionment, uh, in, uh, this the Spanish, uh, uh, Republican forces of the loyalist forces and about the tensions and the duplicity of, of, of Stalin's folks, uh, uh, undercutting the trustees and are cutting the anarchists in it. It's one of those classics as a classic for a very good reason. It's really a, a, a marvelous reed.

Speaker 1:          05:18          And finally, there's the ordinary men. Uh, I go to Poland a lot in the last couple of years. I've been there four or five times for, for various reasons. And I'd never been to Auschwitz. And, uh, I went to Auschwitz a a year ago. I don't know. Some of you would probably had been there. And as you're going through this, the horror of it all, and as you're seeing, you're seeing empty suitcases with people's names on them, that people don't exist anymore, and you're seeing baby shoes and things like that. You think who could have done this, who could have gone out, uh, and simply, uh, in assembly line way killed people or in fields around woods, which is a, was a large industrial towns, still live in Poland, simply gone out and blown the brains out of mothers, babies, grandmothers. And anyway, they found who could have done it. Well, the answer that Chris Brown, he has his ordinary men and he had the brilliant idea of looking at, uh, uh, a German unit, essentially policemen from Homburg, uh, the town, the port town of Hamburg, old important Hanseatic port.

Speaker 1:          06:21          And he follows them from the lives of very ordinary people, uh, into the killing fields. It was nothing less than that of Poland, you know, and it's also short here, middle as long, but these other ones are short and, and, uh, uh, it, it's also, you know, it's gripping. It's, it's, it's quite, uh, quite amazing. So, uh, those are the books, I think the history of modern Europe. I hope it's fun to read. Uh, I think you'll enjoy that. And the lectures kind of, you see the themes as speak for themselves. Um, sections that everybody likes. Wednesday night sessions. Uh, one of my colleagues has only Wednesday night sections. Uh, and we've got increasingly to that because sometimes you don't find a large audience on even Friday morning, 10 30 slots. We've abandoned that. So tentatively we're going to have two at seven, two at eight, and then a Thursday at 1:30 PM and Thursday at 2:30 PM.

Speaker 1:          07:20          And I don't know, when are we starting sections? It doesn't, sometimes we don't do it till the second week. It depends on what date, what day is this Wednesday. Um, so I dunno, maybe we'll start on next week. We can, maybe we won't. Who knows? But they will happen. And, and uh, uh, there's also a short sporty paper assignment. And by short, I don't mean two pages. Uh, but, uh, but something like seven pages, eight pages on something that you want to write about. Now let me give you some examples just off the top of my head. If you have any interest in, in painting, for example, it would be interesting to take a, uh, to take a look by say the impression to impressionist painters like Pizarro and, and, uh, um, and when and wow, and to see how they viewed the transformation of 19th century Paris, the big boulevards and all of that.

Speaker 1:          08:08          Or you could take another novel. I mean, Jeremy, now, one of the interesting things about it is that it's a, it's a document of history. You know, it's a novel. So these are invented people, but, but it's a document of history in some ways, as is lots of the great literature on World War One. And there isn't any period in modern history that has so much, so much gripping literature about it as the great war. The British war poets like seek recess soon. And a lot of these people were, you know, were dead after they wrote, uh, uh, as soon wasn't least immediately. I can't remember if he dies in 1918 or not, but, um, uh, to take, to take some of the poetry or the writing of the war and write a paper about it or if you're in a diplomatic history or something like that.

Speaker 1:          08:49          I mean, I don't know. I wouldn't counsel paper of reevaluating the origins of the Crimean war. I that might you put you to sleep before, you know, it puts your ta to sleep, but don't know. You could imagine a good, uh, a good paper on that. I mean, you can do whatever you want. Um, one of the lectures and when I do the enlightenment, a burn from my good friend Bob Darnton, uh, you know, I'll do a thing at the beginning about why the enlightenment was important and what it is, the secularization, rational inquiry and all of that stuff that you may already know. Maybe not, but it's the, it's in the book. But then what I do is I look at some of the, the third string, kind of where the third division in the European football sense of enlightenment hacks, uh, and what they wrote about royalty in about aristocrats and the way they kind of undermine those traditional hierarchies that would be swept away to a large extent by the French revolution.

Speaker 1:          09:39          Or you can take somebody out of the French revolution such as the steely sounds used and who ran off with his mother's silver at age 16 or something and one on the grand tour of France. And, and talk about him and the Committee of public safety that signed away the lives of lots of people, but may have also saved the revolution. You can do whatever you want it. Well, you know, it should have something to do with the course. And in the time period where we're talking about, I mean, I think I, you know, and on the red sox or something, but, uh, uh, you know, work with your teaching participant in it. You know, I'm an email animal. I'm always available on email and I have office hours as well that people don't come to the much anymore. I'm sitting there doing nba.com because email is made, office hours sort of oblivious, I mean a a irrelevant, not oblivious, but uh, people are oblivious to my office hours.

Speaker 1:          10:25          But anyway, uh, uh, they are, uh, where, when are they are Monday is the one to two 30. You used to be three, but I sit there by myself, one to two 30. Uh, in Branford College, a k a k 13. Um, there are also two other movies when we get to fascism when we get the odd off Hitler, we and, and, and he was only one of a whole bunch of dictators. There was hardly any parliamentary regimes left in, in, in, in continental Europe by the time 1939 comes, uh, a woman called Leni Riefenstahl who just died in 2002 at age 102, uh, she in, when she was a young woman and did a propaganda film for Hitler and Hitler. Mussolini believed in high tech. He's one of the first people to, to use the radio. And we, Franklin Roosevelt used the fireside chat or the radio, but Mussolini was already there, you know, uh, piling fault.

Speaker 1:          11:18          So it upon false hood, uh, and, and Italians who can barely afford to eat a all had the radios. And the same thing that happened in, in Germany as well. And she did a book, she did a movie called, uh, a documentary called triumph of the will about Nuremberg. And it is truly chilling is an amazing, uh, it looks like in on a political convention or something. Uh, uh, in some ways, uh, and it's, uh, all of these movies you can see in the privacy of your, your, uh, luxurious suites and Branford or Pearson College or wherever because they're available now in ways I don't even understand. But, but on your, on your Internet, we used to actually show them here. Uh, I used to use this movie, a great movie called the sorrow and the pity, the show. Glad I let PTA and it was four hours long and the, and people describe it as a two, six pack movie.

Speaker 1:          12:03          I end, the janitor is complaining because there's so many rear bottles rattling around. Of course, this was before the drinking age was Lord, of course, a Lo of her was raised. So of course, uh, uh, I don't show that movie. I, I take that back. I don't take that back, but what the hell. But anyway, uh, I don't, I don't, I don't show that movie anymore, but, but, but I do show a triumph of the will and you can watch that at home. Uh, and that the other one is a of lollies on phone because one of the last lectures I talk about resistance and collaboration in Europe and because I live in France much of the time I talk about France, uh, and, uh, of Wiley's on fall. Some of it. Goodbye children. Uh, some of you have probably seen, it was made by Louis [inaudible] who just died a couple of years ago.

Speaker 1:          12:44          Uh, and it was about when he was college, he was, so, he was equivalent of seventh and eighth grade. And there's a new boy shows up at school during World War II in Fontainebleau, which is just south of east of Paris. And he's a boy who hadn't been there before and he's a Jewish boy. And it's about his friendship with this boy. And what happens at the end. It's not a happy film, but it's like, it's a great, great film. Um, what else? But to say there's a midterm, I don't like to waste the lecture giving a midterm. I would rather give a lecture, but we have to have something, uh, to report to you. Uh, if you, if you a tube. But if you don't do very well at all, we don't count it as much as if you do well. Um, I people ask these questions.

Speaker 1:          13:28          I know how much is it worth while, I mean, Geez, if there's more to life than grades, but it's, uh, uh, it's, it's something like 25% and the is 25% and section participation is 10% whatever we work out. And then, uh, and then the final. So, um, it's just, you know, it's an exercise in seeing how your, uh, how you're doing. Um, and it, you know, it really is, is, is no big deal, but it will help you pull the themes of, uh, of the course, uh, together. And it's no scary situation. I mean, we all live in the sort of a minus B plus range, you know, I'll tell you, a couple of years ago I ran into the student, uh, when I rented a student, something, you know, friendly guy. And I see people say, Hey, well how are you? How, you know, how are you? And I ran it.

Speaker 1:          14:11          It's one person said, hi, how are you? And she went, oh, hello. Oh, and I remembered her name and I went and looked it up and there was a B plus and it wasn't that, hi, how are you? A minus or a one. Uh, but I mean, whatever, I'm sure she had all A's and the other courses and a B plus is not the end of the world. And most people get A's. But, uh, uh, whatever. But you have to take the midterm. Just the way they run it here and it's not my idea. So that's what we're going to do. Okay. Now I'm going to talk about seeing some of the themes. And then at the end, I'm going to read you a poem because I got, I started history in a way, in a serious way because I read this poem, so I'll leave that until the end of it.

Speaker 1:          14:53          Um, I didn't go to Yale. I went to University of Michigan maize and blue forever. Very sad, eh, since last weekend. Um, and uh, I could, I came from Portland, Oregon. I don't know if he would come from Portland, Oregon, but that's where I'm from. And when I went off to Michigan, I had been at a Jesuit high school and just what the high schools for it was a sports factory in part. Uh, but, but it was a very good school, but it was very repressive. And I went off to University of Michigan after having gone to a Jesuit school for four years. And, uh, it was wine, women and song and there weren't enough of them in the middle. Uh, and probably too much of the first and my first semester I got, um, I got a 1.9300000000000002 grade point average and my mother asked me if that was under a two point scale, you know, I'm sure his, and I had a, I had an F.

Speaker 1:          15:45          I mean I'm not, I shouldn't laugh at myself and my kids, the, Oh my God, not the same story again, but I got an f and I got two cs and I got a B and the people I hung around with in Anarbor, we're so unaccomplished some of them anyway that they thought I was smart, can I got a B? They say I go by in the dining room, he got a B and they, they asked me to tutor them. Can you imagine that? And so, I mean, some of the people that I hung around with were amazing. You may even know people like that, but I don't think, I don't think so. But one of the guys that I knew, I got to get back to the topic in a minute, but I just thought of this was a sure. The King of Malapropisms and, uh, one day he was going on and on.

Speaker 1:          16:23          This is the people I hung around with. He was going on and on about this good meal at, he'd had, you know, of one course after another and it was fantastic and it was a really good restaurant. And, and you know, somebody snuck him some wine and, and financially I, they're tired of the whole thing. I said, was it gratis? And he said, no, it was chicken. And so those, those are the people that I hung around with the University of Michigan. But I've tried here a long time. Uh, and I stand by maize and blue. But I love Yale. And one of the things I love about Yale's being able to teach people like you, and I mean, and I love this course, so I hope that you will, you will enjoy it if indeed you take it. Now, what about some of the scenes?

Speaker 1:          16:59          What kind of stuff are we good? Are we going to do, could you get some, uh, um, a syllabi for some of those folks back there be great. They're up to, they're up on the the thing. Thanks a lot. I'm a couple of scenes. Um, I don't believe in, I've never believed that history is a series of bins. I guess I wrote that in the book, but that you open up and you say whether it goes enlightenment, shut that baby down, then you open up the next one and here comes 18th century rivalries and you shut that baby and then French level Lucian, while I'm on, I know all about that now. Pretty soon you'd go on to Russian revolution eventually and all that, that you know, to do a course like this where you're going to learn much of what is important to know about Western civilization.

Speaker 1:          17:38          I do believe, um, to do the reading and stuff and if you enjoy the lectures, um, there have to be some Fred's that no, they go to all the way through that, that make it work then make it worth it. So you something and, and one is certainly state making because even if you take a sort of federalized decentralized state, like with this very bizarre electoral system like the United in the United States, uh, that the growth of, of modern states, you know, it doesn't really just come to the 20th century with, with the welfare state beginning in England and even before that in some other places, insurance programs and things like that. It begins with the consolidation of state power, uh, in the late middle ages with, with territorial monarchies, the Spanish and the, and the French and the English monarchies. Uh, it has a lot to do with the growth of absolute rule and that's why I'm going to talk about next time.

Speaker 1:          18:27          Absolute rule. Uh, absolutism, uh, the growth of standing armies, huge standing armies, never seen before, uh, force big forts built on frontiers. Uh, it has a lot to do with bureaucrats who could extract resources from, from ordinary people. While the rich didn't pay anything or hardly anything at all. Uh, it has to do with an allegiance, the dynastic legions that can be transferred later to, to, to a nation, the idea of a nation. And that starts in the 18th century. It doesn't start in the 19th century. It starts in the 18th century, at least in England. And that's an argument that we in Britain, and that's an argument that we'll make. We'll make bef uh, also, you know, in 1500, which is kind of when that book gets rolling, they only started about 1648. Um, there was about 1500 different terror, Touro units in Europe and some are no bigger than archbishops garden in, in Germany.

Speaker 1:          19:22          And some were larger states. Not yet what they are now in terms of size, such as France and, and uh, Eh, uh, which expanded under Louis, the 14th it into, you know, Alsace and, and, and, and Lauren and, and various other places. But there's about 1500 territorial units in 1890. There were 30. And so the consolidation of state power, which is looking at it from the state out or the, the, the emergence of an identity where you see yourself as German as opposed to a Bavarian French as opposed to Gaskell or Provence, Sal, uh, Spanish as opposed to Castilian, uh, or as opposed to cattle [inaudible] the cat law language was illegal until 1975. It's 75 until a Francisco Franco finally Croak, uh, in 1975 and November. Uh, uh, and so, uh, some, somebody, this is a great phrase, some, I wish I had said it originally, I don't know who said it, but someone once said that a language is a dialect with a powerful army.

Speaker 1:          20:28          And that's it. That's true. France at the time of the French revolution, half the people in France, new French, there was bilingualism. You could know Katella. You could, you could know over in Europe, Patois, we live in the south of France where a lot of people's old people still speak a patois though now that's mostly dying out. Uh, and how does it come that identity, a sense of allegiance to a state or a country? Not everybody, but how does it come to 1914 when people marching off to get killed, uh, thinking they're Macias and the French national anthem, uh, in, in, in pretty good French. How does that happen? How does the state increase its reach? How does the modern world, how is it created? We call this process, it's a clumsy world word, but state making. How does states form? And the other side of this is how do identities change?

Speaker 1:          21:18          If you, you know, in the 16th century, 17th century as somebody who we were say, who are you? And they say, well, you know, I am so, so I'm of this family or I am Protestant. If it was the 16th century or late 16th century or late 16th century, where anytime after 15, twenties and thirties, and parts of Germany, I'm Protestant, uh, I am Jewish, uh, uh, in much of the Balkans. I am Muslim, uh, in most of Europe. Uh, I am Catholic and eaten in Eastern Europe. I am, you know, Russian Orthodox. I live in a village, Mir, Mir, uh, uh, in Russia. How does it happen that by the end of the 19th century, people have you in Russia as they're starving to death, a starving in the famine that the Tolstoy, the great writer called the world's attention to, you know, they, a lot of them died and in fields thinking only if the czar only knew that we were starving and that his ministers were treating this bad, how angry he would be.

Speaker 1:          22:10          Well, they didn't get it. That the, you know, that they didn't know that this art could have given one damn. Uh, but, but the, the allegiance to the czar, that sense of being Russian, uh, or being dominated by the Russians are something they had to be constructed as a w. So the state constructs its ability to, to, to, uh, to extract taxes, extract bodies for national armies, also to provide resources. But identities are transformed. And so I give this as an example cause state making is, is one of the themes that kind of ties everything together. And you know, this course a ends in 1945 but look at, look at the problems and the post communist world of, of state making and look what's going on in Georgia, which is more complicated than, than, than the newspapers, uh, uh, uh, present in very many ways or look what the horror show of of the Balkans in the 1990s.

Speaker 1:          23:02          So a lot of the issues, uh, religious hatreds that we thought only were, would be limited to Northern Ireland. You know, that's another theme that's very important to the whole thing. Another, as of course is economic change. Obviously this is not a course in economic history, uh, but the rise of capitalism, I mean, that's what it's called, capitalism or large scale industrialization. It changes in ways that, that, that will suggest in the reading. And then I'll talk about a little bit the way people live in very fundamental ways. There's lots of continuity's, but there's lots of big changes. Everybody has an end up in the assembly lines right away. Uh, and there are other ways of, of, of other rural production. Uh, a women's work, uh, remains terribly, terribly important. Uh, and I'll spend some time doing that. A very dear friend of mine, my mentor, Indeed Chuck Tilly, who just died a couple months ago, my great sadness once said that it's very, it's bitter hard.

Speaker 1:          23:56          It's bitter hard to write the history of remainders. And so lots of people who were left out of all of this. I'll do one lecture when I talk, I talk about popular protest and I'll take three examples of, of people rebelling and I, I stand back and said, what does this mean? What is going on here? I take the example from, from the Pyrenees mountains, a place called the edge. We're not responsible for that name would never be, but we're suddenly men dressed as women carrying guns or carrying pitchforks. Came down out of the miss out of the snow and, and drove away charcoal burners and drove away forest guards. Why? Because they'd lost access to glean to pasture. They're, they're miserable animals. Uh, because the wealthy big surprise got the law on their side as the price of wood goes up. They didn't walk around and say, well, I'm a remainder.

Speaker 1:          24:50          Eventually I'm going to have to move to Toulouse. And my grand, great, great grandchildren will work in the El Spatialos in the air industry. Uh, there they didn't say I'm remained a number 231, but they fought for their dignity and for a sense of moral of justice that they thought existed at one time that had been taken away by economic changes they couldn't control. And then I take an example from the south of England from the same time, 1829, 1830, when they say they're fine people that uh, dead with only dandelions and their stomach dead of hunger. And then these people start marching. The poor, the rich and poor rural labor start marching and threatening people with threshing machines. Why threshing machines? Cause threshing machines was taking away their work as harvesters. And one day they found a sign that said revenge from the is on the wing from thy determined captain swing suggested that there were many, they were righteous.

Speaker 1:          25:46          They were just, they were armed. They were ready to Catherine's swing exist. Of course not. They were weak and they get lost there. They get defeated. Some of them are Hong, lots of them are sent to Tasmania. The prisoner at Port Arthur Tasmania, they're sent to Australia. That's why when the Australians play the English, a lot of the Australian sing, we, you know, that Old Beatles Song, yellow submarine now, which you don't remember. I, which I vaguely remember, uh, we, you know, we all live in a convent colony, a convict colony, a convict colony, uh, captain swing, they lost, but they went down fighting. And it's bitter hard to write the history of remainders. But when you look up from that and you say, look what the, what's going on here? When you look at people fighting for grain, fighting for food, they're fighting against the larger process that they can't, they can't control, but it tells you a lot what's going on over the big picture.

Speaker 1:          26:37          So that's another one. And then there is just, I'll just take one more, uh, maybe another 10. I'm going to read my poem and they then, then you can go. But I hope you come back. Um, war war as a dynamic of change. Um, the 18th centuries, what warfare changes with Napoleon? Uh, there were already changes in the 18th century, but it was still basically professional armies are people getting conscripted into the British navy because they were drunk at the wrong place, at the wrong time, outside of a tavern in Portsmith or something. And next thing they know, they're throwing up on a, on a ship bobbing off, uh, it sort of the English empire, uh, but, but warfare changes with the nation state. The French called it [inaudible]. That's her mass conscription, the sense of defending the nation. And there's this magic moment where the artisans of Paris defeat the, you know, highly professional art lies army at a windmill called Vat and me, uh, in the east of France.

Speaker 1:          27:33          And it changes the way things were. A Napoleon is arguably the first total war, uh, because of a war against civilians, uh, in, uh, uh, where they're no longer the traditional limits between fighting against civilians in fighting against the, uh, against armies and other, those limits hadn't existed in the 30 years war. And I'll talk a little bit about that, uh, uh, a next time around, but, but the wars are very different. You know, there were, there's famous Goya paintings of, of a peasants being gunned down by French soldiers and, and atrocities against the peasants in Calabria, in the south of Italy. So warfare really changes, but it becomes a dynamic of change. If you think about the Russian revolution of 1917, the Russian revolution was not inconceivable without world war one a, but it was sort of inconceivable without the Russian revolution of 1904, nine, I have 1905 in the feet in Japan by the Japanese and, and an extraordinary, uh, shocking event for, at least for Europeans in, in 1904 1905.

Speaker 1:          28:31          And World War One provides opportunities for dissidents in Russia to put forward their claims. So when the whole thing collapses on the czar's head, uh, in February, 1917 and the Bolsheviks come to power, the war itself with the dynamic of change as well. And what a war, uh, what wars, I mean, there had been nothing ever like it. A few journalists who had been in, uh, the Russian Japanese war had seen trenches, uh, in, in Manchuria that had been built, but nobody could have imagined that the ward was supposed to be over in six weeks, was going to destroy four empires. Uh, that is the, the, the Ottoman Empire, the Austro-hungarian Empire, the German empire, and the Russian empire. And arguably this, we can talk about this. We can debate this, the British empire, because lots of people who had fought in India, oh, Indians who had fought in the war, or people now we'd call Pakistani's who'd fought in the war, or people from Kenya who fought in the war, uh, are no longer going to be satisfied with, was simply, you know, arguing that they're part of the, of the great empire, even though they have, have, uh, hardly any rights and no money and simply work for the, uh, for the big guy.

Speaker 1:          29:41          Um, and so the war transforms, uh, uh, Europe by destroying these empires. What it also does and is very possible to argue this. And, and, um, and my friend Jay Winter, who is great expert on world war one and Bruno and combine also who's on leave this year would agree with this. You can see the whole period in 1914, 1945 as a new and more karabal 30 years' war because Europe is in depression all through the 1920s and thirties, agriculture, depression the whole time, uh, only between 1924, 1929 is it not big industrial depression, uh, the poisoning of the political atmosphere. I'll give, I'll talk. I'm going to do a whole lecture on Hitler and the National Socialists Cause War. Ro One created Hitler. He was already just as pathetic a guy with great grandiose plans with no friends and, and that sort of a sad sack going to the theater and uh, and a of droning on and on about all I knew about Wagner, who we loved and in the theater and in a threadbare coat, but world war one transforms him into an anti-semite.

Speaker 1:          30:43          He was already an anti socialist. It transforms a Munificent, anti-semite people, the troops that came back, many of them simply kept on marching. They'd survived the war, and they kept on marching, marching and the poisoning and the political atmosphere was something that was simply extraordinary. And you have to under understand fascism. This is terribly, terribly important. Uh, you have to understand what happens in world war one. Great expectations dashed, uh, the treaty of Versailles, which only the great British thinker, John Maynard Keynes really got right predicting the disaster that came out of it. If there's no more fascinating period in history, uh, uh, in my mind, it's, it's absolutely a fantastic, and what a war. It's all obvious. Everybody's seen these films, imperial or war museum, which has been kind of wreck the way they've done it. Now it's sort of too high tech, but a in London.

Speaker 1:          31:32          Uh, but it, I leave you with just a couple of thoughts that the battle of the Somme in 1916 that started in July 1st when they blow the whistle and say over the top guys, uh, there are more British soldiers killed and wounded in the first three days of the battle of the Somme, Som m e three days, three days. Then there were Americans killed in world war one, Korea and Vietnam combined in three days. Whereas where are the great British leaders in the 1920s in the 1930s, they're all dead. They're hung up on that old Barb wire. It's one of the war poets put it there are hung up on that old Barb wire. One guy, a soccer player. I said, well, I'm gonna, you know, we'll, we'll, we'll get some enthusiasm. He drives to dribble a ball across, you know, these trenches and things like across the bow, the craters and he doesn't make it.

Speaker 1:          32:27          He's, he's killed in 1950, 1914 and Christmas Day. The Germans and the, and the, and the British soldiers, I'm to say enough of this stuff for the day and they sing to each other and they actually play soccer. They play football. 1915, or British soldiers says let's do the same thing and you put him against the wall and shoot him 19, the war, the horror of the war. Uh, uh, it, it transforms Europe. Every aspect of Europe. Uh, it's impossible to understand the growth of the agrarian, a sort of semi fascist regimes in eastern Europe and very much under Nazi influence, uh, without understanding World War One. Uh, the war that the supposed to end all wars, of course it doesn't do that at all. And that's a big stop on, uh, on our uh, uh, on our agenda as well. We did, we used to read all quiet on the western front, but everybody's read that and then we read Robert Graves rather long and self indulgent, a good bite, all of that.

Speaker 1:          33:22          So that was pretty long. So we don't do that, but we do, we will, we will try to rock. Let me just read you my poem and then you can, then you can go, uh, Lincoln, whatever you want. But anyway, but I remember this, I remember reading this poem, uh, back in University of Michigan, uh, on, uh, uh, on two o'clock on a Saturday trying to figure out what it does in the night before, but ain't we know, um, this is Brett, the great, uh, East German East German poet, and it's called a worker reads history. And let me begin by saying that we're going to study quote unquote great. I mean, really quote unquote great men, great women. Uh, Hitler is obviously not a great man, but he's a, you know, awful, just awful. But the people who were thought to a made history in Napoleon, uh, Peter, the great, uh, other people I do talk about the folks that you read about and in textbooks, including mine, but I asked the same question and post you the same question that Breck poses, and it's a short poem.

Speaker 1:          34:22          So just hang on. Who built the seven gates of thieves? The books are filled with the names of kings was at kings who hold the craggy blocks of stone and Babylon so many times destroyed. Who built the city up each time in which of Lima's houses? The city glittering wood with gold lived those who built it in the evening when the Chinese wall was finished, where did the masons go? Imperial Rome is full of Arcs of triumph. Who reared them up over whom did the Caesar's triumph? Byzantium lives in song where all her dwellings, palaces, and even in Atlantis of the legend, the night to see rushed in the drowning men still bellowed for their slaves. Young Alexander conquered India. He alone, Caesar beat the goals. Was there not even a cookie in his army. Philip of Spain wept as his fleet was sunk and destroyed. Were there no other tiers? Frederick the great triumphed in the seven years war. Who triumphed with him? Each page a victory at whose expense? The victory ball every 10 years. A great man who paid the Piper. So many particulars. So many questions, and if you hang with us this semester, we'll get at some of those. Yep.

Speaker 2:          36:15          Thank you.
