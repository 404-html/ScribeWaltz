1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,030
Okay.
There's an outline up here.

2
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:06,420
I'm going to try to write a little
bigger from now on and it's been already

3
00:00:06,421 --> 00:00:11,280
suggested. I use capital letters and maybe
practice my printing a little better.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,730
I will do that too.
I'm not very high tech.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,750
I will occasionally use some
visuals slides here and there,

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,280
a painting here and there,

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,780
an image now and then and certainly maps,

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,100
especially in dealing with the 1850s
in the coming of the civil war.

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,820
But every lecture we'll have an outline
in front of you and the intention in

10
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:38,190
every case is to get to the
fifth part of that outline.

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,540
I almost always do
almost,

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,420
uh,
but at least you'll have a,

13
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,570
a sense of the structure of the topics
or the themes that this lecture is

14
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:56,220
supposed to work. It's way through.
I do welcome your questions.

15
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,410
I'll ask at times if
you have any questions.

16
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,350
This is obviously a
terribly formal situation.

17
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:04,920
Me Up here on this stage and you out there

18
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,560
looking into your laptops in some cases,
uh,

19
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,930
doing whatever you're
doing on your laptops.

20
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,010
Just don't do what one
student did a year ago though.

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,810
He was right back there and that,
uh, that I always, like halfway back,

22
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,033
he came in,

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,940
it was the day I was lecturing on the
dred Scott decision for some reason I've

24
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:27,780
never forgotten that.

25
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,500
And you whipped out the Yale Daily News
and he just was enjoying the Yale Daily

26
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,770
News. I know it was that much to
read in it for that long at the time,

27
00:01:37,771 --> 00:01:41,610
but he's just reading the Yale
Daily News in front of them.

28
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,790
And at one point I stopped
rather loudly and I said,

29
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,410
the dred Scott decision is not covered
in today's Yale Daily News and you didn't

30
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:53,520
hear me. So I shouted it
again. And by that time,

31
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:56,380
the whole class has meaning
to laugh or uncomfortably.

32
00:01:56,381 --> 00:01:59,660
And he finally realized
it was going on tour,

33
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,300
got crumbled up his newspaper and walked
out the back and he never came back.

34
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,770
I felt a little badly about it,
but

35
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,700
just don't make it so obvious.

36
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,780
All right. Um, does everybody have a
syllabus? Anyone lacking a syllabus?

37
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,300
Everyone's got a copy.
Uh,

38
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,570
we may need some more in the
balcony. People need needs, bye.

39
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:31,620
They're hiding up there. Which uh,
David, do you have any extras or,

40
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,980
oh, okay. No, it's why

41
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,190
none left.
Okay.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,320
We'll have more on Thursday
and I should put it on the web.

43
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,253
Dom,

44
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,820
I will put it up this afternoon.
We'll get it up on the web, uh,

45
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,620
through the registrar's site or however.
Um,

46
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,001
Teddy,

47
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:15,001
I'm going to take up the topic primarily
of why the American civil war period

48
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,490
has had,
still has such a hold

49
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,490
on the American and for that matter,
international historical imagination.

50
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,940
That's what I want to
talk about primarily,

51
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,560
but I want to say a word or two
about the structure of the course and

52
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,150
what you need to do as quickly
as possible. First of all,

53
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,290
every lecture, if you look
at the syllabus, has a topic,

54
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,330
a title of a kind.

55
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,490
I will not get behind spite
of what it may feel like.

56
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,800
The readings are listed
each week we are using,

57
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:07,240
among other things, there's a
combination of readings. In fact,

58
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:10,420
a rich combination of
historical monograph,

59
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:15,930
historical kind of syntheses two works
of fiction to novels worn by the Louisa.

60
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:23,280
May Alcott, a famous short, um,

61
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,900
classic little book
called Hospitals Sketches,

62
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:30,901
which was based on Alcotts
personal experience as a
nurse in civil war hospitals

63
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,380
and experienced that all bit overwhelmed
her emotionally, psychologically,

64
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,240
and she in some ways could not
stop thinking about it. Uh,

65
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,750
we also are reading using to readers
that is collections of documents.

66
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:51,751
One is a collection of documents by
mostly by and somewhat about Abraham

67
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,300
Lincoln,
a reader edited by Michael Johnson.

68
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,890
There's Nicole Ivy entering as we speak,
the eighth teaching assistant.

69
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,870
Sorry Nicole. We just did intros. Um,

70
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,430
anyway, one of the readers is,
is Lincoln the great speeches,

71
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,730
the great public letters.
We won't use every document in the book,

72
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,940
but the Great Lincoln stuff is all there
and well introduced the other reader,

73
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:21,280
which we use virtually
every week in the course.

74
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,870
And teaching assistants will be free
with this to assign whichever documents

75
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:30,690
they so choose. And any given week, I'm
still taking the plastic off the farm.

76
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,830
Um, it's edited by Bill Ganapathy,
Napa, great civil war historian,

77
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:37,030
recently deceased.

78
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,600
It's a collection of documents
from essentially the Mexican war,

79
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:42,100
right on through reconstruction.

80
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,340
Many of them very brief and
short documents allowing
us at times to teach with a

81
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:48,364
document.

82
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,030
It's possible you'll have an entire
discussion section that centers around a

83
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:55,480
single document as well as the other
reading you did his background.

84
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:57,831
Uh,

85
00:05:57,831 --> 00:06:02,831
the other novel I neglected dimension is
a very new novel and I'm taking a risk

86
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:06,320
in this course for years and years.

87
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:10,730
I want to admit how many I've always
taught Michael Sharice great civil war

88
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:12,200
novel.
The killer angels,

89
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,920
which I would venture quarter of you
have probably already read. All right.

90
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:17,450
How many have already read killer angels?

91
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,140
We're not reading at this time.
You can't take that week off.

92
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,550
We're reading the Eel,
Dr Rosen new novel called the march,

93
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,870
which has only been out about
a year just into paperback.

94
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,130
It's doc doctor Oh,

95
00:06:35,131 --> 00:06:40,131
the great modern novelists
of Urban America,

96
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:44,990
of,
of race in America have so many things.

97
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,690
He has actually a brilliant short
story in the current New Yorker.

98
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,840
If you haven't read it,
it may not appeal to all of you.

99
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:55,160
It's really about middle aged
men in the suburbs. I got it.

100
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:57,883
Um,

101
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:02,330
any rate dr o's March is about
Sherman's march to the sea.

102
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,860
It's about Sherman, but it's also
about all the people around him.

103
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:12,770
And I think Dr. Rowe accomplished
something extraordinary in that novel,

104
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:18,490
which so few American writers of fiction
I've ever quite been able to imagine.

105
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,730
He's not alone,
but not many have,

106
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:27,530
and that is fully realized
slave characters, those,

107
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:31,850
he invents a lot of real people
in that book and much of it,

108
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:35,280
like so many of other, uh, of Dr.
Rose. Great works like ragtime.

109
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,070
If you've read ragtime or others,
much of the much of the language,

110
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:43,100
the dialogue is verbatim
out of historical sources.

111
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,390
You might even want to reach Sherman's
memoirs in tandem with it if you have the

112
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:52,240
time, because the whole portions of it
come directly out of Sherman's memoirs.

113
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,960
Then there are characters invented around.
Anyway,

114
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,560
it's that last horrible,
devastating,

115
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,030
destructive,
evil,

116
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,880
sometimes good year and a half of the
civil war in Georgia and South Carolina

117
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:19,570
when the civil war became a
truly kind of total modern,

118
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,200
um, affair. Uh,

119
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,560
it's a novel about this
beast of war itself,

120
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,850
but it's very much a novel
about what this war was about.

121
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,210
Anyway.
Um,

122
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:40,250
I don't want to go into all the readings
were I divide this course in three

123
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:44,630
parts, which may or may not be obvious
the first time he glanced at the syllabus,

124
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,040
but essentially the first third of the
course is the coming of the civil war.

125
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's the story from roughly the
mid 1840s through fort Sumpter.

126
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,950
And the second,

127
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:06,951
third of the course is essentially the
war itself where we tackle not only how

128
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:12,090
the civil war was fought,
but we tackle what it was about.

129
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,620
We tackle the question of
confederate defeat and union victory.

130
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,510
How do we explain that? And we
especially tackle questions of meaning.

131
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,920
If a war is such a devastation
can have meaning in the end,

132
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,190
what are those meanings? It's, I think,

133
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:34,191
arguably the most important take home
set of questions and answers you might

134
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:36,660
take out of this course.

135
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,890
And of course that means we do
a good deal on emancipation,

136
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,090
the single most revolutionary
a result of the civil war.

137
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,890
And arguably the single most revolutionary
historical moment in American history,

138
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,160
the liberation of 4.2 million slaves to
some kind of freedom and some kind of

139
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:58,500
citizenship at least for a while.

140
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,040
And the third third of the
courses of course reconstruction,

141
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:06,660
that a brief shining moment is do boys,

142
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:11,661
one's called it of about 11 years from
the end of the civil for mathematics to

143
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:16,650
the disputed election of
1860 76 and 77 12 years,

144
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,260
one of the most vexing topsy turvy
turbulent embittered periods of American

145
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:26,910
history that historians still
fight over to say the least.

146
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,990
It is there what we'll try to
understand the consequences

147
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,840
of a civil war.

148
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:39,380
This is a course at the end of the day
about the causes and consequences as well

149
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:44,160
as the course of this event.

150
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,540
Now, um, but today is January 15th.

151
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,020
It is Martin Luther King's birthday.

152
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,610
I want to start with
a very famous passage.

153
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:05,580
It's not usually the
passage you hear from the,

154
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,870
I have a dream speech.

155
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,010
Almost always one of the dream speech
is quoted and now it's quoted in

156
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:12,270
commercials,
right?

157
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:18,450
Numerous times or in an radio spots,

158
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:23,900
background kings voices though it's some
kind of American chorus for what our,

159
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:24,630
when it went,

160
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,230
any moment we need to feel better about
ourselves and about race relations.

161
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,280
We often just skip right over the first
two or three paragraphs of the speech

162
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:37,550
where the central metaphor he sets up
in the speech is what he called the

163
00:11:38,851 --> 00:11:43,590
promissory note
in the Bank of Justice.

164
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:49,830
I am happy to join with you today and
what will go down in history as the

165
00:11:49,831 --> 00:11:53,860
greatest demonstration for freedom
in the history of our nation.

166
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,620
Okay.

167
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,450
And so we have come here,
excuse me,

168
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:03,230
five score years ago and here he is
drawing directly off Lincoln five score

169
00:12:05,521 --> 00:12:06,480
years ago.

170
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,550
A great American in whose symbolic shadow
we stand today signed the emancipation

171
00:12:11,551 --> 00:12:16,230
proclamation. This was of course, August,

172
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,760
1963 uh,
hot,

173
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,480
brutally hot August Day king on
the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

174
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:29,690
This momentous decree came as a great
beacon light of hope to millions of Negro

175
00:12:29,911 --> 00:12:34,911
slaves who had been seared in the
flames of withering injustice.

176
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,250
It came as a joyous daybreak.

177
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,300
He says 10 the long
night of their captivity,

178
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,140
that sentences almost
directly from the Bible,

179
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,030
but 100 years later,
the Negro still is not free.

180
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,010
100 years later,

181
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,140
the life of the Negro is
still sadly crippled by the
manacles of segregation and

182
00:12:58,141 --> 00:13:01,680
the chains of discrimination.
100 years later,

183
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:06,660
the Negro lives on a lonely island of
poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of

184
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:09,960
material prosperity.
100 years later,

185
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:14,550
the Negro is still languished in the
corners of American society and finds

186
00:13:14,551 --> 00:13:17,730
himself an exile in his own land.

187
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:19,440
Yeah,

188
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,440
and so we've come here today to dramatize
a shameful condition in a sense.

189
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:26,970
We've come here,

190
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,080
we've come to our nation's
capital to cash a check.

191
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,850
When the architects of our republic
wrote the magnificent words of the

192
00:13:35,851 --> 00:13:38,430
constitution and the
declaration of independence,

193
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:43,670
they were signing a promissory note to
which every American was to fall heir.

194
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:49,620
This note was a promise that all men,

195
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:55,280
yes black men as well as white men would
be guaranteed the unalienable rights of

196
00:13:56,731 --> 00:13:59,010
life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness.

197
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:05,390
It is obvious today that America has
defaulted on this promissory note insofar

198
00:14:06,451 --> 00:14:08,730
as her citizens of color are concerned,

199
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,670
instead of honoring
this sacred obligation,

200
00:14:11,671 --> 00:14:15,750
America has given the
Negro people a bad check,

201
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,680
a check which has come back
marked insufficient funds,

202
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,570
but we refused to believe that
the bank of justice is bankrupt.

203
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:33,670
We refuse to believe that there are
insufficient funds in the great vaults of

204
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:35,350
opportunity of this nation,

205
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:41,370
and so we've come to cash this check a
check that will give us upon demand the

206
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:47,290
riches of freedom and
the security of justice.

207
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,100
I would be thrilled if you walked

208
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,760
out of this course and we're
able to explain to somebody

209
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:01,100
why king made the promissory note,

210
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,460
the central metaphor of his.

211
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:09,461
I have a dream speech and
you could somehow explain
why it hadn't been cashed by

212
00:15:12,771 --> 00:15:17,090
1963 and could then begin to discuss

213
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,090
whether it's fully cashed yet.

214
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,773
Now

215
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,430
that was just my homage to king.

216
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,773
Now,
um,

217
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,520
I like to do a little ritual at
the beginning of every class.

218
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,130
If you'll forgive me,
it only takes me about 10 seconds.

219
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:45,440
Do you know we live in a world where
all of us in this room take books for

220
00:15:45,441 --> 00:15:49,970
granted? We throw books on the
floor, we throw books at people,

221
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,560
we load them in and out of our backpacks.
We drop him here and drop him there.

222
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:58,880
We lose them, we wrap them
up, we write all over them.

223
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,620
I wrote all over mine.

224
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,380
It's only a few generations ago when
there really weren't having any bookstores

225
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:07,550
to go to.
Your great,

226
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:11,720
great grandparents couldn't meander a
bookstore to speak up unless they lived in

227
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:16,430
a special section of a special city.
Books are precious things.

228
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,680
A lot of them are assigned in this
course. Short ones, little ones, big ones,

229
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:24,860
syntheses novels,
monographs.

230
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:29,870
Think of a book just for a moment
and then you can forget this.

231
00:16:29,871 --> 00:16:33,470
If you want to think of a book,
any book,

232
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,910
it's hard to think of a really bad book
this way, but think of a good book,

233
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:43,010
one of your favorite books
ever as like a newborn child,

234
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,660
a newborn child brought
into the world a book.

235
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:53,770
Probably a lot more planning and thought
and design and construction at least

236
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:01,220
intellectually goes into that
book and it goes into, most babies

237
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,900
books have a cover. They have
beginnings, middles and ends.

238
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:15,460
There's somebodies dream,
there's somebody creation.

239
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,260
They never satisfy just like people,

240
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:26,440
but they're in some ways the greatest
things we have and sometimes it's nice to

241
00:17:26,441 --> 00:17:31,090
remind ourselves of that in the places
where we take the most for granted.

242
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:36,640
I want a quote from for you to you,

243
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:40,030
I'm the oldest history book
in Western civilization,

244
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,330
not just because it's a book,

245
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:48,670
but I think this is a 0.1 can
make about any history course.

246
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,350
It doesn't what the subject is. It can
be social history, political history,

247
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:57,270
intellectual history, any history. It
can be the history of ancient Rome.

248
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,800
It could be post 1945 United States.
It could be any history,

249
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,250
but any history course

250
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,161
ought to do.

251
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:13,161
The two things that Herata named and the
opening sentence of the oldest history

252
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:18,590
book we have.
This is Heraclitus,

253
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,980
the history and a great, when you,
when you're writing the first book,

254
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,170
what are you going to call it?
The history,

255
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:30,020
no subtitles, nothing fancy. Just

256
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:37,990
I Herata test of can narcis m
here setting forth my history.

257
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:46,130
The time may not draw the color from
what man has broadened to being nor those

258
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:52,551
great and wonderful deeds manifested by
both the Greeks and the barbarians fail

259
00:18:54,511 --> 00:18:58,680
of their report and
together we'll all of this,

260
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,970
the reason why they fought one another,

261
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,690
I don't know how closely
you listen to that,

262
00:19:06,691 --> 00:19:08,310
but what does the rotted has just said.

263
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:13,470
He's basically said history is two things.
It's the story,

264
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,790
it's the color,
it's the great deeds.

265
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,850
It's the narrative that
takes you somewhere,

266
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:27,350
but it's also the reason why
it's also the explanation.

267
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:34,070
That's what history does.
It's supposed to do both of those things.

268
00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:38,420
Some of us are more into the analysis
and we're not so fond of story.

269
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,650
Some of us just love stories and
don't care about the analysis.

270
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,230
I'll stop giving me all
that interpretation. Just
telling me the good story.

271
00:19:48,231 --> 00:19:51,860
Again, this is what goes on of course
out in public history all the time.

272
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,880
Just tell us the old stories
or just sing us the old songs.

273
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,340
Make us feel good again.

274
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:03,650
Stop interpreting you historians
and worst of all, stop revising

275
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:06,660
you.

276
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:11,440
You how that word revision has crept into
our political culture on politicians.

277
00:20:11,441 --> 00:20:14,620
Don't like the arguments of
people would disagree with them.

278
00:20:14,621 --> 00:20:16,840
They accused him of being
revisionist historian.

279
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:21,610
It was even a poll tested word for awhile
when Condoleezza Rice was using it.

280
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,500
Revision is revisionist
as though all history isn't revisionist.

281
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,151
Now,

282
00:20:28,151 --> 00:20:32,410
favorite story about revisionism is my
buddy Eric Foner was on a talk show once

283
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,360
by 1992 he was not one of those
shouting talk shows with Lynne Cheney.

284
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,194
Who would that?

285
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:43,060
Dick Cheney's wife who was then head of
the Neh and this was a time you won't

286
00:20:43,061 --> 00:20:43,894
remember this.

287
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,670
We were having this national Brouhaha
over what were called national history

288
00:20:48,671 --> 00:20:50,890
standards and Lynne Cheney of m,

289
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:54,370
a real critic of these national history
standards cause he didn't particularly

290
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:57,100
like some of the ideas that the
historians were coming up with.

291
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,870
It's on his talk show.

292
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,820
It was firing line or you get two people
on this shout at each other for an hour

293
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:08,470
or half hour and the producers love it
and phoner is pretty good at rapid fire

294
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,240
coming back. He's pretty
good at that. Anyway,

295
00:21:10,241 --> 00:21:14,970
they had this sit too and she had kept
accusing him and other historians of

296
00:21:14,971 --> 00:21:17,620
being revisionist.
And Eric says,

297
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:21,620
the next morning he got a phone call
from a reporter at Newsweek and she said,

298
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:26,230
professor phoner, um, when did
all this revisionism begin?

299
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,530
If owner said, probably with
Heraclitus and the Newsweek had,

300
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,180
porter said,
do you have his phone number?

301
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,330
Never underestimate the
ignorance. Hl. Mencken said this,

302
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,780
I did never underestimate the
ignorance of the American people

303
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,780
or if journalist or of

304
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,773
no,

305
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:08,520
as to this question of why the civil
war has a hold on us or a hold on a

306
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,970
historical imagination in this country.
There are many,

307
00:22:10,971 --> 00:22:12,710
many ways to think about that.

308
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,190
I'm going to take you through seven or
eight possible answers to that in just a

309
00:22:16,191 --> 00:22:20,540
moment. Almost like a list, but again,

310
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:23,330
sometimes if you go back
to the oldest explanations,

311
00:22:23,331 --> 00:22:28,331
you find things that we haven't
thought about in facilities.

312
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:33,560
The Peloponnesian war, the first great
modern text in Western civilization.

313
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,390
At any rate about a civil war,
the great Greek civil war,

314
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,370
and through acidities great work,

315
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:45,430
he has this little sentence or he actually
captures a good deal about why civil

316
00:22:48,441 --> 00:22:50,300
wars are such vexing,

317
00:22:50,301 --> 00:22:54,840
difficult problems in nations memories
once they've had them. There's this,

318
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,660
the acidities said quote,

319
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:02,230
the people made their recollections
fit in with their sufferings.

320
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,790
They began to tell a story that
reflected their own suffering.

321
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,680
Now they hear might be white southerners.

322
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:20,500
They suffered,
they lost it,

323
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:22,810
were truly defeated.
Conquered.

324
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,720
That's suffering might
be African Americans.

325
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,640
Emancipation wasn't a day of jubilee.
It was an agonizing, horrible,

326
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,833
terrible,

327
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:37,270
sometimes wonderful set of
experiences into the unknown

328
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,140
and the suffering might
be northern unionist. Yes,

329
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:52,090
about 300,000 Yankees soldiers
died in the civil war and about

330
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,810
650 to 700,000 were wounded

331
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:04,480
people,
made their memories fit their sufferings.

332
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,410
I also like this little passage,

333
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,480
they're just put into your craw
about any history course I bought any

334
00:24:13,571 --> 00:24:14,530
interpretation,

335
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,340
and of course I'm going to have a
point of view at times in this course.

336
00:24:18,341 --> 00:24:21,760
All historians do don't have been listened
to a historian if he or she doesn't

337
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:25,750
have a point of view.
None of us are blank slates.

338
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,240
None of us can just

339
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,920
tell it like it was the op interpreting,
please.

340
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:34,870
Okay?

341
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,000
But I always try to
remember William James,

342
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:40,960
this passage and one of his
pragmatism essays, and I say,

343
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:43,750
I think that should be required
for us citizenship. If you know,

344
00:24:43,751 --> 00:24:46,480
if I ruled the world and you'd have
to read this for us. Citizenship

345
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,790
in it.
James says,

346
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:55,520
the greatest enemy of any one of
my truths is the rest of my truth.

347
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,310
It's as though James is
saying, damn, every time I
think I really know something.

348
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:07,020
That's the truth. Along comes
some other possible truth in it.

349
00:25:07,021 --> 00:25:07,854
Screws it up.

350
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,093
Yeah.

351
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:14,610
Why can't history just be
settled and not far ready?

352
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:19,060
If it was, it wouldn't be any fun. It was,

353
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:23,350
it wouldn't be interesting but was,
it wouldn't be good for business either

354
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:27,723
now.

355
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:30,963
Okay.

356
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,930
Why does the civil war have a whole,

357
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:37,490
why are you here at 280 of you
here for a course on the civil war?

358
00:25:37,491 --> 00:25:39,440
I know it fits 10 30 on Tuesday,

359
00:25:39,441 --> 00:25:43,580
Thursday a hundred other reasons you
want to lecture course lots of possible

360
00:25:43,581 --> 00:25:46,550
answers to all that kind of question,

361
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:51,710
but why does this event
hold people there now?

362
00:25:51,711 --> 00:25:56,711
Approximately 65,000 books that have
been written on the American civil war.

363
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,340
This doesn't even really include
the books on reconstruction

364
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,390
that had been written since Apple
Maddix. Now I realized recently in, uh,

365
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,840
giving a public talk that you can't
always say since happen Maddix and people

366
00:26:11,841 --> 00:26:14,180
know what you mean.
I'm going to assume Yale students do,

367
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:17,880
but that's actually where the surrender
was signed to end of the civil.

368
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,630
I was giving a talk recently and I said
before Appomattox and after Fmx and Emma

369
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,820
said that four or five times,

370
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:26,690
one of the first questions in Q and a
is this woman innocently asked what,

371
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:30,020
what has happened?
Maddix oh dear.

372
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:36,430
Well you see ma'am. Anyway,
since [inaudible] 65,

373
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,251
you know what that is?

374
00:26:37,251 --> 00:26:42,251
That's more than one per day had been
published in this country on this event.

375
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,413
Why?

376
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:54,940
What does Robert Penn Warren mean when
he said the civil war draws us as an

377
00:26:55,670 --> 00:27:00,670
oracle darkly on riddled in poor tentious
of our personal and our national fate?

378
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,420
That's pretty grandiose language.
But what did Warren mean?

379
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,680
What a Gertrude Stein mean when she
said there never will be anything more

380
00:27:14,871 --> 00:27:19,871
interesting then that American
civil war of all people,

381
00:27:19,941 --> 00:27:23,480
Gertrude Stein was hopelessly
interested in this event.

382
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:29,110
Oh, never will be anything more
interesting than that. American civil war.

383
00:27:29,111 --> 00:27:29,944
She said,

384
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:36,520
why are so many people into this?
Why do people want to read about it?

385
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,000
Reenact it, go play it. Go visit it.

386
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:47,340
Is it just heritage tourism?
Is it Josh?

387
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,560
The attraction of military history?

388
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,690
What is it that compels us to
remember the most divisive,

389
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,310
the most bloody, the most tragic
event in our national history?

390
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,263
Okay,

391
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:02,230
and how do we remember it?

392
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:08,950
Have we sometimes cleaned it up with
such pleasing mythology that we've just

393
00:28:11,091 --> 00:28:11,990
made it fun?

394
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:18,140
Why is the confederate flag a problem?
Why doesn't it just go away?

395
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,220
It's the second most ubiquitous
American symbol across the world,

396
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,590
especially since Michael
Jordan quit playing,

397
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,880
other than the u s flag,

398
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:32,960
the confederate flags and most ubiquitous
symbol of the United, maybe Coca Cola.

399
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,910
Okay?
But Coca Cola is an international symbol.

400
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:38,150
Now you can find the confederate
flag everywhere in this world.

401
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,480
I spent a year in Germany and I
traveled a lot in eastern Europe.

402
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:46,050
I saw it all over the place.
I was in Prague,

403
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,080
the Czech Republic in 1993 Jim Mcpherson
is battle cry of freedom book your

404
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,600
assigned largely as background,

405
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:59,700
largest selling book on the American
civil war, published in the last 25 years.

406
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,320
International best seller was 16 weeks
in New York Times bestseller list was

407
00:29:04,321 --> 00:29:06,630
translated into Czech.
I mean,

408
00:29:06,631 --> 00:29:11,631
nobody reads check except the checks
and even them even they tend to read

409
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,860
fiction in German.
Anyone in the bookstore,

410
00:29:15,861 --> 00:29:18,680
they had a big display and Jim
Mcpherson's battle cry of freedom.

411
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,530
The whole bookstore window,
I couldn't believe it,

412
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,520
but how did they display
it with confederate flags?

413
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,630
They missed the point of the
title of the book, but nevermind.

414
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,500
How do you portray the American
symbol wars symbolically? Oh,

415
00:29:37,501 --> 00:29:42,430
it's that confederate flag that will tell
us right away with this is about why.

416
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,580
Why does this confederate
flag just go away

417
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,260
or put it another way?
Why do you love the civil war?

418
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,670
I can't tell you how many thousands of
times in public lectures, et Cetera,

419
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,430
et Cetera, et cetera. In my
end, all civil war historians,

420
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,160
faceless people will come up afterwards.

421
00:30:03,161 --> 00:30:06,550
Usually they want to show you the
grandfather's letters, but they'll say,

422
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,830
I just love the civil war

423
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,730
and you want to just stop
them for a moment and say

424
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,370
you need a shrink or what is it you love?

425
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:25,240
Is it the aftermath it in Tetum?
Is it the trenches of Spotsylvania?

426
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:29,020
Is it the latrines at Andersonville?

427
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:34,270
Is it both killing Lincoln?
What is it you love it?

428
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,640
Is it because we love epics?

429
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:47,530
This is it because a lot of people
really are kind of hard wired.

430
00:30:47,531 --> 00:30:52,360
Maybe we may even be hard
wired biologically for
story. I can't prove that,

431
00:30:52,361 --> 00:30:53,830
but there's a lot of research on this.

432
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:59,250
Are we hard wired for story and therefore
to some degree for epic stories that

433
00:31:00,971 --> 00:31:05,680
have heroes and villains and beginnings
and ends and great collisions,

434
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:11,080
maybe.
Is it because Americans love redemption

435
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:16,600
and people around the world love to
think that about us sometimes too.

436
00:31:16,601 --> 00:31:21,430
Is it because we liked to see or
we've converted this terribly divisive

437
00:31:21,431 --> 00:31:23,890
experience into a great unifier?

438
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,640
Did we go back and look at the civil war,

439
00:31:27,641 --> 00:31:31,030
not only to see the beginnings of our
own modern time and a modern American

440
00:31:31,031 --> 00:31:31,660
nation,

441
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,900
a second American republic born out of
the death of the first and so on and so

442
00:31:34,901 --> 00:31:35,530
forth,

443
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:40,530
but do we actually go back to this most
dividing experience to figure out how

444
00:31:41,721 --> 00:31:42,700
are we became unified?

445
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:48,690
Or as William Dean Howells put it
in 1900 and a lovely line, he said,

446
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,860
what the American people always like is
a tragedy as long as they can give it a

447
00:31:52,861 --> 00:31:53,694
happy ending.

448
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:03,930
Is it because we see the American
civil war or have learned to see it as

449
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:09,370
America's first great racial reckoning?

450
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,960
We're the nation's national sin of slavery
as some like to put it had to finally

451
00:32:16,661 --> 00:32:21,580
be remitted in some way, purged, cleansed,

452
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:26,890
and the language used by both sides in
this war of purgings and cleansings,

453
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:33,330
the war that brought a reckoning
from 250 years of slavery,

454
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:40,050
destroyed a slave society brought the end
of the first American republic and the

455
00:32:41,151 --> 00:32:43,520
revolution of emancipation.

456
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,440
I think there's a lot to argue
that Americans have big gun,

457
00:32:50,441 --> 00:32:55,441
at least they've just begun this to
love the civil war because they love

458
00:32:57,311 --> 00:32:58,144
emancipation.

459
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:02,530
They want to live in the
nation that freed slaves.

460
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,600
My favorite line in George Bush,

461
00:33:04,601 --> 00:33:07,990
the first inaugural address in 1989
and I'm probably the only one that ever

462
00:33:07,991 --> 00:33:11,170
bothered to remember this line.
Maybe the only one who cares,

463
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:15,070
but Peggy Noonan wrote him a sentence.
It's classic inaugural rhetoric.

464
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,510
It comes right and it comes right after
the section and Bush ones inaugural

465
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:23,350
where he's two. He's saying, we must
put the war in Vietnam. Behind us.

466
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,830
It is too definitive and so on.
And there's a line where he says,

467
00:33:26,831 --> 00:33:31,660
we must remember, we are the nation
that sent 600,000 of its sons to die.

468
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,250
Rather than have slavery

469
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:40,000
now,
who wouldn't want to live in that country?

470
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:44,290
That's a great line in an
inaugural address. Of course,

471
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:47,470
it's ignoring the fact that at least
half of those people died to preserve

472
00:33:47,471 --> 00:33:49,190
slavery,
but nevermind.

473
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:01,950
Do we love the civil war because sometimes
there's a lot of guilty pleasure or

474
00:34:03,651 --> 00:34:04,940
not so guilty pleasure

475
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:11,520
and just loving the details of military
history and if you're one of those,

476
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,420
fine. That's great. I had that stage two,

477
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,260
I will confess if you make me,

478
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:26,180
but what is all that nostalgia
about for those battlefield?

479
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:30,973
Yeah,

480
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:35,740
or is it because this experience in
American history is ultimately about loss?

481
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,660
Are we attracted to loss?

482
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:43,240
Is loss more interesting sometimes than
victory and by loss, I mean defeat,

483
00:34:43,241 --> 00:34:46,030
but also loss in terms of human life,

484
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:51,430
treasure proportions of
civilizations that die.

485
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,090
Take loss for just a moment.

486
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:01,430
If you took the 620,000 out of
Americans who died in the civil war,

487
00:35:01,431 --> 00:35:05,480
you moved it ahead to the Vietnam era
and roughly the 12 years in the United

488
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,210
States fought in Vietnam per capita.
Okay.

489
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,620
Approximately 4 million Americans
would have died in Vietnam.

490
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:18,050
That's the scale of death and
loss and the civil war. 4 million

491
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:24,470
Americans will never sustain for a million
casualties in a war. I would argue,

492
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,130
I mean, I can't prove that. I mean,

493
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:32,000
unless Osama bin Ladin is coming
through that window, who knows?

494
00:35:32,001 --> 00:35:35,150
Maybe he will one day.
Would that be cool?

495
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,350
I mean that you wouldn't
slip through that lecture,

496
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,590
but I don't think Americans will
ever sustain that Chi. But 4 million,

497
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:50,890
if you came per capita from the civil
war era population to the era of Vietnam

498
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:56,500
every year at Antietam in rural Maryland
on the anniversary of the battle,

499
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,790
17th of September.

500
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:00,440
Yeah.

501
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,950
They put out a little Illuminati
or the Luminari. Excuse me. Uh,

502
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,620
no, no. Whoa.

503
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,580
That's a slip I luminaria or the little,

504
00:36:11,581 --> 00:36:14,850
the little candle lamps
all over the battlefield.

505
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,310
They put 23,000 of them out,

506
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:22,260
which was the number of casualties in
eight hours at Antietam and when the sun

507
00:36:22,261 --> 00:36:22,861
goes down,

508
00:36:22,861 --> 00:36:27,861
you can look at the battlefield and
get a sense of this kind of powerful,

509
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,220
almost artistic sense of the loss.

510
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:37,260
Every one of those little
candle lights wasn't human life.

511
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,393
Um,

512
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:47,390
related to that is the
American imagination for this
event still stimulated in

513
00:36:48,091 --> 00:36:51,600
part because sometimes
we just like lost causes.

514
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,390
We are attracted to defeat
sometimes more than we are attracted

515
00:36:59,140 --> 00:36:59,973
to victory.

516
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,160
Wasson war is sometimes more interesting.

517
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:08,720
Lost Causes Somehow
represent the rebel spirit,

518
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:13,340
a rebellious spirit,
an insurrectionary spirit.

519
00:37:13,341 --> 00:37:14,960
And in surgeon spirit,

520
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:19,400
some people may be attracted in that way

521
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:25,450
and maybe last but not least in
this list could go on and on.

522
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:27,661
There is,

523
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:32,661
I think an interest in the civil war among
serious readers in particular because

524
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:35,660
it does have somehow house
satisfy that search we offer.

525
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,720
It's an [inaudible] for origins.

526
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:43,360
The origins of the modern nation state,
the origins of big government,

527
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,150
the origins of centralized power,

528
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,080
the origins of what seemed to
be the death of state's rights,

529
00:37:50,081 --> 00:37:51,880
but should surely didn't die,
did it?

530
00:37:51,881 --> 00:37:54,610
We have a states rights supreme
court now in case you didn't notice

531
00:37:56,110 --> 00:38:01,110
the birth of a kind of modernity in
America and many form comes out of this

532
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,940
year. It doesn't just come out
of the battle of Gettysburg,

533
00:38:03,941 --> 00:38:05,650
but it surely comes out of the euro.

534
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,740
There's also this sense in which somehow
in that experience of the civil war in

535
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:17,760
the middle of the 19th century fought
for the existence of an American nation

536
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:23,090
and for the new definition of that nation
and just how free and equal the people

537
00:38:23,191 --> 00:38:24,150
in it would be

538
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:29,030
is where we may somehow see

539
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:35,590
that transformation from a
premodern to a more modern world.

540
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,850
And sometimes I suspect
that's what attracts.

541
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,950
Now the watch is, I only have about
two minutes, so let me leave you here.

542
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,770
I do think sometimes

543
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,230
we're attracted because war
is just so big. Geiling Lee,

544
00:39:01,231 --> 00:39:04,350
fascinating and drew Faust.

545
00:39:04,351 --> 00:39:08,760
I'm wonderful historian whom you now know
as the president of Harvard University

546
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,660
has just published a brand new book.
It's literally just out this week.

547
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,090
I read it in manuscript,
but I have a blurb on the back.

548
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:20,700
It's called the Republic of suffering
and she has much to say in that book,

549
00:39:20,701 --> 00:39:21,900
which I highly recommend

550
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:27,090
about why death is so interesting.

551
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,620
Let me leave you with this Thursday.

552
00:39:31,621 --> 00:39:36,621
I'm going to take up the old south and
begin this comparison of the old south to

553
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:41,751
the growing capitalist that both
sides were highly capitalists,

554
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,010
northern society,

555
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:50,360
but in 1850 or 1840s America
you could find both extremes of,

556
00:39:51,151 --> 00:39:53,460
on the one hand,
a tremendous,

557
00:39:53,461 --> 00:39:56,670
seemingly unfathomable
optimism about America.

558
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:01,700
It seemed to be limitless and boundless
and nobody captured it ever any better

559
00:40:02,161 --> 00:40:02,994
than Walt Whitman,

560
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,200
but you can also find
expressions all over the culture,

561
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:15,120
especially from African Americans and
abolitionist and some slave holders of a

562
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,120
great dread about the
direction of the country.

563
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,880
In Whitman's first line of his drum taps,
his color,

564
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:28,730
his famous collection of civil war poetry

565
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:35,410
comes that phrase which is up here
first though songs for a prelude

566
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:42,480
and that first poem and drum taps is
a Whitman trying to capture just how

567
00:40:42,591 --> 00:40:47,300
exciting war can be. But he'd also
written a poem like democracy,

568
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:54,990
and I'll leave you with this and I'll
start with a response to it on Thursday in

569
00:40:55,331 --> 00:40:58,540
Whitman's democracy as well as
several other Whitman poems,

570
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:03,100
you can find this limitless
sense of optimism.

571
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:07,870
Just listened to his words,
sail,

572
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,551
sail.

573
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:14,290
That best ship of democracy
of value is by freight.

574
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:19,860
Tis not the president only the past
is also stored in the this America,

575
00:41:20,651 --> 00:41:24,730
this thing called America to him
is the whole world's new beginning.

576
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:30,490
Thou holdest not the venture of myself
alone, not the western continent alone.

577
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:35,000
Earth's resume,
entire floats on Die Keel.

578
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:40,570
Oh ship is steadied by an ice spar
with the time voyages in trust,

579
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:49,120
the antecedent nations sink or swim with
the America is everything according to

580
00:41:51,891 --> 00:41:56,420
Whitman, with all their ancient
struggles, martyrs, heroes, epics,

581
00:41:56,421 --> 00:41:59,570
wars,
thou barest the other continents.

582
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:05,500
There's, there's as much as the line,
the destination port triumphant,

583
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:09,890
steer them with good, strong
hand and wary eye. Oh,

584
00:42:09,891 --> 00:42:13,070
helmsmen thou carious great companion.

585
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:18,980
How can I pierce the impenetrable
blank of your future?

586
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,600
I feel I ominous greatness,
evil as well as good.

587
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,730
I watched the advancing, absorbing,
the present, transcending the past.

588
00:42:28,731 --> 00:42:33,731
I see that light lighting and eye
shadow shadowing as if the entire globe,

589
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:41,080
but I do not undertake to define
the hardly can I comprehend the

590
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:49,690
well, that's Whitman saying
as we all do at times,

591
00:42:49,691 --> 00:42:50,920
America is an idea.

592
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,920
This course is the story of what
