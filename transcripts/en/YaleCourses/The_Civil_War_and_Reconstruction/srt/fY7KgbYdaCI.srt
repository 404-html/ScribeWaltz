1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:07,270
Used to be said that in the old wars
fought by the Irish clans that they had an

2
00:00:07,821 --> 00:00:12,620
agreement. I Dunno if this
is true, but I love the idea.

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,990
Doesn't matter how much they slaughtered
themselves with broad swords and knives

4
00:00:17,991 --> 00:00:21,320
and whatever else the maniacs used,

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,320
that they should always spare the poets.

6
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,810
Don't kill the poets because the policy
had to be left to tell the story.

7
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,800
Most great poets don't go to war.
They right.

8
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,060
This week you're reading a great poet.
He all Dr. Rowe,

9
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,070
okay.

10
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,740
A poet and prose,
the poet and fiction.

11
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:52,540
Dr. Rowe is some of you must know is a
famous American writer for his historical

12
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:55,164
fiction.

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,100
Much of his fiction is
often very historical and
you'll find if any one takes

14
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:02,640
the time someday,

15
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,270
that large chunks of the monologue you
hear from William Tecumseh Sherman and

16
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:13,110
this novel is directly
out of his famous memoir.

17
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,810
And then every now and then Dr. Rowe
will embellish or add a few lines.

18
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,190
Most of the people in this book,
we're real people,

19
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,060
but there are some invented in some ways
possibly the most brilliant inventions

20
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:34,431
in this book are the slave characters or
the Friedman character and what doctor

21
00:01:35,151 --> 00:01:40,151
road does with them through this sort
of anguished crucible of all out war

22
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,680
look, especially for those
journeys into Sherman Zone, mine,

23
00:01:48,681 --> 00:01:50,090
Sherman's psyche,

24
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:55,750
those meditations of Sherman's on death
page 88 and 89 to be exact is I think an

25
00:01:58,641 --> 00:02:03,641
unforgettable meditation by Sherman on
the meaning of death and just what it

26
00:02:04,011 --> 00:02:08,690
means and why.
He in some ways enjoys it.

27
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,300
Herman Melville wrote a whole bunch
of poems during the civil war.

28
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:22,070
He was one of the poets spared.
It wasn't very famous yet.

29
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,330
As you know,
for Moby Dick that was to come later.

30
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,040
Maybe our greatest writer,

31
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,250
the 19th century also wrote a
lot of poetry and he wrote all,

32
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:37,520
most all of his poetry
during the civil war.

33
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,140
As did,
by the way Emily Dickinson,

34
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:43,430
I don't know if any of
your Emily Dickinson fans,

35
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,300
but Emily the Belle of
Amherst road between 901,000
poems in her life and fully

36
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:53,300
two thirds of them in the
four years of the war.

37
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,800
She became obsessed with
the idea of the war.

38
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,720
And if you read it closely enough,
it's all over her wartime poetry.

39
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,370
She became obsessed with it.

40
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,233
Death.

41
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,910
Our greatest death poet
was of course Whitman.

42
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,030
More from him later,

43
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,290
but one little uh,

44
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,890
piece by Melville cause it's about you.

45
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:28,960
This was Melville's meditation and poetry
on the death of college students in

46
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:32,220
the war.
It's called on the saline collegians.

47
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,770
It's timeless.
It could be about any war,

48
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,130
although collegians
don't go to war anymore

49
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,520
very much in America,

50
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:48,130
youth is the time when hearts are large
and stirring wars appeal to the spirit

51
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,410
which appeals and turn
to the bladed draws.

52
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:56,740
If woman in sight and duty show though
made the mask of cane or whether it'd be

53
00:03:57,651 --> 00:03:58,910
truth sacred,

54
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,940
because who can aloof remain that shares
youths ardor uncool by the snow of

55
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:11,621
wisdom or sorted gain wool for the homes
of the north and wolf for the seats of

56
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:13,910
the south.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
All who felt life spring and prime and
were swept by the wind of their place in

58
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:20,474
time.

59
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:25,430
I'll lavish hearts on whichever
side of birth or Bain or courage,

60
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,490
high arm them for the stirring wars,

61
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,810
armed them some to die.
Apollo like in pride.

62
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,150
Each slay his python caught
the maxims in his temple,

63
00:04:38,151 --> 00:04:43,151
taught the anguish of maternal
hearts must search for bone divine,

64
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,730
but well the Stripling's bore,
they're faded parts. The heaven.

65
00:04:49,731 --> 00:04:54,680
All parts must assign, never
felt lives, care or cloy.

66
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,100
Each bloomed and died and unabated boy
nor dreamed what death was thought at

67
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:06,500
mears sliding into some vernal sphere.
They knew the joy,

68
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,200
but leap the grief like plants,

69
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:14,201
that flower air comes the leaf which
storms lay low and kindly doom and kill

70
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:18,560
them and the flush of their balloon.

71
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,540
Okay.

72
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,430
The casualties in the union army alone
and the army of the Potomac grants army

73
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:33,170
from the 1st of May
through the end of July,

74
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,040
1864 and this horrible war of attrition
and the stalemate it produced in

75
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:38,874
Virginia.

76
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:44,210
The casualties in that one arm and about
two to two and a half months was 66,000

77
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:49,701
men is the largest loss of life in
the shortest period of time and all of

78
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,470
American military history.

79
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,040
How did it get to that?
Why did

80
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,790
the war go on and on and on?
Well,

81
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,390
let's begin with grants and Lee.

82
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,570
These two great warriors
around whose names,

83
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:14,360
symbols, actions, decisions,

84
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,190
a good deal of the war would hinge
in the past in the final year,

85
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,940
grant from his successes in the West fall
of Vicksburg and fall of Chattanooga,

86
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,920
the victory at Chickamauga came east,

87
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,660
appointed by Abraham Lincoln
as general of the army.

88
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,320
Congress actually revived a special
rank that hadn't used in years called

89
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:46,160
lieutenant general and
then just for grant,

90
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:47,751
he came,

91
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:52,751
Easton was appointed head of all union
armies on any front anywhere in March of

92
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:58,280
1864 winter 64

93
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,870
he was wined and dined at the White
House and wined and dined and congress.

94
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,930
They had to keep telling him
to put on a decent uniform.

95
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:13,410
There's a lot of truth to this idea of
grant that kind of humbled Puglian he had

96
00:07:13,721 --> 00:07:17,950
off. They're all been doing nothing but
work in his brother's leather shop and

97
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:20,080
Galena, Illinois. When the war broke out.

98
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,460
Yeah,

99
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,980
but boy did he have a nose for war.

100
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,473
Okay.

101
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,570
It was a great horseman.

102
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:34,530
Cantor like nobody else and Gallup like
nobody else and he loved his horses.

103
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,790
Been to west point.

104
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,170
The only thing he really got good
grades in a West Point were painting and

105
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:47,220
drawing. He nearly failed some
of the military science courses,

106
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:51,150
some of his biographers of act and made
a big deal out of that that because he

107
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:56,151
hadn't studied hard and a genre
and i's Germany's manuals,

108
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,930
those manuals of combat
tactics and strategy. Okay.

109
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:03,960
That he was there for a freer
to simply invent as he went.

110
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,443
I don't know.

111
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,710
This war made grant at the
same time he made the war.

112
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:11,790
Okay.

113
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,250
He may have been as many
of his bar and by the way,

114
00:08:14,251 --> 00:08:18,300
there's been an industry of grant
biographies in the past 10 to 15 years.

115
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:22,830
He's been rediscovered after a long period
in our history when he just vanished

116
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,510
and the country forgot that the,
oh by the way,

117
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:28,640
the Union won the war and
there was that guy grant.

118
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,690
Okay.

119
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,010
There are far, far, far more
monuments to Robert E. Lee.

120
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:38,810
Yeah.

121
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,510
And the American landscape and
they're already Ulysses grant.

122
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,750
I'll try to explain that.
At the end of the course is cash.

123
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,960
Tony rates in these,

124
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:53,961
this last year of the war were ghastly
and horrible and it nearly led to a

125
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:59,321
sufficient of war weariness across
the north and discussed and just an

126
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:06,171
overwhelmed kind of spirit that it was
entirely possible by July and August of

127
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:10,860
64 if certain events
hadn't quickly followed,

128
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,180
that the north collectively would have
given up the war and sued for peace.

129
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,483
Okay.

130
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,860
But grant developed essentially
a strategy of victory.

131
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:27,600
And here's what it was. He did it in
conjunction with William Tecumseh Sherman,

132
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:32,040
Philip Sheridan, uh, the or the of
the previous general of the army,

133
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:37,260
Henry Halleck and most
importantly with Lincoln himself.

134
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,780
And that strategy was basically this.

135
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,560
And it was just the first
to determine that Richmond,

136
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:47,190
the capitol of the confederacy was not
to be the objective of the war in the

137
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:51,570
east, taken an enemy's
capital, not that important.

138
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,581
Secondly,

139
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:58,581
grant grasped as does Sherman the
political character of this war,

140
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,960
that this was now war to be won or lost
in public opinion because it had become

141
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:11,601
all out because it was now a
war upon people upon resources.

142
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:15,690
It depended deeply upon morale.

143
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:20,250
And the will of either side
to somehow see it through

144
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,360
third grant and Sherman especially
determined that this would now be a war on

145
00:10:27,581 --> 00:10:31,240
southern resources.
The destruction of slavery of course,

146
00:10:31,241 --> 00:10:33,430
becomes a major part of that.

147
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,860
And one of the great ironies of the
wars that Sherman never ever for a day

148
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,450
wanted to free a slave
as he told his officer,

149
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:48,320
ain't gonna be no niggers and
uncle Billy's army, sorry.

150
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:53,150
That's what he said. Uh, he wasn't
in to having black soldiers. In fact,

151
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:56,960
there were no black soldiers who actually
served in Sherman's army in Georgia.

152
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,610
There will be thousands upon thousands
of Friedman following his army and it

153
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:06,611
will force him to a situation of
a recognition that will it or not,

154
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,840
he's crushing the spirit of the south to
destroy slavery and ultimately kind of

155
00:11:14,811 --> 00:11:16,530
admits it.
Look for that in Dr. Rowe

156
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,390
in the east,

157
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:26,260
the object of the war now was to be Lee's
army to fight Lee's army anywhere on

158
00:11:28,251 --> 00:11:28,791
ground,

159
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:33,791
especially that the northern troops
could somehow choose to try to spring Lee

160
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:38,180
out of his trench works that he would
build everywhere they would stop.

161
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:43,100
And to simply kill as many
confederates as possible,

162
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:48,380
to force the south to quit.
It was to be a war on an army,

163
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,200
not for a strategic capital,

164
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,080
strategic and rivers and
so on would be important.

165
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:02,140
The object now was to destroy the fighting
force of the south and it's fighting

166
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:02,974
will

167
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,240
and in the western part of the war and
there were actually five major armies.

168
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:14,340
Now the grant was to try to coordinate
and army under Nathanial banks out in the

169
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,203
far west.

170
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,380
Lincoln wanted to go into Texas with,

171
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,080
they never really got into Texas.

172
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,270
What grant wanted eventually,

173
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,300
excuse me one second.

174
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:46,910
What grant wanted was it the army on
her Nathanial banks in Louisiana to move

175
00:12:46,911 --> 00:12:51,911
east to take mo bill the last remaining
great southern port and then come

176
00:12:52,701 --> 00:12:57,590
smashing right through the deep south
across Alabama and Georgia as Sherman's

177
00:12:57,591 --> 00:12:58,820
army,
as we'll see in a minute,

178
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,860
was invading northern Georgia toward
Atlanta and sort of just invade the whole

179
00:13:04,461 --> 00:13:07,730
middle heartland of the south
until the south would give up.

180
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,060
And in Virginia, grant took
battlefield command. He didn't have to,

181
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,200
he could've stayed at a desk
in Washington, but it was by,

182
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,170
it was quite decidedly not his style.

183
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,160
He went into the field as the
commander of the army of the Potomac.

184
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,680
Now on the other side in Robert E.
Lee,

185
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,870
the south had without a question,

186
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,700
we've said this before and there
is so much been written on this,

187
00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:42,680
you can't count it all. The south had a
great general and Lee, a daring general,

188
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,120
even in spite of his
tremendous defeated Gettysburg,

189
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,840
or actually they did tender his
resignation that Davis didn't accept and

190
00:13:50,841 --> 00:13:54,290
couldn't accept.
Lee was already a legend,

191
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,730
is men saw him as almost godlike.
He was beautiful.

192
00:13:59,731 --> 00:14:02,850
They said he was gorgeous,
he was handsome.

193
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,100
No one ever looked quite likely in a
uniform. Well, that curly white hair.

194
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,180
There's a brand new biography out that
I recently reviewed by a woman named

195
00:14:14,181 --> 00:14:17,480
Elizabeth prior.
It's just one the Abraham Lincoln prize.

196
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,140
There's another lovely irony book
on Lee Warren is the Lincoln Prize.

197
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,790
That's reconciliation.

198
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,860
It's called reading the man.

199
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,320
Okay.

200
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,100
I was like a title of a porn
movie or something, but, sorry,

201
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,520
scratch that Jen.

202
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,630
But she did the book from
Lee's voluminous letters.

203
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,410
He was a tremendous letter
writer throughout his life.

204
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,220
Lifetime officer,
Sun of Light Horse,

205
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:54,770
Harry leave the American revolution fame.

206
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,940
His father had been a total scoundrel.

207
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,300
He had a brother that was
an even greater scoundrel.

208
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:08,130
His brother and probably
his father fathered children
by slave women and abandon

209
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:13,660
their homes, their wives, their
families. He came from a very,

210
00:15:13,661 --> 00:15:18,661
very difficult sorted but aristocratic
famous Virginia family and he went to

211
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:21,560
West Point just like his daddy

212
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,810
and he became an officer in his early
twenties he spent his twenties his

213
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,900
thirties in his forties spread
all over the United States,

214
00:15:30,901 --> 00:15:33,930
largely as an engineer.
He was a great engineer.

215
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,650
He helped build the first
bridge across the Mississippi.

216
00:15:37,651 --> 00:15:41,460
He helped redirect rivers in the
lower Mississippi and on and on.

217
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:47,460
He spent probably two thirds of his life
up until the civil war, away from home,

218
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,740
away from that mansion that sits
today and Arlington Cemetery.

219
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,470
Arlington house was Lee's home.

220
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,400
He inherited it by marrying into it.

221
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,780
He married a Custus. He married into
the family of George Washington,

222
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:09,450
extended family of George Washington,
and of course it is Lee's own home,

223
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:15,080
Arlington that before the war and ended
the United States government confiscated

224
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:20,070
Lee's wife to say the least,
never got over this.

225
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,820
They confiscated Lee's home and converted
it into the largest national cemetery

226
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,900
and the country.
Did you ever go to Arlington,

227
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,910
go to Arlington House,

228
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:38,730
or at least remember that that was founded
to bury the thousands and thousands

229
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,310
of union dead killed by Lee's army.

230
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:46,350
At any rate,
he may have hated war in the abstract,

231
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:51,830
but his biographers have taken us into
least psyche and some useful ways.

232
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,990
I won't say all of these many biographies,

233
00:16:54,991 --> 00:16:59,340
but some of them have really shown us
a complicated man of great daring and

234
00:16:59,341 --> 00:17:03,640
audacity and aggressiveness.
He always wanted to be on the off fences.

235
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,610
He hated being entrenched.

236
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:10,910
He hated being on the defensive and
he clearly saw war as an emotional or

237
00:17:12,811 --> 00:17:17,260
psychological release.
Okay. I think a little led,

238
00:17:17,261 --> 00:17:19,830
properly taken is good for a man.

239
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,710
He said that was in the Mexican war.

240
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,230
Then say that during the civil war,

241
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:30,290
surveying the fetal of slaughter at
Fredericksburg and December is 62,

242
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,120
he said famously,

243
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:37,540
it is well that wars so terrible so
that we did not grow too fond of it.

244
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:45,340
He appeared to um, to,
to change in battle. Uh,

245
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:48,130
his eyes would be like fire people said,

246
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:52,130
and English journalist observer
in the Battle of the wilderness.

247
00:17:52,131 --> 00:17:57,131
So horrible battle fought and
dense woods observe this of Lee.

248
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:03,250
No Man who at the terrible moments saw
his flashing eyes and sternly set lips is

249
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:08,130
ever likely to forget them. The light
of battles still flaming in his eye.

250
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,620
And there are lots of
people who said that about

251
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,240
the debate about Lee's
essentially among his story,

252
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:20,460
his Elise is essentially whether he
bled the south to death, so to speak,

253
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:25,461
with his aggressiveness is two major
invasions of the north and the costs that

254
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:30,561
meant to the confederacy or whether he
was the true military genius of American

255
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:35,400
history and only through that offensive
daring that the confederacy survive as

256
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:40,401
long as it did or only through his
devotion and his maneuverability of huge

257
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:46,410
numbers of men across
difficult landscapes.

258
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:51,411
Did the confederacy survive as long as
it did through 1864 and his struggle

259
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:52,860
against grants army,

260
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:57,861
which are numbered him at times
two to one in 1864 in 1865

261
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,010
but he hated being on the defensive.

262
00:19:02,011 --> 00:19:07,011
Now in 1864 I will strike that
man a blow in the morning.

263
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,640
I will strike that man a blow in the
morning. He would say sometimes yes,

264
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,210
that night in his camp,
even if he wasn't planning to do it.

265
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,943
Now

266
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:24,020
the campaign of 1864 the
pivotal in so many ways,

267
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:28,890
decisive, despite the fact that
it becomes a horrible stalemate.

268
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:35,300
The decisive campaign of the civil
war in everyone's hopes in the north.

269
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:38,250
The campaign, once again,
that would only be one summer,

270
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:44,180
was launched in April and May of 64
but it wasn't going to end that summer.

271
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,320
It would end in a horrible stalemate
in a siege of the city of Petersburg,

272
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,130
uh,
just south of Richmond.

273
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:59,050
And the war of course would not end until
the following spring for April's into

274
00:19:59,051 --> 00:20:03,300
the war. But here's roughly
what happened. And by the way,

275
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:07,170
I refer you here to the Ken Burns film
series and there's of course a very good

276
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:08,850
reason it burns,

277
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:13,851
decided in this nine part film series
to give to whole parts to the year 1864.

278
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,110
I have my own little
criticisms of that film series,

279
00:20:19,111 --> 00:20:21,240
which I'll be happy to share
with you at some point,

280
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,470
but I thought it was actually
quite brilliant the way
he just makes you agonize

281
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:29,160
to get out of 1864.
I mean God,

282
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:33,870
how long must 1864 less because that's
actually the way the country feel

283
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,320
in the battle of the wilderness.
May Five,

284
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:44,321
six 1864 the two armies
basically collided just west of,

285
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,490
of uh,

286
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:51,490
Fredericksburg in a densely densely
wooded area that was known at that time as

287
00:20:52,691 --> 00:20:53,560
the wilderness.

288
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:58,420
They essentially just bumped into one
another cause there were only two roads

289
00:20:58,421 --> 00:21:01,090
and went north,
south or east or west through this area.

290
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:05,230
And they fought it out
and woods for two days.

291
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,950
It was a totally disorganized battle.

292
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:14,560
Often men would only fire at what they
saw other weapons firing cause they could

293
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:18,190
really never see their enemies and
hence sometimes killed her own men.

294
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,000
And the most horrible thing
about the wilderness, of course,

295
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,440
as you perhaps have heard,

296
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:29,120
is that hundreds if not thousands of
wounded and ended up being burned to death

297
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:33,530
in the woods because the woods caught on
fire in several places and the wounded

298
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,910
could not be retrieved.

299
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,530
Soldiers on both sides lay down at night,

300
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:44,660
make shift trench, works along roadways
and listened to their comrades,

301
00:21:44,661 --> 00:21:48,680
scream as they were burning to death.
In the woods and could not save them.

302
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,440
Yeah.

303
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,560
In two days of,
uh,

304
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:56,610
of a really thoroughly disorganize
slug fest in woods grants,

305
00:21:57,581 --> 00:22:01,360
Army lost 18,400 casualties,
dead and wounded.

306
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:08,030
Lee lost about 11,000 dead and wounded
and it appeared that Lee had once again

307
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:15,830
for what the fourth time now stopped a
union army invading into Virginia and at

308
00:22:17,731 --> 00:22:21,690
that union army would probably have to
retreat back out of this densely wooded

309
00:22:21,691 --> 00:22:24,720
wilderness.
Get up north of the Rappahannock,

310
00:22:24,721 --> 00:22:26,820
regroup again again,

311
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:31,710
again as the army of the
Potomac always had. Yeah.

312
00:22:31,711 --> 00:22:35,250
What happened was of course,
grant never intended to stop.

313
00:22:35,251 --> 00:22:38,910
No matter what happened.
He had the obvious advantage of manpower.

314
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,430
He had tremendous resources behind him.

315
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,780
Although that manpower was risky
because of that very summer,

316
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,650
the three year lists, they weren't up by
May, but they're going to be up in June,

317
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:53,700
the three year enlistments from 61 to 64,

318
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,400
the great mass of the army of the Potomac.

319
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:59,580
I've been in those who
had survived the veterans,

320
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:04,860
the real soldiers I've been in for three
years, and their terms would be up.

321
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:10,140
How in the hell to get these men to re
enlist. When they were in during this

322
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,800
and the government came up
with three and $400 bounties,

323
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:16,840
they came up with 30 day furloughs,

324
00:23:16,841 --> 00:23:21,670
hearing their percentages of regimen sent
home to do anything to get these guys

325
00:23:21,671 --> 00:23:26,200
to reenlist and Lincoln call
for 500,000 more volunteers.

326
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,370
I half a million.

327
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,930
Now they will actually eventually
get almost that half million men,

328
00:23:31,931 --> 00:23:33,880
but the problem as the union army,

329
00:23:33,881 --> 00:23:37,990
he's realized that summer is that these
new soldiers broadened by being paid

330
00:23:37,991 --> 00:23:42,991
bounties and all sorts of other things
were terrible soldiers and grant counted

331
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,980
by July and August.

332
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,670
These new recruits that about three of
every four became deserters the first

333
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:54,200
time they face combat.
So that manpower was not a certain thing.

334
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,940
The grant just kept moving
and there's the famous story.

335
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,610
It's the night of the second day.

336
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:05,650
It's the fifth or 6th of May 64 and you,

337
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:09,560
most of the Union army is camped along
a roadway, a north south roadway.

338
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:13,310
They've just fought the two worst
days of the wharf. They've survived,

339
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,080
they're depleted.
Woods are burning.

340
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,410
They expect any moment to
all have to retreat north.

341
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:26,150
And there came grant with just a few
members of his staff cantering down the

342
00:24:26,151 --> 00:24:27,410
road heading south.

343
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,180
He didn't stopped to say anything
to anybody in him tip his hat,

344
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,370
probably spit from his cigar.

345
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:40,340
And as they saw him moving south, they
began to realize they weren't retreating.

346
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,630
And for about a mile and
a half along this roadway,

347
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:50,290
these scarred soldiers started to get
up and scream and holler at the top of

348
00:24:50,511 --> 00:24:53,750
their loan for grants for granted.

349
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:59,650
They were going south and they did the
rest of this terrible campaign would be

350
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:06,791
an attempt by grant now to outmaneuver
Lee to try to keep moving left grants

351
00:25:09,621 --> 00:25:14,621
left to try to get around Lee's army
to move faster than Lee if possible.

352
00:25:15,861 --> 00:25:20,861
And ultimately to cut off lease supply
line either to Richmond or further south

353
00:25:22,281 --> 00:25:26,000
from Richmond and if possible,
forget about taken Richmond,

354
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,230
but to try to cut off Lee's
army from the rest of the south

355
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,350
and if possible with Sheridan's army in
the Shenandoah valley cut him off from

356
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:37,184
the West.

357
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,390
So when grant gets accused of
being a butcher that summer,

358
00:25:42,391 --> 00:25:44,400
there's some truth to that,

359
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:49,080
but it really was a war of
maneuver, maneuver, maneuver.

360
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,440
They collided.
They actually,

361
00:25:52,441 --> 00:25:56,490
the first attempt was to see who could
get first to this crossroads called

362
00:25:56,491 --> 00:25:59,940
Spotsylvania courthouse
and it Spotsylvania.

363
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,680
They fought for about six,
seven consecutive days.

364
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:10,080
This was the rehearsal for World War One.
Everywhere the army stopped,

365
00:26:10,081 --> 00:26:14,730
they dug the deepest possible trenches
they could and it's possible date veiny

366
00:26:14,731 --> 00:26:15,211
indeed.

367
00:26:15,211 --> 00:26:20,211
Lee's army got there just before grants
army and they built this incredible

368
00:26:20,431 --> 00:26:22,860
trench work that was in new u shape.

369
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,340
And for about six days,

370
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:30,930
grant's army just made one frontal
assault on this after another.

371
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,370
And it produced these horrifying scenes
of the dead and wounded three and four

372
00:26:35,371 --> 00:26:38,910
deep in these trenches,
day after day after day.

373
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,400
Most of it fought in rainstorms

374
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,410
at Spotsylvania when you add it all up,

375
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:48,880
okay?

376
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,150
Uh,

377
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:52,450
they first encountered each other and
the 8th of May and it didn't really stop

378
00:26:52,451 --> 00:26:54,430
fighting there though
about the 19th of May,

379
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,790
grant's army lost almost
30,000 casualties.

380
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:06,140
Lee's army,
almost 20,000 casualties.

381
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:13,300
And yet grant just kept moving
and kept moving left and south,

382
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,450
left in south,

383
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:23,350
and then grant the first week of June
would make his greatest mistake of the

384
00:27:23,361 --> 00:27:23,721
war.

385
00:27:23,721 --> 00:27:28,040
And he admitted it is the only place in
his great to volume memoir when he used

386
00:27:28,041 --> 00:27:32,180
the word regret and he
really regretted cold harbor

387
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:38,450
at cold harbor.
Grand had misinformation.

388
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:43,820
He somehow did not understand how much
of Lee's army had actually concentrated

389
00:27:43,821 --> 00:27:47,960
in front of him. And somehow
he missed, saw the landscape.

390
00:27:47,961 --> 00:27:52,961
He didn't realize that Lee's army on
each flank had a river and those rivers

391
00:27:53,031 --> 00:27:57,950
were pretty high. It was, you know, may
June. And there was no way to flank him.

392
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:03,650
So he just made on the 3rd of June,
uh,

393
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,590
the largest frontal
assault tack of the war,

394
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,310
there were 50,000 union
troops engaged in this

395
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:17,380
and grants army took 7,000
casualties in a half hour.

396
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:19,570
Yeah.

397
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:24,490
And many of them in, and they'd been
fighting not day after day after day.

398
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:29,680
And God only knows what fatalist
soldiers become in that circumstance.

399
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,660
They were asked before the attack had
cold Harvard dependent pin their names and

400
00:28:34,661 --> 00:28:38,560
home addresses on their shirts.
At least much of the Union army was,

401
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,091
and they did.

402
00:28:40,091 --> 00:28:45,091
They had no dog tags and in that war
they were told to pin their names on

403
00:28:45,431 --> 00:28:47,980
themselves so they can
be identified when dead.

404
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,220
And I believe Burns uses
this story in the film.

405
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:55,510
It was one union soldier who
etched into his diary morning,

406
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:59,020
June 3rd I died today at cold harbor

407
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,013
and he did

408
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,470
this stopped grants movement.

409
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,190
It protected Richmond.

410
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:18,570
It meant that the war would now go on
and on through that summer rather than

411
00:29:21,401 --> 00:29:24,100
attempting anymore
assault on Lee's forces,

412
00:29:24,101 --> 00:29:27,280
which we're now constantly digging
trenches, digging trenches,

413
00:29:27,281 --> 00:29:32,281
digging trenches all around the eastern
side of Richmond grand kept moving south

414
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:37,860
and this time he got to Petersburg
faster than Lee or at least most of Lee's

415
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:42,480
army.
And by

416
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:47,370
mid to late June they put
the city of Petersburg,

417
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:52,371
just some 25 miles south of Richmond
under siege and Petersburg would be going,

418
00:29:53,671 --> 00:29:57,270
you can see many of these great
photographs and burns. His film series.

419
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,200
Photographers went crazy in 64 and 65
photographing these giant trench works,

420
00:30:04,561 --> 00:30:07,290
these trench cities that
were built around Petersburg.

421
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,120
There would be a quick attempt to break
the siege of Petersburg and was known as

422
00:30:15,331 --> 00:30:16,590
the battle of the crater.

423
00:30:16,591 --> 00:30:21,591
Quick in the sense about a month after
grants army concentrated all around the

424
00:30:21,931 --> 00:30:24,120
east side on the south side of Petersburg.

425
00:30:24,121 --> 00:30:28,680
They were always trying to cut Lee's
supply lines off either west or south.

426
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:34,050
Never managed to completely
do it until the next spring.

427
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:38,220
But you may know the story
of the battle of the crater.

428
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:44,810
Some coal miners in the 48th Pennsylvania
went to their colonel who went to his

429
00:30:45,241 --> 00:30:49,800
general. I went to general Burnside
who went to grant and said,

430
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:55,190
we can dig a tunnel 500 yards under the
confederate line and we'll fill it with

431
00:30:55,531 --> 00:30:58,530
tons of dynamite and we can
do it with ventilation stats.

432
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:02,220
We know how to do these things and
I will blow the confederate line to

433
00:31:02,221 --> 00:31:07,140
Smithereens. Let us do it. And at first
grant and his staff said, no, no, no, no.

434
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,230
This is too crazy.
They sat down with them,

435
00:31:10,231 --> 00:31:12,390
they convinced and they
could do it and they did it

436
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,770
500 yards of a tunnel.

437
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,310
They ventilated the confederates and the
other side and the lines in some areas

438
00:31:21,311 --> 00:31:24,480
here, we're never more than
150 to 200 yards apart.

439
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:25,880
Okay?

440
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,910
Nah, they actually did hear
some digging were told later,

441
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,260
but they didn't know what the hell it was

442
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:32,953
and

443
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:37,090
then they dug a countertrend
at the end inside or a tunnel.

444
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,120
They put in four tons of dynamite

445
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:46,640
fuses you to this day can see the opening
to that tunnel and you can still see

446
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:49,740
the suppression in the
landscape where the crater was.

447
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:54,330
And then July 30th,
1864 they blew it up

448
00:31:56,050 --> 00:32:00,610
and they blew up an area of the
confederate line about 200 yards long,

449
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,210
men's bodies were simply
exploded into the air.

450
00:32:04,211 --> 00:32:06,430
It's the opening scene of cold mountain.

451
00:32:06,431 --> 00:32:11,270
If you've seen the movie not bad.
One of the best parts of that movie,

452
00:32:11,271 --> 00:32:15,740
actually
I thought Nicole Kidman was badly cast.

453
00:32:15,741 --> 00:32:19,610
I don't know about you.
When you're suffering,

454
00:32:19,611 --> 00:32:22,400
you haven't got enough to eat
and you're laying in the snow.

455
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:26,750
You can't look like Nicole
Kidman. I'm sorry, any right.

456
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:32,510
But the problem was the battle of
crater became a union disaster.

457
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:38,800
Instead of exploiting this is they should
have and been far, far more organized.

458
00:32:38,801 --> 00:32:41,300
They should have managed to get
around this crater. Actually,

459
00:32:41,301 --> 00:32:45,530
they didn't even understand how big this
gigantic hole in the ground would be.

460
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:51,320
A huge hole in the confederate line has
been exploded hundreds of yards wide,

461
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:56,360
but union troops started marching
into the whole, I'm not kidding,

462
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:02,680
and within an hour or two as
confederates regrouped and sheer shock,

463
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:08,550
they said it was just like picking off
fish in a bowl and they stood all around

464
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:11,220
this giant hole in the ground and forth.

465
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:16,420
4,000 Union troops will killed
in the battle of the crater,

466
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,000
which it turned out to
be a union disaster.

467
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:22,783
Now

468
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,330
out west,

469
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,450
where's Sherman?
There he is.

470
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,000
Can we see this

471
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:00,933
now?

472
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,960
The other major campaign of the war that
of course will ultimately lead to union

473
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:08,834
victory.

474
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:13,520
And I won't get as quite to the dead
end of the war today by any means,

475
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:18,980
but it is of course, William Sherman's
Atlanta campaign through northern Georgia,

476
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:25,030
fall of Atlanta by September of 64 the
campaign lasted all that summer at the

477
00:34:26,211 --> 00:34:26,961
same time.

478
00:34:26,961 --> 00:34:31,961
The stalemate sets in in Virginia around
Petersburg where these thousands of

479
00:34:34,101 --> 00:34:37,400
casualties and you must, you
must try, if you can imagine,

480
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:43,690
northerners standing and post offices
and telegraph offices all over the towns

481
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:49,630
of the Midwest and New England waiting
for casualty report and the adjutants of

482
00:34:50,961 --> 00:34:53,210
regiments writing the list,

483
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:58,190
standing in a small town post office
and the Telegraph comes through with the

484
00:34:58,191 --> 00:35:01,670
list of the dead dozen,
two dozen,

485
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:05,600
three dozen men from a town
that only had a thousand people.

486
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,950
It was beginning to
destroy northern morale

487
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,020
and things weren't that much
better and Virgin Georgia.

488
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,860
So it seems throughout that summer.

489
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,070
Sherman,

490
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:24,160
finally outmaneuvered General
Joseph Johnston's confederate
army toward Atlanta,

491
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,980
one at Kennesaw mountain in
two days in June in June,

492
00:35:30,981 --> 00:35:35,981
late June of [inaudible] 64
and essentially put Atlanta
on under siege in July

493
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:41,220
and August and kept trying
to get around around, around,

494
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:46,221
especially to the left to the east and
south Atlanta to cut off the supply lines

495
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,470
to this biggest city in
the heartland of the south.

496
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:54,230
He finally succeeded at great costs

497
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:01,120
once when Atlanta fell on the 4th of
September in 64 and the fall of Atlanta is

498
00:36:04,131 --> 00:36:08,240
in some ways both strategically
and in terms of morale,

499
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,590
one of the most important little turning
points of the war because it has a huge

500
00:36:12,591 --> 00:36:17,591
impact on the political situation and
the election of 64 about to occur.

501
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:23,120
More on that in a second.
It was then that Sherman,

502
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:26,510
based on this strategy of conquest,

503
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:29,600
destruction of resources
and war upon people

504
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:36,310
made the decision really quite quickly
to launch his march to the sea.

505
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,700
It took him a couple of
months to organize it,

506
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:45,770
but from November 15th to Christmas Eve,
that's about five weeks.

507
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,400
Sherman's Army March 285 miles from
Atlanta to Savannah with 62,000 troops.

508
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:59,210
They were almost unopposed
general John B hoods,

509
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:05,350
confederate army that had surrendered
in effect given up Atlanta had retreated

510
00:37:06,681 --> 00:37:11,681
south to fight again and hoods idea would
actually without Jefferson Davis was

511
00:37:11,871 --> 00:37:15,950
approval while the Sherman was going to
invade toward the east toward the sea

512
00:37:15,951 --> 00:37:17,960
and destroyed Georgia Hood.

513
00:37:17,961 --> 00:37:21,560
Took an army of about 30,000 men
and invaded backup into Tennessee,

514
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,820
hoping the chairman would stop
and come after him. Chairman said,

515
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,660
let him go.

516
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,493
Yeah.

517
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,360
It was a kind of a game now of time,
resources,

518
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,810
destruction,
who would give up?

519
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,960
We are not fighting a hostile army
anymore. Sherman said, I'm quoting him,

520
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,850
were fighting on hostile people

521
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:52,370
is aim and objective now with the civilian
population and Americans had never

522
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:56,170
made war on civilians quite
like Sherman would in Georgia.

523
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:01,510
We cannot change the hearts of those
people. Sherman wrote of the south,

524
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:06,750
but we can make wars so terrible
and make them so sick of war.

525
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:11,590
The generations will pass before
they will ever again appeal to it.

526
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,463
Okay.

527
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,920
Up in the Shenandoah valley.

528
00:38:15,921 --> 00:38:20,921
Philip Sheridan's Union army under
similar orders to make war on society,

529
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:27,110
gave a simple order to his officers
and most of that arm, it was cavalry.

530
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:32,720
His order was put in the
starkest of total war terms.

531
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,760
He said, quote leaves them
only eyes with which to weep.

532
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,580
This was now savage war

533
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:47,770
to win the war with fear was Sherman's
goal to win it with destruction and to

534
00:38:48,711 --> 00:38:49,730
win it with maneuver.

535
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,180
Freed slaves swarmed to behind
Sherman's army. He hated it.

536
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,370
He didn't want him to be there.
He didn't know what to do with them.

537
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,380
The hell am I gonna do with these people.

538
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:05,381
First it was five thousand ten thousand
fifteen he had 25 to 30,000 refugees,

539
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:10,450
slaves tailing right behind his army. It's
about half the size of his whole army.

540
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,100
Follow that in.
Dr. Rowe

541
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,790
Sherman didn't always a play kindness,
her niceness with him.

542
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,180
Okay.

543
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:19,841
At one point,

544
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:24,040
his troops lifted up the pontoon bridge
across a river and scores of Friedman

545
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:26,200
trying to get across with
them drowned in the river.

546
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,210
Sherman's attitude was,

547
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,753
it's where it goes.

548
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:38,550
They made it by Christmas Eve
to Savannah just before that,

549
00:39:38,551 --> 00:39:39,540
into Liberty County,

550
00:39:39,541 --> 00:39:44,280
just south of Savannah and till
this day in Liberty County, Georgia.

551
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:45,570
Okay.

552
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:46,920
There are plenty of people around.

553
00:39:46,921 --> 00:39:50,310
I have a former student who lives there
and runs a historic site who will tell

554
00:39:50,311 --> 00:39:54,630
you this is where Sherman turned left.
Okay.

555
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:59,130
And you think, well, okay, I'm gonna
spend a left turn sign or something.

556
00:39:59,131 --> 00:40:00,300
This is where Sherman turn left.

557
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:04,220
I also never forget the time I
was doing research and the colon,

558
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:08,700
the Caroliniana collections
and the Columbia South
Carolina and I don't remember

559
00:40:08,701 --> 00:40:12,570
exactly what I asked for and the Arco.
It's been a good week there.

560
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:18,060
I don't remember. Oh, I, it was records
about the state capitol and the buildings.

561
00:40:18,061 --> 00:40:21,360
I want her to know about the ruins and
destruction and I asked for this stuff.

562
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,570
An archivist who was a woman looked
up from the desk admin. She said,

563
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,880
don't have it.
Sherman burnt it.

564
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,440
Okay,
thank you very much.

565
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,120
I won't be able to look
at that stuff apparently.

566
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,280
Now,
if you follow the purple line here,

567
00:40:40,281 --> 00:40:44,110
of course you realize
that this is the destined,

568
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,310
is the route of Sherman's.

569
00:40:46,311 --> 00:40:49,670
This is about 280 miles
from Atlanta to the sea.

570
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,060
Okay?

571
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:54,720
It would give us some of the best songs
of the war marching through Georgia.

572
00:40:56,290 --> 00:41:00,100
It also gave the civil war.
It's anti antihero.

573
00:41:00,101 --> 00:41:03,490
It's principal villain of union victory.

574
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,700
Some say the architect of total war.
Oh,

575
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:10,150
that's a little too much for
a short delay only on Sherman,

576
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,920
but it was now a war of
conquest and destruction.

577
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:19,390
He did not destroy Savannah,
but when he got to Charleston,

578
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:23,003
well actually

579
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,990
much of Charleston,

580
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:29,100
he didn't have to destroy because it
was being destroyed already by union

581
00:41:29,101 --> 00:41:32,340
gunboats and artillery
from around the harbor.

582
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,920
But the city he did destroy was Columbia.

583
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,320
The capital of South Carolina,

584
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:44,360
which was burned to the ground
as by the way, was Atlanta. Now,

585
00:41:44,361 --> 00:41:47,510
Sherman would always say these were
just fires that broke out because of

586
00:41:47,511 --> 00:41:51,680
extensive shelling.
That was not the case in Columbia.

587
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,210
They burned about everything
that was standing in Colombia.

588
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:01,970
And then they kept moving north north,
North into North Carolina.

589
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,420
And I'll come back to that later.
Cause the final,

590
00:42:05,421 --> 00:42:08,930
final surrender of the civil war
of course came in North Carolina.

591
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,780
Not In Virginia.

592
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:18,923
No.

593
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:27,580
Before we get to app a Maddix,
I'm gonna save the CG Petersburg,

594
00:42:27,581 --> 00:42:32,581
the lifting of Peter's at the siege
and the march two apoe Maddix and the

595
00:42:32,671 --> 00:42:34,380
surrender for Thursday.

596
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:39,420
Cause it makes a perfect segue back into
wartime reconstruction plans because

597
00:42:39,421 --> 00:42:44,310
that, the nature of that surrender at
Appomattox is a great deal to do with,

598
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:45,790
uh,

599
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:50,790
the kind of reconstruction ideas and
plans that were boiling as early as 1863

600
00:42:53,431 --> 00:42:56,490
really out of congress
and from Lincoln himself.

601
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:59,790
And let me just end with this little story

602
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,140
I mentioned that Terman, you
know, made it to the theater.

603
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:07,440
Havana march part of his
troops up to Charleston,

604
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:11,850
took Charleston seed bed of
succession and all of that. Uh,

605
00:43:11,851 --> 00:43:16,851
although actually Charleston didn't fully
fall to union hands until February of

606
00:43:20,071 --> 00:43:20,904
65.

607
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:26,310
It had been bombarded throughout the
last eight to nine months, as I said,

608
00:43:26,311 --> 00:43:29,700
from union ships and guns
all around the harbor.

609
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:34,320
And if you've ever been to Charleston,
that glorious, beautiful colonial city,

610
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:36,690
that Caribbean city as it looks,

611
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:41,370
all those mentions about 15 to
20 blocks up from the harbor,

612
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:46,970
you must imagine it almost completely
in ruined by early 1865 all the white

613
00:43:47,851 --> 00:43:52,851
people evacuated and abandoned the city
and the only people left principally

614
00:43:54,661 --> 00:43:58,380
were slaves, Freedman, thousands of them.

615
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,930
And they in effect took over the city.

616
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:06,890
The First Union regiment that marched up
meeting street in Charleston was a 21st

617
00:44:07,231 --> 00:44:12,231
USC tea colored infantry of black regimen
and they accepted the surrender of the

618
00:44:12,571 --> 00:44:17,460
city from its mayor.
And then they began to hold ceremonies.

619
00:44:17,461 --> 00:44:21,390
The black folks or Charleston,
the beginning hold ceremonies
all around the city.

620
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:26,610
They held a parade, um, in late March,

621
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:31,670
or was it early April of 65 they had this
huge parade where they had two floats

622
00:44:33,121 --> 00:44:34,320
and they had him on one float.

623
00:44:34,321 --> 00:44:38,910
They had a little slave auction occurring
emoc slave auction with a woman with

624
00:44:38,911 --> 00:44:40,260
her baby being sold away.

625
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,800
And on the next float they had a
coffin labeled slavery and it said Fort

626
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,800
Sumpter, Doug, it's
grave. April 12th, 1861.

627
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,290
And then they play on one more
ceremony. And, and by the way, the war,

628
00:44:56,291 --> 00:45:00,730
when it finally finally, finally ended,
they held an extraordinary ceremony,

629
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,900
a ceremony on Fort Sumpter.
Um,

630
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:09,370
they crammed about 3000 people
onto the little island. Uh,

631
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:14,530
all kinds of dignitaries
came. Now, general Anderson,

632
00:45:14,531 --> 00:45:17,200
not the colonel who had surrendered
the Ford four years ago,

633
00:45:17,201 --> 00:45:20,710
came and raise the u s flag four years,

634
00:45:20,711 --> 00:45:23,170
almost to the day he had taken it down.

635
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:26,110
William Lloyd garrison
was there from the north,

636
00:45:26,111 --> 00:45:31,111
the great abolitionists who
wept uncontrollably when
he heard us a small black

637
00:45:31,181 --> 00:45:33,640
children's choir sing John Brown's body.

638
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,730
And the very negative of that ceremony,
which was the 14th of April,

639
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:45,190
they held a banquet of a sword in a
building that had a roof on it back in

640
00:45:45,191 --> 00:45:47,830
Charleston. And that was
the very night, of course,

641
00:45:47,831 --> 00:45:51,220
that Lincoln was assassinated
at Ford's theater in Washington.

642
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:55,390
But the black folks of Charleston
had planned one more ceremony.

643
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:57,610
Yeah,

644
00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:01,330
that's ceremony was a burial ceremony.

645
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,590
It turns out that during
the last months of the war,

646
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,690
the confederate army turn the
planters horse track a race course.

647
00:46:10,691 --> 00:46:15,580
It was called the Washington race
course into an open air cemetery,

648
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:16,900
uh, excuse me, prison.

649
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:23,250
And in that open air prison in the
Infield of the horse track about 260 odd

650
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:29,300
union soldiers that died of disease
and exposure and they were buried in

651
00:46:29,711 --> 00:46:34,390
unmarked graves in a mass grave site out
behind the grand Stan of the race track.

652
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:35,891
And by the way,

653
00:46:35,891 --> 00:46:40,770
there was no more important and symbolic
site and low country planters slave

654
00:46:40,771 --> 00:46:42,760
holding life than their race track.

655
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:44,780
Okay.

656
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:47,990
All the black folks with Charleston got
organized. They knew about all of this.

657
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:52,670
They went to the site, they reentered
all the graves, the barrier, the men,

658
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:58,510
they couldn't mark them with names and
they didn't have any names and they made

659
00:46:58,701 --> 00:47:00,050
them proper graves.

660
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,920
And then they built a fence all
the way around the cemetery,

661
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:06,620
about a hundred yards long and 50,
60 yards deep.

662
00:47:06,621 --> 00:47:09,950
And they whitewash the
fence and over an archway.

663
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:13,520
They painted the inscription
martyrs of the race course

664
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:19,750
and then on May 1st,

665
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:24,750
1865 they held a parade of
10,000 people on the race track,

666
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:30,690
led by 3000 black children carrying arm
loads of and singing John Brown's body

667
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:35,860
followed then by black women. Then by
black men. It was regimented this way.

668
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,650
Then by contingents of union infantry,

669
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:43,570
everybody marched all the way around
the race track as many as could fit gut

670
00:47:43,571 --> 00:47:48,430
into the grave site.
Five black preachers read from scripture,

671
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:52,090
a children's choir sang the
national anthem of America,

672
00:47:52,091 --> 00:47:54,100
the beautiful and several spirituals

673
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:01,270
and then they broke from that and went
back into the infield of the race track

674
00:48:01,271 --> 00:48:06,250
and did essentially what you and I
do on Memorial Day. They ran races.

675
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:11,280
They listened to 16 speeches by one count
and the troops marched back and forth

676
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:13,690
and they held picnics.

677
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:19,950
This was the first Memorial Day African
Americans invented Memorial Day in

678
00:48:22,001 --> 00:48:23,860
Charleston,
South Carolina.

679
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:28,030
There are three or four cities in the
United States and north and south.

680
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:30,370
The claim to be the site
of the first Memorial Day,

681
00:48:30,371 --> 00:48:33,070
but they all claim 1866
they were too late.

682
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,530
I had the great blind,

683
00:48:35,531 --> 00:48:40,531
good fortune just to discover this
story in a messy totally disorganized

684
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:46,210
collection of veterans papers
at the Houghton Library
at Harvard some years back

685
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:52,730
and once you have there is black
Americans recently freed from slavery

686
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
announcing to the world where their
flowers and their feet and their songs,

687
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,880
what the war had been about.

688
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:09,850
What they basically were creating was
the independence day of a second American

689
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:16,820
revolution.
That story got lost.

690
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:23,200
Hey, got lost for more than a
century and one I discovered it.

691
00:49:23,201 --> 00:49:27,730
I started calling people in Charleston
that I knew in archives and libraries,

692
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:30,630
including the Avery Institute,
the Black Research Center in Charleston.

693
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,740
He does anybody, do you have?
You've ever heard of this story?

694
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:34,120
And no one had ever heard it.

695
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:43,060
It showed the power of the lost cause in
the wake of the war to a race, a story,

696
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:46,930
but I started looking for other
sources and Lo and behold,

697
00:49:46,931 --> 00:49:48,040
there were lots of sources.

698
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:54,390
Harper's weekly even had a drawing
of the cemetery in an 1867 issue.

699
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:01,050
The old oval of that race
track is still there today.

700
00:50:01,051 --> 00:50:03,720
If you ever go to Charleston
and go up to Hampton Park,

701
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:08,810
Hampton Park is today what the race course
was then, its name for Wade Hampton,

702
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:09,840
the white supremacists,

703
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:14,400
Redeemer Governor of South Carolina
at the end of reconstruction and a

704
00:50:14,401 --> 00:50:16,500
confederate general during the civil war,

705
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:19,890
and that park sits immediately
adjacent to the citadel,

706
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:22,020
the Military Academy of Charleston,

707
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,120
and any given day you can see at any
given time about a hundred or 200 citadel

708
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:31,240
jogging on the track
of the old race course.

709
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,270
There is no marker.

710
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:38,620
There's no memento is only
a little bit of a memory.

711
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:43,350
Although a few years ago a friend of
mine in Charleston organized a mock

712
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:48,410
ceremony where we reenacted that event
including the children's choir and they

713
00:50:49,651 --> 00:50:54,120
made me dress up in a top hat and a funny
old 19th century suit and made me get

714
00:50:54,121 --> 00:50:58,290
up on a podium and make a stupid speech.
Yeah,

715
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:02,000
but there is an effort,
at least today, yeah.

716
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,730
To declare a Hampton Park,

717
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:10,400
a national historic landmark.
See you Thursday.
