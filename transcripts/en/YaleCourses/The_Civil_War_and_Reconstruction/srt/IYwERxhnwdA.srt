1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,080
The last book you're
reading in this course

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,810
is about great journalist Nick Lemann.
It's called redemption,

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,230
the last battle of the civil war.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,050
That seems to be a contest right now

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,200
in writing about and publishing
about the violence of reconstruction.

6
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:27,201
It's really been discovered by American
publishers and certainly by American

7
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:31,140
writers and in less
than three new books out

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,590
on either the Colfax massacre,

9
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:39,480
which we'll talk about in a minute or
what lemon does mostly in his book,

10
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:41,370
which is the story of Mississippi,

11
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,740
sometimes called the shotgun policy,
sometimes called the Mississippi plan,

12
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:52,510
but in effect the coup d'etat whereby
the White Democrats of Mississippi took

13
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:58,920
back control of that state
largely by terrorist violence,

14
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,950
political violence in 1875 the
titles of these books strike me

15
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,840
redemption,
the last battle of the civil war,

16
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,730
Charles Lane's book,
the pop,

17
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,980
good journalistic popular writer,

18
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,610
a whole book in the Colfax massacre,
current title,

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,640
the day freedom died one day and
there's another book by a young New York

20
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:29,220
private high school teacher.

21
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,940
Proof that good books
can be written by anyone.

22
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:38,550
The Colfax massacre, the untold
story of black power, white terror,

23
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,020
and the death of reconstruction.
All those titles are true.

24
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,480
It's not the redemption of course that
you hear Button Bob Marley's redemption

25
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:51,744
song,

26
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,420
but am I recommended you put Marley on
while you're reading about this stuff?

27
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,750
It might be a nice antidote.

28
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,410
No,
I'm not going to sing it,

29
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,830
but I'm gonna start with
a very brief little poem.

30
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,410
One of the best illustrations in poetry.

31
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:23,270
I know of this idea that
revolutions can go backward,

32
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:28,610
that revolutions usually
do go backwards for awhile.

33
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,390
That revolutions always cause counter.

34
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,080
It's a poem by Langston Hughes.

35
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,120
He wrote it right near the end
of his life in 1965 note the date

36
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,530
he entitled it emancipation

37
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,500
and then a subtitle. Long view. Negro

38
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,390
two simple versus emancipation.

39
00:02:56,391 --> 00:03:01,391
In 1865 cited through the
telescope of dreams looms larger,

40
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,840
so much larger,
so it seems than truth can be,

41
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,050
but turn the telescope around,

42
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,860
look through the larger in and wonder
why what was so large becomes so small.

43
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:21,064
Again,

44
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,980
the metaphor is powerful.
If vexing,

45
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,590
look through the opposite
end of a telescope.

46
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:36,060
Look back at history and not forward and
wonder why was what was such a dream,

47
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:44,080
what was so large,
it can become so small again

48
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,070
now,
and I'm

49
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,940
on that 15th Amendment Pass that I
talked about briefly the other day.

50
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:00,090
There were just amazing celebrations in
18 set when it was finally ratified in

51
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:04,020
1870 all over the place.
Um,

52
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,000
I only saw it a couple,
um,

53
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,580
grant and his message to Congress in
effect said reconstruction was now largely

54
00:04:16,621 --> 00:04:19,830
over Frederick Douglass.

55
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,880
Though he wasn't thrilled with the
fact that it was the most conservative

56
00:04:23,881 --> 00:04:25,620
version of the 15th amendment and so on.

57
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:30,810
Nevertheless said we can now
breathe a new atmosphere.

58
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,340
We have a new earth beneath
and a new sky above.

59
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,890
That's a dream.

60
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,750
One Republican newspaper called
it the nation's second birth,

61
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,370
second founding
and Wendell Phillips,

62
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,440
the again the Massachusetts abolitionists
said it was now the real birthday of

63
00:05:00,151 --> 00:05:05,151
the nation because now the declaration
of independence applied to all know that

64
00:05:06,721 --> 00:05:11,721
was placing a great deal of hope in a
somewhat limited amendment to say the

65
00:05:12,451 --> 00:05:17,190
least. That's 1870 now go
ahead. Just five years with me.

66
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,120
This is the period now of
southern redemption defined
of course as the southern

67
00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:28,260
White Democratic Party's counterrevolution
and taking back control of its state.

68
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:32,130
Governments happens very
quickly in some southern states.

69
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:37,550
Some are redeemed as early as 1870 by
the Democrats and the last three or so,

70
00:05:38,341 --> 00:05:43,341
not until 1876 77 but think
of what you just heard there,

71
00:05:43,621 --> 00:05:48,621
that that almost unfathomable hope
rooted in this voting rights amendment.

72
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,520
And then listen to this statement
from the floor of Congress,

73
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:59,210
one of the most brilliant young black
who got himself elected among those

74
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:03,890
hundreds of got elected among the
16 who got elected to Congress,

75
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,720
John Roy Lynch,

76
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,440
a former slave self taught.

77
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:14,720
He educated himself like Frederick
Douglass. There's, there's,

78
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:17,240
there's mysteries about
the brilliance of this guy,

79
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:23,170
but he's elected to Congress when he's
26 from Mississippi under Mississippi's

80
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:29,210
radical reconstruction government.
So long as it lasted,

81
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,740
he's still there in 1875 and
on the floor of the congress,

82
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,241
which was then,

83
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:40,130
as you'll see in a moment after the
74 election now ruled by a majority of

84
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,790
Democrats.
He looks them in the eye and he says,

85
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,470
think of it for a moment.
My colleagues,

86
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,870
when I leave my home in Mississippi,
to come to the capitol of the nation,

87
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:58,871
to take part in the deliberations of
this house and to participate with you in

88
00:06:59,101 --> 00:07:02,450
making laws for the government
of this great republic.

89
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,930
I am treated not as an American citizen,

90
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,320
but as a brute force to occupy a filthy
smoking car both night and day with

91
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:16,010
drunkards, gamblers and
criminals. And for what?

92
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,540
Not that I am unable or
unwilling to pay my way.

93
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,370
Not that I am obnoxious in my personal
appearance or disrespectful in my

94
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:26,204
conduct,

95
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:31,690
but simply because I happen
to be of a darker complexion.

96
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:37,850
Now, here's the irony and the
point, the majority of those men,

97
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:40,340
he was speaking to that
day in the congress,

98
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:45,460
in their minds when they heard him say it,
to the extent they listened,

99
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:50,050
when he said that, I think we
can safely assume we're thinking,

100
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,690
yeah, that's just exactly the
way you should be treated.

101
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,253
No.

102
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,660
1873 for the moment.
Uh,

103
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:11,210
the day freedom died according to Charles
Lane's book is the day of the Colfax

104
00:08:11,821 --> 00:08:14,010
massacre.
That day,

105
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:18,900
I wouldn't quite say freedom died on
one day. That's a little a historical,

106
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:23,190
but so be it. That's probably
a publisher's title more
than an author's title.

107
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,600
But April,
1418 73 is in some ways,

108
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:32,580
one of those days we could call in
American history a day of infamy.

109
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,650
The Supreme Court that day,
at least it's the date of the decision,

110
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,950
even though it was Easter Sunday,
handed down his decision,

111
00:08:40,951 --> 00:08:44,040
five to four in the slaughterhouse cases,

112
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:48,030
so called a collection of five
cases that came out of Louisiana,

113
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,750
which was the courts first major ruling
on the civil war amendments on the of

114
00:08:56,521 --> 00:09:00,690
the 13th,
the 14th and the 15th amendments

115
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,330
that day, same day,
Easter Sunday and Colfax.

116
00:09:07,331 --> 00:09:09,550
Louisiana,
a town,

117
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,570
not very big name for Schuler Colfax,

118
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:18,750
the vice president of the United States
and the grant administration in grant

119
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:23,470
parish, renamed by the republican
regime where you list these grant.

120
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:29,490
The largest mass murder of Americans
ever in American history occurred in the

121
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:35,971
political violence stemming from the
divided election in Louisiana back in the

122
00:09:36,611 --> 00:09:40,660
fall of 1872 now nine 11 of course,

123
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:41,940
killed more Americans.

124
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,870
We can get caught up in categories of
what is domestic violence and foreign

125
00:09:46,871 --> 00:09:47,980
violence and so forth,

126
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,870
but this is the largest mass murder of
Americans in our history so far as we can

127
00:09:52,871 --> 00:09:53,704
tell.

128
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,820
That divided election produced in effect
two competing governments in Louisiana,

129
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,540
the republican regime,

130
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:07,541
which per did win the election for
all practical purposes in spite of the

131
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:12,530
tremendous political violence committed
against particularly black voters in

132
00:10:12,531 --> 00:10:14,480
that fall 72 election,

133
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:20,050
but it's still called fusion ticket of
basically a kind of white supremacists

134
00:10:21,411 --> 00:10:26,411
coalition also claimed to
be the legitimate government
of Louisiana and in this

135
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:32,261
situation of essentially and ongoing
vigilante war throughout many of the

136
00:10:34,521 --> 00:10:36,710
parishes,
counties of Louisiana,

137
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,810
a standoff took place in Colfax.

138
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,910
I'll come back to that in a moment.

139
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,860
Yeah.

140
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,750
But back to the slaughterhouse
case that came down that day.

141
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,270
It wasn't the end at testing
of the privileges and
immunities clause of the 14th

142
00:10:55,271 --> 00:10:56,104
amendment.

143
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:01,830
In 1869 the city of New Orleans under
its republican state government created a

144
00:11:04,271 --> 00:11:08,740
corporation to move the
slaughterhouse of New Orleans.

145
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,400
They're actually, I had never been a
legitimate slaughterhouse in New Orleans.

146
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,710
What the butchers of New Orleans would do,

147
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,670
the white butchers of New Orleans would
do is they heard the hogs through the

148
00:11:18,671 --> 00:11:21,670
streets of New Orleans and basically
they'd butcher the things wherever they

149
00:11:21,671 --> 00:11:25,060
wanted to and they always threw all the,
it gets ugly.

150
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,240
All of the old fall from the hogs into
the Mississippi River up river from the

151
00:11:31,361 --> 00:11:36,361
city before the river reached the
main water pipeline into the city.

152
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,940
This has long been a problem.
Long been set,

153
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:46,080
a series of complaints and so this was
an attempt that clean government and

154
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:52,270
clean cities,
the city and the state backing it up,

155
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,530
created a corporation.
They created a new slaughterhouse.

156
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,910
They moved across the Mississippi River
and downstream from the city for health

157
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:05,830
reasons.
They put in a a state appointed inspector

158
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,470
and the white butchers of
New Orleans were angry,

159
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,690
some bushes and some critics charge. This
was a monopoly and an unfair practice.

160
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:21,820
25 butchers brought suit with support
from the reviving Democratic Party,

161
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,033
white butchers,

162
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
the lower courts in this particular suit
found in favor of the new corporation.

163
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,060
It was appealed to the u s supreme court.

164
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:39,760
It got on the docket in
72 it was decided April,

165
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,720
1418 73

166
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,640
it was a five to four decision seemingly
on the surface that when you read it,

167
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,690
it's like many court decisions.

168
00:12:50,691 --> 00:12:55,691
It's a bit boring at first five cases
from butchers and so on and so on.

169
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,100
And you want to,
what the hell is this about?

170
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,900
And then you keep reading and you
realize it became a fundamental decision.

171
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,300
Justice Samuel Miller for the majority,

172
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:09,301
argued that the 13th and 14th
amendments were intended.

173
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,040
This was the good part of the decision
to end slavery and advance the rights of

174
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:19,330
the Friedman. But he made a
sharp, just in other words,

175
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,870
not to protect a bunch of
white butchers in New Orleans.

176
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,873
And by the way,

177
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:30,220
the lead lawyer for the butchers
in the slaughterhouse cases

178
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,110
was none other than a man
named Johnny Campbell. Uh,

179
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:38,740
Georgia born former member
of the supreme court.

180
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,810
He had been part of the six men majority
in the dred Scott decision of 1857

181
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,180
resign his position on the u s supreme
court in 1861 to go home and fight for

182
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:51,970
the confederacy.
He didn't fight on the battlefield.

183
00:13:51,971 --> 00:13:56,620
He became assistant secretary of state
and the confederacy and serve through in

184
00:13:56,621 --> 00:14:01,230
that position and other high ranking
official positions in the confederate

185
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,710
national government throughout the
civil war. And when the war was over,

186
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:08,200
he was one of those high
ranking confederate officials.

187
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:12,340
Denied the right to vote
disfranchised for up to four years.

188
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:17,230
He was part of the final set of amnesty
and pardons that Andrew Johnson enacted

189
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,840
just before leaving office in spring of 69

190
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,520
and Campbell and made it as business as
a redeemer now in the south to Swart and

191
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:31,120
fight reconstruction at every turn.
He hated black suffrage.

192
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,010
He hated black people.
He was a very white supremacist.

193
00:14:36,011 --> 00:14:39,610
He took this case on because he
wanted to crush reconstruction.

194
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,640
He even argued,
by the way,

195
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,870
in the slaughterhouse cases which
Miller turned right back on his head.

196
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:52,260
He even argued that the rights of the
butchers were being under the 13th

197
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:53,174
amendment.

198
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,200
They said that he said that these butches
were now being forced into a form of

199
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:03,500
involuntary servitude because they had
to take their hogs across the Mississippi

200
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:05,170
and of them down river.

201
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:10,590
It was violating their right to make a
proper livelihood by their own individual

202
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:11,944
choice.

203
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:13,870
Okay,

204
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:18,640
and frankly, folks, I read this decision
this morning. I got through most of it.

205
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:24,990
If you want to read the
origins of our modern day uses,

206
00:15:25,601 --> 00:15:29,440
and some would say
misuses of civil rights,

207
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,400
language and legislation in our own time,

208
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:39,070
the ways in which some American
politicians, lawyers, judges,

209
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,170
et Cetera, pundits, et
Cetera, et Cetera, et Cetera,

210
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,160
have appropriated the language of
the modern civil rights movement,

211
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:49,810
especially the language of the
content of our character too.

212
00:15:49,811 --> 00:15:52,150
Sometimes some scurrilous ends.

213
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:57,390
The roots of that are in John Campbell's
arguments in the slaughterhouse cases

214
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,830
in 1873 Miller through the 13th
amendment argument back at,

215
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:08,250
at Thompson and told him in
effect to well stick it somewhere

216
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,160
now, however, back to Miller's
opinion in, in a five, four case.

217
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,700
The real importance of the slaughterhouse
case is that even though Miller argued

218
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:24,920
that the purpose of these amendments
were to, were to advance, uh, uh,

219
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,360
black freedom and the
rights of the Friedman,

220
00:16:28,361 --> 00:16:33,361
he nevertheless made a clear distinction
between national and state citizenship

221
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,230
in these years. We don't
even think him. Well,

222
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:41,170
I don't think we think in terms
of the day of our states citizen.

223
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,520
Do you think of yourself as a
citizen of the state of Virginia?

224
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,400
Maybe you do.
I don't.

225
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:50,680
Maybe today in town Sylvania
where people are voting in droves,

226
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,890
they're thinking of their citizenship
was Pennsylvania and I don't know.

227
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,940
But we tend to think of terms
of citizenship now from the,

228
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:01,540
certainly in the early 21st
century is a national phenomenon.

229
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:04,720
One has Portuguese or,
or,

230
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:09,460
or German or American or whatever,

231
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:12,700
Brazilian citizenship.
And in some countries dual and so on.

232
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,730
Rarely do we think of ourselves
as citizens of states,

233
00:17:15,731 --> 00:17:17,170
but they did in the 19th century.

234
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:22,090
Now what Miller did in this decision
though was a bit weird in retrospect,

235
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,810
he named various national
privileges and immunities.

236
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,290
That's the language of the 14th Amendment,
uh,

237
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:33,330
like entering the nation's ports
or protection out on the high seas.

238
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,970
The ability to run for federal office
and to travel to the seat of government

239
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,900
and so on.
But he never mentioned basic civil rights,

240
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,990
access to public facilities, et
Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera.

241
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,970
He never mentioned the right to vote.

242
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:54,830
He said all of those rights are only
under the jurisdiction of the states,

243
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,630
not the national government.

244
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,030
In other words,
traditional federalism.

245
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,580
This separation of what states can
control, like the right to vote,

246
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,750
like what is the civil rights,
which civil rights,

247
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,320
what kinds of equality or it'd be
adjudicated in court would be left to the

248
00:18:23,441 --> 00:18:27,720
states
slaughterhouse set in motion.

249
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,760
This federal retreat, at least in
the courts, and it's a retreat,

250
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:37,761
is already happening elsewhere
from Miller's zone definition,

251
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:43,550
ironically of the meaning of the 13th and
14th amendments back to Colfax Colfax,

252
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:51,180
Louisiana, April, 1418 73.

253
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,160
I don't have time for the,

254
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:59,180
all the gruesome details of this massacre
and I'll spare you the most of it,

255
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:05,400
but it is in some ways in the
American mee Lai massacre, uh,

256
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:10,401
Katyn forest massacre with the
Soviets did in 1944 and Poland,

257
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,940
it's a, it's one of these
authors of this new book,

258
00:19:14,941 --> 00:19:18,480
I think a bit inappropriately
uses the term genocide,

259
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:22,650
that it was a result of
a wish for genocide. Um,

260
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:25,680
it is mass murder by any definition.

261
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:31,850
What happened is that where these two
competing governments in Louisiana,

262
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,520
Democrat fusion government,
the Republican government,

263
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,040
both would appoint sheriffs
in the same parish.

264
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:42,180
So there was the Republican sheriff who
was black and there was the democratic

265
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:46,590
sheriff who was white, uh, local
officials of all kinds of being appointed.

266
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,481
Well,

267
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:53,481
what happened is that the violence in the
countryside got so bad in grant parish

268
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:59,010
that the blacks in the area began leaving
their cabins and leaving their small

269
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:04,011
farms and they came into Colfax because
Colfax had become a symbol of protection

270
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:10,620
and safety for blacks and the Great Red
River district of central Louisiana.

271
00:20:10,621 --> 00:20:10,981
By the way,

272
00:20:10,981 --> 00:20:15,981
the Red River region of central Louisiana
with some of the richest soil in all

273
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:21,480
of the south. It was a tremendous
sugar and cotton plantation region.

274
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:27,290
Several thousand acres of that Red River
district right around Colfax was zone

275
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:32,520
by a white land owner name of
Willie Calhoun, William Calhoun.

276
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:37,830
He was the son of a Meredith
Calhoun who had been a very,

277
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:42,330
very pro slavery, huge slave holder
before the civil war, but his son, Willie,

278
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:47,130
who had been raised in part in Europe
because his parents kept living half,

279
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:51,940
half the time in Paris as a kid
was badly, terribly injured.

280
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,000
His back was broken.

281
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:58,000
He spent his life as a hunchback
and God only knows how he came by,

282
00:20:58,001 --> 00:21:02,860
his sympathies and his beliefs
in the rights of former slaves.

283
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,110
But he became a union during the civil
war in an area where it was not healthy

284
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:12,100
to be a union and the Red River
district and after the war was over,

285
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:17,101
Willy Calhoun became an early and often
scale away or Republican and he in

286
00:21:18,181 --> 00:21:23,181
effect turned over much of
his land without even selling
it to the settlement of

287
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:27,190
hundreds and hundreds of
Friedman and their families.

288
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:34,080
Willie Calhoun would spend the Colfax
massacre watching probably 150 odd blacks

289
00:21:36,401 --> 00:21:41,401
murdered in cold blood as a kind
of a prisoner on his front porch.

290
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,171
But at any rate,

291
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:49,171
black gathered and Colfax for weeks
before the spring of 73 cause it was,

292
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,590
it had been at least a co or a,

293
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,670
the Calhoun landing as it was called,
had been a place of safety.

294
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,540
Blacks took over the courthouse in Colfax.
They occupied it,

295
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,140
they'd collected lots of weapons,
they were ready.

296
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,800
They build trenches all the
way around the courthouse.

297
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,700
They were ready for
battle and it is battle.

298
00:22:12,701 --> 00:22:17,701
They got from a huge mob of
disparate para military whites,

299
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,300
many of whom were for four
former confederate soldiers,

300
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:25,030
many of whom are former
members of the Ku Klux Klan.

301
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,060
Some now called themselves
knights of the white community.

302
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:33,100
Then went by all kinds of different
names and what had happened on April 14th

303
00:22:33,401 --> 00:22:36,370
was indeed in effect,
a pitched battle.

304
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,560
The whites had a cannon,
lots of weapons.

305
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,540
Blacks couldn't hold them off.
They fled into the courthouse.

306
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:51,930
The whites captured a black men and
forced him to take a torch and they said,

307
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:55,210
we'll kill you or you take the
torch and light the roof on fire.

308
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:59,530
He let the roof on fire and the
courthouse began to burn down,

309
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:02,680
which of course smoked most of
the blacks out of the courthouse,

310
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:07,750
although a few stayed and were burned
to death, hiding under the floorboards,

311
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,480
and as they came out,

312
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:16,020
many of them were executed right around
the door before the thing was over that

313
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,730
night,

314
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:23,170
the estimate runs from
about 82 possibly as high.

315
00:23:23,171 --> 00:23:28,171
We'll never really know
as 150 blacks were killed.

316
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:34,000
Most of them execution style.
Most of them will shots to the head.

317
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:38,710
Many of them shots to the back of their
heads and many of them in the wake of

318
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,190
being shot, uh, having
their bodies mutilated

319
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:48,860
the first representatives of the
Louisiana state government, uh,

320
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,040
the Republican will,

321
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:55,040
Louisiana state government arrived 48
hours after the massacre and recorded one

322
00:23:55,491 --> 00:24:00,491
after another corpse shot in the back of
the head and then shot many more times

323
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,910
and then somebody
mutilated and they kept us.

324
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:10,460
This is this kind of gruesome need to
describe you find in these reports.

325
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,310
They also described many of the bodies
being eaten by dogs and Turkey vultures.

326
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,893
Well,

327
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,100
Colfax led to a national sensation,

328
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,360
Harper's weekly and Leslie's weekly
had illustrated articles about it.

329
00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:31,504
Within a week,

330
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:37,390
a famous pictures of blacks carrying
their dead home to bury them quotations

331
00:24:38,081 --> 00:24:41,410
from women describing a woman describing,

332
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:46,120
dragging her son away from the dogs who
are eating his body and so on and so

333
00:24:46,121 --> 00:24:46,954
forth.

334
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:52,470
And it led to a national investigation
of federal investigation led by the US

335
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:55,780
attorney. The Republican appointed
us attorney in New Orleans,

336
00:24:55,781 --> 00:24:59,230
who's name was James Beckwith,
a northern born new England

337
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,760
old abolitionists fellow with a good deal
of zeal who heroically tried to bring

338
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,560
indictments and prosecutions.

339
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,190
There were indeed many indictments,

340
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:17,290
but only three convictions
in the wake of Colfax.

341
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,940
It took over two years

342
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:25,590
and it led to the second great
Supreme Court case that turned around

343
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:27,874
reconstruction.

344
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,700
That case first argued in Louisiana

345
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:39,360
was for the three men convicted
of leading the Colfax massacre.

346
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:44,470
One of the names was a man
named William Cruickshank Cru,

347
00:25:44,471 --> 00:25:49,470
I. K. S. H. A. N. K. I don't
think I put it on the outline
or did, I guess I didn't.

348
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,420
Sorry.
In the United States versus Cruickshank,

349
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:59,570
the u s supreme court took up the case
of these prosecute these convictions in

350
00:26:00,721 --> 00:26:04,320
Louisiana. The court, by this time,

351
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:09,420
early 1876 when the crook
shank case came down,

352
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:15,510
had a new chief justice, his name
was Morrison Remick. Wait, w.

353
00:26:15,511 --> 00:26:16,440
A. T. E.

354
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:21,820
We've been appointed by grant and 1874
to replace the recently deceased salmon p

355
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:25,080
chase, who had been appointed
chief justice by Abraham Lincoln.

356
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:29,760
The court by 1876 was seven
Republicans and two Democrats.

357
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:33,120
Most of them now had been
appointed by Lincoln or grant.

358
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:37,470
This was a thoroughly
Republican Party Supreme Court.

359
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,010
Um, wait, by the way,

360
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,240
we've been through many Supreme Court
appointments in our recent lifetime and we

361
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:52,950
know how political these things can
get weight with grants. Fifth Choice,

362
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,070
the first two people he
asked turned him down.

363
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,030
I don't want to be on the Supreme Court.
There's no political future.

364
00:27:00,031 --> 00:27:04,170
Their Supreme Court justice in these
years often ran for president while they

365
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:08,580
were on the court and it's, they don't do
that. At least they don't do that. Now,

366
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,860
the next two people he appointed or he
wanted to appoint were turned down by the

367
00:27:13,861 --> 00:27:17,250
Senate way, was his fifth
choice. Nobody ever heard of it.

368
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,990
He was known in Ohio,

369
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,010
but as one of his own supreme
court colleagues called him

370
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:29,280
said, wait, was quote at the
front rank of second rank lawyers.

371
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,660
Maybe it proves the old adage,
apologies to anyone from Ohio.

372
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:41,010
You know, the old saying, Ohio has had
more presidents. I think even in Virginia.

373
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:44,880
Some are born great,
some achieve greatness,

374
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:46,920
so I'm just coming from Ohio,

375
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,011
Morrison.
Wait,

376
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:58,011
we'll write the opinion in a nine zero
decision unanimous decision and the

377
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:02,670
Cruickshank case.
This was a test,

378
00:28:02,671 --> 00:28:07,671
this case now of really the enforcement
act passed in 1870 the enforcement act

379
00:28:08,971 --> 00:28:13,410
as part of the Ku Klux Klan acts
authorizing the federal government

380
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,940
to enforce the right to vote with
military action if necessary in the south.

381
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,760
This was a case now testing that also
of course testing the 14th and 15th

382
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:30,084
amendments,

383
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:36,240
the court decision and Cruickshank
found the indictments had said faulty.

384
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,470
It overturned two of
the three convictions.

385
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:46,400
It ruled that those immortal phrases
of due process and equal protection,

386
00:28:47,971 --> 00:28:52,080
those two great clauses in the fort
and then part one of the 14th amendment

387
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,460
applied.

388
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,460
They said only to state actions and
not to the actions of individuals.

389
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:06,120
If a man murders another man in Colfax,

390
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:11,130
Louisiana in a, in a, in a
political way or any other way,

391
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:16,920
that's a state matter.
Even if it's around voting,

392
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,480
it's a state matter.

393
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:23,340
Not a federal matter can be
adjudicated in federal court.

394
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:29,270
Federal government does not have the
power to enforce the right to vote,

395
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:34,020
the right to civil rights and so on.
The Cruickshank case,

396
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:37,560
the implications of the Cruikshank
case immediately were obvious.

397
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,980
It meant number one,
that mass murder,

398
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:46,290
one unpunished in the United States to
and meant that blacks increasingly not

399
00:29:46,781 --> 00:29:51,160
would be at the mercy of now
hostile state governments.

400
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,240
Back when Justice Miller wrote
that decision in slaughterhouse,

401
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,750
there was still a lot of
republican regimes and he's not,

402
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:03,310
he claimed to his dying day he was
leaving adjudication to states under

403
00:30:03,311 --> 00:30:06,130
sympathetic Republican governments.
Yeah,

404
00:30:06,131 --> 00:30:09,310
but Justice Miller or what if the
government's no longer sympathetic?

405
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:15,360
What if it's run by Klansmen?
And three,

406
00:30:15,361 --> 00:30:19,260
it opened up. Crude now opens
up as a federal court decision,

407
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:24,650
all manner of discriminatory laws passed
by what will be democratic redeemer

408
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,280
governments in the southern states.

409
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:34,230
Why was there a nine zero decision in
1876 on this with seven of the justices

410
00:30:34,231 --> 00:30:39,150
appointed by Lincoln and grant and so on?
Well one,

411
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:44,010
you have to realize that by 75 and 76
when these guys were were adjudicating

412
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:44,844
this decision,

413
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:49,590
there was a tremendous amount of just
flat out fatigue with reconstruction.

414
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,500
And I've been to all,
I've been to a lot of your sections now,

415
00:30:52,501 --> 00:30:56,250
and I've heard you say the same thing,
and I'm not chastising you,

416
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,013
I'm not,

417
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,900
but sometimes we, we, we
read back into the past,

418
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,720
even our own fatigue with certain issues,

419
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,110
they were sort of fed up
with reconstruction in the
north. Well, yeah, they were.

420
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,040
Look at the consequences.

421
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:14,340
Yeah,

422
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:14,971
it's clear.

423
00:31:14,971 --> 00:31:19,500
And even in their own writings that many
of the justices just wanted to get rid

424
00:31:19,501 --> 00:31:21,960
of reconstruction and
leave it to the south.

425
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,140
It's signaled now,
most importantly,

426
00:31:26,141 --> 00:31:29,140
a phoner makes this point in the one
little paragraph he gives you on the

427
00:31:29,141 --> 00:31:30,100
Cruickshank case,

428
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,630
it's signal now with the federal
government was ineffective exiting

429
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:39,540
reconstruction. Certainly the
supreme court was, and his phone,

430
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:44,550
her says terror was given a green light
anywhere that is state government was

431
00:31:47,621 --> 00:31:48,454
unwilling

432
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,470
to enforce the law or protect people.

433
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,583
Now,

434
00:31:55,890 --> 00:32:00,890
why was radicalism waning in the 1870s
or even at the beginning of the 1870s.

435
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,510
What is about about the grant years,

436
00:32:03,511 --> 00:32:07,610
especially the second grant
administration that leaves, you know, the,

437
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:11,970
this pay practically paves these
roads to a southern redemption,

438
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:16,740
a southern counterrevolution?
Well, there are many factors,

439
00:32:16,741 --> 00:32:19,150
and let me kind of run
through them and then focus,

440
00:32:19,151 --> 00:32:24,040
especially on the scandals for a moment.
And then on this larger question of,

441
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:27,510
of violence, in case you haven't
heard enough about violence

442
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:33,390
and mean, first of all,
there's the panic of 1873, um,

443
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,540
which set in,
in the spring of 1873,

444
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:40,490
a major economic depression that
hit the country, the entire country,

445
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:44,690
and led to a great deal of
labor, strife, and violence.

446
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,250
Okay?

447
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:50,090
It meant in the wake of the well in the
midst of the panic of 73 and [inaudible]

448
00:32:50,091 --> 00:32:55,091
74 [inaudible] 75 that the issues now
that politicians were most concerned about

449
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,570
and the voters were most concerned about,
particularly in the north,

450
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:03,680
were things like currency,
tariffs, unemployment,

451
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:08,580
railroad subsidies, labor strife. Whether
a union had the right to strike here,

452
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:13,100
the right to strike there and across
the great Midwest among farmers.

453
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:14,930
The biggest issue was the price of wheat,

454
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:20,260
which dropped from $2 a barrel
to 50 cents in a year and a half.

455
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:23,060
Okay.

456
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:28,060
Wages for manufacturing laborers in the
United States in a year and a half drop

457
00:33:29,251 --> 00:33:31,940
by 50% across the country.

458
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,340
That's for those who kept their jobs.

459
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:40,490
The panic of 1873 shifted people's mind

460
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,390
to say the least.

461
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:46,840
Yeah.

462
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,680
Then there's the factor of the grant,
the nature of grants presidency,

463
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,270
the way in which granted himself
even defined the presidency,

464
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,920
grandchildren remember, was a rather
reluctant politician. At first.

465
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,930
He actually got a little better at it.

466
00:34:01,931 --> 00:34:06,931
Then his historical reputation is
sometimes led us to believe grant could be

467
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:12,280
very political, although he did have this
idea that the presidency ought to be,

468
00:34:12,281 --> 00:34:17,281
especially in these crisis years with
the tremendous bitterness bloody shirt

469
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:19,960
tensions after the
civil war and after all,

470
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:24,990
he's the general that won the war and
obliterated Virginia that the president

471
00:34:25,061 --> 00:34:25,451
ought to be.

472
00:34:25,451 --> 00:34:29,740
Now just basically a caretaker ought
to have as few opinions as possible.

473
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,100
A caretaker presidency,

474
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:37,480
not so much a leader as a unifier.

475
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,640
No,

476
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:45,640
he is hands off approach to so many things
of course is what in part led to the

477
00:34:45,981 --> 00:34:48,030
scandals that are so long have long,

478
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:52,100
so long been associated with him or
at least with his administration.

479
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:58,720
I would argue that grant has gotten
to some extent a bad rap from some

480
00:34:58,881 --> 00:34:59,714
historians.

481
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:04,430
Although if you look at any of those
lists that come out every year when they

482
00:35:04,431 --> 00:35:08,840
survey historians, the greatest
presence, the worst presidents, you know,

483
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,940
Lincoln's always at the top
and then you get to Fdr.

484
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:15,620
Now Reagan has always in the top three
for reasons I don't even want to discuss.

485
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,533
A

486
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:26,360
lot of airports are named forums.
I guess that's why at any rate, um,

487
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:31,220
enough on that grant is always
down here near the bottom.

488
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:36,500
I can't resist this. The great
American cynic of the 19th century,

489
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:39,780
one of our greatest historians and
one of our most beautiful writers,

490
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,010
but what a cynic. Henry Adams,
son of Charles Francis Adams,

491
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,790
grandson of Quincy,
great grandson of John.

492
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,370
This was his description of grant

493
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,720
and he was living the
grant administration.

494
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,160
Grant had no right to exist.

495
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,413
Yeah,

496
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:06,770
he should have been extinct for ages
that 2000 years after Alexander the Great

497
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:08,580
and Julius Caesar,

498
00:36:08,581 --> 00:36:13,581
a man like grant should be called and
should actually truly be the highest

499
00:36:13,801 --> 00:36:18,780
product of the most advanced
evolution made evolution ludicrous.

500
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:24,860
The progress of evolution from President
Washington to President grant was alone

501
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,290
evidence enough to upset Darwin.

502
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:34,650
Grant should have lived in
a cave and Warren Skins,

503
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:36,563
Ooh,

504
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:42,710
that's Cole
and unfair,

505
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,820
but under his leadership,

506
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,880
a whole series of four or five different
scandals that sort of set the standard

507
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,380
for scandal to come in American history.
Although we've,

508
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,870
we've had some much worse one since then.
Some of these,

509
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,790
most of them were of course financial.

510
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:07,380
There's almost no sex in the grant
scandal years so far as we can tell. Um,

511
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,160
the first one is the gold scandal.

512
00:37:11,161 --> 00:37:16,161
This was an attempt to corner of the
gold market by one Jay Gould and James

513
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:20,430
Fisk. He's are Wall Street
guys in New York is an 1869.

514
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:25,350
Right after grant took office.
They did indeed corner the market on goal.

515
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:30,500
They tried to buy up all the gold in
New York and then they plan to force

516
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:34,770
bankers and business people to buy the
gold from them and inflated prices.

517
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,590
It's an old cornering a trick.

518
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,463
They uh,

519
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:46,200
they made $11 million in three weeks
doing this in the 19th century.

520
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:47,620
Yeah.

521
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:52,620
They were eventually selling that
goal than $163 and 50 cents per ounce.

522
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:58,360
And the only way to break their corner
was suddenly, cause it happened so fast,

523
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,450
it was for the federal government
to begin selling all of its goal,

524
00:38:01,451 --> 00:38:04,190
put it on the market,
get the prices down,

525
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:11,230
grants brother-in-law never point
your brother in law to anything able.

526
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:16,050
Corban was that sort of personal emissary.

527
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,240
He assured and promise the plotters,

528
00:38:18,241 --> 00:38:21,680
Gould and Fisk that uh,

529
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:26,750
he had influence on grant and the grant
would never permit the government's goal

530
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:29,890
to be sold,
but he was wrong.

531
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,880
And grant did allow it to be
sold. And then grants person, uh,

532
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:39,270
grants a treasury secretary,
George Barnwell got involved.

533
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:42,430
The scandal finally
broke open in the press.

534
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:48,160
And though nothing ever really happened
to Goulder Fisk setting in motion a

535
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:52,210
history of who gets caught and who doesn't
get caught in the Wall Street world.

536
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:53,621
It did,

537
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:58,621
it was the first scandal of its kind to
begin to lead to cries of civil service

538
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,960
reform, which became, uh, uh,

539
00:39:01,961 --> 00:39:06,961
a big rallying cry and the 1870s
then there was the whisky ring.

540
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:09,521
Man,

541
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:14,440
this was all fashion just
on a Delta rated fraud.

542
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,810
This began in the early 1870s.
At first started in St Louis.

543
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:22,120
It was really a cartel,

544
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,570
what we in modern times would
call the creation of a cartel.

545
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:30,400
These were whiskey distillers all over
the country who banded together to cheat

546
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:34,870
the US government out of excise taxes.
You know the luxury tax on Whiskey,

547
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,030
the way that they did it,

548
00:39:37,031 --> 00:39:42,031
as many distillers were forced to join
this ring of people around the country or

549
00:39:43,331 --> 00:39:47,980
have their businesses ruined,
join or we'll run you out of business.

550
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,300
The whisky ring had branch offices
all over the country and cities like

551
00:39:52,301 --> 00:39:56,260
Milwaukee, a Peoria, New Orleans,
Chicago, Cincinnati in Washington,

552
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:58,780
in many other cities, north,
south, west, you name it,

553
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:02,110
and then they started bribing
the Treasury Department,

554
00:40:02,111 --> 00:40:03,770
which of course is where
the excise taxes would,

555
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:07,360
would go to many officials
in the Treasury Department.

556
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:10,900
We're soon on the payroll
of the whisky ring,

557
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,710
especially the chief clerk of
the U S Treasury Department.

558
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,020
The man who kept the books,

559
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,370
one General Orville Babcock,

560
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:25,240
the president's private secretary
was implicated more than implicated.

561
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:29,410
He was involved. He was charged
eventually, although acquitted

562
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:35,920
grant entered a deposition on his
behalf and a good character and so on in

563
00:40:35,921 --> 00:40:38,860
court, which he never showed his done.
He didn't really look at the facts.

564
00:40:38,861 --> 00:40:40,090
He didn't look at the evidence.

565
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:45,010
The point of all this one is that
millions and millions of dollars in liquor

566
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:47,060
revenues were lost.

567
00:40:47,061 --> 00:40:52,061
To the u s government from about 1870
to 1875 and most of that money went into

568
00:40:53,921 --> 00:40:55,990
the pockets of whiskey distillers,

569
00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:00,580
and a lot of it went into the pockets of
treasury department officials who were

570
00:41:00,581 --> 00:41:04,210
themselves supposed to
be collecting the tax.

571
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:10,320
The estimate is that between 40
and $50 million it was grafted.

572
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:16,620
In this particular scandal scandal broke
in 1875 there were about 150 people

573
00:41:19,301 --> 00:41:21,310
indicted in the liquor business.

574
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:24,400
About 85 people indicted
in the federal government.

575
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,980
There were 110 convictions,

576
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,360
although nobody served
terribly long in any prison.

577
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:36,850
And thirdly,
there's this thing called credit Moby lay.

578
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:43,070
This was the company that was first
chartered in 1859 as part of it was,

579
00:41:44,011 --> 00:41:47,190
it was the finance company
for the Pennsylvania.

580
00:41:47,191 --> 00:41:49,500
It was called the
Pennsylvania fiscal agency.

581
00:41:49,501 --> 00:41:54,501
Originally it was the finance company
for the Union Pacific railroad that got

582
00:41:54,751 --> 00:41:59,130
the greatest contract in American history
to build a transcontinental railroad.

583
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:04,920
The Union Pacific had a charter from the
federal government to build this great

584
00:42:04,921 --> 00:42:06,150
railroad to the Pacific,

585
00:42:06,151 --> 00:42:10,470
or possibly two or three of them
for each mile of track built.

586
00:42:10,471 --> 00:42:15,471
The Union Pacific was to receive 10
sections of public land and from 16,000 to

587
00:42:16,591 --> 00:42:21,300
$48,000 depending on how difficult
the terrain was to build on.

588
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,480
Yeah,

589
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:28,260
Union Pacific arranged the construction
contracts with its own from the wood

590
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:30,500
that had called credit Moby lay,

591
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:35,620
so that all government money
would get spent. You know,

592
00:42:35,621 --> 00:42:36,940
the old routine,
if you get a grant,

593
00:42:36,941 --> 00:42:38,620
make sure you spend it because
they won't give you as much.

594
00:42:38,621 --> 00:42:43,621
Next time credit Moby lay and therefore
union Pacific made enormous profits.

595
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:49,120
The shares of stock and credit
and Moby lay skyrocketed.

596
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:54,010
And to keep the federal government in
line and to let this continue to go on

597
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:58,020
many congressmen,
we never know.

598
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:03,050
We'll never know exactly how many were
on the take with simply being bribed and

599
00:43:05,071 --> 00:43:06,240
old fashion.

600
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,440
Handfuls of cash by the Union Pacific.

601
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:16,610
This scandal to broke in 1873
all kinds of people were accused,

602
00:43:17,371 --> 00:43:18,800
including vice president Schuler.

603
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:23,810
Colfax Congress
reprimanded one government,

604
00:43:23,911 --> 00:43:28,911
railroad agent and two Congressmen
and then just left it alone.

605
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,440
Uh,
so far as I know,

606
00:43:31,441 --> 00:43:36,441
no one's ever really put a price tag on
the graph committed by the Union Pacific

607
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,980
and the credit Moby lake case.

608
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,190
This kind of spoils men economic,

609
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:49,370
financial corruption became rampant
in the grant years and again,

610
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:58,350
a huge political distraction away
from the issues of the south.

611
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:01,980
The issues of the Freedman,
the issues of reconstruction,

612
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,420
the other major paths to

613
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:13,890
southern redemption,
the success of this,

614
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:18,930
the white southern Democratic Party
was of course the uses of violence.

615
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:24,810
But before I give you a little more
litany and the level of clan terrorism,

616
00:44:24,911 --> 00:44:29,620
think with me for just a moment.
What those radical Republicans originally,

617
00:44:29,621 --> 00:44:31,860
almost none of whom are
really in power anymore.

618
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:36,930
That is Stevens died in 1869 Charles
Sumner dies in 1874 Benjamin wait is long

619
00:44:37,501 --> 00:44:39,810
gone as a senator from Ohio,

620
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:44,850
the old leadership of the radicals is
really no longer there by 1874 when the

621
00:44:44,851 --> 00:44:47,520
Democrats are going to throw the
Republicans out of the leadership of the

622
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:48,420
congress.
Anyway,

623
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:53,190
the thing with me for just a moment
back to what phone are called the the

624
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:58,050
radicals civic vision.
That civic vision again,

625
00:44:58,051 --> 00:45:00,750
was rooted in Free Soil Ism,

626
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:06,230
unionism winning the war and
to some an anti and an ending,

627
00:45:07,441 --> 00:45:12,390
slavery, emancipation, and then two at
least the beginnings of racial equality.

628
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:17,190
You cannot mistake that they believed in
at least the beginnings of that in the

629
00:45:17,191 --> 00:45:19,200
13th 14th and 15th amendments,

630
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,730
but think for a moment
in the 19th century,

631
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:29,460
how would most Americans think
about the idea of equality?

632
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:34,680
I would argue that in our history,

633
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:40,460
this nation in the modern
world that probably tried
to do more about the ID of a

634
00:45:41,101 --> 00:45:45,450
quality than perhaps any place else
has gone through three definitions of a

635
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:48,540
quality.
The first,

636
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:53,541
we might simply call a quality in
the eyes of God or natural rights.

637
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:58,170
The old enlightenment,
it's not from the inlet,

638
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,290
just from the alerts in the
epistles of Paul. It's, it's,

639
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:01,350
it's ancient in some ways,

640
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:05,790
but the idea that somehow you're
a born equal before God or nature,

641
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:09,690
well,
you have a natural capacity that's equal.

642
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,580
It doesn't say anything about human
affairs and understanding about government

643
00:46:14,581 --> 00:46:19,320
or law.
The second kind of equality,

644
00:46:19,321 --> 00:46:20,490
and it came into history.

645
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:21,843
Okay,

646
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:27,470
is it quality before law
that was never codified,

647
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:31,490
never spoken until the 14th amendment.

648
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:35,960
The equal protection of the law.

649
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:37,630
Okay?

650
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:42,520
That's where it begins. If there's a
third kind of equality in our history,

651
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:46,630
it's probably what we came
to Carl and the 20th century,

652
00:46:46,631 --> 00:46:51,631
and especially in the civil rights
revolution in its wake and equality of

653
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:56,410
opportunity
in the 19th century.

654
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:58,840
Trust,
they never got to that one

655
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:04,260
and they didn't get terribly
far with the quality before law.

656
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:09,660
The radical Republicans
ideas we're up against.

657
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,580
And here you can just give up and say,
well,

658
00:47:11,581 --> 00:47:15,570
you see what we tried to go too far too
fast. They were ahead of their times.

659
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,840
Gee Whiz, reconstruction failed.
Maybe it should have failed.

660
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,100
Can't do anything about it.

661
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:24,930
So be it how the lights went out for
75 or 80 years. But that's, you know,

662
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,160
some things are inevitable in history
if you're comfortable with that,

663
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:33,620
uh,
fine.

664
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:41,530
But the radical Republican analogy
at least set in motion a tradition.

665
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,610
The problem was they got
cornered themselves in,

666
00:47:45,611 --> 00:47:50,030
they'll by their own language because
the language they got cornered by was the

667
00:47:50,031 --> 00:47:52,940
language of guaranteed rights.

668
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:56,320
If you've guaranteed somebody,
uh,

669
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:00,350
beginnings of a quality in law,
what else is there to do?

670
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:04,090
If you and I are equal before the law,

671
00:48:04,091 --> 00:48:08,470
at least the law says we're equal before
the law, what else can government do?

672
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:14,140
But the radical Republicans
in reconstruction launched
that question into our

673
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:17,140
history. Has No one ever had,
would have governments, old people,

674
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,190
and what do people,
governments,

675
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,710
the trouble of course was that
on the ground in the south,

676
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:27,370
the Klan and all of its imitators,

677
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:30,310
okay,

678
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:33,640
we're winning reconstruction by terror,

679
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,440
by political violence,
um, by intimidation.

680
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:45,010
Now you've read about the Klan. I've
given you a statistics on Klan violence,

681
00:48:45,011 --> 00:48:47,770
especially in 1868 up through 1871,

682
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,360
but it was the first grant administration
and we've got to give grant credit for

683
00:48:52,361 --> 00:48:54,610
this. And Henry, Adam should
have at least four out of this.

684
00:48:54,611 --> 00:48:56,470
When he wrote that godawful passage,

685
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:02,460
the grant administration did act
in 1870 and 71 against the claim.

686
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:08,610
May 31st,

687
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:13,170
1870 it past the so called force
act or the first enforcement act.

688
00:49:13,171 --> 00:49:17,430
It made it a federal offense to interfere
with any person's right to vote and

689
00:49:17,431 --> 00:49:21,660
made it punishable in a federal court.
That's the very law.

690
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:26,820
The Crook Shank case is going to
come along six years later and say,

691
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:31,170
no federal government can
enforce that only the state can.

692
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:36,730
It's one of those moments you want to go
back into history and just grabbed some

693
00:49:36,731 --> 00:49:39,550
people by the collar
and say, no, no, no, no.

694
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:44,560
Think of a think one more time,
but of course we can't do that.

695
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:50,770
February 28 80 71 second for sac
provided a machinery for the federal

696
00:49:50,771 --> 00:49:53,710
supervision of registration
and voting in the south.

697
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:59,580
They had at least tried and finally they
passed what was called the Ku Klux Klan

698
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,370
Act. April, 2018 71

699
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:05,500
okay.

700
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,290
It authorizes the
president to use the army

701
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:14,020
and to suspend the writ of Habeas
Corpus wherever he deemed necessary.

702
00:50:14,021 --> 00:50:15,520
If there was a state of insurrection,

703
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:20,730
which there was in South Carolina and
about 12 counties move the army and if

704
00:50:21,821 --> 00:50:26,650
necessary to protect the safety
and security of elections.

705
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:33,820
Now under this authority of these
enforcement acts and the clacks,

706
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:40,130
approximately, uh, 3000 people,

707
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:44,330
mostly white southerners were
indicted for Klan violence,

708
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,790
murder, intimidation, torture.

709
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:50,120
Thousands were arrested.

710
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:54,740
Many of those 3000 indicted pleaded
guilty and got suspended sentences.

711
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,970
About 600 were convicted,
250 acquitted,

712
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:03,020
most received fines or
light jail sentences.

713
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:08,530
65 people were in prison for up to
five years in a federal penitentiary in

714
00:51:11,031 --> 00:51:12,230
Albany,
New York.

715
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:17,740
All of them were out by 1875
before the Cruickshank case,

716
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:25,240
the thousands of people murdered
by the Klan. The thousands torture,

717
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:26,890
the thousands kept from voting.

718
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:30,430
65 people were prosecuted.

719
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:33,580
If you think back to the other day,

720
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:38,410
a quotation I asked you to keep in your
head on Frederick Douglass gives that

721
00:51:38,411 --> 00:51:43,410
speech in 1875 imagining the following
year, the bice, the centennial,

722
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:44,590
the US independence,

723
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,000
and he worries about all the Hosannas
to American patriotism and independence.

724
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:54,670
And he says,
if war among the whites

725
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,210
brought freedom to blacks,
what will peace among the whites bring?

726
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,160
It is a peace among the whites.

727
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:10,960
That was happening by 1875

728
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:13,500
okay.

729
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:18,150
On Thursday, we'll move this toward
one of the ends of reconstruction.
