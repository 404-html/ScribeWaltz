1
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,501
Good morning.

2
00:00:13,501 --> 00:00:17,670
I'm going to talk today about turning
points and on Thursday about turning

3
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:21,060
points and beyond that
probably about turning points,

4
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,580
but let me lay out right now
my own sort of selective list,

5
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:30,990
short list of the most important
turning points in the civil war.

6
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,280
Make the list and then we
will come back to them.

7
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,530
Now this is any military historians
or any civil war historians,

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,370
guests of course,
but uh,

9
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,220
there's no question that the Antietam
campaign of 1862 is a major turning point

10
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:56,730
in the civil war and I'll
select that as my first.

11
00:00:56,731 --> 00:00:59,580
There are things happening before
that that are terribly important,

12
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,540
like the saving of Richmond against
Mcclellan's peninsula campaign in June,

13
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:13,101
July of 62 but it is this first
invasion of the north by Robert E.

14
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,430
Lee culminating in the bloodiest
single day of the civil war,

15
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:19,290
over 5,000 dead,

16
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,860
23,000 casualties in eight hours on fields
along a little creek in south western

17
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:32,811
Maryland that not only stopped this first
major invasion of the north and this

18
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:38,040
threat of a southern
army to northern soil,

19
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:40,200
northern resources and northern cities.

20
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,390
But it of course resulted in
Lincoln's emancipation proclamation,

21
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,880
which transformed the purpose of
the war on both sides. Back to that,

22
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:54,420
and the second,
the second major turning point in the war,

23
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,020
militarily I'd argue as most people do,

24
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,770
was the battle of Gettysburg and July of
1863 and the day after the three day's

25
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:10,230
battle at Gettysburg,
the bloodiest encounter of the entire war.

26
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:15,231
If you add up the three days casualties
of almost 56,000 dead and wounded in

27
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,040
three days,

28
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,280
that invasion of the not that battle of
course stopped least second invasion of

29
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:26,790
the north. And we'll come to that in
a moment, at least in brief terms.

30
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,110
On the day after tickets charge
at Gettysburg on the 4th of July,

31
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,473
1863

32
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,700
the kind of citadel and river
town or city of Fredericksburg,

33
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,890
excuse me,
Vicksburg,

34
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,250
Mississippi fell to union forces
after a siege of nearly six months.

35
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,060
When grant took Vicksburg and the 4th of
July in 1863 it virtually opened up the

36
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:03,411
entire river to union control cut
geographically the confederacy in half.

37
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,630
It isolated Arkansas,
Louisiana,

38
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:13,360
and Texas from the rest
of the confederacy.

39
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,660
It was without a question at
least in long in the longterm,

40
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,520
a decisive turning point
in the war in the west.

41
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,193
Okay.

42
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:28,930
A third major turning point I'd argue
is the fall of Atlanta in September,

43
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,430
1864 and we'll come back to
that later on after the break.

44
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,680
A fourth major turning point in the
war politically without any question,

45
00:03:41,901 --> 00:03:46,901
I think is the election of 1864 the only
time in modern history that a republic

46
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,540
attempted the whole day,

47
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:55,541
general election in the midst of
civil war and succeeded in doing it.

48
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:02,410
The reelection of Lincoln in 1864 was
absolutely crucial to the prosecution of

49
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:09,161
the war to the ends is the Lincoln
administration at least by then had

50
00:04:09,411 --> 00:04:10,610
determined to fight it,

51
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,950
but without the fall of Atlanta
first week of September,

52
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,450
1864 is not at all clear.

53
00:04:17,451 --> 00:04:22,340
Lincoln would have been reelected and
more on that later. And then fifth,

54
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,093
you could argue,

55
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,840
I would argue the greatest single turning
point in the civil war deeply related

56
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:35,430
to these military battle.
Front affairs is emancipation.

57
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,100
The emancipation of 4.2 million American
slaves in the midst of eventually all

58
00:04:43,831 --> 00:04:48,831
out near total war by the north on the
south to destroy southern society and its

59
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:55,191
institutions transformed American history
more than just transforming a war.

60
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,243
Okay?

61
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:03,290
That's the theme of this lecture and
Thursday's lecture and even to some extent

62
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,124
beyond

63
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,750
it is those results beyond the battlefield
that ultimately it is our obligation

64
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:14,870
to understand.
It's important.

65
00:05:14,871 --> 00:05:18,740
It's an obligation to understand why
the battle of Antietam turned the way it

66
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:21,420
did and it's an obligation done.

67
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:26,421
Just stay on why Lee is invading the
northwest second time in 1863 and why or

68
00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:29,900
that encounter at Gettysburg
turned out the way it did,

69
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:36,080
but by then it is a war being fought
for something very different and much,

70
00:05:36,081 --> 00:05:39,080
much larger than I had been at the outset.

71
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,350
One way into this story is
a very simple quotation.

72
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:50,890
In one of those interviews held with
former slaves and the WPA oral history

73
00:05:51,471 --> 00:05:56,471
narratives in the 1930s these were the
interviews over 3000 of them done with

74
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,260
slaves. Many of them in their
eighties some even in their nineties

75
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,480
a guy named Cornelius Garner was
interviewed in 1937 at age 91

76
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,360
he was asked if he had fought in the
civil war and Cornelius replied to his

77
00:06:16,361 --> 00:06:20,440
interviewer, who was the black
interview or in this case,

78
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,550
did I fight in the war? Well, if I hadn't,

79
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,010
you wouldn't be sitting there within,

80
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,650
you wouldn't be sitting
there right in that me today.

81
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,880
He then went on to describe a
corner of his native Norfolk,

82
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:39,860
Virginia were slave auctions used
to be conducted on New Year's Day.

83
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,580
That day,
New Year's Day said,

84
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:46,760
Garner should be kept by
all the colored people.

85
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,900
That is the day of freedom and day,

86
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:56,060
and they ought to remember Frederick
Douglass to Frederick Douglass told Abe

87
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,000
Lincoln give to black man
guns and let him fight.

88
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,070
And a Blinken say,

89
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:05,270
if I give him a gun
when it come to battle,

90
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,900
he might run in Frederick Douglass
say triumph and you'll win the war.

91
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,110
And Abe said, all right, I'll try them.

92
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:22,581
Oh,

93
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:27,581
that's a simplistic homespun
explanation for emancipation came about.

94
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,840
Oh, 180,000 African Americans
will end up in the union armies.

95
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,700
But old Cornelius Cornelius
wasn't entirely wrong.

96
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:46,040
All right.
Back to Virginia in 1862,

97
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,540
I'll put the outline backup if we need it.

98
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,033
Yeah.

99
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:07,010
Uh, I don't know if you can see all of
that, but I hope you can see some of it.

100
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,420
I left you with

101
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,920
Mcclellan's army on the
peninsula having been defeated.

102
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:18,670
I thought I'd show you a couple of
magnificent Matthew Brady photographs.

103
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,640
Photography of course
finally come into its own.

104
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,340
The civil war would be the first major
event in world history to be photographed

105
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,760
on a large scale. And it's in part
what made Ken Burns film possible,

106
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,390
especially the use of that camera.
They now have the can go into an old,

107
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,051
the girl type,

108
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:40,250
which isn't any bigger than this and
make it seem like a giant panorama.

109
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:48,670
This is a photograph taken
behind union troops overlooking,

110
00:08:48,901 --> 00:08:49,734
um,

111
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:56,040
the Cumberland River and May, 1862.
That's before the, of the seven days.

112
00:08:56,041 --> 00:09:01,041
That's during the march by
Mcclellan's army up the peninsula.

113
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,400
This is this.
I don't know how well you can see that,

114
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:10,401
but that's an absolutely stunning
photograph of a union wagon train.

115
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:15,270
I one of these,
a makeshift bridges.

116
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:19,050
They would build these things in
a few hours over all these rivers,

117
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:22,470
which in May of 1862
were flooding constantly.

118
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,520
It's union troops crossing.
Um,

119
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,720
the Chickahominy river
just east to Richmond,

120
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,050
May,
1862.

121
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,510
Now what happened next of
course was in a Zuora. I left.

122
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:44,070
You was least fateful decision to
not stay in, just defend Richmond.

123
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,760
So not just leave the war in central
Virginia having defeated or held back

124
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:54,600
Mcclellan's army and with a certain
degree of confidence in McAllen probably

125
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:59,520
would be McClellan and not move.
He decided to invade the north.

126
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,750
Now other, we're a high, you know,

127
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:04,550
all these high level councils of war
and Richmond between Jefferson Davis,

128
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,490
Lee and his generals.
There are arguments for and against it.

129
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:14,690
But Lee won the day in the argument
and he went West behind the Blue Ridge

130
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:20,481
mountains and invaded the north through
the upper part of the Shenandoah valley.

131
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:27,140
The goal of which was to not
attack Washington DC by any means.

132
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,870
I think I have a better map possibly.

133
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,300
Hm.
Yeah.

134
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,360
Maybe that helps a little better not to
attack Washington or necessarily to even

135
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:44,520
threaten Philadelphia directly.

136
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:47,760
Lee had no intention of taking
over in the northern cities.

137
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:50,910
He couldn't do that in other resources,
and I'm an army big enough.

138
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:54,270
How would he have occupied them?
But what he most wanted to do,

139
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:59,271
the aim of this invasion was wanting to
take the war out of ravaged Virginia two

140
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,160
to threaten northern cities,

141
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:07,161
especially the US Capitol
three to try to bring about,

142
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:09,750
and Great Britain was
on the brink of this,

143
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:14,220
and I'll come back to that foreign
policy diplomatic story a bit later,

144
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,800
but Great Britain was truly on
the brink of near recognition,

145
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:23,280
at least a kind of quasi
recognition of the confederacy.

146
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,750
And the theory here was
that as a confederate forces
could win a major victory

147
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,570
somewhere on northern soil,
get into Pennsylvania,

148
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,890
do it twice over live off the land,

149
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,630
possibly even forced
evacuation of the US Capitol.

150
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:45,380
That news of that in Great Britain might
bring about British recognition of the

151
00:11:46,861 --> 00:11:51,861
confederacy is a legitimate government
and especially give the confederacy

152
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:54,160
access to its navy,

153
00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:00,350
if not even the possibility
of ground forces.

154
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,670
And by the way,

155
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,840
a British force had already been
sent to Canada in early 1862 for the

156
00:12:08,631 --> 00:12:13,250
possibility of intervention
in the American civil war.

157
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:14,890
Okay.

158
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,190
Now, there was also a theory here at
work that it's going to be dead wrong.

159
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:23,620
Lee believed, as did other confederate
leaders, that in Maryland in particular,

160
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,920
there was a great deal of confederate
sympathy and sentiment and a lot of young

161
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:30,101
Maryland men.

162
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:34,210
The theory was eager to
join the confederate forces
if they could just get out

163
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:39,070
of Maryland and that marching confederate
army was going to attract them.

164
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:44,110
At least that was the theory.
The problem was

165
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:52,170
when young men actually
saw that confederate army
there were appalled because

166
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:57,190
that confederate army then invaded
a across the Potomac river.

167
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,400
They cross the Potomac on September
four and September 5th 80 62 was an army

168
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:07,810
that had apparently remarkable,
almost miraculous morale.

169
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,020
They were winners.
They adjust,

170
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,440
defeated a union army with
Mcclellan's whole force,

171
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,000
whole force still back on the peninsula.

172
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,380
The 40 to 50,000 union troops
still guarding Washington DC.

173
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,790
We're decisively,

174
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:27,690
horribly defeated in the battle of second
Manasses the last two days of August

175
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,110
29th and 30th of 1862 that
union army retreated once again,

176
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,920
fought on the same fields
as first bull run, 15, uh,

177
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:40,450
of 13 months earlier retreated
in the Washington DC, Washington,

178
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:44,950
DC on September 1st,
1862 it was like a giant field hospital.

179
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,990
There were some three to 4,000 wounded
union soldiers all over the streets of

180
00:13:50,991 --> 00:13:55,340
Washington.
Broken army with Mcclellan's army.

181
00:13:55,341 --> 00:14:00,341
Now retreating back up the Chesapeake
and the Potomac and this huge flotilla

182
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,980
trying to get to Washington in case
Lee actually attacked Washington,

183
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,040
but the army Lee had was starving.

184
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,840
They weren't very well fed and
they weren't very well clad.

185
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:19,410
Here's one description of a young
Marylander who saw the confederate army.

186
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,930
He said it was nothing but quota set a
ragamuffins. It seemed as this every,

187
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:29,730
it seemed as if every cornfield and
Maryland had been robbed of a scare.

188
00:14:29,731 --> 00:14:33,520
Crow is not Hannah,
none had any underclothing.

189
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,090
My costume consisted of a
ragged pair of trousers.

190
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,120
This guy apparently join a stained
dirty jacket and old slouch hat.

191
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:46,820
The brim tend up with a thorn a bit grim.

192
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,460
The blanket over my shoulder,

193
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,070
a grease smeared cotton have
sack full of apples and corn,

194
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,770
a cartridge box full and a musket.
I was barefoot.

195
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:58,640
It it had a stone bruise on each foot.

196
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:04,370
There was no one there who would not
have been run in by the police had he

197
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,980
appeared on the streets of a normal city.

198
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,370
There's plenty of testimony in the record
that a lot of young Maryland man came

199
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:15,950
out to see this. Now,
famous army of Robert E.

200
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,950
Lee took one look or one smell is one
put it and went back to their farms.

201
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,570
Lee will get almost no real
recruits out of Maryland.

202
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:31,670
What they will do in Maryland, however, is

203
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,560
capture several hundred slaves

204
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,690
and return them or take them to Virginia.

205
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,980
They're going to do the same thing in
1863 and the Gettysburg campaign on an

206
00:15:45,981 --> 00:15:47,030
even larger scale.

207
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:53,260
Kidnapping was also part of
the confederate army's job.

208
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,520
Now the battle would not have occurred
at Antietam except for the famous,

209
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,990
and it's true. Last order.
Here's what happened.

210
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,510
Lee went into Maryland. The Union
army is all around Washington DC.

211
00:16:11,511 --> 00:16:15,140
There's really no union army
up in Maryland to stopping yet.

212
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,050
He divided his army in three parts,

213
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:23,051
three core about 20,000 roughly men
each and they were spread out around

214
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:28,790
Maryland, about 20 miles
apart over a 60 mile stretch.

215
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,740
Stonewall. Jackson's core was sent to
Harper's ferry. The other two core,

216
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,090
they were separated at least
by 20 miles in between them.

217
00:16:38,091 --> 00:16:39,530
These three parts of his army.

218
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,040
One of the cardinal rules of the old
manuals they were taught in at west point

219
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:48,760
was in the old, uh, in honorees.

220
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,020
Germany's a coat,

221
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:54,320
a military manual of conduct.

222
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:58,370
It said never divide your forces
and the presence of the enemy.

223
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,520
It's exactly what Lee had done.

224
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:06,980
The problem was that the union
command was about find out quickly,

225
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:12,850
Lee wrapped orders around three cigars
and his courier out to the three corps

226
00:17:13,191 --> 00:17:17,930
commanders over the course of
more than a day to deliver.

227
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:22,931
The orders with the orders were lost
and they were found by a private in an

228
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:27,560
Indiana regiment whose name
was BW Mitchell, the 27th,

229
00:17:27,561 --> 00:17:29,720
Indiana volunteers to be exact,

230
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,080
who picked up this bundle of three
cigars with paper wrapped around it.

231
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,890
And he read the orders and at
the bottom it said our ele.

232
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,890
And he apparently said something like,
I've heard of him.

233
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,480
And Lee was already a kind of budding
legend because of the seven days and

234
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,230
because of second Manassas.

235
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,290
And he gave it to his colonel who gave
it to his brigadier general who quickly

236
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,000
gave it to other generals.

237
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:06,590
Lincoln had little choice but
to put Mcclellan back in charge.

238
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,510
His commander at Second
Manassas had been, uh, uh,

239
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:15,690
a general named John Pope would've been
thoroughly defeated and it had a nervous

240
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,130
breakdown.
Seriously.

241
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,940
He had a mental breakdown during the
second Manassas battle and pope was out of

242
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:26,460
action to say the least, and he would
have been put out of action anyway.

243
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:32,260
It's only can put some calling back
in command in Washington DC and within

244
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,340
hours, Mcclellan was
delivered. Lee's orders.

245
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:40,350
This is though there had been a fourth
cigar from McClellan claw clothing.

246
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,360
Looked at these orders.
Um,

247
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,410
but they were discovered by the way,

248
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:50,640
on the 13th of September of
[inaudible] 62 we call them,

249
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:51,750
read them by that night.

250
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:58,250
The orders were basically to have all
parts of Lee's army concentrate rather

251
00:18:59,311 --> 00:19:04,311
slowly but concentrate toward
the area of Sharpsburg Maryland,

252
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:09,060
which is right here alone in Tetum creek.

253
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:12,600
Sharpsburg is a little town Tatum's,
a little river,

254
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:18,120
but they were to congregate there
within the next three to four days.

255
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:23,640
Mcclellan now has at his
command about 90,000 troops.

256
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,920
If he marched them quickly.

257
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,630
He had the opportunity to
defeat Lee's army in parts,

258
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,750
but Mcclellan was McClellan.

259
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:39,690
He sat on the loss daughter for about
two days before he decided whether one

260
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,110
whether to believe it
to what to do about it.

261
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:49,110
Lee quickly discovered that his orders
never reached his commanders and he

262
00:19:49,111 --> 00:19:49,800
worried.

263
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,550
He sent out new orders to concentrate
as fast as possible near Sharpsburg.

264
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:59,030
Mcallen finally moved slowly from
the camps around Washington up toward

265
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,583
Sharpsburg.

266
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,210
They encountered each other at
a place called South Mountain.

267
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:10,200
At the end of the day of
the 15th of September,

268
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,530
1862 and a battle of a
sort was fought there.

269
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:15,600
It was only a rear guard sort of thing.

270
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,970
Lee retreated out of that South Mountain
pass down into this little valley

271
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,780
around Sharpsburg Maryland,
which is just above the Potomac river.

272
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,530
And Ali was taking a tremendous risk here
because one of those other rules that

273
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:32,430
had been taught was never engage an enemy,

274
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,670
at least in full force with
a major river behind you.

275
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,550
That's exactly what happened.

276
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,890
They fought the battle of
Antietam and September 17th, 1862,

277
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,470
as I already said,
the bloody single day of the war.

278
00:20:47,471 --> 00:20:51,220
They fought and cornfields if
fought across open fields. Um,

279
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,740
they fought along a sunken road.
Uh,

280
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:59,410
they fought along a famous bridge
now known as the Burnside bridge.

281
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,440
I have a couple of
photographs to show you.

282
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,640
They fought along what's known
as the Hagger's town road,

283
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:12,630
which along which 48 hours after the
battle won a Matthew Brady's photographers

284
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:18,610
took this
awful photograph.

285
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:19,960
Okay,

286
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,770
these are confederate dead. And
along that road there are many,

287
00:21:24,771 --> 00:21:27,350
many photographs taken.
It emptied them.

288
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,750
This was another one of union dead lined
up for burial align dead probably 75

289
00:21:37,981 --> 00:21:38,940
yards long

290
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:47,780
and Tim was in no way necessarily a

291
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,100
decisive or strategic
victory for either side.

292
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,050
I want you to see this
photograph because of it's irony.

293
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,870
You've probably seen this one before.

294
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,230
At the end of the day at Antietam,

295
00:22:06,231 --> 00:22:11,120
there were about 23,000 casualties
on both sides, over 5,000 dead.

296
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:15,890
Then you may remember back on nine 11 and
the weight and the immediate aftermath

297
00:22:15,891 --> 00:22:20,891
of nine 11 the estimates were over
5,000 dead at the World Trade Center and

298
00:22:22,311 --> 00:22:27,311
people were comparing this to Antidem
as the bloodiest day of sacrifice in

299
00:22:27,591 --> 00:22:32,420
American history. It turned out not
to be the case and nevertheless,

300
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:33,680
um,

301
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,680
what happened in the wake of Antietam
was it Lee Lee's of invasion of the north

302
00:22:38,841 --> 00:22:40,130
had been stopped.

303
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:46,040
Now Mclellan missed a tremendous
opportunity to, to press the day,

304
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:51,380
and this has always been a debate among
military historians and you can read,

305
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,740
Oh God,
hundreds of pages on this if you care to.

306
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:01,010
It's always been a debate as to whether
if Mcclellan and followed this up,

307
00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:06,011
could he have literally crushed Lee's
army with the Potomac at his back and in

308
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,840
effect ended the war.

309
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,740
There's surely was that possibility,

310
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:17,741
but the the day at Antietam had been
so devastating to both forces that

311
00:23:17,781 --> 00:23:21,830
Mcclellan did not move. In
fact, he did not move for days.

312
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,140
It's also true though,

313
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:28,280
that Mcclellan kept in reserve
at Antietam and it was this act,

314
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,780
I think more than anything else.

315
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:35,420
It got Lincoln finally to go out there
by October 3rd and fire McClellan.

316
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,240
Mcclellan kept about 20,000 of
his troops in reserve at Antietam.

317
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,660
Always fearing that he was outnumbered.
He didn't use them

318
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:54,380
in a military sense at someone like
grant Bennet in charge it in Tetum.

319
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:58,880
It is entirely possible.
Lee would have been defeated

320
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,400
and at least the war in the east ended,

321
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,370
but that was not the case.

322
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,690
We retreated back into
Virginia to fight again.

323
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,770
This is a Matthew Brady
photograph taken of Lee,

324
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,260
of of Lincoln meeting with
Mcclellan Mcclellan right here.

325
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:27,050
There's also a famous photo of
them sitting in that same tent.

326
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,480
You may have seen burns
uses it in the series.

327
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:36,040
It was in this meeting that Lincoln went
out to meet with Mcclellan to urge him

328
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:37,460
to move to,

329
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:42,540
to push into northern Virginia to push
after Lee's army and early autumn or the

330
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:48,170
weather was so good and
Mcclellan did not move,

331
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,590
and a couple of days
after that he was fired

332
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:57,960
and fired for good. All on Mcclellan
will not leave history. Of course,

333
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:02,430
he will come back to be the Democratic
Party's candidate for president in 1864

334
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,750
against Abraham Lincoln.

335
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:11,050
Now it is of course in the
wake of Antietam that Lincoln
issued his emancipation

336
00:25:12,741 --> 00:25:16,940
proclamation.
Let me turn to that now and explain

337
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:24,390
why and how emancipation became

338
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,340
the new cause of the war.

339
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,793
Now

340
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,010
let's discuss Lincoln for a moment.
First,

341
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:43,370
the biggest problem with Abraham
Lincoln has always been not a,

342
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,480
that isn't how we interpret him,
treat him, understand him, use him,

343
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,320
which we do constantly.
Every president,

344
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,210
every American politician,

345
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:58,980
as David Donald once said famously in
the 1950s has to get right with Lincoln.

346
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,170
Everybody uses it.

347
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,010
We twist him all inside out and make
them say whatever we want them to say.

348
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,330
And there's no American,

349
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:10,890
no other American in our history who has
been given credit for more apocryphal

350
00:26:10,891 --> 00:26:15,660
quotations and Abraham Lincoln
a little later in the course.

351
00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:20,400
I'll use a few of them at the end of
when we get to the end of the war.

352
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:23,520
But the problem with Lincoln
is indeed his ambiguity,

353
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,300
the reality of his historical ambiguity.

354
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,880
There is a puzzling dualism about him.

355
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:33,060
There are two,

356
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:37,500
at least two seemingly
incompatible legends,

357
00:26:37,501 --> 00:26:39,180
if you want about Abraham Lincoln.

358
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:45,080
One has him as the kind of
awkward storytelling rails,

359
00:26:45,081 --> 00:26:47,220
splitting front tier folk hero,

360
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,700
everybody's favorite homespun granddaddy
with a corncob pipe who might just tell

361
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:54,060
you a little raunchy story.

362
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,493
Okay.

363
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,590
And have you chuckling?

364
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:00,630
Okay.

365
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,250
He's kind of, you know, fun.

366
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,200
Okay.

367
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,280
The other though is the towering
political genius, the moral leader,

368
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:13,260
the shaper of a nation's Destiny's
savior of the union and the great

369
00:27:13,261 --> 00:27:14,130
emancipator.

370
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,370
I ain't never quite
asked for any of those.

371
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,160
Everybody needs to claim him though.

372
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:29,250
There's a brilliant essay on this by a
historian named Scott Sandage came out

373
00:27:29,251 --> 00:27:31,890
about 10 years ago.
It's called a marble house divided.

374
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,690
It's all about the Lincoln Memorial.

375
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,450
A lot of you've probably
been to the Lincoln Memorial.

376
00:27:36,451 --> 00:27:40,080
It is America secular temple.
Everybody uses it.

377
00:27:40,081 --> 00:27:44,940
The Ku Klux Klan is held at
rallies at Lincoln's temple. Uh,

378
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,030
Martin Luther King gave the
dream speech at Lincoln's Temple.

379
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,440
It's been used by every extreme of,
of American political culture.

380
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,710
If you want to claim
the nation's attention,

381
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:00,030
go to the nations temple and
claim all day. But behind you,

382
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,460
he was never very open about himself.

383
00:28:04,461 --> 00:28:08,450
Never wrote an autobiography or didn't
write many autobiographical sentences.

384
00:28:08,451 --> 00:28:12,020
As a matter of fact,
didn't live long enough to do that.

385
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,760
He was never an abolitionist.

386
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,060
He actually had a lot of personal
contempt for radical abolitionist.

387
00:28:20,061 --> 00:28:24,980
He didn't like a lot of their arguments
and he didn't like their tactics and

388
00:28:24,981 --> 00:28:25,880
strategies.

389
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,430
He was a genius with language on.
And there's no question about that.

390
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,100
We've never had a president
who could use words,

391
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,330
who could find the music
of words like Lincoln.

392
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:46,020
He wrote every word and every sentence
of every one of his speeches and every

393
00:28:46,841 --> 00:28:51,400
one of his great public letters,
Jim Macpherson,

394
00:28:51,401 --> 00:28:54,460
every once so far as to write an article
saying how Lincoln won the war with

395
00:28:54,461 --> 00:28:55,360
metaphors.

396
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:02,190
I don't know whether a metaphor can when
you were war strongest battalions might

397
00:29:02,321 --> 00:29:06,700
be a little more important in the end.
Who knows?

398
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,540
Is he the symbol?
Oh,

399
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:16,550
a man who held back emancipation as a
white supremacist or is he the symbol of

400
00:29:18,171 --> 00:29:22,940
the man who outgrew his prejudices and
those of his time to become the amounts

401
00:29:22,941 --> 00:29:25,350
of pater.
Oh,

402
00:29:25,351 --> 00:29:30,351
was he just the shrewd politician kind
of finding the middle ground and seeing

403
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:35,190
how the wind was going to blow if you
tried this or if he threw up that balloon

404
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:36,330
or if he tried that?

405
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,103
No.

406
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,590
There are many ways to reflect on Lincoln.

407
00:29:45,591 --> 00:29:49,730
My own favorite expression about
him and thousands of these,

408
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,940
my own favorite comes from Web Dubois,

409
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:58,190
the great black scholar of the 20th
century who I think really captured all

410
00:29:58,191 --> 00:30:01,570
sides of Lincoln in one quotation.
Yeah.

411
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:06,590
This was two boys and an editorial.
He wrote in 1922 in the crisis magazine.

412
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,250
He wrote it at the time of the
unveiling of the Lincoln Memorial.

413
00:30:10,251 --> 00:30:15,251
He also wrote it at a time when he was
fed up with all of the national honoring

414
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,750
and celebration of Robert E.
Lee.

415
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,260
So it may have been that
that celebration of Lee,

416
00:30:21,261 --> 00:30:25,640
which disgusted Dubois may have had
something to do with how he wrote this

417
00:30:25,641 --> 00:30:29,990
expression about Lincoln.
This was Dubois on Lincoln quote.

418
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,780
I love him.
Not because he was perfect,

419
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:38,490
but because he was not
perfect and yet triumphed.

420
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:42,040
There was something left
so that at the crisis,

421
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:46,570
he was big enough to be inconsistent,
cruel,

422
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,330
merciful, peace, loving a fighter,

423
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:54,010
despising negroes and
letting them fight and vote,

424
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,630
protecting slavery and freeing slaves.
He was a man,

425
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,580
a big inconsistent,
brave man.

426
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,570
Okay.

427
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:11,250
I'd argue my friends that, uh, the, the
most important thing you can grasp it,

428
00:31:11,251 --> 00:31:14,850
but Abraham Lincoln is that he
had the capacity for growth.

429
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:19,500
He was big enough to be inconsistent,

430
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,220
okay.

431
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,630
Or as Emerson once put it,

432
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:26,550
consistency is the Hobgoblin
was simple minds number,

433
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,860
all that language about flip flopping.
And the 2004 election,

434
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:34,390
one of the candidates was alleged to have
been a flip flopper all the time. Well,

435
00:31:34,391 --> 00:31:36,460
if Abraham Lincoln hadn't
been a flip flopper,

436
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,450
we wouldn't have had the emancipation
proclamation. So here's the flip flopping.

437
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,910
Lincoln's early record on
slavery is interesting,

438
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:52,370
is early as 1837 he was one of only
two representatives in the Illinois

439
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:56,510
legislature to vote against the
resolution declaring the right of slave

440
00:31:56,511 --> 00:31:59,900
ownership.
He was 28 years old at that time.

441
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:01,880
Okay.

442
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,450
Is One two year term in the House
of Representatives during that term,

443
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,340
which was a Mexican war,

444
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:12,400
he found himself appall that the
slave trade district of Columbia,

445
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,730
you could go visit slave auctions.
As I said before, I think two,

446
00:32:15,731 --> 00:32:20,060
three blocks down the street
from the capitol. He called
that slave market quota,

447
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,690
sort of Negro lived livery stable.

448
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,990
We're droves of Negroes
are collected temporarily.

449
00:32:25,991 --> 00:32:30,310
Captain finally taken to southern
markets precisely like droves of horses.

450
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,550
Okay.

451
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,390
He also sat during that same term.
If the Negro is a man,

452
00:32:36,391 --> 00:32:41,391
why then my ancient faith teaches me
that all men are created equal and that

453
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:46,070
there can be no moral rights in
connection with one man's making,

454
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,200
a slave of another.

455
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,650
Yeah.

456
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:53,980
At the same time,
Lincoln though was a Henry Clay wig.

457
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:01,510
He was a supporter of the compromise
of 1850 he believed in compensation,

458
00:33:02,151 --> 00:33:03,980
the slave owners as a way,

459
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:07,340
a hope of setting up some kind
of gradual emancipation plan

460
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,860
and he believed as Henry Clay
had founded it and this idea,

461
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:15,120
at least he did for a while.

462
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:20,150
This idea of colonization
of sending blacks either to
Africa or to the Caribbean

463
00:33:22,021 --> 00:33:23,430
or to Central America.

464
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:29,070
I don't have time to stop on the those
fabulous Lincoln Douglas debates where

465
00:33:29,071 --> 00:33:33,090
you can find every extreme of Abraham
Lincoln. I was once given an assignment,

466
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:37,080
you know, junior seminars
and undergraduate, oh,

467
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:40,620
Fred Williams at Michigan state sent us
to the Lincoln collected papers and he

468
00:33:40,621 --> 00:33:40,861
said,

469
00:33:40,861 --> 00:33:45,861
your assignment is to come back with one
passage demonstrating that Lincoln was

470
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:51,970
antislavery on believing in emancipation
and come back with one passage.

471
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,970
Just showing that he
was a white supremacist,

472
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:01,540
not growing up a Lincoln
lover. And I thought, oh dear,

473
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:07,000
that's like, you know, you've been raised
in a certain religion and somebody says,

474
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,390
go read the Bhagavad Gita or you know,

475
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:15,130
read the Koran or study
Buddhism for Awhile.

476
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,960
I did that too for a while.
I didn't learn much. But,

477
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:27,240
and sure enough, you find all of those
extremes in the Lincoln Douglas debates.

478
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:33,680
We also know of course that he was a
free soiler and he's most famous in the

479
00:34:33,721 --> 00:34:34,501
south of course,

480
00:34:34,501 --> 00:34:38,400
for that language of putting slave around
a course of ultimate extinction in a

481
00:34:38,401 --> 00:34:43,260
house divided speech and elsewhere.
But once the war came,

482
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,210
yeah,

483
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:50,210
the imperative about what to do about
slavery was a huge indelicate and terrible

484
00:34:51,391 --> 00:34:52,620
political question.

485
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,810
And this is the link and that
will be forever debate it.

486
00:34:56,811 --> 00:34:58,370
And there'll be debated next year like,

487
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:02,780
like it's never been debated cause it's
the bicentennial, it was birth next year.

488
00:35:02,781 --> 00:35:03,770
And as I've warned you,

489
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,830
it will be raining Lincoln books
and you will have to dodge them

490
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:07,903
next year

491
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,880
now after the war broke out.

492
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:15,320
Yeah,

493
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,860
immediately. Some slaves began
to come in to union lines,

494
00:35:18,861 --> 00:35:21,710
the first word this a,
a Ford and Florida.

495
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:23,510
Okay.

496
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:26,690
And then as early as May,
1861,

497
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:30,890
some slaves began to come in
to union lines, handfuls, uh,

498
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:35,490
near Fortress Monroe in Virginia.
And there was a union command,

499
00:35:35,491 --> 00:35:37,250
or they're a political general,

500
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:42,830
a former Democrat before the war and
anything but an abolition is Benjamin F.

501
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:48,000
Butler, who never the loss
will. Nevertheless, when the
slaves came into his lines,

502
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,770
he realized, no, wait a sec,

503
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,930
the confederates are over
there using these people to
build their fortifications.

504
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:58,740
Maybe we could use them to
bill are fortifications.

505
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:04,260
So why don't we confiscate
them and him contraband of war,

506
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:10,600
their property under law call contraband
and the name stuck of course know that

507
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:17,270
name will end up in poetry and
song and even in the law or to

508
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,270
contraband property.

509
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:21,740
Okay.

510
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:26,740
But at the outset of the war
in the summer of 61 fall,

511
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:30,080
winter 61 62 into the spring of 62,

512
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,090
the first year of the war,

513
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,480
the official policy of the
Lincoln Administration and
of the Union forces across

514
00:36:37,731 --> 00:36:42,080
the land, the official policy
was called denial of asylum.

515
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:48,320
It meant that any slave who
escaped into union lines,

516
00:36:48,321 --> 00:36:53,321
the officer in charge and command of that
unit have the responsibility to return

517
00:36:54,591 --> 00:36:59,120
that slave to his owner.
If the owner,

518
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,830
this was the impossible kicker,
if the owner was loyal to the union,

519
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,660
if that owner was not loyal to the union,

520
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:11,180
it was in the confederate
army or something, then yes,

521
00:37:11,181 --> 00:37:14,330
you could admit that slave to
your lines as contraband of war.

522
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,833
No,
of course.

523
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:21,310
If this had only been a trickle of people
here and they're coming in to union

524
00:37:21,311 --> 00:37:25,510
lines, possibly this could be
enforced, but it wasn't enforceable.

525
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:30,730
How's that union command are going to
go out and figure out, uh, Hey, uh,

526
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:36,940
Mr. Enslaved person is your own
or loyal or disloyal to the union,

527
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,590
that slave, it's probably going to say
he's a confederate. What do you think?

528
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,900
Of course,
most were.

529
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:50,323
Now,

530
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:56,050
Congress took the lead before Lincoln
ever wrote an emancipation proclamation.

531
00:37:56,051 --> 00:37:58,990
Although Lincoln was thinking
about this and working on this,

532
00:37:58,991 --> 00:38:03,190
all through that summer of
1862 congress took the lead.

533
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:08,680
Now this was a congress. Remember that
is now dominated by the Republican Party.

534
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:12,550
You got an 11 southern states out of
the union. They don't have any centers.

535
00:38:12,551 --> 00:38:14,440
I don't have any. I remember is
in the House of Representatives.

536
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:19,270
This is a northern Republican majority,
a significant majority.

537
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,380
Now they're going to run into
trouble in the, in the fall,

538
00:38:23,381 --> 00:38:26,650
congressional elections of 1862 and
they're gonna lose some of those seats

539
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,570
because of what they're doing.
Now,

540
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:34,950
Congress took the lead pastor an article
of war in March of 1862 which said,

541
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,930
fugitive slaves must be
admitted to union camps.

542
00:38:37,931 --> 00:38:41,470
It didn't say what their status would be.
It didn't define anybody.

543
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:46,090
I left illegal status vague. It
just said, any escaped slave,

544
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:47,440
Masa now be admitted.
Now,

545
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:51,820
the reason they did that is because
this denial of asylum policy had caused

546
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:56,110
chaos and a lot of union units.
Brief example.

547
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:00,100
Remember this guy, Charles Brewster,
whose letters I read from the other day,

548
00:39:00,101 --> 00:39:04,840
this guy from Massachusetts, his
letters I edited and so on. Well,

549
00:39:04,841 --> 00:39:08,770
Charley Brewster, this racist
from North Hampton, Massachusetts,

550
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:12,310
28 years old by now.
Nevertheless,

551
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:18,030
in late fall of 1861 he took a runaway
slave who was 17 years old and named

552
00:39:20,681 --> 00:39:24,220
David into his, uh,

553
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:28,900
personal care.
He made him his personal servant.

554
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:31,450
This is after Brewster.
God has commissioned as an officer.

555
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:35,560
He even wrote home to
his sister several times,

556
00:39:35,561 --> 00:39:39,430
asking the sister to send stocking
caps, socks, and old pair of pants.

557
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:43,360
He even named the shirts that
he wanted to put on his David.

558
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,940
It was as though he was dressing him.

559
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:53,550
And Brewster was a determined never
to send that kid back to slavery.

560
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:58,500
But down came the orders by January,
early February,

561
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:03,500
1862 that all fugitive slaves within
their camps must be returned to their

562
00:40:04,561 --> 00:40:07,890
owners if those owners came to
the union lines to retrieve them.

563
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,080
And the future of named David had
his owner waiting at the camp.

564
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,770
There was a near mutiny
and the 10th Massachusetts,

565
00:40:16,771 --> 00:40:21,000
which was Brewster's regimen between
those soldiers who wanted to protect these

566
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:24,810
fugitive slaves and free them
in effect and those who did not,

567
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,750
and that's the one on in
hundreds of regiments.

568
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,820
Brewster's Brewster was threatened with
court martial and being run out of the

569
00:40:32,821 --> 00:40:35,400
army if he didn't give
back this fugitive slave.

570
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:38,310
His compromise was it.

571
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:42,060
He took it as this young David out into
the woods and he said, get Outta here,

572
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,240
run.
I'll just tell him you ran away,

573
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,450
and that's what he did.

574
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:55,630
By that Spring, Congress decided any
fugitive slave was sketch to union lines.

575
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:56,770
It must be accepted.

576
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:02,850
In April of 1862 congress
on the 16th of April,

577
00:41:02,851 --> 00:41:05,400
and this was a very significant law.

578
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:10,020
They passed abolition, the end of
slavery and the District of Columbia.

579
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:17,750
They gave $300 per slave and compensation
to those owners of slaves in the

580
00:41:18,901 --> 00:41:19,734
district.

581
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:24,860
The district of Columbia
in 1862 had 3,100 slaves.

582
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,133
They also put,

583
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:39,010
I think the figure was about $300,000
in that bill where they provided for the

584
00:41:40,881 --> 00:41:45,881
possible colonization of blacks
voluntarily to foreign countries.

585
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,990
As a result of emancipation,

586
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,530
a policy of the Lincoln
administration now was supporting.

587
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,593
Okay.

588
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,000
Then third and June,

589
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:02,020
in June of 62 congress by majority vote
sort of through a great deal of American

590
00:42:06,021 --> 00:42:07,610
history on the dust heap,

591
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:11,690
and they abolished slavery forever
and the Western territories,

592
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:17,890
arguably the single most important cause
of the civil war stroke of the pen.

593
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:23,150
In June of 62 they ended slavery in
spite of the dred Scott decision.

594
00:42:23,151 --> 00:42:26,300
Now remember what the dred Scott decision
had said here was congress passing a

595
00:42:26,301 --> 00:42:30,050
law in direct opposition to
a supreme court decision.

596
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:37,750
That's an argument for not having
too many civil wars, you see,

597
00:42:37,751 --> 00:42:41,470
because Congress might end up doing
anything in the midst of the civil war and

598
00:42:41,471 --> 00:42:42,610
they surely did here.

599
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:47,410
And then finally on July 17th,
1862

600
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:52,210
congress passed what was called
the second confiscation act.

601
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:57,750
There'd been a first confiscation act
pass back in August of 61 even in the

602
00:42:58,241 --> 00:43:00,100
first confiscation. I can. By the way,

603
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:05,120
these were acts authorizing union forces
to confiscate confederate property.

604
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:11,200
Even in the first re confiscation act
back in August of [inaudible] 61 slaves

605
00:43:11,201 --> 00:43:15,850
were mentioned as property.
They're status was still very vague,

606
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:18,100
but in the second confiscation act,

607
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:23,610
July 62 the law explicitly
freed slaves of all persons,

608
00:43:24,191 --> 00:43:27,340
quote in rebellion anywhere,

609
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:31,480
any slave of anyone
supporting the confederacy.

610
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:35,380
It did everything. The emancipation
proclamation will later do,

611
00:43:35,381 --> 00:43:40,381
and then soon it was in some ways more
extensive because it included all parts

612
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:45,880
of the south, including
those border states that did
not seceded from the union.

613
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,513
Now,

614
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:54,770
well, Congress already having done
these things by July of 62 by the way,

615
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:59,650
this is all during the peninsula campaign
down in Virginia.

616
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:04,450
Second confiscation act was passed in
the immediate wake of the seven days

617
00:44:04,451 --> 00:44:05,284
battle.

618
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:11,340
Lee is deciding to
invade the North Lincoln.

619
00:44:11,451 --> 00:44:15,090
As you may know the story, if you've
read team of rivals by Doris Goodwin,

620
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,750
you know it would hang
out at the war department.

621
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:22,130
He'd go there for some solitude.
He had private little office there.

622
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:26,960
He began to draft an emancipation
proclamation as a legal brief,

623
00:44:26,961 --> 00:44:30,740
a legal document. He kept it in a locked
door, have a desk at the war department.

624
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:33,960
Supposedly there was one or
two guards that knew about it,

625
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,210
not sure about that,

626
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,580
but he was beginning to draft
an emancipation proclamation
probably as early as

627
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:44,160
June,
certainly by July of 62

628
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:46,630
yeah,

629
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:48,730
the pressure now monitor
from every direction.

630
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:55,640
He's secretly held meetings with the
delegation of Delaware and a delegation

631
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:03,321
from Kentucky trying to convince them
to institute gradual emancipation plans

632
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:07,380
over time with compensation
to slave owners that would,

633
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:10,560
that would free slaves
over a 35 year period.

634
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:13,820
This was Lincoln, the gradual, this,

635
00:45:13,821 --> 00:45:18,670
this was Lincoln trying to condition
public opinion, Delaware. At that point,

636
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:22,950
I only had 1800 slaves were far more
slaves in the district of Columbia.

637
00:45:22,951 --> 00:45:24,130
Then the war and all of Delaware,

638
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:28,480
but the Delaware delegation that came
to the White House to meet with Lincoln

639
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,030
told him unequivocally no,

640
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:37,230
they weren't going to touch
slavery for fear of what it might

641
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,163
ignite.

642
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:45,140
Lincoln waited and waited.

643
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:48,830
He was attacked by Horace Greeley and
the New York Herald Tribune. As you know,

644
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,180
read the famous Greeley letter
and the Johnson collection.

645
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:57,980
This is the famous passage in August
of 62 or Lincoln said, I will free the,

646
00:45:57,981 --> 00:46:00,230
I will save the union by
freeing all the slaves,

647
00:46:00,231 --> 00:46:03,050
or I will save the union by
freeing none of the slaves.

648
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,590
My aim in the end is to say that,
yeah,

649
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:10,550
but read that entire letter.
Not just that quote.

650
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,020
I'm going to leave that to you.

651
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:17,390
Read the entire letter because he's
actually honest on both sides of the

652
00:46:17,391 --> 00:46:18,224
semicolon.

653
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:25,150
Look for his semi colon
and judge both sides.

654
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:29,560
He's a crafty cat.
You got to read them closely.

655
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:34,510
Lincoln needed a battlefield victory.

656
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:39,630
He needed some kind of battlefield
success and he gets that of course,

657
00:46:40,091 --> 00:46:44,650
with Antidem
in the wake of Antietam,

658
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:46,140
five days afterward,

659
00:46:46,141 --> 00:46:51,141
22nd September 62 Lincoln issued the
preliminary emancipation proclamation

660
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:57,450
that preliminary emancipation proclamation
said that slaves in the United States,

661
00:46:57,451 --> 00:47:01,800
in the states, in
rebellion would be freed.

662
00:47:01,801 --> 00:47:03,240
On January 1st

663
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,840
there was a carrot and a stick.

664
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:11,340
The stick was emancipation and conquest.

665
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:16,710
If the union forces could ever do it,
and the carrot was in effect,

666
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:21,510
he invited the confederate states to
throw down their arms, give up the war,

667
00:47:21,511 --> 00:47:26,310
come back to the union
by January 1st

668
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,250
they're not going to it of course,
but

669
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:35,430
he was hoping or was he hoping?
Yeah.

670
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:39,220
I'm going to leave you with this.
Back in Virginia

671
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:45,220
was a young slave, 22 years old.
His name was John Washington.

672
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,550
He'd grown up in Fredericksburg.
Virginia had a white father.

673
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:54,300
I mean he never knew.
A slave mother named Sarah.

674
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:59,640
She taught him to read and write. He grows
up in urban slave with lots of skills,

675
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:02,490
highly valued,
probably a brilliant young man.

676
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:07,110
You gotta hire it out five times in the
late 1850s in the first year of the war,

677
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:12,370
he married his sweetheart and January,

678
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:14,980
1862 in the African Baptist
church in Fredericksburg,

679
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,990
and he chose his moment of escape at the
first appearance of union forces along

680
00:48:21,991 --> 00:48:26,330
the Rappahannock river in
Fredericksburg on the 16th excuse me,

681
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:28,590
the 18th of April,
1862

682
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:33,400
he left a narrative that he wrote
after the war that I had the great,

683
00:48:33,401 --> 00:48:36,910
good fortune to have lopped in my lap
and have recently published a book about

684
00:48:36,911 --> 00:48:41,130
it.
And in that narrative,

685
00:48:41,131 --> 00:48:45,030
he tells this remarkable story
of the day of his escape.

686
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:49,950
He even drew a map of Fredericksburg
of the day of his escape,

687
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:55,310
including a glossary of 16 sites and
buildings and crossroads on that map as

688
00:48:55,741 --> 00:48:59,730
though he wanted the world to
see as well as hear his story.

689
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,340
And John tells the story.
He's 22 years old.

690
00:49:03,341 --> 00:49:08,140
He tells a story of all the white
people evacuating Fredericksburg and his

691
00:49:08,141 --> 00:49:12,430
mistress. Mrs Talavera is literally
packing her China and her silver,

692
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,040
and she says, one day, now,
Johnny, you'll be with us tomorrow.

693
00:49:15,041 --> 00:49:18,580
You'll be with us tomorrow. She's assuming
his loyalty. And he said, yes, Mrs. Yes,

694
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:19,780
Mrs. I'll be with you tomorrow.

695
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:25,600
And then his next scene is he's at a
hotel where he's been hired out as a

696
00:49:25,601 --> 00:49:28,390
steward,
almost like an assistant manager.

697
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:32,840
Can you describe all the white people
fleeing the hotel and fleeing the streets

698
00:49:32,841 --> 00:49:33,770
of Fredericksburg.

699
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:38,000
And he says he took the 12 workers up on
the roof of the hotel and the hotel was

700
00:49:38,001 --> 00:49:39,830
called the Shakespeare.
I kid you not,

701
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:44,450
he takes all the black workers up on the
roof of the hotel where they could see

702
00:49:44,451 --> 00:49:48,920
across the river and see what he called
the gleam of the Yankees bandits.

703
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:53,690
And then he brought them all back down
into the kitchen and he poured a round of

704
00:49:53,691 --> 00:49:54,524
drinks

705
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:01,130
and he held a toast and the
toast was to the Yankees.

706
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:06,940
And he instructed his fellow workers,
he said to get out of there,

707
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,090
but he said,
don't get too far from the Yankees.

708
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,780
And then John Larson and walk
two blocks down to the river.

709
00:50:13,781 --> 00:50:16,480
He witnessed the formal
surrender of Fredericksburg.

710
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,540
He saw the bridges being burned
by the confederate forces.

711
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:24,500
And he walked one mile up river and he
said he crossed the river at Ficklin,

712
00:50:24,501 --> 00:50:28,040
his mill and the old stone
ruins of Miller is still there,

713
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:31,940
so I know exactly where he crossed
the river. He got into a rowboat.

714
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:37,270
He crossed and that night he slept in
the camp of the 30th New York volunteers,

715
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,180
a captain in that regiment named Ladd,

716
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:44,960
l a d d formerly freedom.
He said,

717
00:50:44,961 --> 00:50:49,961
based on the law that had just been
passed by Congress 48 hours earlier in

718
00:50:50,451 --> 00:50:53,780
Washington, freeing the slaves
in the district of Columbia.

719
00:50:56,190 --> 00:51:01,190
John Washington spent the rest of that
summer as a campaign and a guide for the

720
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:05,100
Union army all the way
through second Manassas.

721
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:10,170
He dated his arrival in Washington
DC as part of the first great wave of

722
00:51:10,171 --> 00:51:13,680
Friedman into the capitol as September 1st

723
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:19,830
and by the following year I found him
in a city directory record living at his

724
00:51:19,831 --> 00:51:24,780
first address on 19th street
in Washington. He had his wife,

725
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:26,400
his newborn child,

726
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:31,230
his mother and his 68 year old
grandmother living there with him

727
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:39,020
apart from beneath next to underneath
this great military and political story.

728
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:45,270
Now thousands upon thousands
of John Washington's.

729
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:47,520
We're freeing themselves.
