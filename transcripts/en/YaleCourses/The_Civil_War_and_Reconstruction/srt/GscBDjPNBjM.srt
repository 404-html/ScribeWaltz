1
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:18,580
Faster than might seem appropriate
and faster than I wish.

2
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,313
We've

3
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,850
come to the succession crisis.

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,780
I wish we had another week to three weeks,

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,753
but we don't

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,993
martyrdom.

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,640
What does a martyr term we hear
all over the place now there are

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,220
martyrs of this cause and
martyrs of that cause.

9
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,610
John Brown was a martyr.

10
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,263
Yeah.

11
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,980
The most important thing about John Brown
is I tried to say the other day and I

12
00:00:59,981 --> 00:01:04,630
want to conclude with
several comments about that.

13
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:05,464
Now

14
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,390
he's in how he died and in
the aftermath of his death.

15
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,410
United States was a Christian country.

16
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,760
Europe was essentially a
Christian civilization.

17
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:25,140
John Brown would be filtered through
a Christian imagination either way,

18
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:33,990
whether people came to admire and sort
of agonizingly love him or agonizingly

19
00:01:37,121 --> 00:01:37,954
hate him.

20
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,590
John Brown's raid on Harper's ferry was
all his own, said Frederick Douglass.

21
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:51,210
His zeal in the cause of freedom
was infinitely superior to mine.

22
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,790
Mine was a taper light.
His was the burning sun.

23
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,910
Mine was bounded by time.

24
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:05,380
His stretched away to the
silent shores of eternity.

25
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,470
I could speak for the slave.

26
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,830
John Brown could fight for the slave.

27
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,930
I could live for the slave.
John Brown could die for the slave.

28
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,880
There's a clarity and that among the
many you logistic statements about John

29
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,810
Brown and the many of the
Frederick Douglass himself.

30
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:33,811
May Douglas you'll remember had great
ambivalence about this man and chose not

31
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:37,750
to join him on the rate at Harper's ferry.

32
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,970
I Brown was captured in the raid.
Raid only lasted 48 hours.

33
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:47,950
It was in some ways the
military strategic blunder.

34
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,000
He was taken to a jail,
a four miles from Harper's ferry,

35
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,910
Charles Town Virginia,
now West Virginia,

36
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,600
and he would reside there
for about the next six weeks,

37
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,473
six

38
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,910
in that period,
he would be put on trial

39
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,250
and the most celebrated trial.
To that point in American history,

40
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,400
there were three charges,
all of which were punishable by death,

41
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:24,080
at least in Virginia,
treason against the United States.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,550
It was considered treason
to attack a federal arsenal.

43
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,460
I suppose it's still would be,
although

44
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,100
we don't try too many
people for treason anymore

45
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,500
to inciting a slave insurrection.

46
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,890
Pretty serious crime and Virginia
and third from Mara for murder.

47
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:48,600
Okay.

48
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,090
Trial began on the 27th of October.

49
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,640
It lasted three and a half days.

50
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,360
State of Virginia famously tried to
provide a lawyer for John Brown and Brown

51
00:03:59,551 --> 00:04:02,940
refused that states supplied lawyer.

52
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,910
He laid on a cot because of his injuries
and his wounds and the courtroom,

53
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:15,260
this would be drawn and put it up in
lithographs and pictures all over the

54
00:04:17,461 --> 00:04:18,294
country.

55
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,150
He was eventually defended in
court by three northerners,

56
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,400
uh,
lawyers who came down to help

57
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,720
closing arguments for the 31st of October,

58
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,970
the jury deliberated 45 minutes,

59
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:40,140
returned a verdict of guilty on all three
counts and it was announced he would

60
00:04:40,141 --> 00:04:45,141
be hung a about a month
later on December 2nd,

61
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,653
1859

62
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,770
from November 2nd to
December 2nd that one month,

63
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,130
November 2nd was the last day in
court where they sentenced him.

64
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:02,170
Okay.

65
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,790
He had one month in jail.

66
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,980
He apparently went over as a jailer who
found John Brown and one of the most

67
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:10,870
fascinating characters you'd ever seen.

68
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,240
People came from the north and we're
allowed to visit him, including his wife

69
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,601
from jail.

70
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:23,601
He wrote approximately 100 letters
all over the country to newspapers,

71
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,740
to editors, to magazines,
to members of his family,

72
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:32,880
particularly to his wife.
He was writing his own epitaph.

73
00:05:32,881 --> 00:05:37,440
He was creating his own romantic legend.
He was arguing his own case.

74
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,930
He, of course, had pled innocent.

75
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,393
Okay.

76
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,690
Are many of those letters.

77
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,380
I had the great privilege to read a
whole batch of the originals once,

78
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,340
how's did of all places,
the Pennsylvania historical society.

79
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,740
He wrote this one to his wife,

80
00:05:55,741 --> 00:06:00,741
which may be indicative of Brown's vision
of his own ax and a vision that was

81
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:07,031
now going to stick in some
ways in poetry and in song.

82
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,910
I have been whipped,
he wrote to his wife as the saying goes,

83
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,610
but I'm sure I can recover all the last
capital occasioned by that disaster by

84
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,550
only hanging a few minutes by the neck.

85
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:28,180
And I feel quite determined to make
the utmost possible out of my defeat.

86
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,800
Uh, I love you dear, but
I can't wait to hang.

87
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,083
Okay,

88
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,680
John Brown,

89
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,450
it was a troubled man. He was morbid
man. He was an old testament man,

90
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,440
but he probably was not crazy as
so many people said at the time,

91
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,640
people have said,
ever since

92
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,920
is altruism on behalf of black
people was not utterly selfless,

93
00:07:02,921 --> 00:07:05,170
but he was an extraordinary example

94
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:11,320
of an American or white
American, uh, who, uh,

95
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,840
put his money where his mouth was.
He didn't have any money,

96
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:19,590
but his life for his mouth was
and took it into the south.

97
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,190
Now he was executed,

98
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,540
hung out in a field outside
of Charlestown, Virginia,

99
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,370
guarded by some 3000 American troops.

100
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,950
Um, there were all kinds of fears of
attempts to break him out and season by

101
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:40,660
northern Yankee bands.

102
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,040
There were all kinds of threats
of escape plans in the newspapers.

103
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:49,390
And by the way, one of the most startling
things about the John Brown story,

104
00:07:49,391 --> 00:07:54,391
once it broke and had never been a
sensation quite like this in American

105
00:07:54,761 --> 00:07:55,720
newspapers,

106
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,390
here was the south oldest greatest,

107
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:06,450
worst fear and abolitionists from the
north with a band of men and a bunch of

108
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:11,470
weapons invading the south and
trying to incite slave insurrection.

109
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,710
They'd been kind of
predicting this all along.

110
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:22,030
Oh and behold it happened in a trunk of
stuff back at the farm in Maryland that

111
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:27,580
he had rented for several months whereas
men had gathered after his capture.

112
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,550
Yeah,

113
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:35,410
it was found a whole
stash of letters and maps.

114
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:39,250
The old man had kept all
kinds of maps of the south.

115
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,570
He had maps of sections of Alabama,
Georgia.

116
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:48,550
He even had extra certain towns
on those maps. I don't know,

117
00:08:48,551 --> 00:08:53,551
the old guide is like maps maybe just
stayed up at night kind of plan with his

118
00:08:53,591 --> 00:08:58,320
maps like some of us do with our rand
McNally maps when we want to wish our

119
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,030
selves out of where we are.

120
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:06,370
But when these maps were
found in the press got hold
of these all over the south,

121
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,970
these stories spread and local newspapers
for 20 stories about the maps of their

122
00:09:13,211 --> 00:09:15,610
county or their section of a state.

123
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:21,330
There was hysteria.
Uh,

124
00:09:21,331 --> 00:09:26,331
northern teachers working in the south
were tarred and feathered and I turned

125
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,220
her a piano tuner in
Tennessee was lynched.

126
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,110
Okay.

127
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,370
Cause he was from Massachusetts.

128
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,303
Okay.

129
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,170
Fear set in across the south that
they were going to be other abolition

130
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:41,350
emissaries. That was always
the term used and there were,

131
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:45,400
there were predictions and threats of
all kinds, especially in South Carolina.

132
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,420
Okay.

133
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:52,280
John Brown, when when you, and he did read
some of these newspapers, must've smile.

134
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,810
Nope.
He was hung.

135
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,530
His body was delivered to his wife.

136
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:08,130
It traveled all the way by train all
the way up to know upstate New York to

137
00:10:08,131 --> 00:10:10,800
North Alabama, New York,
where he was buried

138
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,530
aside in a very remote place, I
must say, in upstate New York,

139
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,490
they have a gathering there every year
of something called the John Brown

140
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:21,324
society.

141
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,890
It's run by a bunch of people from New
York City and they have an annual speaker

142
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:29,250
and an annual pilgrimage
to old John Brown's grave.

143
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:31,960
And I had the privilege of one year of
giving that lecture and the courthouse,

144
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,960
whereas body had laid in state.

145
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:40,130
It was interesting to meet the erstwhile
folks at the John Brown society who are

146
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,170
strange and interesting
lot and I can assure you,

147
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,283
yeah,

148
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,410
but it's an isolated place.

149
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:47,640
Yeah.

150
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,690
But pilgrimage,
pilgrimages already started happening,

151
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:57,150
especially among African Americans
in the north to that remote site.

152
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,103
Okay.

153
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,300
Right in the wake of his burial.

154
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,570
The most important thing about John
Brown's raid and John Brown was the

155
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:08,520
aftermath.
It's what people made of it

156
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,590
in the north.

157
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,600
Certain members of that secret six so
called of white abolitionists to ad served

158
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:19,780
him and helped him and raise money
for him and wrote letters with him,

159
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,400
fled the country,

160
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:23,710
some to Canada,

161
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,040
Frederick Douglass himself.

162
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,000
And there were letters discovered
between Douglas and John Brown.

163
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,060
Okay.

164
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,020
Uh, himself will flee the country, uh,

165
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:38,700
out of Rochester,
New York,

166
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:42,870
across Lake Erie and to Canada and out
the Saint Lawrence River to England

167
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,023
because of

168
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,810
fear of his arrest. And there was a
warrant put out for Frederick Douglas.

169
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,680
Douglas is arrest and a federal
marshal arrived in Rochester, York.

170
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:56,860
Only about a day after Douglas left town

171
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,660
intellectuals and poets and writers and
the press throw in Whittier and Emerson

172
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,620
all over the north and in England and
in France began to try their hand at the

173
00:12:13,391 --> 00:12:16,510
meaning of John Brown as Christian hero,

174
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,940
as martyr of a cars,
as a man who would do that,

175
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,310
which the rest of them
would not have done.

176
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,330
And I want to suggest, I'm going
to give you really for arguments,

177
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,840
just try them on or
why John Brown matters.

178
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:42,330
Why you matter then and why you still
matters in any discussion we have in

179
00:12:42,521 --> 00:12:46,640
American society about what
constitutes terrorism now,

180
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,260
what constitutes revolutionary
violence when is a cause?

181
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,030
So just that the means justify the ends.

182
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,920
When is violence in a
moral cause justified?

183
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:04,870
Is it ever justified? Go answer
those questions in an ethics course.

184
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,720
Go answer those questions
in a politics course.

185
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,310
Go answer those questions in a history
course and you have one of the hardest

186
00:13:12,311 --> 00:13:16,930
questions of wall was John Brown,
a midnight terrorist

187
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,760
or revolutionary hero.

188
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,460
John Brown is a very troubling legacy.

189
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,560
Nobody should pretty fine and
nobody should totally dismissing.

190
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,110
I'd say he leaves us with four essential
questions and you can add to this or if

191
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:37,970
you want first,

192
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:41,390
he really makes his face this
question of the meaning of martyrdom.

193
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,490
What is a martyr?
How do we define a martyr?

194
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,270
What constitutes the value?

195
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:52,400
Is there elements of martyrdom

196
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,243
to

197
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:01,570
how do we deal with revolutionary
violence in history or today?

198
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:09,620
One kind of Cosby just as I
just said earlier, so just,

199
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:10,940
yeah,

200
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,940
that violence in its
name is somehow justified

201
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,360
three and here I'm going to
give you a list within the list.

202
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:28,370
I think John Brown is our
template in American history.

203
00:14:28,371 --> 00:14:32,710
There are others you could point to the
leaders of the Hay market riot, the,

204
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,400
there, there are many other cases, um,

205
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,440
in our history of people who acted
in a cause and used violence.

206
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,080
But John Brown,
um,

207
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:50,290
forces us to face the almost
natural ambivalences about his ax.

208
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,420
He is disturbing and inspiring.
Note all these opposites.

209
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,600
He in some ways worked
for the highest ideals,

210
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:02,480
human freedom and the idea of equality.

211
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,000
But it also uses the most ruthless deeds.

212
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,790
There's a certain majesty about his
character, at least in the aftermath,

213
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,380
but there's also a lot of folly.

214
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,730
He was a monster to some to others. He's,

215
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:20,660
he's a saint. He's a warrior. St

216
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,130
He killed for justice.

217
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,113
Yes.

218
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,800
When does that work for you?

219
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,790
He was a great example of what
had been brewing all over the,

220
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,960
the culture by the 1850s.

221
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:39,961
We've talked about this over and over
of this struggle between human law,

222
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,690
law,
fashion and congress,

223
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:48,310
law facet and fashion by people
and the so called higher law.

224
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,770
When do you abide by a higher law
than the laws of your society?

225
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,940
When is it just a break human
law in the name of higher law?

226
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,673
Who Decides?

227
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,093
And lastly,

228
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,690
I think he's one of those Avengers
of history who do the work.

229
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,120
Other people won't,

230
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,540
can't or shouldn't.

231
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:20,760
Okay.

232
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,740
Men consented to his death,

233
00:16:22,741 --> 00:16:26,190
said Frederick Douglass and one of
those eulogy speech was much later.

234
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:31,210
The speech is much later in 1880 men
consented to his death and then when home

235
00:16:32,221 --> 00:16:34,860
and taught their children
to honor his memory.

236
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:43,500
And then fourth, and the last question
that's always laying out there,

237
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:49,260
John Brown was a white man who killed
white people to free black people.

238
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,790
And that's actually one
of his deepest legacies.

239
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,780
In my first years of teaching a bigger
term in highschool and Flint, Michigan,

240
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,440
I taught lots of young black people
who thought John Brown was black.

241
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:05,940
They had been taught that he was black.
Sometimes in churches,

242
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,520
there's a church in Springfield,
Massachusetts, the John
Brown went to, attended.

243
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,760
They say he was a member.
It's called the John Brown church.

244
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:19,110
There's some people there. You still
have to convince that it was white.

245
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,110
Does it matter?
Why does it matter?

246
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:29,170
Why is John Brown's and been such a
romantic hero in black culture and poetry

247
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,130
and painting and song?

248
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,173
Yeah.

249
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:42,120
Michael Harper,
the great modern African American poet

250
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,460
has a little line on,

251
00:17:44,461 --> 00:17:49,461
one of his poems is called the
poem is called history and Brown.

252
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:56,280
The line is come to the crusade,
not as Negroes,

253
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,880
but as brothers like brother Brown.

254
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,473
Well,

255
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:10,710
you can try all those questions on and
if you come up with some perfect answers,

256
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,130
do let me know.
But before we leave John Brown,

257
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:19,131
I want to leave you with my favorite
passage ever written about the meaning and

258
00:18:19,241 --> 00:18:20,470
memory of John Brown.

259
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,133
And

260
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,630
you can see if it fits or not.

261
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,930
It's in a speech by WB Dubois,

262
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,960
greatest black scholar
writer of the 20th century.

263
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:38,830
Dubois gave a speech about John
Brown at Harper's ferry in 1932

264
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,020
they were dedicating a plaque memorial.
Uh,

265
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,640
this has been done before,

266
00:18:46,641 --> 00:18:50,660
but they were dedicating and yet another
sort of John Brown marker at Harper's

267
00:18:50,661 --> 00:18:53,990
ferry,
and the ending of that speech,

268
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,980
I think is the most poignant thing
anybody ever said about John Brown,

269
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,980
and it's why he's so troubling.

270
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,980
This is dubois is ending.

271
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:09,530
Some people have the idea that crucifixion
consists in the punishment of an

272
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:10,460
innocent man.

273
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:15,200
The essence of crucifixion is
that men are killing a criminal,

274
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,540
that men have got to kill him,

275
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:23,410
and yet that the act of crucifying
him is the salvation of the world.

276
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,370
John Brown broke the law.
He killed human beings.

277
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,200
Those people who defended slavery
had had to execute John Brown,

278
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,110
although they knew that in killing him,

279
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,440
they were committing the greater crime.

280
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:45,340
It is out of that human paradox
that there comes any crucifixion.

281
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,180
Okay,
good morning

282
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:04,660
sermon is over.
I've named my text.

283
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,580
Now let's do some history.

284
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:07,883
Okay.

285
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,300
The raid on Harper's ferry and the
execution of John Brown of course, came.

286
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,100
Whoops.
There we are

287
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:29,910
on the eve of an extremely pivotal
American election to say the least.

288
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:36,930
You all know the Republican party had a
good showing in 1856 and nearly won it's

289
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,030
first time out.
Now,

290
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:44,650
what will this Republican Party be by
1860 how will it threaten the south? Well,

291
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:47,500
it's threatened the south John Bronze,

292
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:51,310
right on Harper's vera in
his execution or a template

293
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,410
all into that next spring

294
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:01,210
as the American political culture held
it's conventions and nominated candidates

295
00:21:01,851 --> 00:21:04,340
and prepared for an election
that now people said,

296
00:21:04,341 --> 00:21:08,000
my decide whether the union
would hold together or not.

297
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,460
The Democrats held their
convention in late April,

298
00:21:13,461 --> 00:21:16,970
early May in the worst possible
place they can hold it.

299
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,910
They had scheduled it well ahead of
time in Charleston, South Carolina.

300
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:24,911
Charleston was a hotbed of southern
rites and southern nationalism,

301
00:21:26,961 --> 00:21:28,370
if you want to call it that,

302
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:32,630
and southern secessionism already.
It was

303
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,440
now the the can to the front running
candidate of the Democratic Party by 1860

304
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:44,090
and this man had been working for this
for a decade and a half. It was of course,

305
00:21:44,091 --> 00:21:46,430
Stephen Douglas of Illinois.

306
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,970
Same Stephen Douglas of
popular sovereignty fame,

307
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:56,770
but Stephen Douglas had
made one a slip up. Oh,

308
00:21:56,771 --> 00:21:57,531
he made more than one,

309
00:21:57,531 --> 00:22:02,531
but he might one or two really big
slipups in terms of his fellow southern

310
00:22:02,991 --> 00:22:06,890
Democrats, I mean is by far the most
prestigious person in their party.

311
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,040
But in one of his debates
with Abraham Lincoln,

312
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,420
one of those incredible debates with
Lincoln, the one in Freeport, Illinois,

313
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:20,400
and much ado was made about this.
It was almost a throwaway line,

314
00:22:20,401 --> 00:22:21,720
although it wasn't thrown away.

315
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,300
Yeah.

316
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,660
Lincoln pushed Douglas and he said,

317
00:22:26,661 --> 00:22:29,690
do you mean then judge Douglas?
Is he always called?

318
00:22:29,691 --> 00:22:32,330
He would never call him senator.
Judge Douglas.

319
00:22:32,331 --> 00:22:36,470
Do you mean then that if the people who
settle the Western territory pop your

320
00:22:36,471 --> 00:22:38,260
popular sovereignty business,
what does that,

321
00:22:38,261 --> 00:22:41,660
that really means the folks
can vote it out, right?

322
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,880
In spite of what the
dred Scott Decision says,

323
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:47,150
dred Scott decision just said that
because of the Fifth Amendment,

324
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:52,460
you cannot stop a person taking his slaves
anywhere he wants. And Lincoln says,

325
00:22:52,461 --> 00:22:57,010
but, but judge, what's that done
to your popular sovereignty,

326
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,790
Douglas as well?
That people can still vote?

327
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,250
And if the people vote slavery
out and they voted out.

328
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:03,440
Okay.

329
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,700
And his fellow southern
Democrats immediately started
writing to him and wiring

330
00:23:07,701 --> 00:23:09,380
him and saying, wait a minute, Steven,

331
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,750
did we live in the land of the
dred Scott decision or not?

332
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:19,540
It became known to southern Democrats
as the so called free port. Doctor

333
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,650
and Douglas kept trying to
dance around it, avoid it

334
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:32,810
in opposition to so called Freeport
doctrine and in opposition to Douglas at

335
00:23:32,971 --> 00:23:37,110
this southern Democrat at
the, at the Democratic Party
convention, and by the way,

336
00:23:37,111 --> 00:23:40,710
that Democratic Party is by
anyone with his eyes open.

337
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:45,180
The only truly national
political party left in America,

338
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,090
the hope of saving the union,
just in a political sense,

339
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,360
by 1860 was with the Democrats.

340
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:58,630
This Republican Party is resumed to see
was a northern party almost exclusively

341
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,050
countering the Douglas southern Democrats,

342
00:24:06,051 --> 00:24:10,520
led by none other than Jefferson Davis,
a senator from Mississippi at that point,

343
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,380
a long distinguished member of Congress,
secretary of war,

344
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:17,690
coming on a west point and so on.

345
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:24,100
They came up with what they now call
a slave code for the territory's.

346
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,880
That's what they called it.

347
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:31,280
And that slave code for the territory's
was now to be a protection in the

348
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:36,281
constitution and explicit protection
in the constitution of slave ownership

349
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:42,230
anywhere in the western
territories of the United States.

350
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,500
They wanted, in essence, not just the
dred Scott Decision Supreme Court case,

351
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,620
they wanted a federal gay.

352
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,930
They wanted not just the repeal
of the Kansas Nebraska Act,

353
00:24:54,931 --> 00:24:58,950
geographical division, not just
the dred Scott Case, which said,

354
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,220
prisoners, right, take
slaves anywhere. They wish.

355
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,700
They wanted a explicit federal guarantee
of the right to slave ownership and he

356
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:12,570
wanted it to be a constitutional
amendment if necessary.

357
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,063
Now,

358
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,720
this is why the Democratic Party
toward self apart at Charleston,

359
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,270
they had a two thirds rule.

360
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:28,780
So even though Stephen Douglas did
muster a small majority of support in the

361
00:25:28,851 --> 00:25:33,370
first balloting, he could not win
the nomination. And when Douglas,

362
00:25:33,371 --> 00:25:36,050
his supporters managed to pass a platform

363
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:42,550
without the so called slave code for the
territory's southern delegates of eight

364
00:25:42,561 --> 00:25:46,520
states, they'd all prepared for
this stocked out of the convention.

365
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,710
The convention ended.
They nominated nobody

366
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,370
and they split into two parties,

367
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,030
the southern Democrats and
the northern Democrats.

368
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:02,330
And everybody knows that
when a party does this,

369
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,420
it almost guarantees that we'll lose.

370
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,673
And

371
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:08,963
it did

372
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:15,000
the southern Democrats re to
reconvene in Baltimore and June 18

373
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,810
and um,

374
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,420
I'm sorry,

375
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:24,560
the northern Democrats reconvened the
so called official Democratic Party.

376
00:26:24,561 --> 00:26:29,561
We convene to Baltimore and June 18
they nominated a Stephen Douglas.

377
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,350
No surprise. They called
themselves the National Democrats,

378
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,880
the southern Democrats of those eight
southern states. It's the deep south.

379
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,300
Yeah.

380
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,470
Met in Richmond,
Virginia.

381
00:26:41,471 --> 00:26:46,471
Shortly after that and nominated John See
Breckenridge of Kentucky slave holder,

382
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:52,830
but a moderate known to be some
kind of an old Henry Clay moderate.

383
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,380
Although he'd never been a wig.

384
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:57,890
Okay.

385
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,480
To be their candidate for president.

386
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:03,240
And by the end of June,
1860,

387
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,750
the democratic party had to
two candidates, Breckenridge,

388
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:12,740
southern Democrat Douglas,
the northern Democrats.

389
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,820
Now the Republican Party had
its convention in Chicago.

390
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,030
There's an extraordinary convention.

391
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,760
It had never been one quite
like it in American history.

392
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,460
It was Rawkus.

393
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,230
They would just parades and
waves of people sometimes hired,

394
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:34,880
sometimes induced den by lots of drink
to come into the so called a Wigwam,

395
00:27:34,881 --> 00:27:39,620
which was this big convention hall of
a kind they had constructed in Chicago.

396
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,670
It was sometimes called the shouters
convention because these people were sort

397
00:27:43,671 --> 00:27:46,010
of hired to shout for one
candidate or the other.

398
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,130
What fun and nonsense it must have been.

399
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,040
Yeah.

400
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,100
The leading Canada, the Republicans
of course was William h Seward,

401
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,320
sort of New York,

402
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,920
longterm time senator from New York had
strong antislavery credentials as a good

403
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:11,101
solid free soiler and indeed even
had fairly strong abolitionist ties.

404
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:14,780
Okay.

405
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:19,760
And He'd been there at the creation of
the Republican Party and he had a kind of

406
00:28:19,761 --> 00:28:21,410
a machine.
I have a sword,

407
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:27,910
but there was this strange insurgency
out of Illinois behind a favorite son

408
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,270
named Abraham Lincoln,
and wasn't all that well known,

409
00:28:32,271 --> 00:28:35,450
even though he had become fairly well
known in his run against Stephen Douglas

410
00:28:35,451 --> 00:28:40,451
and 1858 but of course he'd lost that
election narrowly to Douglas and 58 he

411
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:46,280
doesn't one term in the u s house back
in the late 1840 [inaudible] during the

412
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:46,550
Mexican war.

413
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:51,550
And then he lost on is tempted
reelection two years in the House of

414
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,930
Representatives,
or rather inexperienced.

415
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:57,470
But it turns out brilliant politician,

416
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:02,600
the platform of the Republican Party,
which was very important these years,

417
00:29:02,601 --> 00:29:07,160
people were reading platforms, believe
it or today, platforms SMAPP forms,

418
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:11,840
right?
Southerners were really reading the dumb,

419
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,370
the Republican party platform.

420
00:29:13,371 --> 00:29:18,371
The platform of 1860 was a little broader
and had somewhat more moderate appeals

421
00:29:21,531 --> 00:29:26,531
in it then they're 1856 deeply
free soil platform had had,

422
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,970
they made big appeals in 1860,
uh,

423
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:35,030
to create higher federal tariffs to
create free homestead law in the West.

424
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,540
These are all appeals. You know, the,

425
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:41,570
the common man and to the
rights of immigrants because
the Republicans were now

426
00:29:41,681 --> 00:29:44,800
successful by the late 1850s at all,

427
00:29:44,801 --> 00:29:46,960
but desolving that native as party,

428
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:50,020
the know nothings or the
American party and we're drawing.

429
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:51,670
Most native is not quite all,

430
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:56,020
but most native is into
the Republican Party and,

431
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,450
and they'd manage this strange marriage
of a kind of a pro immigrant platform.

432
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:02,231
At the same time,

433
00:30:02,231 --> 00:30:06,160
they're attracting nativist who are as
worried about slavery as they were about

434
00:30:06,161 --> 00:30:06,994
Catholics.

435
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:12,430
They appealed to a certain
anti southern feeling.

436
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,200
There's no question about that.

437
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:22,580
Now Lincoln got the
nomination largely because in,

438
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,230
well one the convention was held in his
home state to William made Seward had

439
00:30:28,231 --> 00:30:32,010
made a fair number of enemies
around the Republican coalition.

440
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:37,260
He was in the limelight
too long in a sense.

441
00:30:37,261 --> 00:30:42,261
You could argue politically and Ilana
Republicans were looking for a candidate

442
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:47,060
who seemed more moderate
than that is Seward.

443
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,210
They wanted to run in this election in
a way that, you know, the upper south,

444
00:30:51,211 --> 00:30:56,040
maybe the border states would actually
support them. And this Lincoln,

445
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:59,010
yeah, man. After all. He was
born in Kentucky, you know,

446
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,420
he's the kind of a border state guy
himself. Seward's just a Yankee.

447
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:10,950
So there's a certain irony and the
Lincoln got some support because he wasn't

448
00:31:10,951 --> 00:31:13,680
seen as abolitionists.

449
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:16,500
Now that isn't necessarily as true.

450
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,520
Lincoln was on record all over the place
saying such things as he had an 1859 I

451
00:31:22,561 --> 00:31:23,394
quote him,

452
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:29,630
Republicans believe that slavery is wrong
and they insist and we'll continue to

453
00:31:31,171 --> 00:31:36,171
insist upon a national policy
which recognizes it and
deals with it as a wrong.

454
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,150
There can be no letting down on

455
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,093
this

456
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,560
reasonably clear language.

457
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,610
Oh dear,
I got to move him.

458
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,740
Sorry.
There you are.

459
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:08,310
Does Matthew Brady's famous photographs
that he took on the day of Abraham

460
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,770
Lincoln's Cooper Union speech in New York.
The speech,

461
00:32:11,771 --> 00:32:16,771
the introduced Lincoln to the east and
according to Harold Holter and a reason

462
00:32:16,911 --> 00:32:19,930
book made Lincoln President.
Now it's a bit overstated,

463
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,770
but ms pre beer didn't grow
the beard of the next year,

464
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:28,010
but the crisis was so serious now.
Well,

465
00:32:28,011 --> 00:32:33,011
this northern antislavery free soil
Republican Party to democratic parties,

466
00:32:33,971 --> 00:32:36,520
one southern one northern
splitting themselves

467
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,080
that are a group of American politicos
got together practically overnight late

468
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:49,880
that summer, 1860 and decided
to run yet a fourth candidate.

469
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:55,690
His name was John Bell of Tennessee
and they called themselves the

470
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:01,910
Constitutional Union party.
They drew together some old Whigs.

471
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,100
The Whig party doesn't exist anymore.

472
00:33:04,101 --> 00:33:06,530
There's still some old Whigs
looking for a political home.

473
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:08,270
Yeah.

474
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,520
They drew some nativists and no nothings

475
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:18,370
and they drew border state people who
were just frightened of how this mess was

476
00:33:18,381 --> 00:33:20,390
possibly gonna destroy the union.

477
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:26,530
Their platform was extremely simple.
They pledged themselves simply to quote,

478
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:31,330
defense of the Union and
enforcement of the law. Oh,

479
00:33:31,331 --> 00:33:34,750
it could be against that.
They were for the Union and law,

480
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,920
both nice things

481
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,440
and almost unbelievably this party
had quite a few followers overnight.

482
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:49,973
Yeah,

483
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:54,930
no. When the election came, and I'll go
back to the map if you forgive me. Um,

484
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,773
okay.

485
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:06,510
It's worth looking at some quick numbers,
more than worth it.

486
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:12,770
This is one of the great for way races
for the presidency in American history.

487
00:34:12,771 --> 00:34:16,380
We've only had really one
or two other four ways.

488
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:17,880
1912 was a four way.

489
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:22,020
Of course that guarantees almost you're
going to have a minority president that

490
00:34:22,021 --> 00:34:24,720
is the one who wins,
is not going to win a majority,

491
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:29,200
and that's exactly what happened
in this case. Now, Abraham Lincoln,

492
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:33,540
the Republican was not even on
the ballot in 10 slave states.

493
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,840
Republicans weren't even put it on
the ballot in all of the deep south.

494
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:39,263
Okay.

495
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,060
Lincoln carried all of the northern
states and all of their electoral votes

496
00:34:45,061 --> 00:34:46,530
except three in New Jersey.

497
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,421
Breckenridge,

498
00:34:51,421 --> 00:34:56,421
the southern Democrat carried all the
slave states except parts of the Upper

499
00:34:57,751 --> 00:35:02,700
South Virginia, Kentucky,
Tennessee, and Missouri.

500
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,030
Oh,
well you can see that on that map.

501
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,910
John Bell,
the Constitutional Union Canada,

502
00:35:09,911 --> 00:35:14,340
there's overnight party that just said,
please save the Union. Whatever it takes.

503
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:16,200
We needed a new national compromise.

504
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:22,430
Bell Won Virginia, Kentucky,
and Tennessee. Upper south.

505
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:24,710
Okay.

506
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,760
Stephen Douglas,

507
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,080
who'd been kind of running for
president in his heart for 15 years.

508
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,780
One only one state,
Missouri.

509
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:39,660
Lincoln received only 26,000 votes
in the south in all the slave states.

510
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,470
He received only about 40%

511
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:47,430
of the total raw vote.

512
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:54,320
60% of Americans who voted in 1860 and
they voted in huge percentage is 75 80%

513
00:35:55,711 --> 00:35:56,544
turnout.

514
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:01,470
60% of all those who voted did
not vote for Abraham Lincoln,

515
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,700
but he was elected.

516
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:10,140
And now of course the question
was what would the south to do?

517
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,460
What all this rhetoric about southern
unity and the possibility of of

518
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:18,480
succession,

519
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:24,220
uh, sorry. Oops.

520
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,593
I hope that work

521
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:42,080
colors aren't great or anything.
Well,

522
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:46,520
this is session crisis is an unprecedented
moment in American history and

523
00:36:46,521 --> 00:36:48,590
happily we haven't quite had it since.

524
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,130
There were always rumors of Texas wanting
to succeed and the upper peninsula of

525
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:59,210
Michigan wanting to secede,
but nobody quite does a session anymore.

526
00:36:59,211 --> 00:37:02,990
We got a lot of states rights going on,
but we don't necessarily do succession.

527
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:09,100
Would the south really do it now?

528
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:12,560
Lincoln made one thing
clear within his party.

529
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:17,620
He made almost no public appearances
after the election of 1860 into that

530
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,490
winter. Inaugurations were not held
in the 19th century until March.

531
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:26,900
As you may know, the interregnum
was a long time, four months,

532
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,040
four or five months.

533
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:33,790
This was the succession winter of 1860
61 but he made one thing very clear

534
00:37:34,401 --> 00:37:39,140
within his party circles and his quote
after quote about this in private

535
00:37:39,141 --> 00:37:41,210
correspondence.
He said,

536
00:37:41,211 --> 00:37:46,211
whatever the south does that he wanted
the Republican Party to stand absolutely

537
00:37:47,121 --> 00:37:52,121
firm on one thing and that was opposition
at all costs to the expansion of

538
00:37:52,551 --> 00:37:56,450
slavery into the West.
He said that was their reason to be.

539
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,670
That was why they came into existence.

540
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,500
That is what they had been arguing for
six years and they would not give up that

541
00:38:03,501 --> 00:38:04,760
line as he put it

542
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:11,510
on December 20th, 1860 South
Carolina Helda secession convention

543
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:18,100
December 20th and voted unanimously
to secede from the union.

544
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:24,970
They said in that act that they were
quote not in rebellion against the United

545
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,580
States.

546
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:33,580
They said they were only exercising
their sovereign power as a state to

547
00:38:34,371 --> 00:38:35,360
withdraw.

548
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:40,150
They rooted there succession as they
had always rooted state sovereignty and

549
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:45,151
states' rights positions in the old
notion of a compact theory of government

550
00:38:45,821 --> 00:38:50,140
that which a state chooses to
join in a central government.

551
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:53,560
It shall have the right
end power to withdraw from.

552
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:59,740
But the question now is would
anybody join them? Oh and by the way,

553
00:38:59,741 --> 00:39:02,470
they declared themselves the
Paul Meadow Metal Republic,

554
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:10,510
but would anybody join South Carolina?
And this is where your book by Charles Do,

555
00:39:10,511 --> 00:39:14,290
parcels of disunion comes
right into play here.

556
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:19,980
That wonderfully short and I think quite
brilliant treatment of these succession

557
00:39:21,341 --> 00:39:26,341
commissioners is South Carolina was
the first date to send out succession

558
00:39:26,561 --> 00:39:29,980
commissioners and other states in
the deep south and basically say,

559
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,530
please join us,
were hanging out on this limb.

560
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,120
It's scary out here and here are
the reasons you should join us.

561
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,910
The next state to go though,

562
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:44,500
it wasn't until the 9th of January
of [inaudible] 61 it was Mississippi.

563
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:45,910
Yeah.

564
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:50,910
Zippy held the secession convention and
then several deep South states fell like

565
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:54,190
dominoes.
Next Day,

566
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:59,220
January 10 Florida succeeded
Alabama on January 11th Georgia.

567
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,410
I want to come back to Georgia.
And just a second,

568
00:40:02,411 --> 00:40:05,380
cause it's in a very interesting case.
George,

569
00:40:05,381 --> 00:40:08,470
on January 19th in a very divided vote,

570
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,980
Louisiana in January 26 and Texas
on February 1st by February 1st,

571
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:22,660
1861 the seven states of the deep South,
South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama,

572
00:40:22,661 --> 00:40:26,200
Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas
had seceded from the union.

573
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,800
They declared themselves the
confederate states of America.

574
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,810
They met at their first declared capitol
of Montgomery, Alabama. And they,

575
00:40:34,811 --> 00:40:37,870
in effect a pointed,
there was no general election.

576
00:40:37,871 --> 00:40:42,871
At first they appointed
the representatives or the
states appointed Jefferson

577
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:47,110
Davis of Mississippi,
Mississippi as their president.

578
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:50,400
Okay.

579
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,400
By the time Lincoln would take office
and first week in March and deliver his

580
00:40:55,561 --> 00:41:00,561
first inaugural seven states in the
deep south had formed a new government.

581
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:08,840
Now
why did they do it?

582
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:12,410
I'm going to have to leave you a,
we have about seven, eight minutes,

583
00:41:12,411 --> 00:41:14,390
which is great.
Um,

584
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:18,350
I want to focus briefly on Georgia to
show you the succession was no simple

585
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:21,830
process and many of these states
and it was great division,

586
00:41:21,831 --> 00:41:26,831
which we will see later kind of come out
of its shell in the midst of a war and

587
00:41:29,451 --> 00:41:32,090
some extent afterwards in reconstruction.

588
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:36,810
And I don't want to at least leave you
today with some explanations of why is

589
00:41:36,811 --> 00:41:40,760
the session happened, interpretations
we've developed over the years

590
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,750
of why the south seceding

591
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,210
I may have to leave you hanging as to
just what happened to the rest of the

592
00:41:50,211 --> 00:41:51,170
south and so on.

593
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:56,690
But the opera south doesn't budge
and are many reasons for that.

594
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:01,310
Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee,
Kentucky, Arkansas and so on. Maryland,

595
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,830
there are many reasons for that.

596
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:10,090
It was somewhat less strong
attachment to slavery, uh,

597
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,590
in many of these regions,

598
00:42:11,591 --> 00:42:16,210
especially in the mountain regions are
much more closer economic ties to the

599
00:42:16,211 --> 00:42:20,380
north that now caused a whole variety
of fears are what's going to happen if

600
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:23,830
there's conflict or two countries or war.

601
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:25,880
Yeah,

602
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,540
fear that the war would actually
happen if there was war on their soil.

603
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:30,750
Okay.

604
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:33,540
You're not, you didn't have to
be too bright to figure that out.

605
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,620
And many people in the upper south,
some of whom have actually voted for,

606
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:43,890
for Bell and the Constitutional Union
party still had faith that somehow America

607
00:42:46,001 --> 00:42:47,080
would reach a compromise.

608
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:48,780
Yeah.

609
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:53,280
That the party system would somehow
work this through. This was,

610
00:42:53,281 --> 00:42:55,590
this was a very difficult patch,
you know,

611
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,190
but they work at this room
and there was a spirit,

612
00:42:59,191 --> 00:43:03,120
especially in the upper south at
first and some of this in Georgia to,

613
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:07,810
to wait for 64,
wait four years.

614
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,300
I let this Lincoln Republican Party
have its way for a while. We'll see.

615
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,760
We, they would say, still have
a majority on the supreme court.

616
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,353
Okay.

617
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,440
Now, um, explanations.

618
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:29,420
Now Georgia can't, we can't, we can't,

619
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:33,830
we can't leave Georgia because
Georgia succession votes fascinating.

620
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,620
And that's what this map
in some ways shows you,

621
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:38,390
I don't know if you
can see this very well,

622
00:43:38,391 --> 00:43:43,391
but the darker greenish color up there
is that green to you or blue and the rest

623
00:43:43,731 --> 00:43:47,240
is kind of a puke yellow.
Um,

624
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:54,250
those bluish greenish regions are the
regions that tended to be against the

625
00:43:54,741 --> 00:43:56,930
session there.

626
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,810
The regions that had
the least slavery there,

627
00:43:59,811 --> 00:44:03,920
the mountainous regions
or the upland regions.

628
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:08,780
And we've now had detailed studies
of succession done in state by state,

629
00:44:08,781 --> 00:44:13,460
especially in in, in Georgia
and North Carolina, Alabama.

630
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:18,260
Other places that show us that by far
the highest support for succession

631
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:25,450
was in those counties or those regions
with the largest numbers of slaves.

632
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:31,260
And this is where Charles do fits right
in. Read them closely. What are those?

633
00:44:31,261 --> 00:44:35,190
The session commissioners arguing when
they go from Alabama up to Tennessee to

634
00:44:35,191 --> 00:44:39,760
try to convince the Tennessee legislature
or the South Carolina Succession

635
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,900
Commissioner going to Virginia and
sitting down in the Virginia State House,

636
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,380
the Virginia legislature and arguing
with these people, come join us.

637
00:44:46,381 --> 00:44:50,220
Come join us. What are they arguing?
And he's got document after document.

638
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:56,540
They're arguing for the preservation of
white security of white supremacy there

639
00:44:57,811 --> 00:45:00,810
arguing for the preservation
of a slave economy.

640
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:06,350
They're arguing for the preservation of
white political supremacy there arguing

641
00:45:07,201 --> 00:45:08,370
for resistance again,

642
00:45:08,371 --> 00:45:11,610
and he's against any semblance of
those Republicans in the north.

643
00:45:11,611 --> 00:45:15,570
May May somehow represent
about racial equality.

644
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:19,980
They're arguing for the preservation
of a slave labor system.

645
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,720
Put simply, there are no for the
preservation of a slave society.

646
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:26,210
Okay.

647
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:30,740
What's the session about slavery
read Charles.

648
00:45:30,741 --> 00:45:31,574
Do.

649
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,390
All right. And the three minutes I have,
let me leave you with some arguments.

650
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:43,780
Why does south succeed,

651
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,550
oops,
sorry.

652
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:57,703
One

653
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:02,720
is what? Um, we might simply call, uh,

654
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:07,490
what I've just argued,
the preservation of a slave society,

655
00:46:07,491 --> 00:46:09,650
the preservation of a slave system,

656
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:14,890
the preservation of a certain kind of
racial control over a society that they

657
00:46:15,471 --> 00:46:18,440
now greatly feared would be threatened.

658
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:23,720
And this is in part what happened in
Georgia in their divided vote because in

659
00:46:23,721 --> 00:46:26,780
Georgia, the upper counties
of Georgia, those more hilly,

660
00:46:26,781 --> 00:46:31,070
mountainous regions of north
Georgia voted against the session,

661
00:46:31,071 --> 00:46:35,240
the vote on succession and
Georgia on January 19th,

662
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:40,240
1861 was one 66 to one 30 130 of those
people who were elected to go to the

663
00:46:42,351 --> 00:46:45,920
Georgia secession convention
is delegates voted against it.

664
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,550
And here was the theory that was at stake.

665
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:55,060
It was really an argument between
waiting til 64 or the argument used by

666
00:46:57,741 --> 00:46:59,180
southern slave holders now,

667
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:03,140
but people from south Georgia
and all over the deep south,

668
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,870
it was the theory of a shrinking south.

669
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:09,350
And I really do believe this is one of
the most compelling arguments they had

670
00:47:09,351 --> 00:47:10,250
about succession.

671
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:14,720
And it's why they were able to muster
enough folks to go with them in their

672
00:47:14,721 --> 00:47:15,554
revolution.

673
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:21,140
The theory of a shrinking south was
the idea that if the Republicans gained

674
00:47:21,141 --> 00:47:24,830
control of the federal
government through patronage,

675
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,680
through nominations to the Supreme Court,

676
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:30,400
through the much higher numbers they
had in the House of Representatives,

677
00:47:30,401 --> 00:47:33,940
and even now with California and so on,
maybe even in the u s senate,

678
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:40,000
that eventually, and if they close off
the expansion of slavery in the West,

679
00:47:40,001 --> 00:47:44,020
what does that do?
It cordons off and it contains,

680
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:48,640
and it begins to smother southern
society and the slave system.

681
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:53,110
And the theory wasn't on the rim of
the south. In Kentucky, in Missouri,

682
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:56,470
in Maryland, the price of
slaves would begin to dwindle.

683
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,200
Yeah.

684
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,540
And then what do people do when
the price of something goes down?

685
00:48:00,541 --> 00:48:04,020
They sell it off, where are they going
to sell those slaves can't sell him west,

686
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:08,460
can't sell them to the Caribbean.
International slave trades illegal.

687
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,250
They're going to sell them into
the deep south. What happens?

688
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:15,900
The deep south becomes more and
more and more rather quickly,

689
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:20,790
a pressure cooker of increasingly
large numbers of slaves.

690
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,030
Okay.

691
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:23,650
And no place to expand to

692
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:28,160
prices as slaves would
continue to go down.

693
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:31,640
The value of their most precious asset.

694
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:36,650
Was it stake as was their security?

695
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:38,510
Their safety.

696
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,053
Okay.

697
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:51,570
Second reason, and I'm going to run out
of time any minute, I know what I mean.

698
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,740
Let me just lay these out.

699
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:56,460
I'm going to name them and I'm
going to leave you dangling here.

700
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:58,343
Uh,

701
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,870
the second is what I will
call the fear thesis.

702
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,600
The third is what I will
call southern nationalism.

703
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:08,360
The fourth is what I
will call agrarianism.

704
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,480
And the fifth is what I
will call the honor thesis.

705
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:16,130
I will resume that argument,
uh, when we resume next time.

706
00:49:16,131 --> 00:49:21,110
But let me leave you with this.
Lincoln does get inaugurated of course,

707
00:49:21,111 --> 00:49:22,070
in the midst of this,

708
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:23,800
yeah.

709
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,480
Inherits a nation divided

710
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:33,280
at the end of his first inaugural
speech comes those famous words.

711
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:39,530
Lincoln was of course capable of leaving
passages for us to quote and almost

712
00:49:39,901 --> 00:49:42,780
everything he delivered in
almost everything that he wrote,

713
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,730
but he went to a little Shakespeare
at the end of his first inaugural.

714
00:49:48,731 --> 00:49:51,340
By the way, at first,
inaugural was an olive branch.

715
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:55,000
We will never touch slavery
where it already exists.

716
00:49:55,001 --> 00:49:58,240
We only intend to stop its expansion.
You are our brothers.

717
00:49:58,241 --> 00:50:02,260
You are our countrymen.
Come back, do not leave us

718
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:06,820
members of a country.
He said, cannot divorce.

719
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:11,830
Used a divorce metaphor and then
he ended with I am Lowe's to close.

720
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:16,570
We're not enemies, but friends.
We must not be enemies.

721
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:21,970
Though passion may have strained.
It must not break our bonds of affection,

722
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:24,160
the mystic chords of memory,

723
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:29,330
stretching from every battlefield and
patriot to every living heart well yet

724
00:50:29,331 --> 00:50:29,901
swell.

725
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:34,901
The chorus of the Union when again touched
is surely they will be by the better

726
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:38,210
angels of our nature.

727
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:44,190
That was beautiful poetry
and wishful thinking

728
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:50,110
because in the wake of his nomination,
his inauguration,

729
00:50:50,111 --> 00:50:54,490
and eventually in the wake of Fort Sumpter
for more southern states are going to

730
00:50:54,491 --> 00:50:58,060
join the deep south.
And I'll pick up that explanation.

731
00:50:58,061 --> 00:50:59,930
Why next time.
Okay.
