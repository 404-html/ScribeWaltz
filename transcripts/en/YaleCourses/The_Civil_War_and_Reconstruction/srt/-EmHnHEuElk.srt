1
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,830
I was in a meeting some months ago.

2
00:00:15,831 --> 00:00:20,831
The New York Historical Society's board
of trustees are Gus wonderful group of

3
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:23,114
people.

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,960
That's about 35 very rich New Yorkers
and two token historians and I'm one of

5
00:00:28,971 --> 00:00:30,200
the token historians.

6
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,170
They have was there for window dressing
and other good and useful and noble

7
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,150
purposes.
And during a discussion of a subject,

8
00:00:41,151 --> 00:00:43,160
I won't even go into one of the

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,500
very intelligent and very
dedicated members of that board,

10
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:49,610
and I'm not being ironic,

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,440
said that he really wished American
history could be about people of goodwill.

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,320
He wished American history
wasn't so full of conflict

13
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,080
and effect.
He was asking,

14
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:12,081
why can't we really just tell the
stories about people of goodwill?

15
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,380
And I remember thinking,
Oh dear,

16
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,470
this poor man.

17
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,850
But of course I didn't say anything.
I kept my mouth shut.

18
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,060
I nearly threw up

19
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,690
and I just went home about my business.

20
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,230
But why can't history just
be about people, right?

21
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,153
Goodwill.

22
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,760
I'll leave that to you to figure out.

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,560
Sometimes there is a great deal of
goodwill and sometimes there isn't.

24
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,190
A reconstruction is a classic story of,

25
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,060
we've said this already,
great change,

26
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,670
great experimentation,

27
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,170
change forced upon people in some ways
as we'll see where the 14th amendment in

28
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:11,591
a moment,

29
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:16,591
and yet I'm enough of a cadre of
leadership accepted that challenge

30
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,050
and rewrote the country you
live in and yet of course

31
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,120
like all great change.
It caused a tremendous,

32
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,900
and I don't know if there's
a Newton's law of history,

33
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:34,610
an opposite and equal reaction.

34
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,230
Revolutions always caused
counterrevolutions just count on it.

35
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,290
Look throughout American history.
Just for a moment,

36
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,880
let's play some games of historical
cycles just for a moment.

37
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:51,820
I think of the greatest,

38
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:56,560
I mean take your pick the greatest
fundamental changes in American history,

39
00:02:56,561 --> 00:02:59,050
whether that's in society,
the law,

40
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:05,590
no massive immigration, the change,
the demographics of the country.

41
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:07,990
Take your pick,

42
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,410
but pick three or four of the greatest
moments of change in American history.

43
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,380
Every one of them cars do counter change.

44
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,800
Every revolution we have
causes a counterrevolution.

45
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,380
You grew up reaping the great changes
in the civil rights revolution.

46
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,850
You take them for granted.
We most of us do.

47
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,300
Did you also came of age in the midst
of the counterrevolution against it?

48
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,730
If you experienced the civil war
and reconstruction in America,

49
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,450
you experienced,
or a revolution in many ways,

50
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,250
perhaps even more fundamental than
the one in the sixties and seventies

51
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,570
and you experienced very quickly,
it's counterrevolution.

52
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,133
Okay.

53
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:00,890
No,

54
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:05,890
I just want to say that because if the
more you read about reconstruction,

55
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:11,390
the more it seems to me, you find
serious writers on reconstruction,

56
00:04:11,391 --> 00:04:12,800
historians or otherwise,

57
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,010
and not a lot of popular writers
and journalists who've discovered

58
00:04:16,011 --> 00:04:18,560
reconstruction. We're going to read
a book by one of the Nick Lemann,

59
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,200
who is the dean of the
journalism school at Columbia,

60
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:26,000
who in quite good ways,
fashions himself and his story.

61
00:04:26,001 --> 00:04:28,700
He always says he's not a real
historian, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

62
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,870
But he did pretty good research
for this book on violence, uh,

63
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:38,230
largely in Mississippi in 1875 but he's
using it as a window into the counter

64
00:04:39,411 --> 00:04:42,540
revolution your soon to be reading about.
Uh,

65
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:47,510
but most people who write
about this period now tend
to do it in tones of a kind

66
00:04:47,511 --> 00:04:51,250
of a requiem,
a requiem.

67
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,820
Uh,
a tragic mold,

68
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,900
a mold that that is always saying what
might have been what was attempted,

69
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,940
what was, you know, aim
for but then failed,

70
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:13,460
fell apart. What high aspiration.
But God, they couldn't quite do it.

71
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,500
And it is a national requiem in a sense.

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,740
Somebody should write that symphony,
the reconstruction symphony.

73
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,580
We need a Beethoven for that and he
needs to be really depressed one day.

74
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,820
But that doesn't mean it won't be great
and we won't learn from it. Feel from it

75
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,560
all right back on the ground.

76
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,130
I got in some cheap shots and Andrew
Johnson before we left the other day and

77
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:55,110
they were that cheap shots.
No apologies.

78
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:00,650
Um, but Andrew Johnson, the
course of key player here,

79
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:04,430
he comes to the presidency because he's
only comes running mate and his office

80
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:09,230
saying he's gonna make trees and odious
and some radical Republicans were quite

81
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:14,210
fond initially of that approach.
But it quickly, quickly changed.

82
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,860
And here in a nutshell,

83
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:19,430
you've read this now phoner you've all
gotten up through at least the first four

84
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:20,720
chapters.
And by the way,

85
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:24,950
I've now visited at least three sections
and I'm enjoying it. I wish they were.

86
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,910
I wish they weren't just 50 minutes.
You just get going and

87
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:35,150
of course this just gets going and then
you're glad we're out of here in 15

88
00:06:35,151 --> 00:06:38,360
minutes and I'm sure,
but back to Andrew Johnson,

89
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:41,750
he was above all else
and Arden states rightest

90
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,870
he did not support succession.
Now you can be a state's rights.

91
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:51,860
You can believe that power should always
remain in the hands of the state and

92
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,760
still not believe in the right of
succession. And he was one of those.

93
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,860
He believes the session was political
suicide for the south, and Lo and behold,

94
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:01,820
he got that one right.

95
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,910
He had a strong attachment to the
American Union. He was a unionist

96
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,840
and a Patriot in that sense.

97
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:15,440
He had a hatred also of the southern
planter class because he didn't grow up in

98
00:07:15,441 --> 00:07:20,240
it. He was a poor boy who made good
and a huge chip on his shoulder.

99
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,860
He was brilliant in a certain, he was
brilliant at a certain kind of politics,

100
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:29,880
which was east Tennessee stump politics.
Andrew Johnson.

101
00:07:29,881 --> 00:07:33,840
It was said could crawl up on the back
of a wagon and a hold an audience for two

102
00:07:33,841 --> 00:07:35,730
hours in east Tennessee.

103
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:43,540
He didn't very easily convert that
style and that talent at local stump

104
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:45,710
politics.
However,

105
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:51,310
to the much broader world of pragmatic
negotiation of Washington or the

106
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:56,290
presidency, he'd held every
kind of offers you could hold.

107
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,090
Had been mayor of Greenville,
Tennessee. He'd been in stake,

108
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,240
a senator or a state legislature,
he'd been governor of Tennessee.

109
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:10,070
He was then elected senator from Tennessee
and then once again appointed the

110
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:13,970
wartime governor of Tennessee by Abraham
Lincoln. In the midst of the war,

111
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:19,210
he'd held every level of office,
hey,

112
00:08:19,211 --> 00:08:20,660
never been antislavery.

113
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,550
He saw the end of slavery as
a misfortune for the south,

114
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,120
something that had to be
accepted as a verdict of war.

115
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,853
Okay.

116
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,920
Johnson had one essential slogan for his
approach to reconstruction and if you

117
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:44,140
can remember that slogan, you and that
in essence have his point of view.

118
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:49,270
The constitution as it is
and the Union as it was

119
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,560
constitution as it is
in the union as it was,

120
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,980
don't revise the constitution.
He would accept the 13th amendment,

121
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:01,950
the end of slavery, because of the war
that was part of the verdict of the war.

122
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,360
There wasn't any way around that,

123
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,780
but he never accepted the 14th and 15th
amendments and he worked vehemently to

124
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:10,530
destroy the 14th amen.

125
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,070
Yeah.

126
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:18,070
Or at least he worked VM and lead
to urge states not to ratify it.

127
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:22,783
No.

128
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,210
His approach to reconstruction and
once in office was essentially this.

129
00:09:26,211 --> 00:09:30,770
He took Lincoln's lenient plan,
the 10% plan,

130
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,820
anyone another step further
in its leniency or some
say several steps further.

131
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:44,170
Instead of saying he wanted 10% of the
voting population of a confederate state

132
00:09:44,301 --> 00:09:47,570
to take loyalty, almost form of
government come back and so forth.

133
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:53,020
He simply converted 10% to quote
that portion who are loyal.

134
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,920
Any portion,
wherever maybe two or more are gathered.

135
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,260
We'll have a loyal government,

136
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,640
that portion who are loyal.

137
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,460
No,
he added one exception to the pardons.

138
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:15,750
However you remember people
were going to get pardoned. Um,

139
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,120
lieutenant and above and so forth.

140
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,390
I mean it lieutenant and below
in the confederate forces,

141
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,080
he had a one exception to the pardons
and this reflected a very personal

142
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:28,290
interest of his.
He would not pardon?

143
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:33,150
He said at first at least any southerner
who owned $20,000 worth of property or

144
00:10:33,151 --> 00:10:36,120
more,
it seemed like a class appeal.

145
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,050
Nobody owned $20,000 at the planter class.
In other words,

146
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,110
was not going to get a pardon no
matter what they did during the war.

147
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,840
If they were rich, they weren't
going to be pardoned. Well,

148
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:52,870
at least until they applied for it and
the application had to be personal to the

149
00:10:52,991 --> 00:10:54,070
president of the United States.

150
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:01,250
Now this set in motion and
80 65 a bizarre process.

151
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,380
Um,

152
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:10,380
he promised clemency but only after they
made formal written applications about

153
00:11:12,221 --> 00:11:17,221
their new loyalty and what literally
occurred by the end of 1865 and then,

154
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:22,210
especially in the first months of 1866,

155
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,710
his lines formed at the White
House in Washington. Often women,

156
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:32,910
southern women came to Wa lines out doors
on a daily basis at times with their

157
00:11:32,981 --> 00:11:37,300
written applications for clemency
and pardon for participation in the

158
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:38,470
confederate war effort.

159
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,560
Yeah.

160
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,490
After one year of this process,
by May,

161
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:49,110
1866 Johnson himself at personally
signed 7,000 such pardons,

162
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,240
he wanted to make them grovel.
In other words,

163
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,453
yeah,

164
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,510
no,
why is policy but a policy nonetheless,

165
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,500
he did put in place or trieds, uh,
some so called Johnson governments.

166
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:07,210
Now instead of calling
them Lincoln governments,

167
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:08,380
they would be called Johnson Garmins.

168
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,590
And the reason John's going to get a
hold of and get away with this of course,

169
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:13,210
is you should know from reading,

170
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,980
is that Congress went out of session
in the summer of 1865 for a month.

171
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:23,950
I went on a session and Johnson
had largely a free hand to act.

172
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,413
And did he ever,

173
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,410
by December of 65,

174
00:12:30,411 --> 00:12:33,530
one a new congress would
reconvene in Washington.

175
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,663
Okay.

176
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,710
All the states and the former confederacy,

177
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:43,600
except Texas had met the
simplest of criteria,

178
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,780
had written new state constitutions,

179
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,250
had found that portion who are
loyal to form a new government,

180
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,720
and it was very tiny proportions
in some places. In fact,

181
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:57,370
there were no loyalty oath,

182
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:02,050
even even applied to
people all but one state,

183
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:04,990
Texas was ready for
readmission to the union.

184
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,160
Okay,

185
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,990
under this, uh, what actually phone
calls it in his book, the amazing quote,

186
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,150
amazing leniency of Andrew Johnson.

187
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,260
Okay.

188
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:21,260
The only major demand put upon them
was to formerly nullify their active

189
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,133
succession.

190
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,470
That's basically all they had to do.

191
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,990
Now these were whites only governments.

192
00:13:30,991 --> 00:13:35,310
These are governments formed by former
confederates and in many of these states,

193
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:39,420
of course, they began to rapidly
in the late summer or early fall,

194
00:13:39,421 --> 00:13:43,920
1865 pass. What became quickly
known as the black codes.

195
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:48,480
You've actually got a portion of the
Virginia Black codes in the gap reader.

196
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,860
I had three or four of those
laws are there in your reader,

197
00:13:52,861 --> 00:13:54,960
read them with some care.

198
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,410
These black codes mirrored
the old slave codes.

199
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:03,390
They explicitly denied the right to vote
to blacks, the right to serve on juries,

200
00:14:03,391 --> 00:14:05,610
right to hold office,
the right to own property.

201
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,730
There were all kinds of restrictive,
uh,

202
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,760
vagrancy laws pass pass laws passed where
blacks could be at any given point in

203
00:14:14,191 --> 00:14:16,230
time with,
with or without a pass.

204
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,240
And in this newly reconstructed
Johnson approach to these states,

205
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:29,400
there was a great deal of legislation
already flowing from some of these new

206
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:34,401
state legislatures meant to
directly obstruct the work
of the Freedmen's bureau.

207
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,810
The counterrevolution folks began
almost as soon as the war was over.

208
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,110
As soon as x, confederates
could find their way into power.

209
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,033
And did they ever

210
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,250
part of what went on here,
the northern mine,

211
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,130
now that's remember the blood of the wars,
not entirely dry,

212
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,880
but part of what was just simply going
on here on the northern mine is they

213
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:02,900
witnessed this.

214
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,730
And as these new states now sent their
representatives and senators after fall

215
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:10,640
election back to Washington,

216
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,600
some of them literally wearing
their confederate uniforms

217
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,760
and from Georgia came no less than as
the new US senator from Georgia Alexander

218
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:25,880
Age Stephens year ago, he was the vice
president of the confederacy. Well,

219
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:29,060
it's been six months in a Charles
town jail in Massachusetts,

220
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:34,590
allegedly arrested for his
treason against the United States,

221
00:15:35,121 --> 00:15:35,960
but it released

222
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,520
and as they began to arrive in Washington,

223
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:44,300
it was this kind of
insolence on the part of x.

224
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:49,301
Confederates did in some ways began
to stimulate what we will call radical

225
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:53,660
reconstruction.
Radical reconstruction is a plan,

226
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,060
and if owners are right on
that, he said, you know,

227
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:01,100
one of the reasons the this cadre of
Republicans succeeded is because they

228
00:16:01,101 --> 00:16:02,240
really did have a plan.

229
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:06,470
If there's a revolution going on and
something's got to be redone about your

230
00:16:06,471 --> 00:16:10,080
country, go to the
meeting with a plan. Uh,

231
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,550
James Madison did that by the way,

232
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:13,590
at their original drafting
of the constitution,

233
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,330
and you've got most of what he took,

234
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,670
but they came back to Washington with
x confederate generals, colonels,

235
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:21,631
members of that,

236
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:24,840
members of the confederate cabinet and
the vice president of the confederacy.

237
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:29,220
Jeff Davis couldn't get
elected in Mississippi yet
because Jeff Davis was still

238
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:32,190
the only x confederate still in jail.

239
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,580
He will never be formally indicted.

240
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
He spent two years at fortress
Monroe in a prison in Virginia.

241
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:48,580
Tremendous mythology has grown around
that story that he wasn't fed properly,

242
00:16:48,581 --> 00:16:49,690
that he was mistreated,

243
00:16:49,691 --> 00:16:53,560
that he got ill and wasn't giving medical
attention virtually all of which is

244
00:16:53,561 --> 00:16:56,980
nonsense. He didn't, he
wasn't terribly well at times,

245
00:16:56,981 --> 00:16:58,660
but it wasn't because he
didn't get medical attention.

246
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,630
By the time the United States government
under the Johnson administration,

247
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,830
in fact, Johnson wanted absolutely
nothing to do with trying Jefferson Davis.

248
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:14,290
But by the time they even got around
to finally formally considering it,

249
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,000
they had wasted so much time.

250
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:21,760
The Jefferson Davis will
finally be formally released,

251
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:27,370
uh, in the spring, April
to be exact of 1867,

252
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,800
two years after his arrest.

253
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:35,170
And just to show you the harbingers of
reconciliation and the political culture,

254
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,690
the people who paid his bail,
we're all northerners,

255
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,360
some of them quite famous
Horace Greeley of the new day,

256
00:17:46,361 --> 00:17:50,080
the great editor of The New York
Herald Tribune, and the abolitionist,

257
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,100
although a strange and mercurial character
by now put up the most amount and

258
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:57,030
none other than Garret Smith,

259
00:17:57,031 --> 00:18:00,030
the former radical abolitionist
from upstate New York,

260
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:05,270
who checked himself into an insane asylum
after John Brown's raid paid most of

261
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:07,020
the rest of the Bale

262
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:12,480
and Jefferson Davis
would be released April,

263
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,140
1867 to a cheering crowd in Richmond,
Virginia.

264
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:21,960
He would go on to write,
to live in the south of course,

265
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:26,160
and to write the longest,
most Turgid,

266
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:32,150
most overblown personal memoir about
a failed political movement in all of

267
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:36,510
history,
about 1300 page memoir.

268
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:41,490
Basically all arguing succession was
right in the war, wasn't about slavery,

269
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,550
uh,
enough on Davis for the moment.

270
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,330
But back to Washington when this,
when this,

271
00:18:49,331 --> 00:18:53,650
these new state governments send their
representatives to Congress beginning of

272
00:18:53,651 --> 00:18:58,450
December, that's a congress with
the obvious Republican majority

273
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,720
and they absolutely called
a halt to the whole process.

274
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,120
Here were all these people from
the south coming to take the Lord.

275
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,260
They're not loyalty oath,

276
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:12,300
but the old of office into the u s
congress and they were stopped at some of

277
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:17,301
them physically at the door and told
to go home and the Republican Party now

278
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:23,421
began to try to rest control and they
did wrest control of reconstruction away

279
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:27,180
from Andrew Johnson.
And from that day forward,

280
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:32,160
you had the beginnings
of a growing titanic,

281
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:36,000
constitutional political struggle
between president and Congress.

282
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,900
They are not of the same party to say
the least that will result in Andrew

283
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,430
Johnson's impeachment
now to the radicals for a moment.

284
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:56,490
They established what was known as
the joint committee on reconstruction.

285
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,350
They're never been such a committee really
in American history before that date.

286
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:05,610
This was to be a committee of
members of both houses of Congress,

287
00:20:05,611 --> 00:20:10,080
but they made no pretense to
bipartisanship. It had 15 members,

288
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:15,090
12 of whom are Republicans and three
Democrats. They said, thank you very much.

289
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:16,050
We don't need anymore.

290
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,910
Now they established this joint committee.

291
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,940
It began to meet in January of
[inaudible] 66 the purpose of which was to

292
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:31,101
investigate what was going on on the
ground in the south to investigate the

293
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:37,260
necessities and needs of reconstruction
to investigate the further needs of the

294
00:20:37,261 --> 00:20:42,261
Freedmen's bureau and to recommend to
Congress what legislation ought be passed

295
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,160
to reconstruct the country.

296
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,440
They held massive hearings,

297
00:20:51,441 --> 00:20:55,100
the largest such congressional hearings
in American history to that time,

298
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:00,110
they saw 144 witnesses
over about two months,

299
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:06,140
including Robert E. Lee himself, who
came up from Richmond to testify,

300
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,640
testifying essentially under orders,
and he's still was under house arrest.

301
00:21:10,641 --> 00:21:15,560
He didn't really have a choice.
They ask hundreds of questions,

302
00:21:15,561 --> 00:21:17,570
but you can boil them down to these.

303
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:23,140
They asked about the treatment of Friedman
in the south and their witnesses were

304
00:21:23,571 --> 00:21:27,740
all kinds of people, union
officers, Freedmen's bureau agents,

305
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:32,660
some white southerners for
sure, some famous, most not.

306
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,880
They ask lots of questions about the
levels of Lolo, t and disloyalty.

307
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:40,130
What were the political
attitudes of southerners?

308
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,190
They were really trying to find out what
would white south, southern is actually,

309
00:21:46,191 --> 00:21:48,290
do you know if we did that?

310
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:53,540
Now this is absolutely
crucial because we've long,

311
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:59,330
I wouldn't say assumed what we've long
wondered and there's a lot of evidence

312
00:21:59,331 --> 00:22:04,331
for this that had the white
south in its prostate state,

313
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,690
in its state of destruction and defeat.

314
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:14,420
How'd they truly been put
under an honest to God,

315
00:22:14,421 --> 00:22:17,510
legitimate near total occupation.

316
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:25,930
The assumption is among a lot of scholars
that they being the white south would

317
00:22:26,701 --> 00:22:29,720
have accepted it because
they didn't have any choice.

318
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,330
They had virtually no choice at all and
some of their leadership was already in

319
00:22:35,331 --> 00:22:36,164
exile.

320
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:39,650
I think I mentioned the other day about
eight to 10,000 x confederate leaders,

321
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:43,490
mostly military people had left
the country at least temporarily.

322
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,700
Anyway, they're trying to test a
what southern attitudes or thirdly,

323
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,460
they ask lots of questions about
the needs of the Freedmen's bureau,

324
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:57,500
what authors bureau do, what
about schools, what about
food, what about hospitals,

325
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,453
et Cetera.

326
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,950
And then they would ask about the need
for troops and the need for enforcement.

327
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:11,470
Now you may know from reading phone or
by now that the reduction in in the union

328
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:16,471
armies was overnight from
nearly a million men in arms

329
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:23,370
to a mere 15 to 20,000 by 1866

330
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,260
yeah,

331
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,080
and a fair portion of those are
being sent west to fight Indians

332
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,440
and one of the great deep myths about
the melodrama reconstruction or the loss

333
00:23:38,261 --> 00:23:41,940
cause version of reconstruction over the
years is that the south was put under

334
00:23:41,941 --> 00:23:46,941
this military occupation bayonet
rule as it so often was called

335
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,670
about the only time a union
soldier fixed the bay in it,

336
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:56,670
in all the reconstruction years was when
they put their band at on and parked to

337
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,480
defend themselves and go after the
people who were murdering and massacring

338
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:03,270
black people in Memphis
and New Orleans in 1866

339
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,670
the vast majority of union troops
throughout the reconstruction years in the

340
00:24:08,671 --> 00:24:09,420
south.

341
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:14,420
We're simply in garrison forts on the
coastlines occasionally in the cities.

342
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:22,020
The conclusions of this report,
which was by the joint committees report,

343
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:25,320
which by the way chaired by
William Pitt Fessenden of Maine,

344
00:24:25,321 --> 00:24:30,110
a moderate Republican senator, but a
key figure. He had a lot of prestige.

345
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:33,750
He'd been in the U S Senate forever.
He was an old time Republican,

346
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,960
but a moderate who had come to
see the verdict of the civil war,

347
00:24:39,421 --> 00:24:44,130
the destruction of slavery and
the challenge to make it good.

348
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,720
Their conclusions were essentially this,

349
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:53,930
and they actually use this word that
it would be quote madness to let x

350
00:24:54,571 --> 00:24:59,571
confederates run the new southern
state governments madness

351
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,480
was the word used by the
committee's report. Secondly,

352
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,350
the Johnson's style of leniency
towards reconstruction,

353
00:25:10,351 --> 00:25:12,000
and they had various
ways of putting this in.

354
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:15,420
Ferris conclusions I draw
from this was foolish

355
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,500
and the third,
and last but not least,

356
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:25,670
they made a whole series
of recommendations for what
they call safe guards that

357
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:27,720
would be necessary

358
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,660
to guarantee security in the
south and the beginnings,

359
00:25:33,661 --> 00:25:38,070
at least of a new political
regime in every state.

360
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,430
Now,

361
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:46,200
it is that Republican majority
congress of the winter,

362
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:51,201
Spring and summer of 1866 that
began to first pass the great,

363
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:56,340
the great legislation of reconstruction
and if you want to see reconstruction as

364
00:25:56,341 --> 00:26:00,300
this rise and fall requiem and why not?

365
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,670
This is the rise.

366
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:10,220
If reconstruction was a kind of bright
shining moment as dubois once called it

367
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:13,920
and black reconstruction in
1935 this was its moment,

368
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:19,280
1866 and 67 when the actual system
by which the southern states would be

369
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:23,160
readmitted to the union was put in place.

370
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:29,330
The first thing they passed was the civil
rights act of 1866 passed congress in

371
00:26:29,371 --> 00:26:31,080
April of 66.

372
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,620
This was an act of Congress
now constitutional amendment
and therefore it didn't

373
00:26:34,621 --> 00:26:35,910
require two thirds.

374
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:42,230
It was the first statutory definition
and American history of the rights of

375
00:26:43,111 --> 00:26:43,980
citizenship.

376
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:51,050
It was potentially a profound
change in federal state relations.

377
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,500
This Republican Congress
and it's leadership,

378
00:26:55,501 --> 00:27:00,000
at least it was going to do some very
new things with American federalism.

379
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,633
Now

380
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:07,990
it had a bunch of flaws.
Um,

381
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:13,270
it gave full citizenship to all
Americans regardless of race, creed,

382
00:27:13,271 --> 00:27:17,110
or color. It's said that the
first time ever in our history,

383
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,030
we'd never had a citizenship law.

384
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,720
It had never been legally
determined who was a US citizen,

385
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:28,260
but citizenship had always
implied whiteness and maleness.

386
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,950
It now had at least the definition,

387
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,310
the problem in and of course its flaw
and there'll be a flaw and a compromise

388
00:27:40,311 --> 00:27:43,910
and element and almost everything past
in these years, nothing came up pure.

389
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:47,660
Out of these terrible
debates over reconstruction.

390
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:52,690
It's great flaw was that it was directed
against public but not private acts of

391
00:27:52,701 --> 00:27:53,534
discrimination.

392
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:59,710
I might still discriminate, again,
discriminated against you in any way,

393
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:02,350
a wish privately with my business,

394
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,850
with my private facility,
with my school,

395
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,230
with a lot of ways,

396
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,340
but in terms of public civic rights,

397
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,320
it at least put in place the beginnings
of the idea of citizenship rights.

398
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:26,620
Secondly, this Congress
renewed the Freedmen's bureau.

399
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:32,020
I gave it a new life for another year
and they did this and the civil rights

400
00:28:32,021 --> 00:28:32,854
act,
by the way,

401
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,060
over the rapid and quick
veto of Andrew Johnson,

402
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,180
what's set in as early as April of 1866
was the federal government by veto,

403
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,840
Congress would pass a law. Well this
is the Civil Rights Act, the renewal,

404
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,090
the Freedmen's bureau and
numerous other things.

405
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,010
Eventually all four of the reconstruction
and acts in early 67 and Johnson would

406
00:28:54,011 --> 00:28:54,844
veto them.

407
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:00,190
Andrew Johnson in one in one and a half
years we'll issue more presidential

408
00:29:00,191 --> 00:29:03,310
vetoes and all American presidents
before him put together.

409
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,163
Okay.

410
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,850
Not the weather thing supposed to work,

411
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,020
but that's the way this was working.

412
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,570
And then for six months

413
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,190
the congress debated and let's remember,

414
00:29:22,191 --> 00:29:26,180
there's still about a one third of
this congress that are Democrat.

415
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,133
Yes.

416
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:35,040
I don't know how close I can get you
to this and I want to try at least to

417
00:29:35,111 --> 00:29:35,944
section one.

418
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:41,980
Oh dear. I don't know. Can you read

419
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,540
that? Good. Cause that's
the country you live in.

420
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,780
Oh, I'm sounding so pretentious
today. But you know what?

421
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:59,140
United States was invented at
Philadelphia in 1787 but in many ways,

422
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:05,170
and Americans still don't get this.
Don't understand it, don't know it.

423
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:11,010
The country you actually live in
was invented in 1866 in Washington.

424
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:15,250
D C is the country of the 14th amendment.

425
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,330
The 14th amendment has five parts.

426
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:26,030
It's the first one, the new one,
the one authored by John Bingham,

427
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:32,570
staunch Christian abolitionist from
Ohio into a tiny little college called

428
00:30:33,141 --> 00:30:34,280
Franklin College.

429
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:42,390
It is that first clause that
actually revolutionized,

430
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,600
if you want the revolution,

431
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,100
the 14th amendment was,

432
00:30:49,101 --> 00:30:53,920
wasn't effect the Republican
leadership's response to emancipation.

433
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:55,440
Yeah,

434
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,330
well of course the 13th amendment is too,
but the 13th amendment you'll remember,

435
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:05,340
has a second clause and said Congress
shall pass all appropriate legislation to

436
00:31:07,141 --> 00:31:10,140
enforce it. All right. Now how do
you enforce the end of slavery?

437
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,580
Was the end of slavery are to mean,

438
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,970
or as you were discussing in sections
yesterday in his phone or his chapter

439
00:31:14,971 --> 00:31:16,440
addresses,
what did freedom mean?

440
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:23,530
What the amendment did,
is it enshrined birthright in the shrine?

441
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,740
At least two things into the constitution.

442
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:29,130
Even though they're ill defined at
first and we're still fighting over them

443
00:31:29,131 --> 00:31:33,480
right now and probably two thirds of the
courts in the United States as we speak,

444
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:38,550
and by the way about two
thirds of everything and an
American case law book is a

445
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:43,410
14th amendment case. Those gigantic,
Godawful, thick case law books,

446
00:31:43,411 --> 00:31:45,180
if you ever opened one,

447
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:51,030
about two thirds of everything in
there goes through the 14th amendment.

448
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,381
Anyway,

449
00:31:52,381 --> 00:31:57,381
it didn't shrine birthright
citizenship number one and number two,

450
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,750
the beginnings of the idea of equal rights

451
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:07,290
under the constitution
took six months of debate.

452
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:11,280
It was passed finally in June of 1866

453
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,870
these were the new framers
if you want the new founders,

454
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,030
it's the first set of
challenges they faced.

455
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:29,280
Um, they've settled pretty, not easily,

456
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:32,220
but they pretty much settled
in clean and clear language.

457
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:37,250
Those first three challenges were number
one to define citizenship and who holds

458
00:32:37,861 --> 00:32:41,120
it. Now the rights act had
already begun to do that.

459
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,570
This is going to go a little further too.

460
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:49,430
They had the problem of repudiating
confederate award dense. What do you do?

461
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,440
All those debts that a confederate state
at entail toward Great Britain or Spain

462
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,470
or France or anyone else.

463
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,990
The federal government was here by saying
in a constitutional amendment that any

464
00:33:02,991 --> 00:33:07,850
debt the confederacy had entailed to any
government, any people, any bank, anybody,

465
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,210
anywhere that the you would United States,

466
00:33:11,211 --> 00:33:13,070
federal government would never pay them,

467
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:19,290
but they were also here trying to
head off of course the demands for

468
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:23,850
compensation, for loss of slave
property as a confederate debt

469
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:30,630
and three they had to face the question
now that every reconstruction plan had

470
00:33:31,031 --> 00:33:35,500
to face and then in Lincoln had it in
his and Johnson had it and even the way

471
00:33:35,501 --> 00:33:40,500
Davis Bill had it and that
is which x confederates are
going to get disqualified,

472
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:45,390
disqualified or disfranchised.
How many x confederates,

473
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:50,400
what level of disfranchisement would
there be from office holding or for that

474
00:33:50,621 --> 00:33:54,160
matter citizenship rights at all?
Rex Confederates,

475
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,520
these three,
they settled but there were three others.

476
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,200
They did not settle so easily

477
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,900
and they were the extent of the
right to vote for black men would,

478
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:14,420
would this amendment declare the right
to vote for black men everywhere are only

479
00:34:14,891 --> 00:34:18,520
in the south,
only in confederate states.

480
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:24,420
The inconvenient and terrible
problem on this one of course,

481
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:28,770
is that the very men writing this bill,
uh,

482
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:31,350
no,
that in their own northern states,

483
00:34:31,351 --> 00:34:34,470
black suffrage is not
popular to say the least.

484
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:39,860
And most northern whites still
don't want black men to vote,

485
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:45,230
especially in their own states.
The evidence of that was so clear.

486
00:34:45,231 --> 00:34:46,280
The state of Connecticut,

487
00:34:46,281 --> 00:34:50,420
this state in 1865 after the war was over,

488
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:54,350
held a special referendum
and overwhelmingly voted
down the right to vote for

489
00:34:54,351 --> 00:34:55,550
black men in Connecticut.

490
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:00,991
Secondly,

491
00:35:00,991 --> 00:35:05,550
they had to settle the extent of civil
rights declared equal before the law.

492
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:08,730
How equal which rights were

493
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,223
okay

494
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,760
at First Section of the 14th amendment
ends with the famous language of equal

495
00:35:15,761 --> 00:35:18,370
protection of the laws.

496
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,570
No one shall be deprived.

497
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:27,200
There's no state shall deprive
any person of life, liberty,

498
00:35:27,201 --> 00:35:32,030
or property without due process nor deny
any person within his jurisdiction the

499
00:35:32,031 --> 00:35:34,460
equal protection of the law.

500
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:40,410
And then the lastly,
they faced the vexing problem.

501
00:35:40,411 --> 00:35:44,730
Now, and you may have forgotten all
about this, it's easy to forget it.

502
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:49,710
How to reapportion representation
of the so called slave seats.

503
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:56,510
Those are the extra congressmen that
southern states had been given from the

504
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:02,750
1790s on through 1860 because of the
three fifths clause in the constitution.

505
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:10,100
The estimate is that between 1,818
60 the slave states in the south,

506
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:16,461
depending on when you take the snapshot
received from 20 to 30 additional

507
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:21,591
congressmen in the house because
of the three fifths clause,

508
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:26,240
because three fifths of black people
were being counted for representation.

509
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,200
Okay?

510
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,540
Now what happens is you're
gonna count all black people.

511
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,740
Yeah.

512
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:36,910
The estimate was that the south southern
states would get an additional 18 more

513
00:36:36,911 --> 00:36:37,744
congressman.

514
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,720
So when these new states
come back into the union,

515
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:46,260
they're going to have more
congressman, more power, more cloud.

516
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,170
When are you gonna do with that?

517
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,980
No,
the key players in this,

518
00:36:54,981 --> 00:36:58,160
and I want to spend through this as quick
as possible, the key players in this,

519
00:36:58,161 --> 00:37:00,260
we're on the one hand,

520
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:05,090
Thaddeus Stevens as a kind of
visionary in radical voice.

521
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,700
Stephen's would have had this
amendment go further than it did,

522
00:37:07,701 --> 00:37:09,260
especially on black suffrage.

523
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,630
Probably its greatest architect of two
of them really were John Bingham of Ohio

524
00:37:14,631 --> 00:37:19,520
and Lyman Trumbull of Illinois.
They're unsung heroes. Yeah,

525
00:37:19,521 --> 00:37:22,100
I bet you don't know anything about
John Bingham and probably nothing about

526
00:37:22,101 --> 00:37:26,210
Lyman Trumbull. Um, they're not famous.

527
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:30,350
They should be
Bingham road.

528
00:37:30,351 --> 00:37:32,750
Section one Wyman.

529
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:36,660
Trumbull wrote the 64 civil
rights at 66 civil rights sac.

530
00:37:36,661 --> 00:37:40,580
He actually wrote the 13th amendment
and he will write other parts of the

531
00:37:40,581 --> 00:37:43,970
reconstruction legislation.
John Bingham,

532
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:47,600
we'll stand up day after day in the
congress and we'll argue that emancipation

533
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:49,700
had finally forced the United States.

534
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:54,820
This is the way he always put it to apply
the bill of rights to everybody and he

535
00:37:56,271 --> 00:37:58,460
argued in his words that
what they were really doing.

536
00:37:58,461 --> 00:38:02,570
Now we're federalizing the bill of rights.
Now think about it,

537
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:05,630
American history,
it always had the bill of rights.

538
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,450
Just tick them off the first 10
amendments to the constitution,

539
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,630
you're right to religion and your
right to free speech and your right to

540
00:38:11,631 --> 00:38:13,220
assembly and on and on and on.

541
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,760
But it had never been
applied to all Americans.

542
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,780
They've never even been an assumption
that applied to all Americans.

543
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,813
Okay.

544
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:35,950
Well, um, there were others,
Charles, to some extent,

545
00:38:35,951 --> 00:38:39,670
Robert Dale, Owen of Indiana,
the old utopian community leader.

546
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,690
I was quite a visionary of this as well.
Um,

547
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,030
and some others,

548
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:51,060
but it's really a handful of six or seven
people who wrote the 14th amendment.

549
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:56,950
Now they faced tremendous
opposition day in and day out.

550
00:38:56,951 --> 00:38:59,010
Democrats would get up and say though,

551
00:38:59,011 --> 00:39:01,750
all the 14th amendment really was trying
to do is to get white and black people

552
00:39:01,751 --> 00:39:04,720
to marry each other.
They tried it out,

553
00:39:04,721 --> 00:39:09,721
the worst of white supremacy and the
worst of racism to try to trash the vision

554
00:39:09,821 --> 00:39:10,750
of the 14th amendment.

555
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:17,380
It's going to have effect eventually
in a larger American politics.

556
00:39:17,381 --> 00:39:21,700
Rest assured because the 68 presidential
election is going to be a referendum on

557
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:26,230
this and it will be without question the
most white supremacist racist election

558
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:27,860
and all of American history.
Yeah,

559
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,950
so unsettled and so blunt
that it will surprise you.

560
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:38,430
I suspect the central compromise
in the 14th amendment,

561
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,700
I'll let you read the
rest of its provisions,

562
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:48,220
but the central compromise was actually
on black suffrage. As I said, there was,

563
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:51,550
is uncomparable fact that most white
northerners didn't want black people to

564
00:39:51,551 --> 00:39:53,050
vote in the north,

565
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:59,580
so they left any enforcement of
the right to vote to the states.

566
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,283
Okay.

567
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:09,290
Now going to codify the right devote
for black males and by the way,

568
00:40:09,291 --> 00:40:12,770
it's the first time the word male
got into the u s constitution.

569
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:18,410
Very complicated important amendment
and it's going to cause it terrible

570
00:40:18,411 --> 00:40:19,310
explosion.

571
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:24,320
Actually a bad train wreck between the
women's suffrage movement and the old

572
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:26,810
abolition movement,
black and white men.

573
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:30,200
It's going to cause Elizabeth
Cady Stanton and Susan B.

574
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:35,200
Anthony and others to basically bolt
from the black suffrage movement and even

575
00:40:35,331 --> 00:40:39,800
the whole civil rights movement such
as it was during reconstruction.

576
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:43,580
And go off and fight their own crusade.

577
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,450
That's another long story we'll return to.

578
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:54,030
So instead of an outright guarantee of
the right to vote everywhere for blacks,

579
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:00,940
men, the final version left
control of suffrage to the states.

580
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:03,610
It did though in one provision,

581
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:08,640
penalize if a state to
come back into the union,

582
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,830
denied the right to vote to black men,

583
00:41:11,831 --> 00:41:16,030
it would have its representation in
Congress reduced to the proportion of the

584
00:41:16,031 --> 00:41:20,740
black males in their
state. Oh, that's fine.

585
00:41:20,741 --> 00:41:23,180
I'm going to scare many northern states
cause they don't have large black

586
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:24,014
populations.

587
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:28,363
Okay.

588
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,630
And actually they're not going to be
part of that provision because they never

589
00:41:31,631 --> 00:41:32,710
seceded from the union.

590
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:37,880
But the key thing here is
that the equality, Jeanie,

591
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:42,200
this language of equal protection,
this definition of citizenship rights,

592
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:47,150
it never happened before. The equality
Jeannie was now out of the bottle.

593
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:51,560
And for better or worse,
it could never be put back.

594
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:01,280
The equal protection clause is the most
malleable provision in the constitution.

595
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:04,010
It has been used,
uh,

596
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:08,780
to support or advance the rights
of everyone and everything,

597
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:13,460
every kind of organization you can
imagine. Cities, states, corporations,

598
00:42:13,461 --> 00:42:18,050
immigrants, women, gays and lesbians,
Anti Gay and lesbian movements, students,

599
00:42:18,051 --> 00:42:20,630
labor unions,
anti labor union movements.

600
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:26,500
It has advanced tolerance and intolerance
and has advanced affirmative action.

601
00:42:26,721 --> 00:42:28,940
And the anti affirmative action crusade,

602
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:32,750
the 14th amendment is so mainly
bullet can be used by anyone.

603
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:40,800
It's the great legal wellspring of
was in modern civil rights revolution.

604
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,520
No 14th amendment,
no civil rights movement.

605
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:47,370
And last but not least,

606
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:53,030
it is the basis of that dreadful supreme
court decision in 2000 known as Bush v

607
00:42:56,641 --> 00:42:57,474
Gore.

608
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:04,440
I didn't make that up.
Now

609
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:10,840
in this circumstance for the passage
of the civil rights act passage,

610
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:14,310
new Freedmen's bureau passage of the
14th amendment not to be sent out to the

611
00:43:14,311 --> 00:43:19,311
states for ratification comes the fall
elections of 1866 and Andrew Johnson took

612
00:43:21,511 --> 00:43:25,590
his case out on the road.
Um,

613
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:30,600
he called it the swing around the circle.
The circle was to be the union,

614
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,810
or where's my map?

615
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,510
I have a better map here.

616
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:45,043
Oops.

617
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:49,880
Well, I don't even really have the
whole north on here. Sorry about that.

618
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,693
Oh,
well

619
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:00,880
in the fall elections of 1866
these were congressional elections,

620
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,180
but the terribly important given
what's going on in Congress,

621
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:09,970
the 66 congressional elections were a
referendum on reconstruction and they came

622
00:44:09,971 --> 00:44:14,971
in the wake of two terrible racial
riots or massacres in south,

623
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:17,800
which really got northern attention.

624
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:23,160
The first was in New Orleans,
the other in Memphis.

625
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:28,290
In both cases they were essentially
police riots in Memphis.

626
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:33,291
About 40 blacks were killed and over
200 whole neighborhoods is destroyed.

627
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:36,890
Okay.

628
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:40,730
Congressional investigations
launched in New Orleans.

629
00:44:40,731 --> 00:44:45,731
The riots or massacre that was conducted
by the white police of New Orleans

630
00:44:47,571 --> 00:44:49,490
against its black community,

631
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:53,930
was stimulated by a political
parade of black Republicans.

632
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:59,380
In the late spring 1866 before the New
Orleans riot was over 34 blacks were

633
00:45:02,331 --> 00:45:03,050
killed,

634
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:07,850
about 250 wounded and
hundreds of homes destroyed.

635
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:14,320
This was the state of chaos and reaction
already going on in the south and you

636
00:45:16,851 --> 00:45:20,210
don't even really have legitimate
functioning governments yet.

637
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,960
So out on the hustings that fall,

638
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,200
the campaign appeals were on the one
hand by Democrats to prejudice and racism

639
00:45:30,871 --> 00:45:32,460
and leave the south alone.

640
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:37,800
Democrats are out on the hustings blaming
Republicans for causing that violence

641
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:40,290
in the south. If you give
black people the right to vote,

642
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:44,190
if you will let black people
move too high, too far, too
fast, et Cetera, et Cetera,

643
00:45:44,191 --> 00:45:45,024
et cetera.

644
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:50,520
And the Republicans attacking
Andrew Johnson for everything,

645
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:53,190
including his drunkenness
at his inauguration,

646
00:45:53,191 --> 00:45:58,191
but most importantly for his insolence
and obstinance and obstruction to

647
00:45:59,581 --> 00:46:03,600
reconstruction.
So Johnson took his case to the people.

648
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,440
He went on a long tour,
he called it the swing around the circle,

649
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:12,540
all over the northern states, up through
New England, all across the Midwest.

650
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,440
And he tried to be the old stump speaker
from east Tennessee and it totally

651
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:19,890
backfired on him.

652
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,510
He demanded that Ulysses
grant go with him.

653
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,270
He demanded the William h Seward
go with him, secretary of State,

654
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,560
and they reluctantly joined them. They
were after all serving him as president.

655
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:38,330
Grant Heda. This granted
into like politics. He soon.

656
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,980
Now I have to change his tune on that.

657
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:46,490
But what happened in in essence is it
Andrew Johnson went out and caused a

658
00:46:46,491 --> 00:46:49,580
gigantic embarrassment for himself,

659
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:52,040
for grant and for others.

660
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:58,530
He took out hundreds and hundreds of new
US flags that had 36 stars and not the

661
00:47:00,341 --> 00:47:01,180
25

662
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:02,860
okay.

663
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:07,860
Without the s the 11 secede as the states
and he would pass out the flags and

664
00:47:08,141 --> 00:47:12,820
everywhere he went, he would make the
same speech over and over and over.

665
00:47:12,821 --> 00:47:16,780
He would say, you would always begin
by saying, I stand on the constitution.

666
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:21,000
And then he started talking
about the traders in Congress.

667
00:47:21,001 --> 00:47:23,660
He called them traitors.
Stephen's in Sumner,

668
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:27,360
in Bingham and Fessenden
in their own states.

669
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,430
No one,
very clever.

670
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:36,640
He even engage in all kinds of on
dignified displays and certain kinds of

671
00:47:36,641 --> 00:47:39,250
vulgarity.
Crowds began to react to them.

672
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:42,490
He gives the same damn speech town
after town, after town, after town.

673
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:45,310
It'd be reprinted in the paper and
before he could get up and say,

674
00:47:45,311 --> 00:47:49,030
I stand on the constitution, and the crowd
would start saying, yeah, yeah, yeah.

675
00:47:49,031 --> 00:47:53,080
You're standing in the
constitution. Crowds started
shouting back at him saying,

676
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:55,870
shut up and stop,

677
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:00,850
and we'd rather hear grant
and chance of that sort.

678
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,760
It became in some instances,

679
00:48:05,761 --> 00:48:09,240
by the time he got to the
Midwest and Indiana and Illinois,

680
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:12,750
impossible for him even
to hold an audience.

681
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:19,680
Then finally he started to compare
himself to Jesus on the cross.

682
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,590
Never a good idea.

683
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:29,630
He was being crucified by the radical
traders wing of the Republican Party and

684
00:48:31,321 --> 00:48:32,154
Congress.

685
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,360
And then he invented a story that he had
been the one called Judas and he worked

686
00:48:38,361 --> 00:48:43,100
at, you, worked at Judas Metaphor
about as often as he could.

687
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,850
He was finally shouted off
the stage and Pittsburgh

688
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:51,710
and he just took the train and went home

689
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:59,440
and he also kept referring to
this magical circle of the union,

690
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:02,590
magical circle of the union.

691
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:05,750
And it became a parody.

692
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:10,590
And in the fall elections,

693
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:15,650
the people of the northern states return
an overwhelming majority of Republicans

694
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:18,000
to the congress,

695
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:23,600
a slightly more than two thirds
veto proof majority to the congress.

696
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:31,070
And it will be that Congress once it
convenes in December 66 and then the next

697
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:36,630
winter of [inaudible] 67 that we'll put
in place the first reconstruction act

698
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:41,730
and then three consecutive
three subsequent reconstruction
acts to enforce the

699
00:49:41,731 --> 00:49:45,030
first and that first reconstruction act.

700
00:49:45,031 --> 00:49:47,880
We will come back to next
time cause it's crucial,

701
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:51,000
but it's set up here and
you can see it on this map.

702
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:56,990
A system by which the south was to now
be divided into five military districts,

703
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,960
two or three states in each,

704
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:06,140
the x confederacy divided into five
military districts each commanded by major

705
00:50:06,421 --> 00:50:07,254
general.

706
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:12,500
That major general was to have control
over elections and electoral boards and a

707
00:50:14,221 --> 00:50:16,170
sufficient body of troops.

708
00:50:16,171 --> 00:50:21,171
It's said to enforce the electoral
process in the south and there was to be,

709
00:50:21,721 --> 00:50:24,570
according to that first
reconstruction act as we'll see,

710
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,820
a high level of confederate.

711
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:33,710
This now will be the Republican Party
taking control of reconstruction

712
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:40,330
of trying to plant the Republican party
into the south now with African American

713
00:50:40,331 --> 00:50:41,200
votes.

714
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:42,720
Okay.

715
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,280
And they will succeed

716
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:50,160
in creating Republican
control legislatures,

717
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:54,660
governors offices in all 11
of the x confederate states,

718
00:50:54,661 --> 00:50:59,661
at least at first and in some of
those states will see some remarkable

719
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:06,620
experimental democracy put in place
on precedent to that time in American

720
00:51:07,201 --> 00:51:10,080
history. Unfortunately, of course,

721
00:51:10,081 --> 00:51:15,081
what will also be stimulated and put in
place is a deeply embittered reaction

722
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:23,330
and the white south to now do whatever
it took by any means necessary to destroy

723
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:30,210
the Republican Party,
to destroy African-american autonomy,

724
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:33,330
to destroy the African
American right to vote.

725
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:38,280
And it will be organizations like the Ku
Klux Klan that had been around at least

726
00:51:38,281 --> 00:51:43,281
since 1866 but are going to explode with
fury in 1868 and between 1868 and 1871

727
00:51:46,981 --> 00:51:49,590
the Klan and its many,
many, many imitators.

728
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:55,520
We'll engage in a kind of violence as
real politics to try to take back control

729
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,490
of the political south.

730
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:05,960
And I'll leave you there hanging
with goodwill.
