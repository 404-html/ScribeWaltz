1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,650
In a speech before the
Virginia secession convention

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,320
in 1861 late April,

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,200
the wake of the firing on Fort Sumpter,

4
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,230
the newly elected sort of appointed
vice president of the confederacy,

5
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:22,790
Alexander H.

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:27,470
Stephens gave a speech that became quickly
known to history as his cornerstone

7
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:28,304
speech.

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,070
Yeah,

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,600
this is spring 1861 Alexander
aches Stevens, a Georgian,

10
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,090
a slave holder,

11
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:41,590
old friend and colleague of
Abraham Lincoln's ironically
said the cornerstone of

12
00:00:42,221 --> 00:00:43,210
the confederacy,

13
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:48,211
the cornerstone of their political
movement was what he called American Negro

14
00:00:49,211 --> 00:00:50,044
slavery.

15
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,780
It was the cornerstone on which
they had founded their revolution.

16
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,470
The quote goes on as a race,

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,170
the African is inferior to the white man.

18
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,750
Subordination to the white
man is his normal condition.

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,740
He is not his equal by nature and
cannot be made so by human laws or human

20
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:21,060
institutions. Our system, therefore,

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,360
so far as regards to this inferior race,

22
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,460
rests upon this great
immutable law of nature.

23
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,960
You always have to get worried in history
when people start to start talking

24
00:01:38,961 --> 00:01:39,794
about

25
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,590
how human beings or human behavior

26
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,950
is rooted in nature.

27
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:55,210
But how do we get to 1861 and that's
the session crisis with Alexander Age.

28
00:01:55,211 --> 00:01:59,600
Steven's delivering this
cornerstone speech, declaring that,

29
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,400
hey folks, it's all about
slavery and its preservation.

30
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,380
How did we get there today I want to
talk about, we're going to dwell on

31
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,700
ultimately the southern
defense of slavery.

32
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,350
The argument's over time that
they develop layer upon layer,

33
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,250
drawing upon earlier arguments,
building them into new ones,

34
00:02:24,251 --> 00:02:26,680
sometimes quite original toward old,

35
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,800
toward ultimately a virtually utopian
defense of slavery as a perfecting

36
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,950
perfectible if not perfected system.

37
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,990
Now I want to say one of the quick
thing before we get to the substance.

38
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,730
1,000 times in a thousand ways,

39
00:02:45,731 --> 00:02:50,230
anybody who studies the American
civil war period is inevitably ass.

40
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,480
Okay?

41
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,830
So what caused this war?

42
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,910
So of course the question of
the first third of this course.

43
00:02:56,911 --> 00:03:01,780
So what caused it
yesterday on ml king day,

44
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:05,740
I had the privilege of being on the least
for radio programs about this new book

45
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:10,570
I wrote called the slave no more.
Some of them quite terrific. Uh,

46
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,810
Minnesota public radio does
a fabulous hour long program,

47
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,880
but one of them was on a Nashville,

48
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:20,881
Tennessee radio station on a program
at 5:30 PM called drive time.

49
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:27,100
And the host was Harry or peach or whoever
he was. I'd been on too many of these.

50
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,220
First question was, so, professor,

51
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,070
what was the civil war about?

52
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,560
Now do that in a soundbite on Nashville
radio station when you got two minutes

53
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:42,660
to answer. Well, Pete, you see, uh,

54
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:47,460
there was this free labor
system in the slave labor
system, blah, blah, blah, blah.

55
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,270
I tried to sound byte this and I ended
up saying something silly like, you know,

56
00:03:54,271 --> 00:03:56,460
Pete,
I'm teaching a whole course on this.

57
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,473
Yeah.

58
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,930
And I finally just ended that particular
little exchange before he went on to

59
00:04:05,931 --> 00:04:10,931
rant at me about what all is wrong
with American education by saying Pete.

60
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,700
Uh,
it was slavery

61
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,080
and Alexis de Tocqueville's
great democracy in America,

62
00:04:21,081 --> 00:04:26,081
which you published in 1831 or a Polish
name 37 after his famous nine month tour

63
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,720
of the United States,

64
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:34,750
the most famous book travel book ever
written about America by a foreigner.

65
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,570
And democracy in America.

66
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:43,571
There's that famous passage or passages
on Tocqueville crosses the Ohio River

67
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:50,590
from Ohio in the Kentucky from free soil
and the slave soil free state into a

68
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,550
slave state talk.

69
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,940
People you may know didn't spend a great
deal of time in the south though he

70
00:04:55,941 --> 00:04:58,200
traveled all across the south,

71
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,720
spent oh at least two thirds of is more
than about three quarters of his time in

72
00:05:02,721 --> 00:05:03,860
the northern states,

73
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,660
but when he crossed into Kentucky,

74
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,640
he wrote this letter to his
father for the first time.

75
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,670
This is of course the French
Aristocrat de Tocqueville.

76
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,950
For the first time we have had the
chance to examine the effect that slavery

77
00:05:21,951 --> 00:05:26,210
produces on a society on
the right bank of the Ohio.

78
00:05:26,211 --> 00:05:30,380
Everything is activity.
Industry. Labor is honored.

79
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,620
There are no slaves pass to the
left bank and the scene changes.

80
00:05:35,691 --> 00:05:40,010
So suddenly that you think yourself
on the other side of the world,

81
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,690
the enterprising spirit seems gone.

82
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,990
Their work is not only painful,

83
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:52,490
it's shameful and you degrade yourself
and submitting yourself to it.

84
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,640
To ride, to hunt, to smoke
like a Turk isn't a song.

85
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,780
It's a thing like a Turk in the sunshine.

86
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:05,170
There's the destiny of the white man to
do any other kind of manual labor is to

87
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:08,600
act like a slave.

88
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,223
Okay.

89
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,103
Now,

90
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,120
Tocqueville was of course responding
from his own kind of French aristocratic

91
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:18,650
heart to some extent.

92
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:24,080
He was drawn in a bit to certain
kinds of southern charm. The whites,

93
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:28,940
he said of the south form
a veritable aristocracy,

94
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:33,440
which combines many prejudices
with high sentiments and instincts.

95
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,190
He probably over judged the
scale of that aristocracy.

96
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,230
Yeah.

97
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,130
They say,

98
00:06:41,131 --> 00:06:46,131
and I am much inclined to beliefs that
Tocqueville that in the matter of honor,

99
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:52,020
these men practice, delicacies and
refinements unknown in the north.

100
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,670
They are frank,

101
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,710
hospitable and put many
things before money.

102
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,470
Oh,
they'd love that.

103
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:06,120
When we start hearing from our
pro slavery advocates and writers,

104
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:11,540
they would have loved that because one
of the critiques that slavery allowed

105
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:16,701
pro-slavery writers ultimately to make
was a critique of a certain kind of

106
00:07:16,921 --> 00:07:21,870
capitalism, the greedy,
grinding, aggressive,

107
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,140
malicious kind of capitalism.

108
00:07:25,141 --> 00:07:28,470
They believed the north body,

109
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:35,980
but charm alone didn't seem to make a
great society. According to Tocqueville,

110
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,850
you see few churches and no
schools here in the south.

111
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,880
He observed society like the
individual seems to provide nothing.

112
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,220
The south would end.

113
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:53,670
He said by being dominated by the north
every day the latter grows more wealthy

114
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,280
and densely populated while the south
is stationary and growing poor and not

115
00:08:04,271 --> 00:08:08,140
entirely accurate about that either
from what we now know about the

116
00:08:08,141 --> 00:08:12,310
profitability of slavery and
profitability of the cotton crop,

117
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,470
but he ends that famous
section with this passage.

118
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,390
It is kind of haunting when you think
it's only 1831 when he writes this and

119
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:27,580
that civil war is still 30 years away.
Slavery,

120
00:08:27,581 --> 00:08:32,581
brutalizes the black population and
debilitates the white man is not made for

121
00:08:35,951 --> 00:08:40,210
servitude.
Now

122
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,160
in the south,
what developed,

123
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,560
and let's define it at least quickly,

124
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,400
what developed was one of the world's
handful of true slave societies.

125
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,680
What is a slave society?

126
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:02,250
What do we mean when we use
that phrase slave society?

127
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,460
Essentially it means any society

128
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,140
where slave labor or the
definition of labor, where the,

129
00:09:15,141 --> 00:09:20,141
where the definition of the relationship
between ownership and labor is defined

130
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:25,430
by slavery by a cradle to grave.

131
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:30,431
And some would have even said a cradle
to grave and beyond human bondage or

132
00:09:31,161 --> 00:09:35,960
slavery affected everything about society
were whites and blacks in this case in

133
00:09:35,961 --> 00:09:39,740
America,
in a racialized slavery system grew up,

134
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,960
we're socialized by married rear children,

135
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,303
worked,

136
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:51,970
invested in and conceived of the idea
of property and home their most basic

137
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:59,050
habits and values under the influence
of a system that said it was just to own

138
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,920
people as property.

139
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,850
The other slave societies
in human history.

140
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,400
And you can get up a real
debate over this, uh,

141
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,000
especially among Africanists,

142
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:16,850
Brazilian east Asianist and others.

143
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,280
And it's why slavery is such a hot
field and in international history,

144
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:27,850
but the other great slave societies in
history where the whole social structure

145
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:33,800
of those societies was rooted in
slavery or ancient Greece and Rome,

146
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,930
certainly Brazil by the
18th and 19th century,

147
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,580
the whole of the Caribbean,
the Great West indies,

148
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,140
sugar producing empires of the French.

149
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:52,250
The British, the Dutch, the
Spanish, and a few others,

150
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,760
and the American south.

151
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,773
Now

152
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,670
there were other localized slave society,
surely,

153
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,150
certainly within Africa
to a certain degree,

154
00:11:05,151 --> 00:11:08,420
even before Europeans arrived and
certainly after Europeans arrived,

155
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,990
particularly after the regularization
of the Atlantic slave trade,

156
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:17,380
there were certain localized slave
societies in east Africa out of Zanzibar.

157
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,570
By the 18th and 19th century,

158
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,830
there were certain localized slave
societies in the vast Arab world and the

159
00:11:24,831 --> 00:11:26,870
Muslim world,
uh,

160
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:30,700
well before there was even an
Atlantic slave trade to the Americans.

161
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,500
The five great slave societies
were those fine. Yeah.

162
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,570
All we're highly
profitable in their primes.

163
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:48,550
All tended to hinder technological
innovation in those societies.

164
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:58,750
All tended to have a high slave
to free ratio of population.

165
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:06,330
All of those slave societies had a
population of slaves that was from one

166
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:10,930
quarter to one half and sometimes
more of the total population.

167
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:13,350
Okay.

168
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,830
In those slave societies,
slaves as an interest,

169
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,690
as an interest.

170
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:22,470
Okay.

171
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:27,470
We're both a political and
a great economic institution

172
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,400
that defined

173
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,410
ways of life.

174
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,203
Now

175
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,390
when exactly did the American south
become a slave society? You know, is it

176
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:52,410
1820 the Missouri crisis
in that settlement and at
least the beginnings now of

177
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:00,020
of a clarity of its expansion or was it
more the 1830s when you got this booming

178
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:07,630
cotton production happening finally and
Alabama and Mississippi and Louisiana?

179
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:12,631
Or was it 1840 or was it really in the
wake of the Mexican war when you get this

180
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:16,720
massive expansion into the the great
southwest and the Mexican session,

181
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,860
which will take up actually next week.
That's,

182
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:25,150
that's always open to debate exactly
when the south became a slave society,

183
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,740
but I think it became in most ways and
in most definitions of slave societies,

184
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:34,741
surely by the 1820s or the 30s now
one aspect of that slave society.

185
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:39,760
Then I'll focus on it
just at least briefly

186
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,160
is that as Americans ended the foreign
slave trade and we did an 1808 this is,

187
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,840
this month is the bicentennial of the
legal end of America's participate in

188
00:13:56,221 --> 00:13:59,860
United States participation
in the foreign slave trade.

189
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:04,890
I didn't entirely in and there were
some south Carolinians and Georgians who

190
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:09,180
wanted to reopen it and a few folks out
in Louisiana who wanted to reopen it.

191
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,490
It numerous times in
the antebellum periods,

192
00:14:11,491 --> 00:14:15,760
especially in the late 1850s
there were the same people.

193
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:19,780
We're always trying to annex
Cuba about four times over.

194
00:14:19,781 --> 00:14:23,440
They tried to annex Cuba and it's still
a bit of a mystery how it never happened,

195
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:28,600
but as the foreign slave trade was closed
off for a whole variety of reasons,

196
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,120
only one of which was that there was this
passage sort of a vow and the original

197
00:14:36,661 --> 00:14:40,980
constitution that the question would
be revisited in 20 years in 1808 was 20

198
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:41,814
years.

199
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:42,930
Okay.

200
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,360
But as the foreign
slave trade was cut off,

201
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:49,740
the domestic American slave
trade absolutely boomed.

202
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,280
And one the reasons that the American
south could become such a profitable slave

203
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:55,791
society.

204
00:14:55,791 --> 00:15:00,791
One of the reasons that the cotton boom
could be the cotton boom is because,

205
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,640
yeah.

206
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,760
One of the unique features
of North American slavery,

207
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,310
US s slavery is,

208
00:15:08,311 --> 00:15:12,960
or was that it was the only slave
population in the entire new world.

209
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,010
Brazil managed to now and then,
but not in the long run.

210
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,770
It's the only slave society in,

211
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,860
in the new world or the slaves
naturally reproduce themselves.

212
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:29,370
That has to do with climate, that has
to do with sex ratio, male to female.

213
00:15:29,371 --> 00:15:33,870
It has to do with diet and
it has to do with movement.

214
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:39,790
If Frederick Jackson Turner had
anything right and the frontier thesis,

215
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,180
so the hidden apparently
any attention to the south,

216
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:46,020
this idea of a safety
valve of a west to move to,

217
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,850
we're surely there for slavery

218
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,160
between 1810 and 1820 alone.

219
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:59,050
This is the decade of the war of 1812
which caused all kinds of chaos on the

220
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,040
western frontier.

221
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,520
137,000 American slaves were forced
to move from North Carolina or the

222
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:10,120
Chesapeake states to Alabama,
Mississippi,

223
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,690
and other western regions.
That's in the one decade of the teens.

224
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,043
Okay.

225
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:20,070
Then from 1820 to 1860 the 40 years
before the war and estimated roughly 2

226
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:26,280
million American slaves were sold to
satisfy the need of slave labor in the

227
00:16:28,031 --> 00:16:29,080
great cotton kingdom.

228
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,080
Okay.

229
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,730
Of the growing South West?

230
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,853
No.

231
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:41,040
About roughly two thirds of those 2
million slaves move from the eastern

232
00:16:42,311 --> 00:16:46,810
seaboard or the upper south to Alabama,
Louisiana,

233
00:16:46,811 --> 00:16:49,060
Mississippi, Texas, Arkansas, et cetera.

234
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,300
About two thirds of those
went by outright sale

235
00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:00,630
by financial speculation and now a
growing huge American business of the

236
00:17:02,941 --> 00:17:07,620
domestic slave trade.
By the 1830 [inaudible] 1840 [inaudible],

237
00:17:07,621 --> 00:17:10,080
there were over 100 men in Charleston,

238
00:17:10,081 --> 00:17:15,081
South Carolina alone making their
livings fulltime as slave traders.

239
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:16,900
Okay.

240
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,150
Their ads were in the
newspapers every day,

241
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:19,990
okay.

242
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,340
Many of them own their own shops and their
own in effect jails where they housed

243
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,833
people.

244
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,680
Other cities became major ports
are places of deportation.

245
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,330
Okay.

246
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,060
For the domestic slave trade,
Richmond, Virginia, for example,

247
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,680
became a huge slave trading center,
uh,

248
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,850
by the 1840 [inaudible] and 1850s,

249
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,360
it had two depending on when you look
to three dozen major fulltime slave

250
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:52,170
traders. One of the richest
was a man named Hector Davis.

251
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:57,860
Hector Davis owned a two stories slave
auction house in jail on 14th and

252
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:02,820
Franklin streets' just two blocks down
the hill from Thomas Jefferson's glorious

253
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,860
Capitol building of the State of Virginia.

254
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:09,450
Just two blocks down the hill from
that great equestrian statue of George

255
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,283
Washington,
the founder,

256
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,790
you could find a huge slave
jail owned by Hector Davis.

257
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:18,210
Fector Davis kept tremendous records.
He kept the account books,

258
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:19,410
huge account books.

259
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,330
One of those account books ended up in
the Chicago historical society after the

260
00:18:24,331 --> 00:18:28,260
civil war because it was confiscated by
an Illinois regiment that took it home.

261
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:33,950
And I worked with that
account book because one of
the two slaves I write about

262
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,580
and this new book called a
slave no more published there.

263
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:42,590
Two narratives was indeed a young 14
year old teenagers sold out of North

264
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,210
Carolina, uh, from Snow
Hill, North Carolina.

265
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:48,360
He was sold 1960 to
Hector Davis in Richmond.

266
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,920
Actor Dave purchased him for
$900 for about six months.

267
00:18:52,921 --> 00:18:56,230
Wallace turnage worked in Hector Davis,
a slave auction house,

268
00:18:56,231 --> 00:19:00,390
helping organize the auctions every day.
And one day the Wallace was told today,

269
00:19:00,391 --> 00:19:01,620
boy,
you're in the auction.

270
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,270
And he was sold for $1,000 to an Alabama
cotton planner who came up to Richmond

271
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:09,660
twice a year to buy slaves
and 72 hours by train.

272
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:13,260
He found himself on a huge cotton
plantation. And your Pickens Ville,

273
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:18,261
Alabama on the UN in West Central
Alabama on the Mississippi border.

274
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:19,470
Yeah,

275
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,790
at 14 years old.

276
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,030
Okay.

277
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,600
Martin Wireless Turner's
later in the course, he, he'll
be sold again, by the way,

278
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:30,960
a third time for $2,000 in mobile,

279
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:35,961
Alabama that the at the mobile slave
jail I calculated and Hector Davis,

280
00:19:36,781 --> 00:19:41,340
his account book at the biggest weak
he had and he had some big weeks,

281
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,940
but he had a week in 1859 where he made
a cool approximately $120,000 in profit

282
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,110
just from selling slave.

283
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,050
I mean the equivalent of a of
a healthy teenage male slave.

284
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:58,690
If you could sell them
for $1,000 in 1861 up.

285
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,910
It's about the same price of
a good Toyota Camry today.

286
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:12,410
And when I go to the Aon Toyota for
my service or to buy my new Camry,

287
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:15,230
which I've done every four
years for the last two decades,

288
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:19,290
I don't always think of a slave
market, but it does occur to me. But

289
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,123
yeah,

290
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,370
they just sell those
Toyota's that they tell you.

291
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:27,840
Here's the price we don't bargain.

292
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:32,743
Okay.

293
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,470
The south was part of
the westward movement

294
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,220
for slave children.

295
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,400
One of the little point about this so we
can get a sense of this system that is

296
00:20:45,441 --> 00:20:50,441
now about to be justified and for slave
children between eight and 20 and 1860

297
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,080
living in the upper south
or the eastern seaboard.

298
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:01,980
They had approximately a 30% chance
of being sold outright away from their

299
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:05,830
parents before they were 10

300
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,433
now,

301
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:16,310
just to give you a sense of how cold and
calculated this business was and how in

302
00:21:17,851 --> 00:21:22,170
many ways the first defense
or justification of of
slavery in America is of

303
00:21:22,171 --> 00:21:25,650
course it's certainly is by
the late antebellum period.

304
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:29,490
It is an unabashed economic defense.
As we'll see

305
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,230
ads and newspapers like this one in
Charleston would read Negros wanted,

306
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:42,270
I am paying the highest cash prices
for young and likely negroes.

307
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,400
Those having good front teeth
and being otherwise sound.

308
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:54,560
It's all about market forces and the
health and the condition of your product.

309
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,450
Probably the best book written on this,

310
00:21:57,451 --> 00:22:01,230
particularly on the language of the
domestic slave trade is Walter Johnson's

311
00:22:01,231 --> 00:22:03,480
book called soul by soul book.

312
00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:06,720
I highly recommend you read it
sometime and were reading lives,

313
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:12,210
but it's amazing to read the letters in
the language of slave traders when they

314
00:22:12,211 --> 00:22:16,260
write to each other.
The complacency,

315
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,070
the mixture of,
of,

316
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:23,090
of just pure racism on the one hand and
just business language on the other.

317
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:29,880
I refused a girl 20 years
old at $700 yesterday,

318
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:34,881
one trade or wrote to another in 1853 if
you think best to take her at 700 I can

319
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:40,530
still get her. She is very badly
whipped but has good teeth.

320
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,261
Bought a cook.

321
00:22:44,261 --> 00:22:49,261
Yesterday I wrote another trader bought
a cook yesterday that was to go out of

322
00:22:50,051 --> 00:22:54,430
the state. She just made
the people mad. That was all

323
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,211
I have bought.

324
00:22:57,211 --> 00:23:02,211
A boy named Isaac wrote another trader
for $1,100 he writes to this in 1854 to

325
00:23:04,741 --> 00:23:07,530
his partner,
bought a boy named Isaac

326
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:12,860
I think in very prime.
He is a house servant,

327
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,730
first rate cook and
splendid carriage driver.

328
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,240
He is also a fine painter and varnish
shirt and says he can make a fine panel

329
00:23:22,431 --> 00:23:26,840
door. Also, he performs
well on the violin.

330
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:32,890
He is a genius and it's strange to
say I think he's smarter than I am.

331
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,783
Yeah,

332
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:47,140
truth always creeps through all
of our language. Doesn't always,

333
00:23:47,141 --> 00:23:50,260
but sometimes creeps through our language,

334
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,880
doesn't it?
Now,

335
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,790
how has slavery defended

336
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,660
in many ways to say the least,

337
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:09,190
but I want to give you at
least some sense of the,

338
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,280
the development of the pro
slavery argument of the
kinds of arguments that were

339
00:24:14,841 --> 00:24:19,640
used, how they changed over
time. Who made the argument

340
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,473
now

341
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:28,510
the best way to begin to understand pro
slavery ideology or whether we're in the

342
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:33,761
early period of its defense in the 1820s
we're actually a quite vigilant defense

343
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:36,080
of slavery begins early.

344
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:41,110
It isn't something that just sprung from
southern pins and the 1850s during all

345
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:43,850
this expansion.
It comes very early,

346
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:49,010
but a framework in which done to standard
is it pro slavery ideology was at its

347
00:24:49,011 --> 00:24:52,880
heart a kind of deeply conservative,

348
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:55,040
organic world view,

349
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,810
and by that I mean a
Berkey and conservatism,

350
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:05,700
a set of beliefs that says the world
is ordered as it is for reasons

351
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:13,910
and then human beings ought not
tinker with that order very much.

352
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:21,210
It was a set of beliefs in the
sustenance of a social order as it is.

353
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:23,920
Okay.

354
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,920
It was a belief in a hierarchical
conception of not only society,

355
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:34,540
but if people that people were conceived,

356
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:37,870
whether by nature or by
God or even by evolution.

357
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:39,980
Okay,

358
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,720
well a certain order to them.
So I'm born to do this. Yes,

359
00:25:43,721 --> 00:25:45,830
I'm born to do that and
some born to do that.

360
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,440
It's an organic conception of the world.

361
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:55,090
It just is the way it is.
It's natural.

362
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,940
Remember back to Alexander H.
Stevens cornerstone quote.

363
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:03,230
He uses the word natural
twice in that pasture.

364
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:08,240
This worldview had, of course,
an obsession was stability.

365
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,810
Okay.

366
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:13,740
It's one of the reasons white
southerners didn't like reformers.

367
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,290
It's one of the reasons abolitionists,
they're dangerous.

368
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:20,370
What are abolition is calling
for upsetting the social order.

369
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:26,180
They're offering a critique of
the social order and they're even,

370
00:26:26,181 --> 00:26:28,790
they even have the audacity
to talk about good and evil.

371
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:35,710
It's just, it's a worldview often
obsessed, as we said last time,

372
00:26:35,711 --> 00:26:38,260
what notions of honor and duty,

373
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:44,370
and it's a worldview deeply rooted
in the idea or for tradition,

374
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:51,860
tradition and social
control and this worldview,

375
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,060
institutions,

376
00:26:53,061 --> 00:26:57,830
human institutions evolve only slowly
over time and cannot be altered.

377
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,570
Why? Abrupt human
interventions? It's dangerous,

378
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:06,400
too abruptly intervene in the
evolution of human institutions.

379
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,700
I think what's at stake
here in this world view,

380
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:15,420
especially as we transition next Thursday
to a developing though by no means

381
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:22,050
unanimous or homogenous northern
worldview in which reform impulses get

382
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:26,883
embedded.

383
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,280
Okay.

384
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,040
White southern defenders of slavery.

385
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:37,041
We're to some extent like other
Americans products of the enlightenment.

386
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,490
Yeah.

387
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:42,160
Some of them come to really
believe in intellect.

388
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:48,060
They really do come to believe in the
power of reason though human beings to

389
00:27:48,061 --> 00:27:49,530
figure out the universe.

390
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:50,850
Yeah.

391
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,530
But to figure it out in different ways.

392
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,340
You can be a product of the enlightenment
and still be deeply conservative.

393
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,320
Yeah.

394
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,430
You can be a product of the enlightenment
and with the faith and reason and not

395
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:08,431
become a romantic well begins to believe
in the possibilities of man or even the

396
00:28:10,441 --> 00:28:11,790
perfectibility of man

397
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:19,200
conservative as conservativism deep
organic forms of conservative activism is

398
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:22,151
not antithesis,

399
00:28:22,151 --> 00:28:27,151
is not antithetical to the enlightenment
and he's not entirely Arlo pro slavery

400
00:28:27,931 --> 00:28:30,470
writers will become deeply,
uh,

401
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,200
contemptuous of natural law of natural
law doctrine as it can be applied to the

402
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,520
possibilities of man.

403
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,290
Okay.

404
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:49,290
Many of them will argue therefore that
ideas like freedom and I that idea of

405
00:28:49,721 --> 00:28:53,800
liberties so much at stake in the age of
the American revolution and falling off

406
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:57,820
everybody's tongue and eventually falling
off of their tongues and off their

407
00:28:57,821 --> 00:28:58,900
pens as well.

408
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:00,130
Yeah.

409
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:03,280
What they're fighting for by
1861 where their liberties,

410
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,470
they said over and over
and over and over again,

411
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:10,360
but in their worldview,
the pro slavery worldview,

412
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,690
he's like freedom and liberty
were simply never. Absolutely.

413
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:15,210
Okay.

414
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:19,620
And many of them will directly reverse
Thomas Jefferson's declaration of

415
00:29:19,621 --> 00:29:24,240
independence and simply say,
nobody is born equal.

416
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:27,460
Okay.

417
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,770
They will argue over
and over and over again.

418
00:29:29,771 --> 00:29:32,260
Some of them almost in a feudalistic way,

419
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:37,980
that freedom must always be balanced
with order and that order is rooted in

420
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:43,960
certain kinds,
prescribes stations in life

421
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:49,380
for the various statuses of humans

422
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,990
or freedom, they will argue
must be balanced with tradition.

423
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,860
The possibilities of freedom must always,
in their view,

424
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,940
be balanced with the world as
it is not as it ought to be.

425
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,180
Yeah.

426
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:12,180
They are therefore going to have an
extremely different point of view from at

427
00:30:12,191 --> 00:30:17,191
least abolitionists in the north
and this concept of equality.

428
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,790
Although a lot of abolitionists had
their struggles with this one too.

429
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:28,140
Southern pro slavery defenders are much
more likely to stress a human's duty

430
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:34,130
then there ever distress a humans rights.

431
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,880
They believe that the world was made up
of a struggle between human autonomy on

432
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:45,790
the one hand and human
dependency on the other,

433
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,220
and you should never give up on that.
Dependency

434
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:57,380
is early as 1826 and important pro-slavery
writer name Edward Brown argued that

435
00:30:57,721 --> 00:31:00,390
slavery, he said, quote,

436
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,720
had ever been the stepping ladder by which
nations have passed from barbarism to

437
00:31:07,801 --> 00:31:08,790
civilization.

438
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:14,580
There you have the roots in the kernel
of the so called positive good thesis

439
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:15,683
about slavery,

440
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,400
but slavery was a way in which
you sustained a social order,

441
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,860
a way in which you built an economy,

442
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:27,600
a way in which you maximize the
possibilities of those who deserved it

443
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,860
by using those who did not deserve.

444
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:35,510
Okay.

445
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,650
The same fruits.

446
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,813
Okay.

447
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:47,390
Pro Slavery Writers, you have to
understand outhouse. So it really, uh,

448
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,820
often a fundamentally different conception
of history itself or how history

449
00:31:53,101 --> 00:31:53,934
happens.

450
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:59,570
Then we'll many eventually
northern antislavery writers,

451
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:05,420
even eventually the political antislavery
folks like an Abraham Lincoln.

452
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:14,720
It was never a real abolition is but
did at least grow up with antislavery in

453
00:32:14,721 --> 00:32:15,554
his heart.

454
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,430
Yeah.

455
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:22,290
Thomas are do very important pro-slavery
writer who wrote a whole book in the

456
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:27,291
wake of the state of Virginia's debates
in 1830 and 32 or 30 and 31 31 32 over

457
00:32:30,361 --> 00:32:35,361
whether to rewrite its constitution and
they squared the faced the question of a

458
00:32:37,321 --> 00:32:41,690
gradual abolition plan for the
of Virginia in 1831 and 32,

459
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,400
they had been planning to
rewrite their constitution.

460
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,450
Extraordinary turning
point in southern history.

461
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,560
The problem was of course
nat Turner's insurrection.

462
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:53,180
It just occurred in October of 1831 and
they held these debates in the wake of

463
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:58,160
it and do wrote a forceful defense
of slavery in the wake of this,

464
00:32:58,161 --> 00:32:59,600
which became kind of a,

465
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,080
a seminal text for all future pro slavery
writers among the many things he said.

466
00:33:05,181 --> 00:33:08,690
And that was this simple
sense of how history happens.

467
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,140
There is a time for all things wrote,
do,

468
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:16,700
and nothing in this world
should be done before its time.

469
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,860
And what would you do if
your parents told you that

470
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,233
they probably have?

471
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,670
What would you do if your professors
told you that all the time?

472
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,980
Stop trying to change things.

473
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:34,940
Nothing will change before it's time.

474
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:42,840
You'll probably get bored
or angry or who knows?

475
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,780
Maybe you would just agree.
I don't know.

476
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:49,110
Youth are supposed to be impatient

477
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,260
now.
Um,

478
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,600
there are many ways to
look at pro slavery,

479
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,180
deep,
deep,

480
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,710
and the pro slavery argument.

481
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,340
I'm going to give you categories
here to hang your hats on.

482
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,880
Deepened the pro slavery
argument is a biblical argument.

483
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,590
Almost all pro slavery writers at one
point or another will dip into the Old

484
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:22,520
Testament or dip into the new testament.
They, especially with dip to the old,

485
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:28,580
to show how slavery is an ancient
and venerable institution.

486
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:32,990
It's venerability was its own argument.
Some set, it's always been around.

487
00:34:32,991 --> 00:34:37,520
Every civilization has had it.
All those biblical societies had it.

488
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,330
You can read Jeremiah and Isaiah and some
of the Great Old Testament prophets in

489
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,250
some ways as defenders of slavery.

490
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:46,750
Okay?

491
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:50,380
You can therefore assume
it was divinely sanctioned.

492
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:58,340
You can also look in the New Testament
for examples of it, justifications of it.

493
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:04,790
Slaves be out, be honorable,
be be dutiful, be obedient.

494
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:08,720
It's usually the word in the King James
Slaves. Be Obedient to your masters.

495
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,780
Slavery's all over the Bible
and one way or another,

496
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:17,420
the Bible of course can
breathe antislavery into a
situation and it can breathe

497
00:35:17,421 --> 00:35:19,190
pro slavery into a situation.

498
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:20,890
Okay.

499
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:25,090
A second kind of set of arguments I've
already referred to are the historical

500
00:35:25,091 --> 00:35:29,080
ones. Here it is not just
the venerability of slavery,

501
00:35:29,081 --> 00:35:30,490
how old it is,

502
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:38,390
but it's the idea that it has been
crucial to development of all great

503
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:39,930
civilizations.

504
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,430
That slavery may have its bad aspects,

505
00:35:44,431 --> 00:35:47,700
but it has been the creek,
the engine of good.

506
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:53,130
It has been the engine of empires, the
engine of wealth, the engine of greatness.

507
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,470
How would you have had Cicero?

508
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:00,500
How would you have had the great
Roman philosophers and thinkers?

509
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,110
How would you have had the
great Greek playwrights?

510
00:36:04,111 --> 00:36:08,520
They would argue without the system,
the world,

511
00:36:08,521 --> 00:36:11,640
the Greeks were able to
create with the hell lots,

512
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:15,030
but at the base of all societies,

513
00:36:15,031 --> 00:36:20,031
there has to be a labor system that
will support the possibility of Plato.

514
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,023
Yeah.

515
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,610
Personally,
radiology is also,

516
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,630
yeah,

517
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:34,430
part of, at the same time, it's
resistant to the greatest product,

518
00:36:34,431 --> 00:36:37,880
arguably, of the enlightenment, and
that is the idea of natural rights,

519
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,670
natural law and natural rights,

520
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:45,700
rights by birth rights from
God being born with certain

521
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,113
capacities.

522
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:55,370
I personally, every writers were
inspired by this to some extent,

523
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:02,120
but many of them will simply convert it.
They will convert it.

524
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:07,100
They'll take portions of John Locke
that they like and not the others.

525
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:12,430
And they'll say the real rule of
the world is not natural equality,

526
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,690
but it is natural inequality.

527
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:24,110
Humans are not all born the
same with the same capacities,

528
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:24,944
abilities.

529
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,853
Now

530
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:40,640
then there's a whole array of
economic arguments and the cynic,

531
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:46,120
the economic determinists simply goes to
the economic conclusions of pro slavery

532
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:49,010
and nowhere else.
Um,

533
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,400
one of the greatest of these
writers was James Henry Hammond,

534
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:00,560
South Carolina planner who had
plenty of mixed race children.

535
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:06,230
He was in some ways the epitome of
the kind of cynical pro slavery.

536
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,940
And the end of the day he
wasn't bothered by morality.

537
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,020
His argument for slavery was
that it ultimately it was amoral.

538
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,690
But at the end of the day,

539
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:22,870
he also essentially made a property
argument or a property defense of slavery.

540
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:28,900
He wrote, among other
things, the means, therefore,

541
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:33,800
whatever they may have been by which the
African race now in this country have

542
00:38:33,801 --> 00:38:35,270
been reduced to slavery,

543
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,430
cannot affect us since
they are our property.

544
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:45,060
As your land is your property by
inheritance or purchase and prescriptive,

545
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:51,100
right? You'll, we'll say that
man cannot hold property in man.

546
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:56,610
The answer is that he can and actually
does hold property in his fellow all over

547
00:38:58,541 --> 00:39:02,680
the world in a variety of
forms and has always done so.

548
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:06,150
Thank you. Very much. Said Henry Hammond.

549
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,840
Don't talk to me about property in man.

550
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:17,260
Oh, some would get
guilty. Indeed they did.

551
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:23,520
Some would get worried and then we'll
discuss slavery as a necessary evil.

552
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:27,550
This system entailed upon them.
God, they wish they were without it.

553
00:39:27,551 --> 00:39:31,000
And some of them, frankly, folks
were deeply sincere in that.

554
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:36,760
One of the most famous and one of the
most prolific was a man named Charles Cold

555
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:36,761
Cock Jones,

556
00:39:36,761 --> 00:39:41,761
who owned a huge rice and partly cotton
plantation system in low country,

557
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:47,110
Georgia, just south of
Savannah. He and his family, uh,

558
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:51,190
wrote literally thousands
upon thousands of letters.

559
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:55,420
Those family letters have been published
in a book called the children of pride.

560
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:59,500
And a brilliant book has been written
about Cold Cock Jones in his extended

561
00:39:59,501 --> 00:40:02,500
family by ors can Clark
called dwelling place.

562
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,500
But one of the fascinating things about
Charles coldcocked Jones born in the

563
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:09,820
late 18th century, uh, rises through
adulthood by the teens. 1820s

564
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:15,280
is he's a classic example of the
highly educated southern planter.

565
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:20,470
He came north, he was educated
in theology at Yale for a while.

566
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:21,850
He was really affected by it.

567
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:26,140
And then he went up to and
over a theological academy
and he taught there and

568
00:40:26,141 --> 00:40:30,150
he's affected even more by
New England theologians.

569
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:35,290
And he began to write back first to his
fiance, who quickly became his wife Mary.

570
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:41,050
And he was really worried about
all slaves heal. He writes,

571
00:40:41,051 --> 00:40:43,940
for example,
to marry,

572
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:48,920
I am moreover undecided whether I
ought to continue to hold slaves.

573
00:40:48,921 --> 00:40:53,370
He underlines hold slaves as to the
principle of slavery. It is wrong.

574
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:57,570
It is unjust, contrary to nature
and religion to hold men and slave.

575
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,950
But the question is,

576
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:03,960
in my present circumstances with evil
on my hands and tailed from my father,

577
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:09,230
would the general interest of the slaves
and community at large with reference

578
00:41:09,451 --> 00:41:13,260
to the slaves be promoted
best by emancipation?

579
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:19,520
Could I do more for the ultimate good
of the slave population by holding or

580
00:41:20,491 --> 00:41:23,190
emancipating what I own.

581
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:29,160
I know not very particularly
how you feel on this point,

582
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,280
and there are many letters like that.

583
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:36,440
He and his wife right back and
forth about how evil slavery is,

584
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,900
but in the end,
cold cock,

585
00:41:38,901 --> 00:41:43,901
John's becomes a classic example of
the guilty pro slavery slave holder.

586
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,180
He doesn't know how to freeze him.

587
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:53,480
He doesn't know how to go to emancipation.
Instead,

588
00:41:53,481 --> 00:41:58,481
he developed a highly intricate theory
of how he's going to use slavery to save

589
00:42:01,461 --> 00:42:05,720
black people.
He's going to ameliorate their conditions.

590
00:42:05,721 --> 00:42:10,490
He's going to make their slavery on
his plantations so effective, so good,

591
00:42:10,491 --> 00:42:11,324
such a

592
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:17,630
even joyous form of labor that he will
be doing God's work by improving slavery.

593
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,640
It's a, it's a genuinely tragic
sort of story. In his case,

594
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:32,950
there are plenty of pro slavery
writers who also to some extent,

595
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:38,250
whether out of guilt or out of
awareness saw slavery is wrong,

596
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,210
but they saw it

597
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:45,190
as a problem more for white
people than for black people.

598
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:48,280
Their concern was not
the conditions of blacks,

599
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,000
but what slavery did to whites and usually
they ended up in the same situation

600
00:42:54,581 --> 00:42:55,900
as cold cock Jones.

601
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:02,910
There are many pro slavery writers who
developed like James Henry Hammond,

602
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,520
what I would call the cynical or a
moral form of pro slavery argument,

603
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:13,240
and this is a potent form of
argument when you think about it.

604
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:17,943
Yeah.

605
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:22,370
One of them was a writer named William
Harper who wrote a book called Memoir of

606
00:43:22,371 --> 00:43:24,980
slavery in 1837 or 38

607
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:30,620
a. It's an oft quoted work
of pro slavery writing.

608
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,230
This is just one little passage.

609
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,620
This is this kind of cynical,

610
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,380
if you want defense of slavery,

611
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:44,930
it is what it is, deal with it. He wrote,

612
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,200
man is born to subjection.

613
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:53,150
The condition of our whole existence
is but to struggle with evil,

614
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:58,100
to compare them to choose
between them evils that is

615
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,180
and so far as we can to mitigate them.

616
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:07,780
To say that there is evil
in any institution is only
to say that it is a human

617
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:13,450
institution. James James, James Jameson,

618
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,020
Harper's writing in the third,

619
00:44:15,021 --> 00:44:17,990
James Henry Hammond starts writing in the
forties and end of the 50 and he takes

620
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:22,991
that much further and he writes over
and over and over again that the only

621
00:44:23,511 --> 00:44:25,010
problem with slavery in America said,

622
00:44:25,011 --> 00:44:29,090
James Henry Hammond is the too damn many
northerners didn't understand it is the

623
00:44:29,091 --> 00:44:33,210
way of the world as it is and they ought
to stop talking about the world as it

624
00:44:33,211 --> 00:44:38,070
ought to be. In Hammond even aggressively
directly took on Thomas Jefferson.

625
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:44,710
I'm sorry Harper did even before him.
Here's Harper on Jefferson.

626
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:50,470
It is not the first time that I've had
occasion to observe that men may repeat

627
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,030
with the utmost confidence,

628
00:44:52,031 --> 00:44:57,031
some maxim or sentimental phrase
as self evident or admitted truth,

629
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:02,770
which is either palpably false or to
which upon examination it will be found

630
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:05,410
that they attach no definite idea.

631
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,890
Not withstanding our respect
for the important document,

632
00:45:08,891 --> 00:45:12,760
which declared our independence
yet if anything be found in it,

633
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:17,910
and especially in what may be regarded
rather as it's ornament than its

634
00:45:18,011 --> 00:45:20,770
substance faults sophistical and,

635
00:45:20,771 --> 00:45:25,771
and meaning that respect should not
screen it from the freest examination.

636
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:31,330
All men are born free and equal.

637
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:33,550
He says with a question mark,

638
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:39,510
is it not palpably near the truth to say
that no man was ever born free and that

639
00:45:41,161 --> 00:45:43,570
no two men were ever born equal?

640
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:49,500
Man is born in a state of the most
helpless dependence on other people.

641
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:55,123
Okay.

642
00:45:55,420 --> 00:46:00,420
And then there's the whole vast category
of racial defense and justification of

643
00:46:01,331 --> 00:46:04,420
slavery. At the end of the day,
that's where I was under age.

644
00:46:04,421 --> 00:46:09,310
Stevens went with this cornerstone speech
in 80 61 so all of them went on one

645
00:46:09,311 --> 00:46:11,440
point or another,
some less than others,

646
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:17,960
probably the most prominent pro-slavery
writer to make the racial case.

647
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:21,140
And they all did. But probably the
most prominent was George fits you.

648
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:23,080
Yeah.

649
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,120
In a book called sociology of the South.

650
00:46:25,121 --> 00:46:28,330
He's also the same George Fisher who
wrote a book called cannibals all but in

651
00:46:28,331 --> 00:46:33,331
sociology of the south is famous pro
slave retract and 1854 he wrote this,

652
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,800
the Negro he said is,

653
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:45,240
but a grownup child and
must be governed as a child.

654
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:50,610
The master occupies toward him,
the place of parent or Guardian,

655
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,510
like a wild horse.
He must be caught,

656
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:56,880
tamed and domesticated.

657
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:02,420
We find slavery repeatedly instituted
by God or by men acting under his

658
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:06,930
immediate care and direction.
As in the instance of Moses and Joshua,

659
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:12,560
nowhere in the old or New Testament
do we find the institution condemn but

660
00:47:12,571 --> 00:47:15,750
frequently recognized and enforced.

661
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,900
And probably his most famous line,

662
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:22,650
men are not born entitled to equal rights.

663
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,200
It would be far and near the truth to say,

664
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:30,490
and some are born with saddles on their
backs and others booted and spurred to

665
00:47:30,701 --> 00:47:35,160
ride them.
And lastly,

666
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,520
there was a kind of utopian pro slavery.

667
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:44,510
It was best exemplified by a writer
in Mississippi named Henry Hewes.

668
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:49,980
Henry, who's was one strange
duck. He lived in New Orleans.

669
00:47:49,981 --> 00:47:54,780
He was eccentric as hell.
He wrote an amazing diary.

670
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,060
He was a loner.

671
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:02,970
He arres revival of the slave trade in
the late 1850s and he developed a theory

672
00:48:02,971 --> 00:48:05,610
of what he called Warranty Ism.

673
00:48:05,611 --> 00:48:10,611
W.

674
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:13,320
A. R. R. A. N. T. E. I. S.
M. He said, slaves were not
slaves. They were warranties.

675
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:19,170
What he meant was they were the charges
put in the world for slave holders to

676
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,930
care for and if possible,

677
00:48:21,931 --> 00:48:25,020
even to protect and perfect.

678
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:28,260
He believed in a strong central state,

679
00:48:28,261 --> 00:48:31,050
which was a real departure for him from
the rest of the plus pro pro-slavery

680
00:48:31,051 --> 00:48:35,460
writers. He wanted a strong central
government to regulate everything.

681
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:38,640
He wanted huge taxation.

682
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:45,380
He wanted to build institutions that
would be used for the sole purpose of

683
00:48:45,601 --> 00:48:48,240
perfecting the slave
into the perfect worker.

684
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:55,110
He was a bit of a mad scientist
and he was especially obsessed,

685
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:56,740
was racial purity.

686
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:02,490
His writings are just replete with his
fears about hygiene that of white and

687
00:49:03,011 --> 00:49:07,210
black people touched or if they came
together, the whites would be soiled

688
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:14,070
and that any kind of inner mixing of
the races was to destroy ultimately the

689
00:49:14,381 --> 00:49:18,460
intellect, the ability, the
capacity of a master race.

690
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,433
Yeah.

691
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:25,160
He wasn't that widely read,
I must admit,

692
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:31,670
but it shows us how far pro
slavery could ultimately

693
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,133
go,

694
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:39,150
and he uses vision and he, his worldview
slavery was not only a positive good,

695
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,070
okay.

696
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:46,070
It was the possibility of man finding a
perfected society with the perfect land

697
00:49:48,581 --> 00:49:53,100
owners do fulfilling their
obligations supported by a government,

698
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:59,160
would tax the hell out of him to do it,
and perfect workers

699
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:05,660
would make the south and to the
agricultural utopian civilization

700
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:11,670
of history.
Now,

701
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,610
boxes that run out of timeliness
is leave you with this.

702
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:21,300
All of that is a way of simply saying
there was a deep and abiding and

703
00:50:22,331 --> 00:50:24,250
well-rehearsed.
Indeed,

704
00:50:24,251 --> 00:50:27,820
thousands of pages were
written in defensive sleep.

705
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:32,660
It wasn't just the profitable
financial institution.

706
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:38,070
And if you want to understand
why so many white southerners,

707
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,650
especially in the deep south,

708
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:44,510
went to such great extents
to save their slave society.

709
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:50,980
Remember the kinds of arguments
and language used by its defenders.

710
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:57,910
Thursday we'll take up the north
and the critique of this ideology.
