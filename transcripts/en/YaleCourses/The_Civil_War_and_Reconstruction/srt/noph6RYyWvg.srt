1
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,970
There was trouble in the air.

2
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,450
I left you the other day with Henry Clay,

3
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,780
sloshing down some brand in
a late night and mid January,

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,360
1850 to try to come up with
ways of solving the great
political challenges they

5
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:34,810
faced between the sections and
over the expansion of slavery.

6
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,540
They were doing this in great part
because gold had been discovered in

7
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:42,921
California.

8
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:47,921
This is an original photograph
of panners gold miners,

9
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,350
white,
Asian,

10
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:55,730
and who knows probably
somebody mixed black.

11
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,910
If California wasn't ready for statehood
in 1850 it's possible that wouldn't

12
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:10,011
have needed to be a compromise of 1850
but it was an already and its inception.

13
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:17,271
People realized how big California was
and they already realize north and south

14
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:21,330
that part of it was north of the Missouri
compromise line and part of it was

15
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,164
south.

16
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,980
Would that vast territory of California
become a free state or a slave state?

17
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,200
The south greatest spokesman.

18
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,530
It's intellectual leader of its state
sovereignty and states' rights position

19
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,160
delivered what became known quickly that
year as the southern address and in in

20
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:49,470
Calhoun said many things
warning the country what the
south might do or at least

21
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:53,730
the deep south might do, but he captured
it in this ending of the speech.

22
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,381
If you,

23
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:59,790
and he's pointing to northerners
who represent a stronger portion,

24
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,650
cannot agree to settle on the broad
principle of justice and duty.

25
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,710
Say so and let the states
we both represent agreed to
separate and pardon piece.

26
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,360
If you are unwilling we should part
piece tell us so and we shall not and we

27
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:19,590
still know what to do.

28
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,080
When you reduce the question
to submission or resistance.

29
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,890
If you remain silent you will compel us
to infer by your acts what you intend.

30
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:36,600
In that case,
California will become the test question.

31
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,310
If you admit her under all the
difficulties that oppose her admission,

32
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,580
you compel us to infer that you intend
to exclude us from the whole of the

33
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:52,161
acquired territories of the west with
the intention of destroying irretrievably

34
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,270
the equilibrium between the two sections

35
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,010
and one of the oldest ideas
in our political culture
is the great conflict comes

36
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,820
when there's an issue around which
two sides. Let's assume there too.

37
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,290
Sometimes they're more than two,

38
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,910
but if there are two sides
on a great issue of conflict,

39
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,201
one,

40
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:25,201
one side or the other
cannot accept the result.

41
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,320
When a vital interest is somehow it's
stake that they will not or cannot or

42
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:36,010
choose not to accept a political outcome.

43
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,810
That's the question and the 1850s can
compromise some kind of coalition and

44
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:49,780
consensus around this
question of slavery is future

45
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,460
future in the west future in
the American political culture,

46
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:59,461
future within the constitution
can some kind of center hold.

47
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,310
Now,
clay invited down there,

48
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,250
Webster to deal with this cause Webster's
happens to the most at that point in

49
00:04:08,251 --> 00:04:10,500
time down,
your Webster was the most famous

50
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,320
northern Whig politician.

51
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,720
He was from abolitionist,
Massachusetts. He was antislavery.

52
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,320
They'll never a card carrying
abolitionists to say the least.

53
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,210
He was a great lawyer. Many said the
greatest order in the United States.

54
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,000
Those were usually the ones that
hadn't heard Frederick Douglass yet.

55
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,710
He'd been in Congress since
1823 almost as long as clay.

56
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:42,770
He'd been in the Senate since 1844 he
was seen in some ways is the lion and the

57
00:04:43,681 --> 00:04:45,090
spokesman of New England.

58
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,900
He had been the great voice and the
nullification crisis debates of 1830

59
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,010
he had been a voice of union,
but also law enforcement. Then,

60
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,290
that famous phrase that did,

61
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:09,340
he had become known for liberty in
union now and forever one and separable.

62
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:15,440
Webster always seem to be the union man.

63
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,410
At the same time.
He was an anti slavery man.

64
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,900
Henry Clay from Kentucky,

65
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:25,901
founder of the Whig Party candidate for
president three and four times over the

66
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:32,591
organizational genius in some ways
behind the Whig party and it's so called

67
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,730
national system.

68
00:05:34,731 --> 00:05:39,731
The idea of using government for economic
and social change in the lives of

69
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,380
immigrants and everybody else.

70
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:48,020
Clay of Kentucky slave holder,
he owned about 60 people,

71
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,750
hemp plantation farmer,

72
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,390
original founder of the
American colonization society,

73
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,700
a border state,

74
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,530
political titan with great
influence in the congress.

75
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,340
Okay.

76
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,220
Polls in Webster and
says web to were Daniel.

77
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,840
We've got to save the Union cause liquid
Calhoun and company in the deep south

78
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,060
or threatening. What will we
do? How will we solve this?

79
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,930
I mentioned the other day that when
clay introduced his five measures,

80
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:30,130
which were known first is
the claim measures and then
as the compromise measures,

81
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,640
he stood up in the Senate with great
theater and held a piece of what he said

82
00:06:36,571 --> 00:06:38,910
with George was George
Washington's coffin.

83
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,420
What were the issues in 1850?
Uh,

84
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:48,390
I hope you've seen enough of the outline.
If not, it's gone for the moment.

85
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,240
The issues that are on the map,

86
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,260
I think I need to,

87
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,270
no, they told me that makes it
better. Okay. That's better.

88
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,480
I guess the issues are the California
and the West is ready for statehood

89
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:15,790
overnight because of that vast
migration of minors by sea,

90
00:07:15,821 --> 00:07:18,580
by land and by imagination.

91
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,050
It always been a brewing issue in the
u s congress and in the district of

92
00:07:25,051 --> 00:07:29,370
Columbia about the fact that
the district of Columbia,

93
00:07:29,371 --> 00:07:32,460
the Capitol of the United States,
was a slave trading center.

94
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,420
Northern Congressmen of all stripes had
always been bothered by the fact that

95
00:07:38,851 --> 00:07:42,660
about two and a half blocks
down the street from the
United States capitol was a

96
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:44,370
huge slave jail.

97
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,730
People said that when the wind was right,

98
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,670
you could smell it on
the steps of the capitol.

99
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,550
Abraham Lincoln and his one term in the
house, call it a human livery stable.

100
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,820
Foreign visitors would
come and they would say,

101
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:06,350
they would stand in awe at that majestic
capital as it was being built in.

102
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:09,290
The Dome was being completed
and then they would ask,

103
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,940
where's the slave jail?
Can we see a slave jail?

104
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,100
So there were a lot of northerners.
Now we're saying, okay,

105
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,890
this is gonna be some big
compromise now about California,

106
00:08:22,891 --> 00:08:24,810
but slavery in the West.
What we're gonna do about this.

107
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,250
Let's deal with this question too.

108
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,863
Yeah.

109
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,640
Thirdly,
there was the question of,

110
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:34,900
and this is what southerners were
exorcized about a fugitive slaves escaping

111
00:08:34,901 --> 00:08:35,621
into the north.

112
00:08:35,621 --> 00:08:40,621
And that's so cold underground railroad
and the term underground railroad

113
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:45,661
appears for the first time openly over
and over in public debate on the floor of

114
00:08:47,021 --> 00:08:50,320
the u s congress, southern
standing up and saying, we need a,

115
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:55,650
a much stronger federal fugitive slave
act requiring the return of fugitive

116
00:08:56,731 --> 00:09:00,480
slaves because they are escaping too
much in that underground railroad.

117
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,360
They didn't have a clue
what it really was,

118
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,133
didn't matter.

119
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,020
But southerners wanted fugitive slaves,

120
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,310
retrieved to them by law
under federal enforcement,

121
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:20,400
no questions asked.
And then there was the problem of Texas.

122
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:25,220
Now, uh, it doesn't quite show
it on this map properly, but,

123
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,010
uh, the other day you
remember the map of Texas,

124
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:32,990
the boundaries of Texas had never
been determined to the Mexicans,

125
00:09:32,991 --> 00:09:34,400
much less to the Americans.

126
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,040
And the idea here now was to how,

127
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:42,950
how would you kind of divide up Texas?
There was no New Mexico or Arizona yet.

128
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,640
It's just this vast territory
called the New Mexico territory.

129
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:53,530
The idea was if you moved back the border
of Texas about three or 400 miles and

130
00:09:56,001 --> 00:10:00,590
you placed it where it actually is today,
you would open up new territory.

131
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,470
Lots of it to the establishment of at
least one new if not two new. Yeah.

132
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,310
Okay.

133
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:10,330
And those states in the
southern imagination would
in all likelihood be slave

134
00:10:10,331 --> 00:10:11,520
states.
They were southern

135
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,820
more to do with the Texas boundary.

136
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,353
Now,

137
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,750
Daniel Webster supportive.
This came at some price.

138
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,660
It came at a huge price
for his own career.

139
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,660
The five measures that came out of
their discussions, they weren't alone,

140
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:37,730
but they really did conceive of this.
The five parts of the compromise of 1850

141
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,220
okay,

142
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,240
we'll be on your citizenship test.

143
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,800
You shouldn't have US citizenship if
you can't name the five parts of the

144
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:46,600
compromise of 1850 I've
always believed that.

145
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,470
And the three parts of the
Kansas, Nebraska, that should
be a test of citizenship.

146
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,150
No Lithuanian should ever
get us citizenship without
being able to name the five

147
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,100
parts of the compromise of 1850 nevermind.

148
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,630
California would be admitted
as a free state. Clay said,

149
00:11:03,631 --> 00:11:07,630
there's no way around this.
If they hold a referendum in California,

150
00:11:07,631 --> 00:11:11,070
it's going to be a free state. The people
who have gone there are all, you know,

151
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:14,380
they're all little people.
They're all these, you know,

152
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:16,900
these miners and these panners there.
They're immigrants.

153
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,320
They're people from Germany who have
come across the see all in one year to go

154
00:11:20,321 --> 00:11:24,340
find a Golden California.
They're not going to be slave holders.

155
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:25,780
Yeah.

156
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,150
All right. California will
be admitted as a free state,

157
00:11:28,151 --> 00:11:31,990
but now remember what Calhoun had said,
so what are you going to give the south?

158
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:34,683
Yeah,

159
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,530
and return.
The South is going to get a whole new,

160
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,910
much stronger federal,
fugitive slave act.

161
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:48,160
The most notorious and controversial
aspect of the compromise of 1850

162
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,310
secondly, clay said, Webster,
let's abolish the slave. In
the district of Columbia,

163
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:56,590
we have,
we have federal jurisdiction over that.

164
00:11:56,591 --> 00:12:00,820
The congress has jurisdiction over the
district. Let's abolish the slave trade.

165
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,800
Let's get this slave
jails out of Washington.

166
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,540
Northern has all like that
rubs. Just said, yeah,

167
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:13,940
let's move the boundary back three, 400
miles. It was really about 350 miles.

168
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,910
Let's open up a whole new part of
the Mexican cession to the possible

169
00:12:16,911 --> 00:12:19,160
establishment of new slave states.

170
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:24,370
Let's let southerners dream of two and
three more states and four to six more US

171
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,100
senators in the next three to five years.

172
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,880
Let's let them feel secure that California
may come in as a free state and get

173
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:39,371
two new senators and the number will
now be 16 to 15 free to slave states.

174
00:12:39,861 --> 00:12:44,780
People were counting,
but the idea was, yeah,

175
00:12:44,781 --> 00:12:49,160
but maybe the south gets two or
three other Mexicans session.

176
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,360
And then lastly,

177
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,950
how would slavery be determined
in that southwest the big issue?

178
00:12:56,951 --> 00:12:59,890
How do you do it?
By what principle?

179
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,550
Probably said popular sovereignty.

180
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,030
Let the people have a referendum and vote

181
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,720
liberal democracy.

182
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:17,180
So that statehood for any
territory and the Mexican cession,

183
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,960
uh,
except for California here,

184
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,120
this is the stuff of compromise.
Don't look for hard principles here

185
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,060
except for California.

186
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,550
Everything else in the Mexican session
will be determined on popular sovereignty.

187
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:39,380
The people who settled the territory at
some stage of the territory of process

188
00:13:39,381 --> 00:13:40,550
could be,
or it could be late,

189
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,450
we'll vote whether slavery shall exist,

190
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,310
so I'll look at the five measured.
California will be a free state

191
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,860
slave trade trade,

192
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:57,010
not slavery itself will be abolished
in the district of Columbia.

193
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,860
Two issues.
The North Wall like

194
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:01,700
okay,

195
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,870
the Texas bound removed back open to new
territory. New possible southern states.

196
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,173
Yeah,

197
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:11,120
and that fugitive slave act two,
two measures.

198
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,520
Southerners would really like,
and by the way,

199
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,750
when clay suggestion of the fugitive slave
act to Webster, Webster says, no, no, no,

200
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:22,640
I can't take that home to Massachusetts
at won't fly. You can't do that.

201
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,090
Clay said you have to do that. We'll
have just said, I can't do that.

202
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,810
Clay said you have to do that. Have
some more branding. Webster said, okay,

203
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,940
I don't know how much brand do they drink
and popular sovereignty is of course

204
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:43,590
it's American democracy. Let them vote.
It's, it's an appeal to both sides,

205
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,860
two for each side and one for everybody.

206
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,920
It is a great compromise in sense,

207
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,240
but how has it actually passed is crucial.
Of course,

208
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:59,900
it's substance is crucial the way it was.
Finally,

209
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:03,320
path is the [inaudible],
and by the way,

210
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,620
there was no certainty
whatsoever that this would work.

211
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:13,510
After clay initiated the debate
with an emotional appeal for union,

212
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:22,230
Daniel Webster spoken what became known
in his career and in American history is

213
00:15:22,231 --> 00:15:23,910
the 7th of March speech.

214
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:29,130
He held forth for three hours and
one of his classic Philippics.

215
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:35,130
It began with the famous
lines I wish to speak today,

216
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:39,480
not as a Massachusetts man, Norris
and northern man, but as an American.

217
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:42,300
I speak today for the
preservation of the union.

218
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,990
Any appeal to his fellow northerners,

219
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,730
the vote for the fugitive slave to
vote to make northern states legally

220
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:55,950
complicit in the return of fugitive
slaves in their neighborhoods.

221
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:01,960
He got groans and he got
jeers and he got cheers.

222
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,390
Everybody said one of the
greatest speeches ever made
in the u s senate and it

223
00:16:07,391 --> 00:16:08,650
ruined Webster's career.

224
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:14,900
Poets started writing about as Whittier
did the devil and Daniel Webster.

225
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,990
Calhoun was unable to deliver.
His speech was the 4th of March.

226
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,880
Uh, he was too sick. He
will be dead by the fall.

227
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,900
It was delivered by James Mason.
His colleague

228
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:34,850
Calhoun was carried into the u s
Senate in a chair. He couldn't walk.

229
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,150
They literally carried him in,
sat him down.

230
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,830
He stared at his shoes on.

231
00:16:41,831 --> 00:16:46,831
Mason delivered his speech
in which Calhoun said that
the south had to stand now

232
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:53,801
as one for a slave society and for states'
rights and for the protection of what

233
00:16:57,171 --> 00:17:00,350
he constantly argued were minority rights.

234
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,323
Okay.

235
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:09,920
Calhoun's speech, arguably, I think
from an interpretive mode now,

236
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,220
frightened,
frightened,

237
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:18,430
especially some northern into voting
for a compromise they hated it.

238
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,930
May have even frightened some
border state Democrats and wigs

239
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:30,140
to vote for this thing,
some of which they hated,

240
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,360
like any great compromise them.

241
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:36,080
And you've ever been on major political
committees, dorm committees and so on.

242
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,040
You got to pass something, but you got
two or three things on the, on the bill,

243
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
and are these people who hate number,
item number one, and these people eight.

244
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,520
Item number two and these people,
eight. Item. Number three,

245
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,680
what happens if you vote on
all three at the same time?

246
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,570
Everybody's got something to vote against.

247
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:57,090
So the way the compromise of 1850 was
passed and it was passed largely by the

248
00:17:57,091 --> 00:18:01,530
young Steven,
a Douglas who took over the management.

249
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,460
He's about 38 years old at this point.

250
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:10,710
Senator from Illinois, uh, young Titan,

251
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,560
small as he was five foot six,

252
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,580
a young tighten over the
Democratic Party from Illinois.

253
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,860
He was really the parliamentary manager

254
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:26,540
in the midst of the debates from
March into the summer of 1850.

255
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:30,690
There were threats of disunion
from southerners every other day,

256
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,180
brave threats and newt assistant,
southern newspapers.

257
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,820
So a Douglas dead is a classic
parliamentary maneuver.

258
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:50,080
He voted on each bill separately and
ultimately called it the omnibus bill.

259
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,230
And in each case,

260
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:58,220
manage just enough of a narrow majority,

261
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,600
getting enough northerners,
especially northern Democrats,

262
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:08,240
to vote for that fugitive slave act,
which they tended to hate.

263
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,290
And then Justin enough southern,

264
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:17,660
what's left of the wigs to vote for the
end of the slave trade and the district

265
00:19:17,661 --> 00:19:18,494
of Columbia.

266
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,830
And it passed in early August,

267
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,520
1850 Henry Clay ill,
terminally sick,

268
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,900
had gone home to Kentucky,

269
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,640
maybe out of the picture
and out of American history
before the end of the year.

270
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:39,200
Calhoun was dying at that very moment
was dead, I believe by September

271
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:45,260
Webster was now to be
denounced politically forever
and his own political party

272
00:19:45,261 --> 00:19:46,790
and in his own Massachusetts,

273
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:52,990
but the compromise past and in some ways
the nation celebrated or so it's seen

274
00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:00,670
the compromise of 1850 did
in some ways save the union,

275
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,790
at least at that point in time.
But as David Potter,

276
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,710
the, the bestest story into this
we've ever had said it was far more,

277
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,000
and it's the best way to remember it.

278
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:19,001
I think it was far more in armistice
than it really was a compromise.

279
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,090
It began to collapse almost
as fast as it passed.

280
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:28,580
There were huge rallies and marches in
northern cities celebrating the saving of

281
00:20:28,581 --> 00:20:33,050
the Union. People were frightened, I
mean business interests in the north,

282
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,840
not just in New York City
where the banks all were,

283
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,030
but now in this colossus of Chicago,

284
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:42,020
this burgeoning railroad center
in the West. And Cincinnati,

285
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:45,580
Detroit worried.
I mean,

286
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:49,930
what if there is disunion what happens to
the economy? What happens to, to trade?

287
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:56,690
So there were a great
rallies at the same time,

288
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:00,350
state of Georgia minutes
legislature by December,

289
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,170
1850 and passed what they
called the Georgia platform
and send it all around the

290
00:21:03,171 --> 00:21:04,940
rest of the deep south.
And it said,

291
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:08,930
it said the state of Georgia gave only
it's conditional acceptance to the

292
00:21:08,931 --> 00:21:13,931
compromise measures waiting to see
whether the north acted in good faith.

293
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,280
In other words,
we don't trust you.

294
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,410
Some northern state legislature said,
Oh really?

295
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,760
And they passed a resolution saying
we don't think we trust you either.

296
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:29,643
Yeah.

297
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,240
There were vehement protest
against the fugitive slave act.

298
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:42,590
The fugitive slave act above all else
in this crisis caused much further

299
00:21:45,331 --> 00:21:46,164
conflict.

300
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:51,770
It led directly to an estimated
20,000 African American free blacks.

301
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,900
Well free blacks and fugitive slaves.

302
00:21:54,901 --> 00:21:59,901
So many of them living in the northern
states and in some cases whole church

303
00:21:59,971 --> 00:22:04,971
congregations from cities
like Philadelphia and Boston
moved north of the border

304
00:22:06,481 --> 00:22:11,481
into Canada between 1850
and roughly a 1857 58

305
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:14,850
yeah.

306
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,730
When there was another small wave
after the dred Scott decision,

307
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,390
this will lead to the establishment
and that fugitive slave act of special

308
00:22:23,391 --> 00:22:27,650
federal magistrates whose job
the whose sole job it was.

309
00:22:27,651 --> 00:22:30,950
Now this is a whole new level of,
of,

310
00:22:30,951 --> 00:22:34,610
of federal adjudication
of fugitive slaves.

311
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:40,030
Magistrates were now appointed to go
all over the north to retrieve fugitive

312
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:41,330
slaves.
Well,

313
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,560
just set up a police apparatus to retrieve
fugitive slaves and then the conduct

314
00:22:45,561 --> 00:22:47,720
courts to determine their identity.

315
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:52,370
And in the fugitive slave act itself,
it determined,

316
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,400
or it's said that those magistrates
would be paid twice as much money.

317
00:22:57,411 --> 00:23:02,411
They actually would be paid $10 for every
fugitive slave they convicted of being

318
00:23:03,741 --> 00:23:08,060
that person and sent them back to slavery.
And $5 for every acquittal.

319
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,560
No, no, $5 doesn't seem like much.
But on the cert on the face of that,

320
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:17,760
and you look at that and you ain't no
wait a second, this is blind justice.

321
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,270
You're going to give me twice as much
money to convict you as a [inaudible].

322
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,373
Hey,

323
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,660
I need a meal too.

324
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:34,300
It led now to famous fugitive
slave rescues like the
rescue of Jerry Mchenry in

325
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:34,901
Syracuse,

326
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:39,901
New York in 1851 and a violent rescue by
abolitionists to spirit who killed one

327
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:43,840
of his captors and
carted him off to Canada.

328
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,200
It led to the rescue of Shadrack
minkins in early 1852 in Boston,

329
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:53,720
a fugitive slave from Virginia who was
working in an abolitionist coffeehouse in

330
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:57,260
Boston, retrieved by slave
catchers, taken to a jail,

331
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,910
broken out of that jail.

332
00:23:58,911 --> 00:24:03,860
One of the jailers murdered on the spot
by a mob of abolition is led by Louis

333
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,431
Hayden himself,

334
00:24:04,431 --> 00:24:09,431
a fugitive slave from Kentucky who
lived in Beacon Hill in Boston and dared

335
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:14,300
federal magistrates to come to his house
and try to retrieve Strad rec minkins

336
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:19,510
by putting an entire posse on the street
and a keg of gunpowder in front of his

337
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:23,960
door, which he threatened. He would blow
up if any magistrate garden near it.

338
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:27,860
And that night they spirited shed
Rakoff to Concord, Massachusetts,

339
00:24:27,861 --> 00:24:31,730
where the descendants of abolitionists
to this day like to argue which hosts he

340
00:24:31,731 --> 00:24:36,731
stayed in and then off cross route to
cross northern Massachusetts and on up

341
00:24:37,521 --> 00:24:42,521
into Canada where shed rec remained the
rest of his life as a grocer in Montreal

342
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,430
and there were many, many other
fugitive slave rescues. Now,

343
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:52,040
there was the fugitive
slave rescue at Christiana,

344
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:55,280
Pennsylvania in 1851 it
was really at a farm,

345
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,590
a slave holder named Gorsuch,

346
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:02,620
and a posse of only five or six men
cornered a group of his former slaves.

347
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,910
Four of them in a barn
group of abolitionists.

348
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:12,230
Black and white defended them
in a gun bottle in a gun battle.

349
00:25:12,231 --> 00:25:16,250
One of the Gorsuch, his sons was
killed. The future, the slaves escaped.

350
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:20,060
They ended up going
across upstate New York.

351
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:25,580
Two of them ended up in
Frederick Douglass, his
house in Rochester, New York.

352
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,740
Douglas drove them personally in a
carriage to the wharf on Lake Erie

353
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:33,930
and when he bid them goodbye,

354
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:38,830
one of them gave him the
revolver that he had used it.

355
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:43,460
Christiana, I'm a Mento. The
Douglas kept the rest of his life.

356
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,760
Resistance to slavery was now

357
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,860
direct,
sometimes violent.

358
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,120
The underground railroad had been
filming over ground railroad.

359
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,500
It was no longer caught up in the romance
of a whole lot of people spiriting

360
00:26:01,501 --> 00:26:03,240
people to secret hideaways.

361
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:08,010
It was sometimes now a
matter of gun violence

362
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:13,050
and one could argue that
the most important thing
that happened in the wake of

363
00:26:13,051 --> 00:26:17,790
the fugitive slave act and therefore the
compromise of 1850 was the publication

364
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:22,140
of uncle Tom's cabin, Harriet
Beecher Stowe, that brilliant,

365
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:27,720
very short little woman would live for
quite a while with her husband Calvin

366
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:28,310
stoves,

367
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:32,790
a theologian teaching in Cincinnati and
lived in a house on a hill in Cincinnati

368
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,460
for several years where
she first met slave women,

369
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,350
where she first met fugitive slaves coming
through Cincinnati may have hit a few,

370
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,810
heard their voices,
tried to learn their dialect,

371
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:52,250
and wrote the greatest novel of the
19th century and still on any list,

372
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,880
any shortlist of the best selling works
of literature and the history of the

373
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:57,714
world.

374
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:03,090
That sugarcoated antislavery
story of several characters.

375
00:27:03,091 --> 00:27:05,190
Eliza young allies,

376
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:09,390
a light skinned where their babies gaping
across the Ohio jumping from iceberg,

377
00:27:09,391 --> 00:27:12,240
the iceberg iceberg.
They,

378
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:16,560
Ohio doesn't have icebergs anymore.
Didn't have any of that either.

379
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,873
Okay.

380
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,840
Our uncle Tom Himself,

381
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:25,220
the most important Christ like
figure in all of American literature.

382
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,940
Harriet Stowe wrote a brilliant book,

383
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,550
whatever I want and anyone
wants to say about it,

384
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:36,170
she made everybody complicit in
complicit as in the slave story.

385
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:40,820
The most despicable character in the book
is Miso Phelia who was born in Vermont,

386
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,380
who's racist to the core,

387
00:27:42,381 --> 00:27:46,550
who can't stand black people and goes
down south preaching at southerners.

388
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,400
What's wrong with slavery? At the same
time, just can't get near black people.

389
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,280
And in some ways,

390
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:56,180
the most admirable character in
that book was a southern slaveholder

391
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,850
and actually the most evil character,
the most heinous characters,

392
00:28:02,851 --> 00:28:06,120
missile field yet, but the most evil
character. Of course, it's Simon legree

393
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,620
and Simon legree was
himself from New England.

394
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:18,090
The whole world was suddenly reading
a work of fiction about slavery.

395
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,180
It's so 300,000 copies in the first year

396
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:28,850
by far broke every sales record
of any book ever published,

397
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,350
ever anywhere

398
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:34,980
reprinted into at least to 20 languages.

399
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:39,981
And its first five years of existence
made into stage plays within two years.

400
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,380
Okay.

401
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,730
It brought an awareness to the
slavery problem as never before.

402
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,740
And then the election,

403
00:28:51,741 --> 00:28:56,741
the congressional off year elections
of 1852 four every four votes for every

404
00:28:59,241 --> 00:29:02,060
four votes cast for Franklin Pierce,

405
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,970
the Democrat who will win

406
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:11,210
one copy of uncle Tom's cabin sold
somewhere in the United States.

407
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,040
I mean name a book today that we
could even imagine doing that.

408
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,450
What did they are worth?
A novel

409
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:26,630
that are electric was
electrified by in some way

410
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,103
now

411
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,520
in the wake of the Kansas and excuse me,

412
00:29:38,521 --> 00:29:43,521
in the wake of the compromise of 1850
the country now though had to face this

413
00:29:43,931 --> 00:29:48,160
question, not just what'd you going to
do with the Mexican cession territory's.

414
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,400
That's going to take a little while.
Northerners,

415
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:55,810
a lot of northerners are pissed off about
the nature of the Utah Territory Bill

416
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,430
and in New Mexico territory bill.

417
00:29:57,431 --> 00:30:02,431
Cause there are southerners immediately
propose a slave territories for Utah and

418
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,230
New Mexico.

419
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:10,620
But the real question by 1853 and early
854 was all the territory that was left

420
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,370
of the Louisiana purchase,
the Kansas and Nebraska territories,

421
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:20,800
which is simply what they
were at that point in time.

422
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:27,280
Now it is worth stopping for a moment to
realize that not every American woke up

423
00:30:27,281 --> 00:30:32,281
in 1850150250 three you're worried every
moment of every day about the expansion

424
00:30:35,081 --> 00:30:37,960
of slavery.
They are worried about it.

425
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:43,750
And it proves to us without question
that there was a political crisis,

426
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:47,430
a brewing that the electric cared about.

427
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,020
Okay?

428
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:53,200
But it's worth remembering that a lot
of Americans were preoccupied with the

429
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:58,030
same things. They always work.
Price of wheat, a sick cow,

430
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,280
wages at a textile mill,
a son who wants to marry him,

431
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,390
needs land.

432
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:08,740
A daughter wants to marry an Irishman

433
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:14,450
or, uh, most of all,

434
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,980
all those Catholics arriving in
New York City and Philadelphia,

435
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,740
huge numbers of Irish Catholics.

436
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:27,260
They're going to Catholicized America.
They're going to turn every,

437
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,930
every small outhouse into a confessional.

438
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,320
We laugh today.
It's easy to laugh at this,

439
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:39,600
but nativism caught hold in the
early 1850s more on this a bit later.

440
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,130
Um,

441
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,510
with the breakup of the American party
system as we take it through the 1850s

442
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,930
but a lot of Americans were really
worried about those Catholics,

443
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:56,200
but the Kansas Nebraska Act or the
establishment now of the territory's of

444
00:31:56,201 --> 00:32:01,201
Kansas and Nebraska and what to do with
them was front and center on the agenda

445
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:06,421
of the United States Congress by late
1853 in the wake now of numerous of these

446
00:32:08,441 --> 00:32:11,650
celebrated violent rescues
of fugitive slaves.

447
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:16,630
The attempts to enforce the fugitive
slave act in some parts of the north where

448
00:32:16,631 --> 00:32:21,631
it was very successfully prosecuted and
dozens and dozens and dozens of fugitive

449
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:26,800
slaves were returned to the south.
But in some celebrated cases,

450
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:28,563
they weren't

451
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,413
quickly.

452
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:38,930
The most celebrated case of all came
in the spring of 1854 at the time,

453
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:43,820
Congress is debating this thing called
the Kansas Nebraska act and people are

454
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:47,360
politically waiting with bated breath
and if I find out what are they actually

455
00:32:47,361 --> 00:32:48,194
going to do here?

456
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,330
We had the rescue in Boston have a
fugitive slaves name. Anthony Burns,

457
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,960
who was a young guy in his early
twenties he had escaped out of Virginia,

458
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,240
Boston by sea.

459
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:08,660
He too was working in a actually a
store at one point a coffee shop.

460
00:33:08,851 --> 00:33:13,410
At another point he was even distributing
copies of William Lord Garrison's

461
00:33:13,411 --> 00:33:18,411
liberate her and been there even a
year and a slave catchers found him,

462
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:20,933
captured it.

463
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:26,870
Now after Shad Rec minkins got out of
Boston in 1852 the Anthony Burns rendition

464
00:33:28,081 --> 00:33:32,790
case capture the imagination of
the nation because Franklin Pierce,

465
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:36,990
president of the United States move
federal troops about 3000 of them into the

466
00:33:36,991 --> 00:33:41,940
streets of Boston to guard the courthouse
and the guard the jail and make sure

467
00:33:41,941 --> 00:33:43,800
nobody broke Anthony Burns out.

468
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,050
It became a test case for the
Democratic Party of Massachusetts. Yes,

469
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,150
and on the day Anthony Burns was marched.
He was convicted,

470
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,320
marched from the jail down to the wharf
and put on the ship back to slavery in

471
00:33:57,321 --> 00:33:59,930
Virginia,
the abolitionists community,

472
00:33:59,931 --> 00:34:03,950
black and white of Boston and all
of Massachusetts gathered in Boston.

473
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,560
They held an all night
vigil with candle light,

474
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:11,580
but outside of the jail and they drape
the streets of Boston or some of the

475
00:34:11,661 --> 00:34:14,940
streets and black crepe in the morning.

476
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:20,940
Burns was sent back to Virginia.
It's his story is amazing though.

477
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,430
Is owner then sold him.

478
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:29,450
It was to a famous sold in
the North Carolina and one
day a white woman in North

479
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,160
Carolina wrote a letter
to her sister in Amherst,

480
00:34:35,161 --> 00:34:38,160
Massachusetts and said,
Helen,

481
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:44,040
that slave name Burns that
they captured up in Boston.

482
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:47,520
He's living on the farm next door.
Isn't that interesting?

483
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,460
And her sister wrote from the
first Baptist Church of mammary,

484
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:56,820
Massachusetts back to her
sister and said, really, um,

485
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,750
what if we could raise
some money to purchase him?

486
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,100
Would you talk to your neighbor?
She talked to her neighbors.

487
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:08,520
One thing led to another abolition is
beginning in Amherst, Massachusetts.

488
00:35:08,521 --> 00:35:11,250
And then around the state of
Massachusetts raise the money,

489
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:15,480
made the offer and Anthony
Burns freedom was sold.

490
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,610
And you came north by 1856

491
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:25,560
he first arrived in Amherst,
Massachusetts where he was celebrated.

492
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,930
They took him out on the road,

493
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:31,800
exhibit a and he went to Canada

494
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,500
and he died in 1860
prematurely of disease. Lonely,

495
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:41,640
lost,
almost unknown.

496
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,210
But it was in that environment.

497
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:50,211
Now that the congress has to decide
what to do with Kansas and Nebraska now,

498
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:51,510
here was the situation.

499
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:56,990
It was in part a big deal because what
was firing the American imagination now

500
00:35:57,271 --> 00:36:01,080
was not just to the west,
but it was the railroad west.

501
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,270
Who would build these railroads?

502
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:07,200
Where would they be built and where
would this eastern terminus be?

503
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:12,180
Would there eastern terminus of the
transcontinental railroad being a North

504
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,750
Chicago or maybe St
Louis in a slave state,

505
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:20,040
or maybe further south in New Orleans,
or maybe Memphis.

506
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,080
Maybe there'd be two of them.

507
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,430
Maybe we can have a
compromised transcontinental
railroad bill. Two of them.

508
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,530
Well then people said,
no way.

509
00:36:28,531 --> 00:36:30,720
I was gonna be hard enough to build
one of them over those mountains.

510
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:33,600
Okay.

511
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,620
The chairman of the Senate
territory's committee,

512
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:41,100
very powerful position in these
years was Stephen Douglas.

513
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:44,340
He's not about 40 years old,
1954

514
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,640
a political genius with
a few terrible flows.

515
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:53,151
Douglas,

516
00:36:53,151 --> 00:36:57,740
one of the terminus of
the transcontinental
railroad to be in Illinois,

517
00:36:58,730 --> 00:36:59,960
in Chicago,

518
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:05,290
and to go across the north to the
North West in the northern California.

519
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:13,590
Douglas is approach to slavery though
is terribly important here it is in some

520
00:37:13,591 --> 00:37:16,320
ways all of the story.

521
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:21,870
Stephen Douglas believes that the climate
would solve the problems of slavery.

522
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:25,320
He's famous for all these speeches he
would make where he would say, you know,

523
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:30,340
often soil is good and the temperatures
are right and then slavery will probably

524
00:37:31,051 --> 00:37:36,051
exist or the soil is not proper
and the temperatures aren't right.

525
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,790
Or if you've got mountains,
slavery won't exist,

526
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:44,340
climate will solve the problem and
wouldn't that be great? And we did.

527
00:37:44,341 --> 00:37:45,200
We'll just lift them.

528
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:48,510
All of our great political troubles with
just lifted off our shoulders by the

529
00:37:48,511 --> 00:37:49,320
weather.

530
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,580
Just watch the weather channel
the hell with MSNBC and CNN,

531
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:57,150
all those blabbering pundits
just watch the weather channel.

532
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,700
He really believed that don't have,
you know,

533
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,580
there was some reason to believe that

534
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:09,800
no problem was southern is one,

535
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:12,610
one thing out of this and a lot
of northerners one another thing,

536
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,800
but here was the question,

537
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,950
which principle will you apply about
slavery in the Kansas and Nebraska

538
00:38:20,951 --> 00:38:23,770
territory?
Think now the recent past,

539
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:29,140
think of the distant past in American
terms to the compromise of 1851 had the

540
00:38:31,241 --> 00:38:35,350
compromise of 1850 already
superseded the Missouri compromise.

541
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,230
Think about that.
You had that sacred bargain.

542
00:38:38,231 --> 00:38:43,231
They said of the 36 30 parallel line
dividing free territory from slave

543
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:48,271
territory forever pass back in 1820
that was that vow that the northerners

544
00:38:49,181 --> 00:38:54,181
concerned about the expansion of slavery
could always assume the great northwest

545
00:38:54,521 --> 00:38:58,200
would be free of slavery,
but cal,

546
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:03,170
half of California is below it,
below it and half of it's above.

547
00:39:03,171 --> 00:39:07,510
It had the compromise of 18 and half.

548
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:12,250
The Mexican session is above it and
now you said popular sovereignty will

549
00:39:12,251 --> 00:39:16,090
determine the Utah territory
and not the Missouri compromise.

550
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,250
So which rule is in play?

551
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,523
Yeah.

552
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,350
Which principle do you apply?
Do you apply?

553
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:30,910
The oldest principal of the northwest
ordinance of 1787 the northwest ordinance

554
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:35,911
folks had said slavery shall never
exist in the northwest territory,

555
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:40,270
which became those five states of
Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,

556
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:42,280
and Wisconsin will never exist.

557
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:46,900
Explicit territorial exclusion.
That's one principle.

558
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,680
Second principle, geographical
division, Missouri compromise.

559
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:53,320
Draw a line across the continent.
Do you go back to that one

560
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,050
or do you use the third one now?

561
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:02,380
The third one that's employee popular
sovereignty. Just let the people choose.

562
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:06,610
Forget geography.
Forget old laws

563
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:09,640
and have a referendum.

564
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,360
In other words,
and this,

565
00:40:14,361 --> 00:40:19,361
this is the great question of the 1850s
and the terrible tragedy that in the end

566
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:25,980
nothing worked. Would the American
pragmatic tradition now, yeah,

567
00:40:25,981 --> 00:40:28,500
we got this.
We got principal ab and C here.

568
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,320
We all want principled politicians.

569
00:40:31,321 --> 00:40:34,160
Don't we want principal professors
and principal politicians,

570
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,470
principled stock brokers?
At the end of the day.

571
00:40:37,471 --> 00:40:39,270
Sometimes the three principles in play,

572
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,700
what American pragmatism
continue to solve. This one,

573
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:48,720
well maybe that principle is best now,
but that principal is better than

574
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:58,030
Douglas wrote, the bill, the Kansas,
Nebraska bill as it was called

575
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:01,540
or act. Now, um,

576
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:15,780
in this case, folks, numbers matter.
We're going to look at a vote,

577
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:21,690
but first of all, he wrote three different
versions of the Kansas Nebraska Act.

578
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,680
This is important.

579
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,520
He went from Vegas to most
specific because southerners
put his feet to the fire

580
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,960
and made him do it.

581
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,970
He first introduced a bill in December,

582
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:38,030
1853 this is for the establishment
of Kansas and Nebraska territory.

583
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,600
Everybody said that's nice. Was that
was doing this to the, you know,

584
00:41:41,601 --> 00:41:46,550
there's millions of acres and square
miles, but it's slavery going to exist.

585
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:52,360
The first version that he put before
Congress in January four 1854 said that a

586
00:41:53,401 --> 00:41:56,180
state shall be admitted
from those territories,

587
00:41:56,390 --> 00:42:01,390
quotes with or without slavery as their
constitution may prescribe at the time

588
00:42:02,961 --> 00:42:03,794
of admission.

589
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:08,000
Note the vagueness and you
all know the new politics.

590
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:11,300
Sometimes the Vagaro you are,
the more you get done.

591
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:15,430
Slavery,

592
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:19,990
widow without slavery as
their constitution may
prescribe at the time of their

593
00:42:19,991 --> 00:42:23,740
admission.
How that's to be done was not mentioned.

594
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,950
Douglas said,
leave it to time.

595
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:30,580
Climate and good sense.

596
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:36,920
It was silent about the old
Missouri compromise line.

597
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,400
Southerners quickly reacting and said,
Steven,

598
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:44,480
his own fellow Democrats in the south
that were now dominant in the south said,

599
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:48,500
nope, not enough. And there were a lot
of powerful southerners in the Senate.

600
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:52,450
So he drafted six days later,

601
00:42:52,451 --> 00:42:56,740
January 10 of 50 for a second
version of the Kansas Nebraska Act,

602
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,390
and he,

603
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:04,980
he gave a direct statement
of popular sovereignty quote,

604
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:11,070
the decision on slavery shall be
left to the people residing there in.

605
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,190
Now he's moved one step further,

606
00:43:15,191 --> 00:43:19,090
so there's going to be a vote
out there and how are they vote?

607
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:24,190
That'll determine again, his
fellow southerner said, no,

608
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,090
not enough.

609
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:31,470
And there was a famous episode where
as a kind of spokesman for the southern

610
00:43:32,351 --> 00:43:33,250
point of view,

611
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:38,910
a Kentucky wig from the other party name
Archibald Dixon took Steven Douglas for

612
00:43:39,941 --> 00:43:44,941
a ride in a carriage one day
in March of 1854 after these,

613
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:50,110
these uh, excuse me, uh, in late January,

614
00:43:50,111 --> 00:43:51,910
they are going to vote
on it later in March,

615
00:43:51,911 --> 00:43:53,890
but in late January it
took her a carriage ride

616
00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:00,130
and Dixon and no uncertain
terms told Douglas No, no.

617
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:04,690
What'd you have to do is you have to
draft an explicit repeal of the Missouri

618
00:44:04,691 --> 00:44:06,100
compromise line,

619
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:11,160
a specific repeal of any
geographic division between
slavery and freedom in the

620
00:44:13,031 --> 00:44:16,000
West. In other words, Steven,

621
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:20,110
you'd have to open up the entire west
to the possible expansion of slavery.

622
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,060
Douglas didn't want to do that.

623
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:29,270
He knew this was going to cause a bad
time in the north and he is alleged to

624
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:34,380
have said back to Dixon quote
by God, sir, you are right.

625
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:37,530
I will incorporate it in my bill though.

626
00:44:37,531 --> 00:44:40,110
I know it will raise a hell of a storm.

627
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:43,590
And he was right.

628
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
It may seem a bit odd to us today that
Americans could care this much about what

629
00:44:50,341 --> 00:44:51,930
was to be done to Nebraska

630
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:56,700
or for that matter with Kansas.

631
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:01,980
We didn't even know about Dorothy
yet and the yellow brick road,

632
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:08,600
but no other than it was
really did care visit.

633
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:12,730
Think back again to this idea of Free
Labor radiology and we'll bring this up

634
00:45:12,731 --> 00:45:14,560
again and again and the
next three lectures.

635
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:20,700
The American dream to the
average northerner immigrant
or not was land free land

636
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:29,431
of possible cheap land if not a place to
move to mobility where you would never

637
00:45:31,901 --> 00:45:36,670
have to compete with any kind of
oligarchy that could control that land.

638
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
The bill that he finally brought forth
and that actually passed had two measures

639
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:46,200
and I'm going to leave you here.

640
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:51,950
The two measures were they explicit
repeal of the Missouri compromise line and

641
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,280
the principle of popular sovereignty.

642
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:01,740
The formula for the settlement
of Kansas and Nebraska.

643
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:07,540
The Kansas Nebraska Act is arguably the
pivotal event politically of the 1850s

644
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:13,470
that will now sectionalize American
politics break apart forever.

645
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:17,220
The Whig party, what was
left of it, and give birth to

646
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:23,220
the first successful third party
coalition movement in American history.

647
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:26,160
The Republican Party immediately,

648
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:30,960
which comes into existence immediately
in the wake of the Kansas Nebraska Act.

649
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:35,250
And if you want to understand
how sectional that vote
was right down that vote,

650
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:39,990
count in the house. No Northern
Democrats, but right in half.

651
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:42,150
That's Douglas as party,

652
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:47,820
but nearly half of his own party in
the House voted against this bill.

653
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:52,080
Southern Democrats 57 to two
I can't explain those two.

654
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,280
I don't know what happened to them.

655
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,360
Northern Whigs 45 to zero against this.

656
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,640
This is a polarization folks.
We've heard a lot about that recently.

657
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:08,120
Southern wigs 12 to seven the
Whig party is diminishing.

658
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:12,150
It's all, but it will be dead
in the wake of Kansas, Nebraska,

659
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:17,390
and the four free soilers elected in
1852 now our platform that oppose the

660
00:47:18,871 --> 00:47:22,590
fugitive slave act voted of
course against Kansas, Nebraska,

661
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:28,310
that vote 113 to 10 got the
Kansas Nebraska Act passed,

662
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:35,380
but in the long run with terrible results,

663
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,130
it will break apart the
American political party system.

664
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,860
It will bring about for the first time,

665
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:46,861
a genuine antislavery political coalition
that will elect a president within six

666
00:47:48,851 --> 00:47:52,630
years.
See you on Thursday.
