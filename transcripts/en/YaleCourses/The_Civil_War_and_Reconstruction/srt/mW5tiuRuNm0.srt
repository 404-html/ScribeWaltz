1
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,890
I suppose every war,
the short ones and long ones,

2
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,030
the ones that get televised
and the ones that don't,

3
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,780
the ones where we get to see the
coffins and the ones where we don't

4
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,900
have their romance and their reality,

5
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,850
it seems to be an endless in the face
of whatever modernization of war,

6
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,870
media coverage of war,

7
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,490
the devastating critique of wars and
individual human experience by so many

8
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:57,660
great poets and writers
for a century and a half.

9
00:00:57,661 --> 00:00:59,610
It doesn't seem to matter what

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,240
changes or what happens,

11
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:09,050
but youth grow up to be excited about war.

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,270
Ambrose Bierce once wrote that only,
I quote him,

13
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,120
only fools forget the causes of war,

14
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,720
but then it's the same.
Ambrose Bierce one of the most,

15
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,880
certainly I think the unique
American writer about the
civil war in so many ways.

16
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,210
A kind of bitter,
brutal realists too,

17
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,760
was wounded three times in the war,

18
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,310
hit in the head with a shell shot from
a cannon should have died Carston and

19
00:01:42,951 --> 00:01:46,340
part of his skull,
which may explain Ambrose Bierce actually,

20
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:53,390
but as beers who also wrote that lovely
little line where he said the soil of

21
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:58,250
pieces thickly sown the seeds of war.
Yeah.

22
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:01,580
Too much peace for a while
and people get anxious.

23
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:09,590
Americans win this war broke out
and braced it with a fever that is,

24
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,180
uh, an enthusiasm and an almost, um,

25
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,170
undefinable joy.
Uh,

26
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,820
that may be a little tough to
understand today or appreciate.

27
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,360
It's only in the wake of war or in
the face of real war. Of course,

28
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:34,361
the people get reflective at the
end of it all at the end of it all.

29
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:39,980
And Lincoln's second inaugural
is this famous passage.

30
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,231
And by the way,

31
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:47,231
there may be more book titles drawn from
this one page and a half speech than

32
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:51,290
any other piece of prose ever
Penn by an American. I mean,

33
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:54,350
I can just start ticking off the
book titles that come out of phrases.

34
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,300
The latest is a Jim Mcpherson,

35
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,210
his latest book of essays called
this mighty scourge of war.

36
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,350
At some point we will run out.
It's only a page and a half.

37
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:08,380
I'm after all on the occasion
corresponding to this four years ago,

38
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:11,690
this is Lincoln,
March,

39
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,690
1865 remembering March,
1861

40
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,090
all thoughts were anxiously
directed to an impending civil war.

41
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,490
All dreaded it all sought to avert it.
Well,

42
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:31,570
the inaugural address was being delivered
from this place devoted all together

43
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:35,540
to saving the union without,
or hmm.

44
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,660
Insurgent agents were in the city
seeking to destroy it without war.

45
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:43,730
Okay.

46
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:48,730
Seeking to dissolve the Union and
divide effects by negotiation.

47
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,600
Both parties deprecated war,

48
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:59,590
but one of them would make war rather
than let the nation survive and the other

49
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:09,350
would accept war rather
than let it parish.

50
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:15,150
And the war came.
Well,

51
00:04:15,151 --> 00:04:18,150
now that's Lincoln's argument,
isn't it?

52
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,313
Yeah.

53
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,820
Once I would make war,

54
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,353
no,

55
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,010
the other side would except war.

56
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,550
Okay.

57
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,900
We're going to revisit that
moment in just a minute. Lincoln,

58
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,860
so called April policy of April,
1861.

59
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,080
His maneuvers against Jefferson Davis
maneuvers about the single fort in

60
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:52,660
Charleston harbor or the civil
war would actually begin.

61
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,570
Did Lincoln maneuver the
south end of the first shot?

62
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,930
Always been a question
on answered. Um, quickly,

63
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,690
let me revisit with
you. Um, whoops, sorry.

64
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,390
Um, this question of causation. I
left that in a bit of a bay. It's, uh,

65
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,080
there was,
uh,

66
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,950
there was a school of interpretation
of this war that has had a tiny,

67
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,440
tiny little revival of lake,
uh,

68
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:34,190
in the hands of greatest stories. People
I greatly admire, like Edward Errors.

69
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:39,680
And you've read two of his essays for
this week, worrying about the civil war.

70
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,680
Um, and, uh,

71
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:48,170
my colleague here skip
scout in a different way.

72
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,450
There's been a kind of a little revival
of this notion that the civil war

73
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:56,660
might've been preventable,
that it might've been needless.

74
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,570
Um,
no one is arguing that as,

75
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,320
as vigorously as James G.

76
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,830
Randall and Avery craven and our host of
other American historians do it in the

77
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:10,820
1920s, thirties and
forties, up to World War II.

78
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,010
World War Two is going to really reshape
that interpretation and put it on the

79
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:16,820
run.

80
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,820
But I wanted to just visit it a moment
because it shows us not only the

81
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:27,020
historical interpretations as will be
yours are influenced by one's own times,

82
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:29,540
one's own experiences,
one's own assumptions,

83
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:33,140
one's on sentiments and
how the world shapes us.

84
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,470
Sometimes it comes out of conviction.

85
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:41,960
The needless wars school interpretation
was led by James Round on every craven

86
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:43,940
and Avery Cravens.
Casey was a Quaker,

87
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,900
but these were men deeply influenced by
the outer disillusionment of World War

88
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:52,304
One.

89
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:58,030
They came of age and cut their teeth
on history at a time when the world had

90
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:03,320
collapsed into what seemed to be in
the end. And explicable meaningless war

91
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,760
is that unforgettable scene
at the very beginning of, um,

92
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,340
the guns of August by Barbara Tuchman.
No one reads her anymore.

93
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:16,970
She was at one point the most
popular historian in America,

94
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,720
um, turn it over the Middle
Ages. She wrote about world war.

95
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:23,570
She wrote up all kinds of things.
Anyway,

96
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,940
at the very opening of the guns of August,

97
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,120
there's a scene,

98
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,410
we're on a German general
meets of French general,

99
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,680
somewhere in the mid or late 1920.

100
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,370
And the one general says
to the other, uh, sir,

101
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,230
why did it happen?
And you're the general says,

102
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,750
I don't know.
I really don't know.

103
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,830
In the wake of the Bay of Pigs and
before the Cuban missile crisis,

104
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:03,130
President John Kennedy gave a copy of
the guns of August and ordered every

105
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:06,710
member of his National Security
Council in his cabinet to read it.

106
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,370
And he quoted that passage and he said,

107
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,720
never will.
We never,

108
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,840
shall we be caught having to
answer that question about war.

109
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,603
I don't know,

110
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,660
in that kind of disillusionment
and interpretation that fines,

111
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,820
sheer politics and fanaticism and uh,
you know,

112
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,531
uh,

113
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:41,160
aggressive emotionalism
and overblown kind of, uh,

114
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,260
what did Randall call it?

115
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:47,261
Anxious fury as the essential explanation
of why the war came in 1861 can make a

116
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:53,990
certain sense. There's a bug
geiling quality of that argument.

117
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,880
When we look at the folly of human
history and the folly of human nature

118
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:05,210
at all changed in so many ways.
In the wake of the Second World War,

119
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:09,560
a war that was all about it,
he ology all about racism,

120
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:14,100
all about the survival of enlightenment,
ideas against [inaudible],

121
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:17,090
against fasteners,
fascism and so on and so on.

122
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,980
And the generation led by such as storage
is Arthur Schlesinger Jr and many,

123
00:09:21,981 --> 00:09:22,341
many,

124
00:09:22,341 --> 00:09:27,341
many others came to see the American civil
wars coming when they started writing

125
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:34,361
in the 1950s and sixties and into the
70s as what they would call and your

126
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:39,710
repressible conflict and
this array of arguments,

127
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,140
they all get kind of all
lumped under this heading.

128
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:48,370
Irrepressible conflict thesis began
to flow from American historian Don

129
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:54,920
Fehrenbach or may have captured that
interpretation best in a line when he said

130
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,990
the civil war came and it was fought.

131
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,603
MMM.

132
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,540
To bring,
well,

133
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,540
how did he put it to bring to bring
great national progress at great national

134
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:13,610
cost. I remember mind entirely
comfortable with that idea.

135
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,040
You know? Well, it all had to happen.

136
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:19,160
It was bloody and horrible and
terrible and all those people died.

137
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:23,120
But we all got better for
it. That never, never,

138
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:24,500
never sits very well with me,

139
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:28,280
especially when you study the
memory of the war and the aftermath.

140
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,050
But what happened in post war, World War
II scholarship, and it's still there,

141
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:38,170
it's still at the heart of how we try
to explain this most pivotal event.

142
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:44,030
The one of the most pivotal events in
American history is a certain respect for

143
00:10:45,531 --> 00:10:46,910
moral questions,

144
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,960
a certain respect for ideas and in a,
and the,

145
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:56,420
and the notion that politics
sometimes about something,

146
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,173
oh,
that's a

147
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:07,560
utterly horribly streamlined way of
saying you don't find many historians

148
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:10,890
anymore who argue from a
needless war perspective.

149
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:17,270
Although what you do find is a kind of
roller coaster ride through American

150
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:20,340
scholarship about this,
the civil war,

151
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,220
sometimes deeply influenced by Vietnam,

152
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,870
sometimes deeply influenced.
Even today,

153
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,790
some have argued about Harry Stack,
uh,

154
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,390
skip stouts book. Um, if
you know professor stout,

155
00:11:37,391 --> 00:11:42,391
he is remarkable new book out about
whether the American civil war was a just

156
00:11:43,691 --> 00:11:44,524
war.

157
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:49,650
And I will revisit that question at the
end near the end of this course and use

158
00:11:51,941 --> 00:11:54,370
a couple of his arguments.
It's controversial in your book.

159
00:11:54,371 --> 00:11:55,540
It's an interesting book.

160
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,160
It's a question we've never
truly asked about this good war.

161
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,120
Was it just,
does it fit?

162
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,350
Does it fulfill the principles
of just war doctrine?

163
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,340
Can it,
does it matter?

164
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,323
Okay.

165
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,420
All right.
Um,

166
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,860
but back to April,
1861

167
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:25,910
whether it was just

168
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,860
and just why it became so
bloody and so prolonged,

169
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,160
we're going to take up over and over,

170
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,960
but it surely did happen
and it began,

171
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:51,050
I dunno if that map works terribly well.
Probably doesn't.

172
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:56,130
It's the best I can do this morning
is a map of Charleston harbor,

173
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:02,630
which had their last remaining federal
installation fort around the coast of the

174
00:13:04,531 --> 00:13:08,010
American south,
still in federal hands.

175
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,760
By march and April of 1861

176
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,390
the seven states of the seceded south,

177
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:19,200
the deep South had begun
to cs coastal forts.

178
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,140
They began to see these federal arsenals.

179
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,180
They seized post offices and
they seized federal courts.

180
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:27,691
Now,

181
00:13:27,691 --> 00:13:32,691
I can guarantee you today if you
seized a federal court office building,

182
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,390
and if, particularly if you
killed anybody in the act

183
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,140
or if you took over the US post office,

184
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,420
uh,

185
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:53,300
I know nobody cares about post dogs is
because you do everything online. I mean,

186
00:13:53,301 --> 00:13:56,670
it was putting those people down there
on, on, uh, on elm street. You mean?

187
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:01,390
No such sweet people that if somebody's
taken over that post office at gunpoint

188
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:06,190
is, is not, not a thought.
But if you did that today, I,

189
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,240
and you'd be in federal prison and no time
and you could be charged with treason.

190
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,710
Now we can come back to that issue
of treason when the course ends, uh,

191
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,610
revisited if you want, um, about this war.

192
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,170
But by and large, every federal
installation in a seceded state,

193
00:14:23,171 --> 00:14:27,730
the seven seceding states had
been seized by those states.

194
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,510
Confederate states except Fort Sumpter.

195
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,250
Okay.

196
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,960
And it was a brand new forte.

197
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:36,963
MMM.

198
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,370
Oh God.
It can't be more than 200,

199
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,120
maybe 300 yards across diameter.

200
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,340
It had just been built in the late 1850s
is part of the coastal fort system,

201
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:53,030
a big, huge high stone
walls, but 20 feet high.

202
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,520
It sits out at the mouth
of Charleston harbor.

203
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:04,870
Here it is nearly a mile from fort Sumpter
to the tip of the town of Charleston,

204
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:13,510
which is here from the battery park and
Charleston to the fort is nearly a mile.

205
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,530
You can almost not see it.

206
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,880
Um,
there is today a monument.

207
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:25,010
I wish I had a slide of it to show you.

208
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,300
It's one of my favorite for strange
reasons. Civil war monuments,

209
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:32,030
the thousands upon thousands
of civil war monuments.

210
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,730
Many of them are so generic
you don't even notice them.

211
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:40,150
This one you notice it's right at the
tip of battery park in Charleston where

212
00:15:41,151 --> 00:15:44,660
they used to hang pirates.
It looks right out at Fort Sumpter.

213
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:47,090
It was put up in the early 20th century.

214
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,720
It's a confederate monument
of our wing Roman soldier.

215
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,440
I think Roman,
because of the helmet I'm told is Roman.

216
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:03,010
He's some combination of of a
winged creature and a soldier.

217
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:09,260
He's about four times the size of life
he is looking out at Fort Sumpter.

218
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,150
And the inscription around the bottom says

219
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,600
to the defenders of Charleston,
quote,

220
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,990
count them happy.

221
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:26,030
Who for their faith and
courage endured a great fight.

222
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:31,670
I'm gonna repeat that.
Count them happy.

223
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:36,650
Who for their faith and
courage endured a great fight

224
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,560
on our monuments of this war.
Almost all of them,

225
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,530
you will find almost nothing

226
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:52,410
about what caused the war or even
about what its consequences were.

227
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,900
Almost all it was just a great fight.

228
00:16:59,100 --> 00:16:59,890
Okay.

229
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:02,380
And the dead are happy.

230
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,240
Well, what to do about fort Sumpter. Uh,

231
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:12,540
in his first inaugural of March four,
1861,

232
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,280
Lincoln promised, he said,
promised to quote, hold,

233
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:21,240
occupy and possess
remaining federal property.

234
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:22,980
Now think about it.

235
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,720
If Lincoln and the Republicans are going
to make a stand against the session,

236
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,130
and once he finally comes into office,
by the way, the day he entered off,

237
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:34,800
as all at federal property had
been taken by those seven states,

238
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,280
it's already done.
He inherits the situation.

239
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:44,370
Now he could have backed away and
continued to try to negotiate.

240
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,080
And there was a compromise
negotiation under John Jay Crittendon,

241
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,140
a Kentucky senator,

242
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,850
Washington for a while going on in
late February and it never came up with

243
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:56,850
anything new.
They were going to try again,

244
00:17:56,851 --> 00:18:00,390
a geographic boundary out
in the west with slavery,

245
00:18:00,391 --> 00:18:04,980
although don't forget the dred Scott
decision declared that on leads illegal,

246
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,140
um,
they're going to try to,

247
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:11,300
or the rub up something again about
fugitive slaves to satisfy the south.

248
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,540
They just couldn't come it.

249
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:17,540
Any new ideas and Lincoln could have tried
to continue to whole compromise Nikos

250
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:24,050
negotiation conventions he could have
or he could have held firm to the

251
00:18:25,441 --> 00:18:26,670
Republican position.

252
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:31,650
That's the session was
illegal and impossible and
unconstitutional and had to be

253
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:36,180
stumped.
But if he lets fort Sumpter go,

254
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:40,280
there was a garrison there led by a,
um,

255
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,380
a colonel named Anderson.

256
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:45,330
Yeah.

257
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,930
He just lets it go and effect.
He's saying,

258
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:53,540
well maybe all that seizure
federal properties legitimate, um,

259
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,610
maybe it's a session is possible.
Right.

260
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,770
It was about the only place he could have
taken a stand if he was going to take

261
00:19:02,771 --> 00:19:03,604
a stand

262
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:09,780
on Lincoln was buying time and he took
a whole month of time before he acted.

263
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:11,940
Yeah,

264
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,780
he was hoping for what he
called privately quote,

265
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,550
voluntary reconstruction.

266
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,780
He was hoping for Saner minds
in the south to some, you know,

267
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:27,050
a union spirit in the south to somehow
take whole and as much been said over the

268
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,470
years about Lincoln overestimating
union sentiment across the south,

269
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,710
he may have indeed over
estimate at union sentiment,

270
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:35,910
but there was a good deal of it.

271
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:41,200
There were a lot of frightened people and
the upstate counties of Virginia and a

272
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:44,940
Western Virginia and in western North
Carolina and eastern Tennessee and

273
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:45,930
northern Georgia.

274
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:51,090
Those Union is pockets of the south were
scared about this because they have to

275
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:55,800
make terrible decisions. Now, if
this cozy, if this goes to war,

276
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,400
who do they go with and stay home?

277
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,510
Well, colonel, I'm sorry, Major
Robert Anderson had about 80 men.

278
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:15,270
He was from Kentucky. That's from
slave holding in his background,

279
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,453
but

280
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,670
he'll never end up with the south.

281
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,960
A commissioners from South Carolina.

282
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,610
Okay.

283
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:31,610
Had come to Washington as early as January
of [inaudible] 61 to negotiate that

284
00:20:31,821 --> 00:20:33,950
specific forts release.
They wanted it.

285
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,110
Federal government had basically
stonewalled president of Buchanan.

286
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:43,970
Then the lame duck president tried
actually to reinforce the fort and by

287
00:20:43,971 --> 00:20:46,760
reinforce it for,
I mean send food to the garrison of

288
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,480
um,
between January five and nine of 1861,

289
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:56,930
Buchanan the only act Buchanan
even tried to make about secession.

290
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,320
He was begging to get out of office.

291
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:05,470
Buchanan send a ship called the star of
the west full of supplies down the coast

292
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:10,471
of Fort Sumpter to feed the men shore
batteries around the harbor actually

293
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:14,230
opened up fire and one had
a direct hit on the ship,

294
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,230
but nothing came of it. No,
it's January five to nine.

295
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:24,530
South Carolina was the only succeeded
state wasn't until the 11th that

296
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,720
Mississippi went and then Georgia and
then about six others in the next three

297
00:21:30,721 --> 00:21:31,554
weeks.

298
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:37,090
Lincoln's April policy if you like,

299
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:42,780
was a process of trying to buy time
and if there was to be war or firing or

300
00:21:46,331 --> 00:21:48,100
shooting about Fort Sumpter,

301
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:52,870
he was trying to make sure the
shots were fired by the south.

302
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,290
Now there were Harkes
and his administration,

303
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:01,120
there were Harkson the Republican
party who wanted him to act faster.

304
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:06,010
One of them wrote to Lincoln privately
and said, quote, give up Sumpter, sir,

305
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,790
and you are as dead politically is.
John Brown is physically

306
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:14,810
yeah.

307
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:18,920
Newspapers across the north strongly
republican newspaper started to print

308
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:19,940
headlines like,

309
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:25,250
do we have a government wanted a policy

310
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:31,460
or come to the point Mr Lincoln and so on.

311
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,000
People were ready now do something.

312
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:40,460
Now his secretary of state duly
appointed in great part of this,

313
00:22:40,461 --> 00:22:44,270
Doris Kearns Goodwin is shown and argued
in a recent bestselling book team of

314
00:22:44,271 --> 00:22:48,140
rivals was boy, he makes Seward,
Lincoln's principal rival for the, uh,

315
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,970
the nomination of the Republican Party.

316
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:56,050
My not only put a few of his enemies in
his own cabinet to control them and use

317
00:22:57,621 --> 00:23:00,200
them politically in the end,

318
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:04,700
made an absolute best friend
out of William Seward.

319
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,380
But not yet.
Seward was a dove on this.

320
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,630
Seward wanted to negotiate.

321
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:18,370
He urged evacuation of
the fort and then he said,

322
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:23,260
leave the door open to
voluntary reconstruction as
it might take hold around the

323
00:23:23,261 --> 00:23:27,580
south as southerners might see that this
new Lincoln administration was willing

324
00:23:27,581 --> 00:23:28,414
to talk.

325
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,130
Yeah,

326
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,630
and it isn't.
All the sewer did.

327
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,680
Seward launched a crazy plan to declare
war on Spain and France to direct

328
00:23:39,111 --> 00:23:44,111
America's attention outward to the world
and therefore cause national unity wag

329
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,840
the dog. All right, you see the movie?

330
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,730
Let's just go to war with Spain and
France and all those crazy southern is

331
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,970
realize, oh, the nation is at risk.

332
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,800
Lincoln immediately rejected this idea,

333
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:04,560
although unfortunately it got out
there and the foreign ministers, Spain,

334
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,800
France needed explanations.
Thank you very much.

335
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,240
Stuart also made private promises as
secretary of state to southerners that

336
00:24:14,631 --> 00:24:18,290
Sumpter would ultimately be evacuated.
Just hang in there. Just wait.

337
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,010
Well,
Lincoln found that out.

338
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,460
He said the Seward in effect shut up.

339
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:28,521
Now,

340
00:24:28,521 --> 00:24:33,521
Lincoln tried in his approach to Sumpter
two separate reinforcement of these

341
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:39,791
troops and military act from provisions
and Humanitarian Act and he wanted to

342
00:24:42,711 --> 00:24:47,240
stress the ladder.
He notified finally southern officials,

343
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,720
you never forget them as the confederate
government just notified South

344
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:53,451
Carolina.

345
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:58,310
He said that he was going to send food
and provisions to Hungary soldiers.

346
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,460
Now who could be against that.
You just got to feed some people.

347
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:07,760
He called it a mission of
humanity, bringing food to
a hungry man, quote unquote.

348
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,700
But the confederate leadership took,

349
00:25:10,701 --> 00:25:15,701
this is a direct challenge and Lincoln
did indeed send a ship down the coast

350
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:23,370
about the eighth or ninth of
ape known sixth or 7th of April,

351
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,630
uh,

352
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:30,630
any 61 and the prolonged
suspense finally came to an end

353
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,930
that one ship was provisioned with food.

354
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,740
Now the truth is there were some arms
and some weapons and the whole as well,

355
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,350
and the end isn't going to matter a lot.

356
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:47,910
The confederate cabinet met
under Jefferson Davis and
the 9th of April and they

357
00:25:48,941 --> 00:25:53,941
made a decision that if Blinken tried to
sail that ship into Charleston harbor,

358
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,850
they would fire on it.
On the 11th of April,

359
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,230
Major Anderson in the fort was going to
chance to surrender by the authorities

360
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:07,410
in Charleston.
He refused.

361
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:13,470
And at four 30 in the morning, in
the dark of night, April 12th, 1861,

362
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:17,250
about 100 cannon from all
around Charleston Harbor,

363
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,480
100 federal Canon's originally now seized
by the confederate states of America,

364
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,910
opened up m bombarded.

365
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:33,210
Charleston bombarded Fort
Sumpter for 35 hours.

366
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,213
Yeah.

367
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,130
Anderson's men hid
underground and dug out.

368
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,000
They'd been well prepared for this
and none of them died. And the

369
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:48,800
of thousands of shells
lobbed into the Ford.

370
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,870
The relief expedition arrived out of the
mouth of the harbor during the firing

371
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,050
and it never got to the fort.

372
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:07,330
On the 14th of April,
after the bombardment ended,

373
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:14,460
Anderson was forced to surrender the
fort to take down the United States flag,

374
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:20,850
a brand new confederate states flag
with stars and bars was put up.

375
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:27,970
And then Anderson's men
held, uh, a gun salute.

376
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,440
21 gun salute.

377
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:35,370
And the first casualties of
the war occurred when two
of Anderson's troops were

378
00:27:37,181 --> 00:27:42,181
killed on a powder keg blew up because
it was too close to one of the muskets

379
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:52,810
for April's later 620,000 dead
and the 1.2 million wounded

380
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,220
before I go go back up at Fort Sumpter.

381
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,833
Okay.

382
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,500
On April 14th,
1862

383
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:13,300
it will be attended by William Lloyd
garrison and 3000 freed people.

384
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:16,603
Okay.

385
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,180
But that's a long way away.

386
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:19,960
Yeah.

387
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,200
The day after the firing on Fort
Sumpter all across the country,

388
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,060
the headline was war

389
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,600
and Lincoln

390
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:34,290
sent an executive order dot declaring war.

391
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:37,380
Lincoln's position on this was clear.
He to him anyway,

392
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:39,510
that no nation can declare war on itself.

393
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:43,890
He never accepted succession as legal
or constitutional or appropriate,

394
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:49,940
but he called for 75,000 volunteers
to put down a domestic insurrection.

395
00:28:50,431 --> 00:28:51,510
And in the constitution,

396
00:28:51,511 --> 00:28:55,830
the President United States is given
control over the military to put down

397
00:28:55,831 --> 00:28:59,520
domestic insurrection.
He called it a rebellion.

398
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:06,783
No.

399
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:11,470
The most immediate and the most important
immediate result of the firing on Fort

400
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,960
Sumpter, of course, was the
succession of the upper south

401
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,350
part of the upper south.
Where's my map?

402
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,953
Well,

403
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:34,040
oh, I apologize. I should have had that
map, right. Well, you'll remember the map

404
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,750
for more southern states.

405
00:29:37,751 --> 00:29:41,500
Slave states will succeed in the wake
of something to the most pivotal course

406
00:29:41,501 --> 00:29:42,334
was Virginia.

407
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:47,470
But Note Virginia had held a secession
convention back in February and

408
00:29:47,471 --> 00:29:52,471
decisively voted against the session
after Fort Sumpter in this state of war,

409
00:29:54,281 --> 00:29:58,030
hysteria and fever and fear,
and under.

410
00:29:58,031 --> 00:30:03,031
Now this new argument that what the
Lincoln Administration had really done was

411
00:30:03,491 --> 00:30:08,140
an act of coercion against
the south coercion. Now,

412
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:12,910
the feeding of some 80 soldiers in the
fort was being interpreted as coercion.

413
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:15,670
Okay,
but Virginia quickly,

414
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,790
overnight held a new secession convention,

415
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:23,791
actually had state legislature
held it and it voted 88 to 55

416
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:31,620
devote 88 to 55 lots of those,

417
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:36,220
no votes, almost all of those no votes
coming from the western part of Virginia.

418
00:30:36,221 --> 00:30:37,570
West Virginia didn't exist yet.

419
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:42,880
The western part of Virginia where there
was very little slavery and some of the

420
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:45,400
upper counties of Virginia.

421
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:51,400
April 17th only three days after
the surrender of Fort Sumpter,

422
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:56,820
Virginia seceded from the union by may
six Arkansas seceded by a vote of 69 to

423
00:30:58,841 --> 00:31:02,110
one in secession convention,

424
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:06,690
North Carolina on May 20th
voted to send the look.

425
00:31:06,691 --> 00:31:09,970
We're North Carolina is now,
it's between Virginia and South Carolina.

426
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,380
What are they gonna do?

427
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:17,730
They voted unanimously in convention
just to seed and finally on June 8th by a

428
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:23,050
two to one vote of a popular referendum.

429
00:31:23,051 --> 00:31:27,130
These we've done different
ways in different states
on in a popular referendum,

430
00:31:27,131 --> 00:31:31,420
Tennessee in a two to one vote,
approximately

431
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,170
seceded from the union or

432
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:39,340
the confederacy was now 11 states.

433
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,040
It would never really
be any more than that,

434
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:47,590
but there was great tension
about what Maryland, Delaware,

435
00:31:47,591 --> 00:31:49,960
Kentucky,
and Missouri would actually do.

436
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:56,100
Lincoln is reported to have said that
he hoped to have God on his side,

437
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,100
but he was certain he wanted Kentucky.

438
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:06,630
Now there's been a whole flurry of
emails recently on the slavery in history

439
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,600
network of historians online.

440
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,950
I'm trying to trace that quote just in
the past couple of weeks and the truth is

441
00:32:14,951 --> 00:32:18,070
nobody can actually find it anywhere.
It's one of those many, many,

442
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:20,620
many probably Apocryphal Lincoln quotes.

443
00:32:20,621 --> 00:32:23,200
He must probably said
something like it's somewhere,

444
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:28,210
but I just couldn't resist using it.
I've used it for so many years,

445
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,820
so footnote might be apocryphal.
Okay.

446
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,620
He did need Kentucky and whatever.
He said,

447
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:44,630
all those states were deeply divided
about what to do and what they will do in

448
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:49,430
the war will prove that and they will
be terrible, horrible places to be

449
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,890
geographically, emotionally,
physically. In the war.

450
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,670
Maryland was horribly divided.
Node where it is,

451
00:32:58,671 --> 00:33:00,950
it's right above Washington DC,

452
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:08,210
approximately 50,000 white men fought
for the union in Maryland and the civil

453
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:12,750
war, approximately, I'm sorry,

454
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:17,280
about 50,000 white men in
Maryland fought in the civil war,

455
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,290
30,000 on the Union side,
20,000 on the confederate side.

456
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:27,420
And of those 30,000 on the union side,
9,000 of them were African Americans.

457
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,293
Kentucky

458
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:35,590
had about 50,000 men fight for the union,

459
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:40,870
and about 35,000 men fight for
the confederacy. And per capita,

460
00:33:40,871 --> 00:33:42,200
Kentucky,
uh,

461
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:47,110
produced more African American soldiers
for the Union army than any other state.

462
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,380
24,000 total.

463
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,750
Yeah,

464
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:55,470
Missouri. The numbers are
even greater. In Missouri,

465
00:33:55,471 --> 00:33:58,260
about 80,000 men fought for the union,

466
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,890
about 30,000 fought for the confederacy,

467
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,040
and there were about 3000
to one on either side.

468
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:08,490
They were gorillas looking
for the best pay day.

469
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,530
Okay.

470
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:14,560
Early versions of Jesse
James Without ideology later.

471
00:34:14,561 --> 00:34:18,340
Jesse James got real ideology though.
That's another story.

472
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,700
And folks, especially in those
states, this was immediately,

473
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:29,620
you've heard all the cliches about how
it was a fratricidal conflict kind of

474
00:34:29,621 --> 00:34:32,410
brothers war immediately.

475
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,500
It was a brother's war and thousands of
families in April and May and June of

476
00:34:39,131 --> 00:34:40,390
1861,

477
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:45,460
brothers and fathers looked each other
in the eye and had to decide what they

478
00:34:45,461 --> 00:34:46,294
would do.

479
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:47,610
Okay.

480
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:51,630
Henry Clay had seven
grandsons in Kentucky.

481
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:56,670
Three fought for the union and
for fought for the confederacy.

482
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,460
Okay.

483
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,320
John Jay Crittendon of Kentucky,

484
00:35:00,321 --> 00:35:05,321
of these as a senator of the Crittendon
compromise efforts in this position.

485
00:35:05,961 --> 00:35:10,961
Winter had one son who became a general
in the union army and one son who became

486
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:14,030
a general in the confederate army.

487
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,440
Both survived and I've always wanted to
know about Crittendon family reunions,

488
00:35:20,481 --> 00:35:24,610
but I've never looked into it.
Mrs Lincoln,

489
00:35:24,611 --> 00:35:27,850
Mary Todd Lincoln, who was of
course born and raised in Kentucky,

490
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:36,860
I had four brothers who all fought for
the confederacy and three brothers in law

491
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,220
who fought for the confederacy.

492
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,380
Okay.

493
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:45,580
It will lead late at all kinds of charges.
Well,

494
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:48,470
some charges about treason
against her and so on.

495
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:51,560
Le Sympathies for the south and so on.
And so

496
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,480
John See Pemberton from Pennsylvania
became a confederate general and was

497
00:35:58,761 --> 00:36:03,761
ultimately the general who surrendered
Vicksburg to grant in 1863 George Thomas

498
00:36:05,391 --> 00:36:09,860
was Virginia born
old slave holding family,

499
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:16,060
but he never resigned his commission
and he became known as the rocker

500
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,870
Chickamauga. The union general who won
the battle of chicken was a Virginian

501
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,100
and the stories go on and on and on.

502
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:27,050
There's the story of Clifton
and William Prentice.

503
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:34,190
One of them fought in the sixth
Marilyn Infantry, uh, union regimen.

504
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:38,510
The other fought in the second Marilyn
Infantry, a confederate regiment.

505
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,400
Both were wounded at Petersburg
on April two on the same day,

506
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:46,730
1865 and the last week of the war.

507
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:51,050
And they died and cots right next
to each other in a field hospital.

508
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:54,483
Okay.

509
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,110
And the list goes on and on.

510
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:00,623
No.

511
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:06,020
When people went to war in 1861,
what did they say they were doing?

512
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,740
What did they say? Where their aims
were there? What were their reasons?

513
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,753
We have,
uh,

514
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:19,290
thousands of diary entries and letters
and editorial and all sorts of things to

515
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:23,710
draw upon.
But on the northern side,

516
00:37:23,711 --> 00:37:28,450
what you find that summer is not only
the sense that this will be a short war,

517
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,460
and that's a preface worth

518
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,453
pointing out.

519
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,540
But people would say over and over,
they were fighting for the flag,

520
00:37:37,541 --> 00:37:40,760
but they were fighting for the union.
They were fighting for the constitution.

521
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:44,630
They were fighting to save the republic.
They were fighting two quotes,

522
00:37:44,631 --> 00:37:48,480
save the government and you keep
hearing those phrases and you,

523
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:53,010
you keep thinking, oh man, these are
abstractions. What were they really doing?

524
00:37:55,340 --> 00:38:00,200
You keep reading and You keep hearing
them say the same damn thing. Well,

525
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:04,620
there's a lot of good scholarship on
this now that shows us that in 1860

526
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:09,620
[inaudible] in America, the u s
constitution was important to people.

527
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,650
They saw it as a kind of protection.

528
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,920
They saw it as a source of social order.

529
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:22,570
They saw the American nation as now
something they were directly experiencing.

530
00:38:22,881 --> 00:38:27,230
Millions were directly experiencing
the government as never before in those

531
00:38:27,231 --> 00:38:32,231
debates of the 1850s and as I've said
before now voter turnout just zoomed in

532
00:38:33,051 --> 00:38:38,051
the 1850 to 75 and 80% in each
general election from 852 on

533
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,430
a pallet and then a
marvelous book about this.

534
00:38:45,431 --> 00:38:49,660
They said that the constitution and the
government for so many northerners was

535
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:54,661
like a shield of protection and the
southern succession now was not just a

536
00:38:55,061 --> 00:38:56,380
threat to this government.

537
00:38:56,381 --> 00:39:00,640
It was a threat to social order itself
and are therefore had to be stopped.

538
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:04,740
Okay.

539
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:09,490
Uh, New Hampshire farmer who became
a buck private in 1861 said, quote,

540
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:13,930
the question now is country or
no country liberty or slavery

541
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,530
is a beautiful clarity
to that isn't there?

542
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:23,730
Now I don't know what he said after
bull runner after Antietam or after

543
00:39:25,331 --> 00:39:26,111
Spotsylvania,

544
00:39:26,111 --> 00:39:31,111
if he survived a 50 year old railroad
contractor named Robert mcallister threw

545
00:39:32,531 --> 00:39:37,531
down his lucrative job in
1861 and enlisted at age 50
quote to help us put down

546
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:42,580
this wicked and unjustifiable rebellion.

547
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,630
Our country and property is
worth nothing if we don't,

548
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:49,030
nor will life be secure.

549
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:50,840
Okay.

550
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,640
This is all over people's letters.

551
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,170
They said they were fighting for liberty

552
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,240
of course.
So Soda Southern,

553
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:03,800
no. Another argument here, and again,

554
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:08,801
Phil Pallen and has made this better than
anyone I think is he's argued that sun

555
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:12,810
is a northern, is it sort of come
to view the U s constitution? This,

556
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:16,430
you know this document we live under Dan,

557
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:20,300
different ways that northerners that
come to see the constitution as a kind of

558
00:40:20,301 --> 00:40:25,220
protector, much violated
now by Kansas, Nebraska Act,

559
00:40:25,221 --> 00:40:26,960
dred Scott decision,
et cetera.

560
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:32,540
Whereas southerners had come to see
that constitution more as a destroyer,

561
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,000
as something to fear.

562
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,200
It might if the wrong
people get hold of it,

563
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:44,570
begin to attack or erode their society.

564
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,350
There were a lot of people,
particularly in the north,

565
00:40:48,351 --> 00:40:50,480
but then quickly in the south as well,

566
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:55,010
who when this war broke out began to
see it in terms of cosmic dualism,

567
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:59,330
good and evil.
God was entering history right away.

568
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:03,160
Christian America began to
interpret this in millennial terms.

569
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,140
God had a quarrel in America.

570
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:10,280
People start arguing and they're going
to really be arguing this after the

571
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:15,020
enormous bloodshed of 62 and 63 when
they have to try to explain why this is

572
00:41:15,021 --> 00:41:15,854
happening.

573
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:16,870
Okay?

574
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:17,441
They're going to say,

575
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:22,330
God has an appointment with America
and he's going to decide whose sins are

576
00:41:22,331 --> 00:41:23,164
worse.

577
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:32,320
Now on the southern side, as I said,
people have to make tough choices,

578
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,410
horrible choices.

579
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,920
Who Do they go with and join their
neighbors or pose their neighbor

580
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:40,680
Mary Chestnut.

581
00:41:40,681 --> 00:41:45,681
The great dire is from South Carolina who
indeed kept the most famous diary by a

582
00:41:47,731 --> 00:41:49,800
southern woman.
There are many of them.

583
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:51,430
Okay.

584
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:54,190
She remembered March and April,

585
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:56,850
1861 this way and here we have
another kind of beautiful clarity.

586
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:58,283
Okay,

587
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,570
we separated,
said Mary Chestnut because of in Kampala,

588
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,400
in compatibility of temper.

589
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:11,300
We are divorced north from south
because we hate each other so much.

590
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:19,060
Okay, Mary, I get it. Doors,

591
00:42:19,061 --> 00:42:21,580
papers you hate us.

592
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:27,830
Walter knew Jenna,
Mississippi lawyer who did not own slaves,

593
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,480
nevertheless declared in 1861
there without slave labor.

594
00:42:32,481 --> 00:42:34,760
Now the non slave holders arguing this,

595
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,540
that without slave labor the country
would be quoted in his words,

596
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,330
a barren waste and desolate plane.

597
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:46,900
We can only live in exists by this
species of labor and hence I am willing to

598
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:49,640
continue the fight to the last,

599
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,490
well Nugen hadn't seen any fight yet,

600
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:55,670
but
nevermind.

601
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,430
Well in the end,

602
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:06,610
the south from the highest ranks of
Jefferson Davis on down to buck private's

603
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:10,700
are all going to say they were
fighting for their liberty.

604
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:13,760
Everybody was fighting for their liberty

605
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,690
and what blocks to get into
this thing and 62 and 63, uh,

606
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:20,450
they're fighting for their liberty too.

607
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:21,970
Yeah,

608
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:24,010
everybody is.
Lincoln later said,

609
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,010
everybody declared for liberty.

610
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,193
Okay,

611
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,440
no, I'm making a mistake. I love to cook.

612
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:41,090
My friend Uriah over there on the stone
wall and Woolsey a walk every time,

613
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:44,200
every morning on the
way over here to class,

614
00:43:44,201 --> 00:43:47,650
I'd go by and I rub my finger on his name
for, I dunno, good luck or something.

615
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,310
If I teach her long enough,
it's probably going to wear off.

616
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:55,890
But everybody in the union army, it
wasn't a Uriah parmelee. In fact,

617
00:43:55,891 --> 00:43:59,700
the vast majority were not going
to free the slaves just yet.

618
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,040
There's a story of a

619
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:10,340
Yankee soldier in Virginia in 1861
oh encounters a slave woman in it.

620
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:14,310
And he's taken that woman's goods and
that woman's, well, wait a minute,

621
00:44:14,311 --> 00:44:18,260
aren't you coming here
to help us? And, uh,

622
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,040
he answered her and said,

623
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:22,103
MMM,

624
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:28,110
no. He answered her and
said, no. The woman says,

625
00:44:28,111 --> 00:44:32,910
we were told you are coming here to
help us and instead you steal from us.

626
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:36,630
And the soldier replied,
you're a Goddamn liar.

627
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,930
I'm fighting for $14 a month.
And the union,

628
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:44,400
there's a beautiful clarity in that too.
I ain't ain't here to free you.

629
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:51,880
Oh, I got behind on this
outline, didn't I? That's okay.

630
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:53,920
That's actually just fine.

631
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,013
MMM.

632
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:02,960
When we resumed that don't, don't leave
yet. When we resumed next Tuesday,

633
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:08,770
I will talk a little bit about west
point and what happened at West Point on

634
00:45:09,561 --> 00:45:13,460
union and confederate or southern
and northern men began to leave.

635
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:18,350
And then we'll begin the war and we'll
talk about comparative strengths and so

636
00:45:18,351 --> 00:45:18,531
on.

637
00:45:18,531 --> 00:45:23,480
But let me leave you for today
and the weekend if you don't mind.

638
00:45:23,481 --> 00:45:24,650
With Walt Whitman,
again,

639
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:32,400
Whitman's opening poem of his immortal
collection called drum taps in a kind of

640
00:45:33,821 --> 00:45:35,170
agonizing way,

641
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:40,690
may have captured what was in the
heads of most Americans in 1861

642
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:45,730
to the drum taps prompt.
He writes,

643
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:49,600
the young men falling in
and arming the mechanics,

644
00:45:49,601 --> 00:45:52,830
arming the troll,
the Jack plane,

645
00:45:52,831 --> 00:45:56,740
the blacksmith's hammer tossed
aside with precipitation.

646
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:03,040
The blood of the city is up armed arm.
The cry everywhere.

647
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:07,780
The flags flying out from the steeples
of churches and from all the public

648
00:46:07,781 --> 00:46:12,190
buildings and stores, the tearful
parting, the mother kisses or Sun,

649
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:16,630
the sun kisses the mother low. This
is the mother to part, yet not a word.

650
00:46:16,631 --> 00:46:18,850
Does she speak to detain him?

651
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:24,420
War and armed races advancing
the welcome for battle.

652
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:29,050
No turning away now.
War be it weeks,

653
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:34,380
months or years and armed race
is advancing and it welcomes it.
