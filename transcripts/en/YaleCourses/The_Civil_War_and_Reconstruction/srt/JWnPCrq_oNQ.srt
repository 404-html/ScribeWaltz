1
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:08,390
Frederick douglass gave a speech in 1875
that gives us a question that we might

2
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:13,230
keep in mind right through
the end of the course.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,020
Let's call this Douglas question.

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,710
It's the speech he gives
an 1875 in Washington,

5
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:21,780
D c not the year.

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,530
It's 1875 he's anticipating it's the
4th of July and he's anticipating the

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,220
coming year of the u s centennial of
independence and he knows there's going to

8
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:38,520
be a big national
celebration and it will be,

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,250
and I'll say something
more on that next week,

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,030
Philadelphia put on an
extraordinary exhibition,

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,180
the nearly one 10th of the
American people visited,

12
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,660
but Douglas is anticipating this national
centennial 10 years after the civil

13
00:00:56,221 --> 00:01:00,600
war, and he's worried. He said,

14
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:04,080
the nation of quote,
when I'm quoting him with lift to the sky,

15
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:07,650
it's million voices in one grand.
Centennial,

16
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:12,651
Hosanna of peace and goodwill to all the
white race from golf to lakes and from

17
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:20,180
sea to sea.
And as a black citizen,

18
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:23,870
he dreaded the day. He
said, listen to his words,

19
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,680
it's one of them was racialized speech.
This is Douglas ever game. He stayed,

20
00:01:27,681 --> 00:01:30,230
he dreaded the day when his words,

21
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,490
this great white race
has renewed it's vows,

22
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:39,440
the patriotism and flowed back
into it's a custom channels.

23
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,500
He was proud,
he said to be an American,

24
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,540
but he was worried.
And then he ended with this question,

25
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:55,000
if war among the whites brought
peace and liberty to blacks,

26
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,310
what will peace among the whites bring?

27
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,183
Okay,

28
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,410
what would peace among the white brain.

29
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,520
Okay.

30
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,520
It's a way of shaping an overall question
in Douglas and did it for us as to how

31
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:16,031
and why reconstruction ended up eroding
collapsing if you want failing as some

32
00:02:18,651 --> 00:02:22,400
say ending.
Now,

33
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,000
one of the things we're going to begin
to examine today and the rest of the

34
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:29,470
course is this question,
sorry to keep putting the uh,

35
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,370
outline back up.

36
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,470
But we are always as historians
debating this question of ends.

37
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,900
When did reconstruction and uh,
there's, we'll see in a moment,

38
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,950
many are going to claim it's all
over when they pass a 15th amendment.

39
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,730
It's what Horace Greeley said.
That's 1870.

40
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,850
And then there are those
who argue reconstruction.
Now it really ended in 1873.

41
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,840
And the reasons you argue
that the horrifying Colfax
massacre and Louisiana on

42
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,900
Easter Sunday,
April 14th,

43
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,600
1873 the largest domestic murder,

44
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,780
collective mass murder and all
of American history until nine 11

45
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:17,980
okay.

46
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,120
And the following Supreme Court decision
based upon the investigation of that

47
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:24,700
massacre, and I'm going to
deal with Colfax next Tuesday.

48
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:26,790
Okay.

49
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,060
Some would argue that really
shows us an under reconstruction,

50
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,230
but all the southern states weren't yet
back under the control of the Democratic

51
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,570
Party. So those who are arguing, no, no,

52
00:03:35,571 --> 00:03:40,571
no reconstruction doesn't really end
until you have the full redemption by the

53
00:03:40,891 --> 00:03:44,070
southern Democrats have
their state governments,

54
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,930
which doesn't occur until the disputed
election of 1876 and it's compromise of

55
00:03:48,931 --> 00:03:51,810
1877 and we'll deal with
that and a week and a half.

56
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,210
But then there are plenty of others now
who argued no, no, no reconstruction.

57
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,400
Never really ended in the 19th century.

58
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,580
Heather Cox Richardson has a book out now,

59
00:04:01,581 --> 00:04:06,581
but about the story of reconstruction
and its issues moving west in the United

60
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,370
States throughout the
rest of the 19th century.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,833
Yeah.

62
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,660
Steve Prince,

63
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,020
one of your teaching assistants has a
chapter in his dissertation and titled The

64
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,310
ends of Reconstruction.

65
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:20,030
He's playing off that irony or
that pun of when did it end?

66
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,320
Did it ever end?

67
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,920
Okay.

68
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,730
Sam Shaffer is going to argue it didn't
end until 1912 and his dissertation,

69
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,930
I got another, uh, graduate
student, Owen Williams,

70
00:04:30,931 --> 00:04:34,830
who's writing a dissertation on the
Reconstruction Supreme Court and he's

71
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:37,410
arguing that absolutely ended in 1873.

72
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,470
This is the sort of inside baseball
that historians love to play mean your

73
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,630
Dayton and fight over it.

74
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,100
We tell the world dates don't matter
and we love to fight over them.

75
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,703
Yeah,

76
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,680
I'm probably going to
do what I usually do,

77
00:04:55,681 --> 00:04:58,200
which is leave you with a good
deal of ambiguity about that.

78
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,460
In some ways,
reconstruction has never ended.

79
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,900
Now think with me for a moment though,

80
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,420
back on the ground in the south,
uh,

81
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,670
about this question of the
real lives of the Freedman,

82
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,850
the Trans formations to
New Labor arrangements,

83
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,890
this vexing, naughty, chaotic, uh,

84
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:32,940
in some ways,

85
00:05:32,941 --> 00:05:37,941
terrible process by which slave labor
converted to free labor and ultimately

86
00:05:38,911 --> 00:05:41,610
into sharecropping as a system.

87
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,300
In which approximately 80% of all the
Friedman found themselves essentially

88
00:05:48,301 --> 00:05:53,301
myered in as early as the late 1860s and
surely by the 1870s and throughout the

89
00:05:55,351 --> 00:05:56,550
rest of that century.

90
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,180
Okay.

91
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,750
One of the greatest memoirs we have,
it's an odd kind of memoir,

92
00:06:01,751 --> 00:06:05,530
but one of the greatest memoirs
we have by a sharecropper,

93
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,620
and I don't know if you've
ever read this book,

94
00:06:08,621 --> 00:06:12,310
and of course it gets widely taught
often an African American history courses

95
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,530
is the autobiography
of Neat Shark.

96
00:06:17,531 --> 00:06:22,510
All old gods dangerous. His real
name was ned cob. Name was changed,

97
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,860
I guess to protect him in the title.

98
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:32,030
It's an extraordinary series of
hundreds of hours of interviews. Uh,

99
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,830
the Ted Rosengarten did with
him some 25 years ago. Now,

100
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,930
Ned Cobb lived a very, very long life
and in the middle of the 20th century.

101
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,960
But he grew up a sharecropper and there
are a thousand nuggets of wisdom or the

102
00:06:47,351 --> 00:06:49,870
secrets from his past
as he often calls him,

103
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,740
that Ned carb Shaw has to give us.

104
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,120
There's this honest section about how
he never got an education and now he

105
00:07:01,361 --> 00:07:06,361
resents that he never got an education
and how he resents actually it his father

106
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,550
never even sought to help
get him an education.

107
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:18,250
I didn't never get out of the first
reader, got no education to speak of.

108
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:23,550
And another hurt addition to that
weren't no colored schools through here.

109
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:28,660
And this is central
Alabama worth no count.

110
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:34,140
You might find a school close to town
somewhere that accommodated the colored.

111
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:39,130
And if you did, you'd doing,
you were doing well, said Ned.

112
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,060
My daddy when he had the opportunity,

113
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:46,210
never did send me to school
long enough to learn to read.

114
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,110
If you send his children, he'd have
to supplement the teacher's salary.

115
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,550
But if he don't, but if he don't send
his children, it don't cost him nothing.

116
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,310
And there's nothing said.

117
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,600
None of my brothers and sisters,
not one by name,

118
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:05,900
got a good book learning and all I can do,

119
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:10,220
I can put down on papers,
some little old figures,

120
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,860
but I can add them up.
Well,

121
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:17,220
ned went on to be a

122
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,960
a landowner and one of the most moving
passages in this book comes toward the

123
00:08:24,181 --> 00:08:26,790
end when he buys his first mule,

124
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:33,390
when he puts his first stinking
smelly mule and his own stable.

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,010
It's like a religious experience.

126
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:43,620
Smelling a mule is not exactly my
idea of of religious experience,

127
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,690
but it was to ned.

128
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,560
But he really is hard on his father.
It's an honest,

129
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,090
honest illustration.

130
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:58,950
I've heard the sons and daughters of
the freedmen and now it is the son of a

131
00:08:58,951 --> 00:08:59,940
former slave

132
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,590
we're inheriting so little.

133
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,670
I mentioned the other day
that what the Friedman had

134
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:15,420
was some human capital,
their skills, their bodies,

135
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,740
their labor, their dreams, their religion,

136
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,430
their ideas, their self
worth, the dignity.

137
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,590
But they had so little physical capital,
they owned nothing.

138
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,010
And I had no money,
no credit.

139
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,060
So few ways of getting
any physical capital.

140
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,430
He goes on and on and on.
I won't quote it,

141
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:43,490
but he continually refers to what he
called his father's old slavery thoughts.

142
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,890
He complains about how his father
never learned how to put up any money,

143
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:55,890
never learned to save anything. And that
he didn't learn it very well either.

144
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,710
In fact, here's what he says, he
said, my daddy was blindfolded,

145
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,130
didn't look to the
future just throwing him,

146
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,200
I'm sorry for the direct language here,

147
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,970
just throwing his money in a
dead hogs ass and taking shit.

148
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,720
Sorry about that on the video.

149
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,710
But Ned cobb's directness is useful.

150
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:26,660
It's in the face of
those kinds of obstacles.

151
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,680
It we contain, we call
them that. Nevertheless,

152
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,360
thousands upon thousands of
Friedman embraced in education

153
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,470
and embrace the hope that
literacy could bring.

154
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:41,420
And let me focus on that just briefly.

155
00:10:41,421 --> 00:10:45,410
At least mired in the
system of sharecropping,

156
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:46,610
working on halves,

157
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:51,611
giving half of their crop to the land
owner and half the crop they would keep

158
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:52,950
and hopefully get cashed,

159
00:10:52,951 --> 00:10:57,830
but then that cash had to be spent down
at the furnishing merchant to get seeds

160
00:10:57,831 --> 00:11:02,390
and get tools and get
food. Excuse me, clothing.

161
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,050
Nevertheless,
in the face of all of this,

162
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:11,530
one of the things a Freeman most wanted
was this book learning the net carb

163
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,390
never gone.
Well.

164
00:11:14,391 --> 00:11:19,391
We know about slave literacy and
Friedman's literacy is essentially this.

165
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,410
At the end of the civil war,

166
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:26,411
probably 5% maybe 7% to eight of
the American slaves were literate

167
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:34,570
by 1870 that had increased
to perhaps 12 to 15%

168
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,773
and

169
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,400
that was due of course to
the Friedman schools to the,

170
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,390
to the Freedmen's bureau schools.

171
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:49,000
There were tremendous accomplishments
in these Freedmen's bureau schools.

172
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,520
They created over 4,000 of them.

173
00:11:51,521 --> 00:11:56,521
There were some 93 teachers at one time
or another employed and Freeman's bureau

174
00:11:56,741 --> 00:12:00,460
schools up into the 1870s
they had at one point,

175
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:05,020
slightly more than a quarter million
students in these schools, Freedman,

176
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,370
young and old,

177
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:11,790
68 72 year old former slaves would sit
down in the same room with eight year

178
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:17,020
olds and begin to try to
read out of the same reader.

179
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,740
Okay.

180
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,740
And there were in some ways nothing
more threatening to white southerners.

181
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:25,981
Actually,

182
00:12:25,981 --> 00:12:30,060
there were two things most threatening
to white southerners around which this

183
00:12:30,061 --> 00:12:34,920
southern counterrevolution will be forged.
One was the black school,

184
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,890
black literacy education, the potential
of mobility and the education,

185
00:12:40,891 --> 00:12:44,460
particularly of a black
political leadership class.

186
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,000
And then con.
And then on the other hand,

187
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:53,340
directly related of course was the
creation of black politics itself.

188
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,440
As we'll see in a moment, one of the
major targets of the Ku Klux Klan,

189
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:02,580
the knights of the White Chameleon and
all the other imitating groups that

190
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:06,030
imitated these were black schools.

191
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:12,890
Dozens and dozens of black schools were
burned to the ground by the Klan between

192
00:13:14,491 --> 00:13:17,880
1868 in the middle of the 1870s.

193
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:24,470
I want to just read just one little
example of what these schools meant to

194
00:13:25,741 --> 00:13:27,880
people.
Uh,

195
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,570
I love this little letter
because of the assumption, the,

196
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,520
let's call it audacity of hope,
if you'll want, forgive the title.

197
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:41,590
This comes from a black school
principal whose name was PB Randolph.

198
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,360
He's running a Friedman
school in New Orleans in 1866.

199
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,140
They named it for William Lloyd garrison.
It's called the garrison school.

200
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,430
He has 373,
uh,

201
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:00,210
pupils and he has seven
teachers, uh, five of them black,

202
00:14:00,211 --> 00:14:04,020
two of them white. And this
was, this was the revolution,

203
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:08,700
the potential revolution of
reconstruction. And he writes
this letter to himself,

204
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:12,870
William Lloyd garrison asking for
garrison to help them get what they need.

205
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,660
Just a small excerpt of it.

206
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,970
We are proud of our pupils and
feel you will rejoice with us.

207
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:26,100
We feel also that you will not take a
miss if we ask a little assistance from

208
00:14:26,101 --> 00:14:31,101
Boston in the shape of apparatus
to illustrate astronomy,

209
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,910
a gyroscope and a microscope,
a numerical frame,

210
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:40,410
conic sections, cube
root blocks, a magnet,

211
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,740
and such other instruments as will enable
us to fight this battle for our race

212
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,190
against ignorance.

213
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,720
Send us the simplest implements
to teach some science

214
00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:00,270
and a thousands of those such
letters all over the record.

215
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,430
Literacy among blacks
increase to over 80%. Um,

216
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,060
uh, by 1880, I'm sorry,

217
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:16,040
over 20% by 1880 and probably 25 to 30%.

218
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:21,070
These things are very difficult to
measure by the turn of the 20th century.

219
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,610
Now you need to know one other thing
here by the 1880 [inaudible] 1890

220
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:30,611
[inaudible] turn of the 20th century
literacy rates among southern whites.

221
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,730
We're not that much higher.

222
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,663
Yeah.

223
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:43,340
Remember one thing above all else about
these new economic social arrangements

224
00:15:45,691 --> 00:15:50,691
taking hold from 1866 right on through
the 1870s in the south share cropping

225
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:53,731
emerge.

226
00:15:53,731 --> 00:15:58,731
This is the argument share
cropping emerged essentially
as a kind of compromise

227
00:16:00,421 --> 00:16:05,220
result of a tug of war between
two kinds of interests.

228
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,280
Blacks wanted autonomy.
They want out of gangs.

229
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,260
They wanted their women out of the field.

230
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,010
They wanted some control
over their economic lives.

231
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,010
White folks,
the owners,

232
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:25,040
land owners wanted labor to
control a stationary dependent poor

233
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:30,883
labor force.

234
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Both sides end up embracing tenant farming
sharecropping because it was such a

235
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,480
desperately cash poor society.

236
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,950
Landowners didn't want to rent to
blacks because they knew in the long run

237
00:16:46,951 --> 00:16:49,260
blacks wouldn't get enough
cash to pay the rent.

238
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:54,270
Blacks realized quickly
they couldn't depend on cash
because there wasn't enough.

239
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:59,510
They therefore themselves began to resist
wages because they get promised wages

240
00:16:59,821 --> 00:17:00,840
and they wouldn't get paid.

241
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,920
So share cropping this system
that ultimately becomes a
frosty and bargain and a

242
00:17:07,081 --> 00:17:11,700
dead end and a kind of tragic no exit
for the vast majority was nevertheless

243
00:17:11,701 --> 00:17:16,701
something they actually negotiated
and embraced themselves.

244
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,343
No.

245
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,040
Also on the ground in south emerging

246
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:33,700
out of radical reconstruction
as the southern states were

247
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,550
put under the first reconstruction act
and the subsequent reconstruction acts,

248
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,970
what took place in the south was the
creation of new state governments run by

249
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:50,610
the Republican party in every former
confederate state, at least at first

250
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,740
all the acts confederate states were
readmitted to the union between 80 and 68

251
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,320
and 1870 Georgia was the last,

252
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:03,590
but by 1870 all 11 x confederate
states are back in the union,

253
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:10,290
but they're back in the union. Remember
under that radical reconstruction plan.

254
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:16,670
Now this story that's set in about
this over the years from the loss cause

255
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:20,960
ideology of the late 19th century to
the writings of the so called dunning

256
00:18:20,961 --> 00:18:24,450
school of the turn of the 20th
century and early 20th century,

257
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,950
based on the writings of
William h dunning and his many,

258
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:33,951
many students he trained at Columbia
University was this idea that what what

259
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:39,831
happened in the south now was essentially
carpet bag rule or rule by bayonet or

260
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,980
rule by blacks.

261
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,270
Now in the history books we've
come to call us for decades,

262
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,430
the myth of carpet bag rule.

263
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,480
This idea that the south was colonized,

264
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:05,750
taken over by northerners and move
south white northerners and move south,

265
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,943
uh,

266
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:13,310
plying appealing to exploiting
and manipulating the black
vote to take over the

267
00:19:15,391 --> 00:19:20,391
south to disenfranchise and eliminate
white southerners from their own policy.

268
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:28,070
Now this much is true in every
former confederate state.

269
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,320
The so called radical constitutions
did manage to create all sorts of new

270
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:39,360
levels. If you like,
of democracy, small d,

271
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,650
The number of elective offices increase.
It was more direct election,

272
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:47,580
more direct control for people
in the south had ever seen.

273
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,140
There were more people voting,

274
00:19:49,141 --> 00:19:53,040
more constituencies and more people
holding office. We'll see in a second,

275
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:57,450
there was more home rule for local
governments than they'd ever experienced

276
00:19:57,451 --> 00:20:01,830
before. These new radical
constitutions. Yes,

277
00:20:01,831 --> 00:20:06,420
indeed had eventually a
fair degree of corruption.

278
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,910
This was the age of spoils and the
kinds of corruption going on in southern

279
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:15,450
state governments was no difference in
the kinds of corruption going on in many

280
00:20:15,451 --> 00:20:16,710
other places in the country.

281
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:21,900
But there were many social provisions in
these new constitutions as long as they

282
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:24,630
lasted.
And they lasted seven,

283
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:28,710
eight and nine years in some
ex confederate states and
they only lasted three to

284
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:33,060
three and four years. And others, uh,

285
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:36,660
for the first time there
were social provisions.

286
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,850
They not only did away
with the black codes,

287
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:42,420
but they established a certain
degree of equal civil rights.

288
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:45,750
Some of these new state governments
actually pass the civil rights acts.

289
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:51,530
Many of the made it the
state's responsibility now
to for the first time in

290
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:53,680
southern history.
And for that matter,

291
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:57,370
there wasn't much of it is in the
north either to provide for the sick,

292
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:01,060
the insane, the disabled,
the poverty stricken.

293
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,370
Yeah.

294
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:06,700
Above all else, they created public
schools. The first public schools,

295
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:07,870
the south I'd ever seen.

296
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:13,230
South Carolina had the first comprehensive
school law of any southern state

297
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:18,901
passed an 1870 by 1871 they had 32% of
people have school age attending some

298
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:26,620
1700 public schools in South Carolina,

299
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,210
blacks and whites,

300
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,840
and by 1875 the South Carolina
public schools system,

301
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,201
creative,

302
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:40,201
other radical republican regime had
50% this is still a rural society and a

303
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:45,960
society riven with problems
of race and violence is,

304
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,970
we'll see it had 50 probating 75 they
had 50% of school age population of South

305
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,800
Carolina in school with over 3000
teachers paid by public tax money.

306
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,460
Now,
the one thing of course,

307
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:08,461
that virtually no southern
radical republican southern
regime ever accomplished

308
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,480
was much in the way of any kind of
economic and redistribution of land

309
00:22:16,451 --> 00:22:20,020
redistribution. This is our
classic problem of reconstruction.

310
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,740
How could you advance political liberty,
the right to vote,

311
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:27,220
the whole office serve on juries.
Run legislatures.

312
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:28,910
Yeah.

313
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:32,510
And yet why does economic liberty always,
always,

314
00:22:32,511 --> 00:22:37,100
always lag behind? Now there
were some attempts, however,

315
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,200
let me give you just one little example.

316
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,950
I don't think phone or really
even mentioned to this again,

317
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,630
South Carolina,

318
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:49,430
which had a black majority of its
legislature for about five years during

319
00:22:49,431 --> 00:22:52,490
reconstruction as well as
a political revolution.

320
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,870
And you can see why white southerners
who were organizing against it,

321
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,120
but the South Carolina
legislature run by blacks,

322
00:23:02,121 --> 00:23:06,710
by blacks and white Republicans,
some of them native born southerners,

323
00:23:06,711 --> 00:23:11,090
some of them from the north created
a South Carolina Land Commission.

324
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:17,810
They created it in 1868 it actually is
going to last all the way to 1890 on the

325
00:23:19,141 --> 00:23:23,340
books. It, it, it, uh,

326
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:27,750
it's settled some 5,000
South Carolina families,

327
00:23:27,751 --> 00:23:32,751
black and white on land that the
state purchased or took over,

328
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,690
confiscated in effect,

329
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:42,290
and then began to sell to its own
citizens on longterm loans at very reduced

330
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:45,174
interest.

331
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:51,340
Approximately $225,000 out of $802,000
eventually it could not be accounted for.

332
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,120
There was,

333
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,530
there was some fraud and corruption in
the South Carolina Land Commission about

334
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,410
a quarter of the money that
they actually distributed,

335
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,750
never was accounted for,

336
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,880
but it's extremely important to note here
that at least an attempt was made here

337
00:24:10,881 --> 00:24:11,271
was the,

338
00:24:11,271 --> 00:24:16,271
at least the possibility of
radical reconstruction by
1876 that land commission

339
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:24,611
in South Carolina by 76 republican still
barely controlled the South Carolina

340
00:24:25,851 --> 00:24:28,310
state government. They're
about to lose it. That year,

341
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,640
[inaudible] 80 76 about 14,000
families had participated,

342
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,640
a total of about 70,000 people,
about 60% black,

343
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,110
40% white in actually buying land.

344
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:48,220
By 1884 more blacks were
losing land in South Carolina.

345
00:24:48,411 --> 00:24:50,750
However,
then we're buying it.

346
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:54,863
Yeah.

347
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,560
I'll give you one last little number to
show at least what the possibilities had

348
00:24:59,561 --> 00:25:00,394
been.

349
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:05,610
In the census of 1890 about 13,000 blacks
in South Carolina owned the farm of

350
00:25:08,651 --> 00:25:13,651
some signs for thousand
of whom had purchased them
through that land commission.

351
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:19,870
Now we're always talking
about the possibilities,

352
00:25:19,871 --> 00:25:22,630
the experiments of reconstruction.
What if, what if, what if,

353
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,320
what if it had been more enforcement?
What has it been more military occupation?

354
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,423
What if,

355
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,600
what if the Klan and its
imitators had truly been crushed?

356
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,840
All the other crushed this kind of land
commission is one example among others

357
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,800
of the kinds of efforts that could have

358
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,020
flourished.
Now

359
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:52,290
in those state governments in the south,

360
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:57,650
you had for the first time in American
history and in a kind of a explosion of

361
00:25:58,381 --> 00:26:02,310
political activity,
you had black elected officials,

362
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:07,610
approximately 2000 African Americans
in the southern states served in state

363
00:26:09,841 --> 00:26:13,380
legislatures and state government
and executive positions.

364
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,350
And ultimately in the U S Congress,

365
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:21,680
16 African Americans from x confederate
states were elected to the u s Congress

366
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,260
to,
to the u s senate,

367
00:26:25,261 --> 00:26:30,210
Hiram revels from Mississippi being the
first black senator in American history.

368
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,860
And how many times do you hear in
our political culture today? Uh,

369
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,890
the first black since reconstruction,
the first this since reconstruction,

370
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:38,970
the first of that,

371
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,260
the first black governor
since reconstruction was
Doug Wilder in Virginia.

372
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,880
The first this and the first
that since reconstruction,

373
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:52,680
it's because there was this explosion
of black political activity for a short

374
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:53,520
period of time,

375
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:58,290
decade really until the lights went out.

376
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,000
Yeah,

377
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
of the 1000 delegates to constitutional
writing conventions in 1868 69 when

378
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:12,690
these new state governments were created
of about the thousand delegates that

379
00:27:12,691 --> 00:27:17,590
participated in writing those new
constitution, 268 of them were blind.

380
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:23,660
About 680 African Americans served in
the lower houses of state governments

381
00:27:24,421 --> 00:27:29,421
during reconstruction for presided as
speakers of those houses that were 112

382
00:27:31,201 --> 00:27:34,470
African Americans and served in
state senates during reconstruction.

383
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:39,930
There were at least 41 black sheriffs
somewhere in one of the 11 x confederate

384
00:27:39,931 --> 00:27:44,570
states. There were five black mayors
of southern cities for awhile.

385
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:49,050
There were 145 blacks is heard on
city councils and so on and so on.

386
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:52,683
Now

387
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,020
this is the heart of the
myth of carpet bag rule.

388
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:02,430
The claim against these people in the
south, at least in the white south,

389
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:06,060
was always they were not prepared.
They were ignorant.

390
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:10,780
All they did is sit around eating
chicken bones and spitting in the Gold's

391
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:12,990
platoons that they
bought with public money.

392
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:17,540
And if you've ever seen birth of a nation,
a DW Griffith's,

393
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:22,541
a white supremacist epic of 1915 he
plays out that scene at great length of,

394
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:29,460
of the black politicians
in state legislatures would
their boots up on tables,

395
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:34,730
literally chewing on chicken bones and
spitting in this platoons and laughing

396
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:39,480
and playing happy Darcie
until the cows come home.

397
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,063
Yeah.

398
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,800
There were corrupt black politicians and
there were a corrupt white politicians.

399
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:54,490
I don't really have time to go into all
the great biographical stories of the

400
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:58,430
Robert Smalls is and the John Roy Robert
smalls as a South Carolina and the John

401
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:02,810
Roy Lynch's of Mississippi and,
and so many others who,

402
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,850
many of whom were former slaves,
all the,

403
00:29:04,851 --> 00:29:08,670
some of them had been free before
the war by their own purchase,

404
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:12,950
by manumission mission, by other means.
Some of them, only a small percentage.

405
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:18,140
We're northern born blacks who moved
south like Hiram revels and eventually got

406
00:29:18,141 --> 00:29:21,950
himself elected to the Senate.
By the way, just recently,

407
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,320
well,

408
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,320
I guess it was buddy years ago when the
Republicans had control of the Senate,

409
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,290
they put up a portrait for the
first time of Hiram revels.

410
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:37,760
Our Modern Republican party wanted
to claim him. He wasn't Republican.

411
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:41,850
So are they by name?
Uh,

412
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,950
but anyway there is now today
a portrait of Hiram revels.

413
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,130
It took a century more to get it there,

414
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:52,600
but he's finally up in the u s senate,
his picture.

415
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:58,000
Now, the other side of this
myth of carpet bag rule,

416
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,760
and I want to be a
little speedy about this,

417
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:05,440
but it's also very important
this again this the story,

418
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:09,130
the deep myth that set into
American culture for generations,

419
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,760
is it all these reconstruction governments
really where we're a bunch of Yankees

420
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:13,900
who came south,

421
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:18,540
got themselves elected with black votes
and ran these governments and oppressive

422
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:19,390
white southerners.

423
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:24,910
So who were these carpetbaggers so-called
the term got into our language and now

424
00:30:24,911 --> 00:30:29,380
today anybody who grows up in one state
but somehow moves to another and tries

425
00:30:29,381 --> 00:30:31,540
to get elected as Hillary
Clinton did in New York.

426
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:36,541
And there are plenty of other example is
labeled a carpet bagger at least for 10

427
00:30:36,641 --> 00:30:41,641
years or so until she's lived there long
enough and gets reelected and I guess I

428
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:47,920
guess you got to get reelected
before you no longer a carpet bagger.

429
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:53,110
What many of these northern isn't
one south were former union soldiers.

430
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:59,070
Most of them went before 1867 and 68
before these radical republican regimes

431
00:31:00,251 --> 00:31:03,490
were put in place.
They want to become farmers.

432
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:07,990
They went to because of the land was
so cheap and some of them one because I

433
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:12,290
liked the climate,
there were New Hampshire rights,

434
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:14,890
so went to Mississippi
because it was warm.

435
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:20,830
Some carpet baggers were industrialists,
investors. They saw the south.

436
00:31:20,831 --> 00:31:24,760
Now is the place to invest.
It obviously was,

437
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:28,120
it was prostate and it needed money.

438
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,770
Some are federal agents, Freedmen's
bureau agents and stayed and lived there.

439
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,600
Many were teachers,

440
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,750
some of them stayed and lived if
they survive and weren't killed.

441
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:42,700
Some were political opportunists
and some were adventurers.

442
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:46,630
A ne'er do wells and I'll
never forget as long as I live.

443
00:31:46,631 --> 00:31:51,160
One of the best friends I have in the
world is a Methodist minister in Chicago

444
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:54,250
who grew up in Mississippi and east Texas.

445
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,690
Gene Winkler and a positively brought,

446
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,860
he's one of the best read
human beings I've ever known.

447
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,440
He worries more about
the civil war than I do.

448
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,650
I used to actually ask him
what I should be reading.

449
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,630
His real job was being a minister,

450
00:32:07,631 --> 00:32:11,800
but he spent most of his time reading
and he was one of the most politically

451
00:32:11,801 --> 00:32:14,770
radical people I've ever known.
I mean,

452
00:32:14,771 --> 00:32:16,900
he was still trying to be a
socialist during Reaganism.

453
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:23,410
But one day I asked gene as gene,

454
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:29,010
why do you keep that picture of
stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee?

455
00:32:29,011 --> 00:32:33,990
And the corner of your
office said, you know what,

456
00:32:33,991 --> 00:32:35,230
I'm not exactly sure,

457
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,800
but it's probably because carpet
baggers killed my great granddaddy.

458
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,200
I don't think he said,
God damn carpet baggers.

459
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,340
He's a good Methodist carpet baggers.
Killed my great granddaddy.

460
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,930
I said, Whoa, okay.

461
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:02,890
Like so many southerners,
he was a complicated mixture of memories.

462
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:07,170
Uh, and, uh, well enough on gene.

463
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,060
I actually got the thrill,
uh,

464
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:14,340
some years ago to write an
essay epilogue to Fitz Brundage,

465
00:33:14,341 --> 00:33:19,341
his book of essays called where these
memories grow about southern memory.

466
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,450
And I opened the piece
with that very story.

467
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,450
I was always worried about how
gene was going to interpret it.

468
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:31,510
Any thank God liked it, I think. Anyway,

469
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:38,190
at no time did carpet baggers ever
make up anywhere near a majority of any

470
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,470
southern legislature

471
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,250
in the x confederate states.

472
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,640
Their goals tended to be financial,

473
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,090
economic and to some extent political.

474
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:55,210
And then there's this other
kind of southerner. Yeah.

475
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:59,410
The white indigenous southern or the
native born white southerner known to

476
00:33:59,411 --> 00:34:04,411
history of course is scalawags
who joined the republican part.

477
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,260
Yeah.

478
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:09,730
Who became part of these reconstruction
regimes who said give up the past,

479
00:34:09,731 --> 00:34:11,320
give up the old cars.

480
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:18,050
And they often became the object of the
iron and the hatred and the violence

481
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:24,810
of white vigilante groups
as readily as anyone else.

482
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,753
Now

483
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,960
what was the scale away?

484
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:34,843
Uh,

485
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:41,700
well let me tell you the
ways. Hold on. Sorry.

486
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,200
We're good. Me got it. Now.

487
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,210
Galloway Egg. So a scallywag is,
by the way, our runty little horse.

488
00:34:54,211 --> 00:34:58,170
That's actually what it means. If you
look it up, it's a runty little horse.

489
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,990
I kind of useless a little horse.
It doesn't work very well for you.

490
00:35:00,991 --> 00:35:04,380
Just gets in the way,
stinks and smells and doesn't pay his way

491
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:11,980
are scallywag is the local leper of
the community. Wrote a Tuscaloosa,

492
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:17,310
Alabama newspaper editor in
1869 unlike the carpet bagger,

493
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:21,460
he is native,
which is so much the worse.

494
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,740
Once he was respected in his circle,

495
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:27,730
his head was level and we would look his
name and he would look as neighbor in

496
00:35:27,731 --> 00:35:28,564
the face.

497
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:33,810
Now possessed of the itch of office
and the salt room of radicalism.

498
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,640
He is a mangy dogs.

499
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:41,650
Slinking the alleys haunting
the governor's office
defiling with tobacco juice,

500
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:47,181
the steps of the capitol stretching his
lazy carcass in the sun on the square or

501
00:35:47,821 --> 00:35:49,860
the benches of the mayor's court.

502
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,320
That's relatively direct.

503
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,320
Scalawags were considered,
in other words, turncoats.

504
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:07,230
Now they had a variety of social
backgrounds, some worth sort of former.

505
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:12,110
Nobody's, but most of them were actually
quite prominent people like the wartime

506
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,970
confederate. And governor of
Georgia Josephy Brown who said,

507
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:19,050
give up the cars and joined the
Republican Party after the war.

508
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,790
Perhaps the most famous of all,
James Longstreet Lee's second in command.

509
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:25,410
In the last two years of the war,

510
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:30,710
long streets of Georgia moved out to
Louisiana after the war embraced the

511
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:31,650
Republican Party,

512
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:36,510
said the war had settled something
and the southerners had to face it.

513
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:42,560
And he became a railroad president and
he even for awhile commanded US troops in

514
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:47,460
Louisiana who tried to kill off the clan.

515
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,530
There are many, many other examples. Um,

516
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:57,960
there's James settle of North
Carolina. He's one of my favorites. Um,

517
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:02,040
and these were fascinating
people. Um, courageous people.

518
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:06,060
A saddle of North Carolina had been
a member of the confederate congress.

519
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:10,350
He'd been a big player in confederate
politics in North Carolina.

520
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,480
But after the war,
he said this,

521
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,230
the war had brought a general breaking up.

522
00:37:16,231 --> 00:37:20,880
He said of old ideas taking a
new start in the world. We are,

523
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:25,830
if we are ever to have
prosperity and any concluded,

524
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,121
I tell you,

525
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:31,710
Yankees and Yankee notions are
just what we want in this country.

526
00:37:31,711 --> 00:37:36,450
Now we want their capital to build
factories in workshops and railroads.

527
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,340
We want their intelligence,

528
00:37:38,341 --> 00:37:43,341
their energy and enterprise to operate
factories and to teach us how to do it.

529
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,750
Settle, nearly was killed
for his views, his actions,

530
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:57,050
his political actions in
particular or many other examples.

531
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:01,470
Uh, Amos t Ackerman and
Georgia, uh, among others.

532
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:05,490
Look up him and phoner.
Uh, if you like. Now

533
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:12,120
I guess the only other thing I want to
say about that is there were a carpet bag

534
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,110
governors,

535
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:17,760
there were northern born Republicans who
ended up governors of southern states.

536
00:38:17,761 --> 00:38:22,340
Several of them. There were northern born
members of southern state legislatures,

537
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,550
some black,
some white,

538
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,750
and they became

539
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:34,760
many instances the most ready,

540
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:40,800
um, targets of what was to come. No.

541
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,430
Ah,
there we are.

542
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:54,510
I don't know how well you
can see this painting.

543
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,090
I'll try to blow it up.
It doesn't have a date on it,

544
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:06,230
unfortunately. Uh, yeah.
I need to figure that out.

545
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,170
It is entitled Disfranchisement,
which is an interesting title.

546
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:17,540
If you can see on the right, you can
see about every kind of a image of a,

547
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:22,490
of a, of a bitter, angry Hayden,

548
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,930
the eyes southerner,
some sitting on the Canon,

549
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:32,660
others in Ku Klux Klan robes and masks.
All of them.

550
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:35,870
Of course looking at
the lone black Friedman.

551
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,100
Go on your first look. It almost looks
like he's holding a machete, but he's not.

552
00:39:40,101 --> 00:39:42,440
He's holding a voting role

553
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:44,893
now

554
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:51,080
the southern white counterrevolution
the move towards southern redemption,

555
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:53,960
which simply means of course the dumber,

556
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:58,970
the southern Democratic Party taking
back control of their states between 1870

557
00:39:59,941 --> 00:40:01,470
and 1876

558
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:08,430
is rooted in their hatred there resentment
of the rise of black political and

559
00:40:12,341 --> 00:40:14,650
economic independence.

560
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:16,973
Now,

561
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:18,843
but first of all,

562
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:24,030
go with me back to Washington and then
we'll end at least today back on the

563
00:40:24,401 --> 00:40:27,910
ground in the south and try to understand
where some of this violence is coming

564
00:40:27,911 --> 00:40:28,744
from.

565
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,820
The 15th Amendment Task Congress,

566
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:36,210
the 15th now pass Congress

567
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:40,640
in the spring,
late spring of 1869

568
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:42,730
okay.

569
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:46,180
It's right after you listen to it.
As grant is inaugurated,

570
00:40:46,181 --> 00:40:50,110
president elected in the fall
and inaugurated in the spring

571
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:56,610
by 1868 11 of the 21 northern states
still denied the right to vote to blacks.

572
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,040
You'll remember Republican's are stepping
around this question of black suffrage

573
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:06,190
in the north,
but they want to plant it into the south,

574
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:10,180
but the trick was what kind
of amendment would it be?

575
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,220
This is the great voting rights amendment.

576
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,320
Okay.

577
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,560
They went through three versions of,
of the 15th Amendment,

578
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:20,650
looked this up and phone.
Make sure you understand this.

579
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:25,660
They went through three versions in the
debate in Congress as to what kind of

580
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:29,470
voting rights amendment to put in
the constitution. The first version,

581
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:33,160
and they went from most
conservative to most radical.

582
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:38,470
The first version for bade states the
right to deny suffrage on grounds of race,

583
00:41:40,341 --> 00:41:44,090
color,
or previous condition of servitude.

584
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:49,310
That's all it said.
That's the most conservative version.

585
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,980
The second version would have four bay,

586
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:57,070
four bades states to impose literacy
property or Nativity qualifications.

587
00:41:58,251 --> 00:42:01,340
In other words,
that whole array of qualifications,

588
00:42:01,341 --> 00:42:06,341
tests that will ultimately be used all
over the south to prevent black folk from

589
00:42:07,221 --> 00:42:10,370
voting and to some extent poor white folk.

590
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:17,460
And then it was a third version was
simply would have affirms simply that all

591
00:42:18,251 --> 00:42:23,050
male citizens 21 years of age and
older had the right to vote, period.

592
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,480
Now they debated and debated,

593
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:30,370
but the one they passed of course was
the first one, the most conservative,

594
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:34,390
the one that made absolutely no mention
of the possibility of qualifications

595
00:42:34,391 --> 00:42:35,224
test.

596
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:41,810
And so the 15th amendment has two kinds
of of of impact to great importance is

597
00:42:43,001 --> 00:42:47,230
if you want. One is that it was passed
at all and it's hugely important.

598
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:52,810
But the other of course is it was
a very conservative compromise.

599
00:42:52,811 --> 00:42:57,811
The men left the door open to all kinds
of machinations over time in states at

600
00:43:00,371 --> 00:43:03,790
the local level about qualifications

601
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,493
to vote.

602
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:10,420
It passed the House of Representatives

603
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,790
in March,
1869

604
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:22,770
it finally was ratified by two thirds
of the state legislatures in the United

605
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:25,540
States.

606
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:30,540
A full year later in the spring of
1870 and many people now looked at the

607
00:43:34,691 --> 00:43:39,010
situation in the country a
year into grants presidency.

608
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,980
The man, the Republican who
said, let us have peace.

609
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,470
You've got the 13th
amendment abolishing slavery.

610
00:43:44,471 --> 00:43:47,770
You've got the 14th amendment establishing
the citizenship rights and equal

611
00:43:47,771 --> 00:43:48,910
protection before the law.

612
00:43:48,911 --> 00:43:52,150
At least the beginnings of this
fledgling thing called civil rights.

613
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,990
You've got the
reconstruction acts in place.

614
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:01,580
Southern states have all been
brought back into the union. By 1870.

615
00:44:01,581 --> 00:44:04,970
Georgia was still being
sort of weirdly adjudicated,

616
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:09,920
but it finally was brought back in in
1870 and now comes the voting rights act.

617
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:13,500
And throughout the
history of, of modern, uh,

618
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:17,330
know modern political philosophy
and modern political history.

619
00:44:17,331 --> 00:44:20,420
The idea was that the vote,
you know,

620
00:44:20,421 --> 00:44:22,400
it was the essence of democracy.

621
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:26,810
And so once you've given
people the vote on some level,

622
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,970
what else could you possibly do?

623
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:35,380
Republicans now say to themselves that
they have established the principle,

624
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:42,390
oh,
would that the head of guaranteed rights

625
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:46,110
and that they could go no further.

626
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:54,660
One Republican wrote to another
after voting for this, he said,

627
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:59,690
this is the last great point that remains
to be settled from the issues of the

628
00:45:01,711 --> 00:45:06,711
war and Horace Greeley famously in
his New York Herald Tribune in April,

629
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:13,430
1870 after the ratification of the 15th
Amendment said quote let us have done

630
00:45:13,741 --> 00:45:15,910
with reconstruction, was
the opening line of, of,

631
00:45:15,911 --> 00:45:20,430
of under a big headline a lot of
us have done with reconstruction.

632
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:25,620
The country is tired and sick of it.
Let us have peace.

633
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:28,980
It's over.
It's done.

634
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:36,170
Said official Republican
Party people to themselves.

635
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:38,671
Of course,

636
00:45:38,671 --> 00:45:43,671
the white south for two years already
through it's rising and growing Democratic

637
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:50,420
Party and its violent
militant wings is saying,

638
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,660
you bet reconstruction is over.
Let us show you the ways.

639
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,833
Now

640
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:04,320
I'm actually going to save the violence
story for an entire lecture on its own.

641
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:08,490
Uh, the clan, it's many actions,

642
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:13,910
examples through the Colfax massacre
at least of 1873 for next Tuesday.

643
00:46:13,951 --> 00:46:17,580
But let me leave you with this.
What happens now?

644
00:46:17,581 --> 00:46:22,581
What is already happening now in the
first grant administration by 1870 is what

645
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:26,520
we might simply call,
it's the waning of radicalism.

646
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:30,000
It's the waning of that,
that civic vision, his phone,

647
00:46:30,001 --> 00:46:33,690
or calls it in your book of the
radical Republicans ideology.

648
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:37,320
And what was that vision phone
or lays it all out for you.

649
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:42,600
He said the radical Republicans had
an essential ideological vision.

650
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:48,210
On the one hand, it was
unionism. On the other hand,

651
00:46:48,211 --> 00:46:53,211
it was routed to some extent and trying
to create racial equality because the

652
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:56,640
ward necessitated it
and forced it on them.

653
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,760
They therefore were,

654
00:46:59,761 --> 00:47:03,690
were believers in this idea of guaranteed
rights within the constitution.

655
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:09,030
And last but not least,
they were believers in positive activists,

656
00:47:09,031 --> 00:47:10,050
central government.

657
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:15,700
And you put those three or four principals
together and you've got the package

658
00:47:15,701 --> 00:47:18,100
that was the civic vision
of the radical Republicans.

659
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:23,100
But the problem is that vision
is now going to crumble, um,

660
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:27,850
as fast, almost as fast as it
ever came into existence. In fact,

661
00:47:27,851 --> 00:47:32,410
it's going to crumble faster than
it ever came in to existence.

662
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:41,840
I want to leave you with this.

663
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:53,010
It's not just going to crumble because
Republicans are sort of give up the game

664
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,860
and it's not going to just crumble
because that is Stevens dies and Charles

665
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:00,370
Sumner is out of the way and radicals
don't really run this party underground

666
00:48:00,371 --> 00:48:01,204
anymore.

667
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:05,110
It's going to crumble because of the
most widespread use of political violence

668
00:48:05,111 --> 00:48:09,490
in American history. We'll return
to this question next Tuesday bid.

669
00:48:09,491 --> 00:48:10,660
Let me leave you with this.

670
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,960
There is no African American writer and
some white writers worth their salt from

671
00:48:18,341 --> 00:48:21,020
the 1870s and eighties right on through,

672
00:48:21,021 --> 00:48:26,021
into well into the 20th century who could
ever avert their eyes from this story.

673
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:29,410
This is a passage from James Weldon.

674
00:48:29,411 --> 00:48:32,020
Johnson is the autobiography
of an ex colored man.

675
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:35,530
If you've ever read that
wonderful 1912 novel,

676
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:38,680
you'll know it's the story of a
black man is passing for white,

677
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,650
but because he's passing in the south,

678
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,650
he gets to see things that
people don't know he's seen.

679
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:50,560
And of course the book ends is so many
books did in this time with a lynching.

680
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:58,910
This is x colored man who doesn't have
any other name describing what he sees.

681
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,250
A railroad tie was sunk into the ground.
The rope was removed,

682
00:49:03,251 --> 00:49:08,170
and a chain Broughton securely coiled
around the victim and the stake there.

683
00:49:08,171 --> 00:49:12,310
He stood a man only informing stature.
His eyes were full and vacant,

684
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:17,140
indicating not a single ray of thought.
Fuel was brought from everywhere.

685
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:18,460
Oil,
the torch,

686
00:49:18,461 --> 00:49:23,410
the flames crouched for an instant as
though to gather strength then leaped up

687
00:49:23,411 --> 00:49:26,800
as high as the victim's
head. He squirmed, he rides,

688
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,540
he strained at his chains,

689
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:33,700
then gave out cries and groans
that I show always here.

690
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:38,200
His eyes bulging from their sockets,
roll from side to side,

691
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,940
appealing in vain for help.

692
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:45,090
I was fixed to the spot where I stood
powerless to take my eyes from what I did

693
00:49:46,211 --> 00:49:47,890
not want to see.

694
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:56,680
We have never wanted to see what really
happened in the south and the 1870s but

695
00:50:00,351 --> 00:50:00,830
we'll try.
