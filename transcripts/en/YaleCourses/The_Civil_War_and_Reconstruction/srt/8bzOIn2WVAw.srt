1
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,590
If you haven't noticed

2
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,300
at the back of my addition
of Douglass's narrative,

3
00:00:19,301 --> 00:00:23,170
which is the one I am
hoping you are using,

4
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,200
come on down in quickly.

5
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:33,821
Anyway,

6
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:37,860
if you haven't noticed at the back of
this edition of Douglass's narrative,

7
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:38,740
they're not only,

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,913
okay

9
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,920
a variety of ancillary documents.

10
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,310
Douglas is greatest
speech was also included

11
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:59,120
a word on that. It's Douglas is 4th of
July speech. If you've never read it,

12
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,013
you should read it.

13
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,910
It is the rhetorical masterpiece
of American abolitionism,

14
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,960
one of the greatest works of
Oratory and American history.

15
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,150
It was Frederick Douglass
as Beethoven on steroids,

16
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,150
but with language,

17
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,510
it's like a symphony in three movements.

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,930
I say that in a little
headnote introduction to it.

19
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:33,190
He gave that speech in 1852 I may
refer to it at the end of this lecture,

20
00:01:33,251 --> 00:01:34,480
depending on the time

21
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:41,080
it is all about the crisis that has
gripped the country in the wake of the

22
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:46,081
compromise of 1850 in the midst of this
expansion of slavery into the West and

23
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:50,200
the way it has begun to tear
apart America's political culture,

24
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,810
and on the 4th of July I missed
his friends in Rochester,

25
00:01:55,811 --> 00:01:59,830
New York. He was invited to
give the 4th of July oration.

26
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,290
He says,
thank you very much.

27
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,420
The invitation was from the ladies
in antislavery society of Rochester,

28
00:02:07,421 --> 00:02:11,710
New York,
many of whom were his friends.

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,570
He gave the address in the house of his
friends, Corinthian Hall and Rochester,

30
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,710
600 people in the audience.

31
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,040
Double more than double your numbers.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,020
Read that speech because
it's as if Douglas,

33
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,160
after that first opening
gentle introduction where
he sets his audience at ease

34
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,190
about the greatness of
the founding fathers,

35
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:45,010
the genius of the
Declaration of independence.

36
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,210
He calls it the ring bolt
of American independence,

37
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:51,580
the ring bolt of American identity.

38
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,150
He just makes them feel
good about the founders.

39
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,820
And then it's as if he has a staff
bolting doors around the hall.

40
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,590
And then he's got a staff
riveting people into their seats,

41
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,820
puts metaphorical
seatbelt on him and says,

42
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:16,420
you won't move until I rain.
Held on on you for the next 20 minutes,

43
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,920
which is what he did.
And he says, in effect,

44
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,800
he says more than in effect.
He says it directly,

45
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,520
why have you invited me speak
to you on your 4th of July?

46
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:35,920
And then it just rains the
pronouns on them. You, you,
you, you, your, your, your,

47
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,410
your 4th of July is yours and not mine.
You may rejoice.

48
00:03:39,411 --> 00:03:41,870
I us mourn and 90 90 goals.

49
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,900
And then there's the moment,

50
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,390
one of the most brilliant rhetorical
moments in American letters in my view,

51
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:58,391
but certainly an abolitionist writings
where he doesn't even announced his texts

52
00:03:58,591 --> 00:04:02,870
to his well rooted biblical audience.

53
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,330
And he says,
after raining down on them,

54
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,840
this passage as long passage
about the 4th of July is yours.

55
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:16,400
You may rejoice imas mourn to drag
a man and he fetters into the grand

56
00:04:16,401 --> 00:04:19,310
illuminated temple of liberty.
And call upon him to join you.

57
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:23,810
Enjoy his anthems is in human.
Mockeries says,

58
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,840
and then he just floats without
announcing his text and does 137 song

59
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,300
and he's simply reads
by the rivers of Babylon.

60
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:41,010
There we sat down. Yay. We
wept when we remembered Zion.

61
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,000
We hanged our harps upon the willows
in the midst of their, uh, for their,

62
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:50,001
they that carried us away captive required
of us a song and they who wasted us

63
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:53,070
required of US mirth saying,

64
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,980
sing us one of the songs of Zion.

65
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,150
How can we sing the Lord's
song in a strange land?

66
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,040
If I forget the Old Jerusalem, but
my right hand, forget her cunning.

67
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:10,050
If I do not remember the but my
tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.

68
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,550
What does Douglas just done
to his friendly audience?

69
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,680
He just, one of the most
famous passages in the Bible,

70
00:05:19,681 --> 00:05:21,480
his audience would have
known that passage.

71
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,100
People wouldn't today in little
circles by the rivers of Babylon.

72
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,650
There we sat down, we were the
captives from Egypt and he said,

73
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:37,210
you made us sing for you.
And in effect,

74
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,250
he was saying to them,
I'll sing for you,

75
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,190
but you may not like it.

76
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:49,150
That was Douglas as you did it
hundreds of times elsewhere.

77
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:54,851
It was Douglas is most
brilliant expression of,

78
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:00,490
or critique of this American hypocrisy
about freedom in a land of slavery,

79
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,390
but a lot of people were worried
about this contradiction.

80
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,680
It was Douglas as well in
the midst of the Mexican war,

81
00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:18,681
which is what we're about today in 1847
myths are that expansionist war where at

82
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,740
least modest numbers of northerners,

83
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:29,550
certainly abolitionist opposed it because
they saw it as a war for the expansion

84
00:06:29,551 --> 00:06:31,620
of slavery.
It was Douglas who said,

85
00:06:31,621 --> 00:06:35,730
America is a nation of in consistencies,

86
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,750
completely made up of
it's in consistencies.

87
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,140
Do you know the young Abraham Lincoln
had always been worried about this?

88
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:51,080
Very same question.
He comes at it from different perspective.

89
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:53,930
He comes out of from
different experiences largely.

90
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,023
Yeah,

91
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,010
he's never going to be an abolitionist,

92
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,520
but it is very first public address.

93
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,470
The young men's lyceum speech of 1838
the first public address that a young

94
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:11,471
Abraham Lincoln ever gave in the middle
of it is this quite remarkable passage

95
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,990
where it says though he's
almost predicting we don't
want to him too much credit

96
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:18,980
for his predictions,

97
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,840
but it's almost as if he's predicting
this crisis that we're now about to try to

98
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:25,730
understand for the next several weeks.

99
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,960
At what point said Lincoln in this speech
way back in 1838 at what points shall

100
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:35,900
we expect,
the approach of danger,

101
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,620
by what means shall we fortify against it,

102
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,910
shall we expect we hear
is this American nation?

103
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Shall we expect some transatlantic
military giant to step over the ocean and

104
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:56,180
crush us at a blow?
He answers never.

105
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,480
All the armies of Europe,
Asia,

106
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:04,481
and Africa combined with all the treasure
of the earth could not by force take a

107
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:10,871
drink from the Ohio river or make a track
on the Blue Ridge mountains in a trial

108
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:19,510
of a thousand years.
If destruction is to be our lot,

109
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,300
we must ourselves be its author and
it's finisher is a nation of free men.

110
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,150
We must live through all
time or die by suicide.

111
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,940
He doesn't say what that
problem in the midst would be

112
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,563
directly.

113
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,330
It's already implied it.
What is civil war?

114
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,260
What a kind of collective suicide.
No,

115
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,143
briefly,

116
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:02,040
and I'm going to put the underground
railroad story off until after we do the

117
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,460
aftermath and collapse of
the compromise of 1850 oh,

118
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,340
I just predicted it would collapse.
Sorry about that.

119
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,020
But this antislavery
impulse that does take hold,

120
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:19,550
and the American north went
through various stages.

121
00:09:19,551 --> 00:09:23,150
That first stage is the 1830s
into the 1840 [inaudible],

122
00:09:23,151 --> 00:09:28,151
which is largely a time of great expansion
and abolition as organizations and

123
00:09:28,971 --> 00:09:33,920
societies and newspapers. It tends
to be a decade, decade and a half,

124
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:39,310
driven largely by a kind of Garrisonians
and I outline the various tenants of

125
00:09:39,521 --> 00:09:40,354
Gareth and isn't,

126
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,540
but it tended to be a kind of
Gareth Sonian moral suasion.

127
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:49,541
This was an era in which most
abolitionists were largely
devoted to this idea of

128
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:54,980
reforming or changing the heart
of the American people. This was,

129
00:09:54,981 --> 00:09:59,480
this was driven very much by the kind
of evangelical second grade awakening

130
00:09:59,481 --> 00:10:03,680
impulse of changing the conscience.

131
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,080
Oh, the American people indeed just
changing the conscious of the slave holder

132
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:08,914
himself.

133
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,250
Okay.

134
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,520
A second stage of American
antislavery impulse. It's not,

135
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,010
there's no single moment when it begins,

136
00:10:17,011 --> 00:10:20,840
but that second stage is
essentially a political stage.

137
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,660
It begins largely with the birth of the
Liberty Party as it was called an 1837

138
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:32,091
the first attempt at an antislavery
political party founded by some pretty

139
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:35,910
serious abolitionists. These were, these
were, these people were the real thing.

140
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:41,340
They're going to run James G Bernie for
president a couple of times and they got

141
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:46,410
minuscule numbers of almost
comfortable votes. James G,

142
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:48,390
Bernie,
who had been born in Alabama,

143
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:53,820
former slave holder who moves
north and becomes an abolitionist.

144
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:58,821
His symbol was quite remarkable
that liberty party will
morph in the 1840s after

145
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:05,790
its record of very little success into,

146
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,310
especially in the midst
of this Mexican war,

147
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:13,850
what became known as the free soil party
play 848 and we'll pick up the free

148
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:15,510
soil is here in a few minutes.

149
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:21,590
The free soil party as it was founded
in 1848 directly in response to this

150
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:23,041
expansion.

151
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:28,041
This war with Mexico was a party largely
devoted by its very title to keeping

152
00:11:29,911 --> 00:11:31,560
the West free of slavery,

153
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:36,561
it political impulse to try
to keep America's future
free of slave labor system.

154
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:44,840
But what's really going on here is
a shift out of the moral suasion,

155
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:49,841
just impulses of early abolitionist
to a learning of the art of politics.

156
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:51,640
Yeah.

157
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,870
I've engaging a larger culture
with the nation's greatest issues,

158
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:02,490
and it is of course when abolitionism
or an antislavery impulse is what I want

159
00:12:03,611 --> 00:12:05,440
to call it here because this isn't these,

160
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:10,441
these are not necessarily
rabid abolitionists to
become free soilers and Nora

161
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,840
Nora who become the Republican's
after 854 but it is a fear of slavery,

162
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,770
of fear, of it's power, of fear of
it's a denigration of free labor,

163
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,400
a fear of the way slavery as a system
could control America's future.

164
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,800
The becomes a special in the wake
of the Mexican war front and center,

165
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,700
the greatest political issue in America.

166
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:36,570
Okay,

167
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,200
well how did we get a Mexican war?

168
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,633
Now,

169
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,220
I don't know if you know much
about the war with Mexico.

170
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:46,040
We speed right over it and a
lot of American history classes,

171
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:50,630
but after the annexation
time for some maps,

172
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,793
uh,

173
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,230
I think that does a bull mostly

174
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,953
well

175
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:09,450
after the annexation of
Cuba in 18 third as Cuba,

176
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,660
Texas in 1836 the south was always trying
to annex Cuba four times before the

177
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:16,470
civil war.
I can't get that out of my head,

178
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:22,010
but after the annexation of
Texas by the United States,

179
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,660
Texas became a state.

180
00:13:24,661 --> 00:13:27,990
So said the United
States after eight and 36

181
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:29,980
okay.

182
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,940
Texas was to be that great western
territory, seemingly limitless.

183
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:36,880
It's western border had never
been determined for that matter.

184
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:41,570
A southern border with Mexico had
never been negotiated. You know, he's,

185
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,220
today's just took Texas and said,
wow,

186
00:13:45,221 --> 00:13:48,220
we'll figure out its boundaries
later. Oh, by the way,

187
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:50,260
Mexico will let them know.

188
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:57,520
Mexico never accepted the Rio Grande
as a border between United States and

189
00:13:57,521 --> 00:13:58,480
Mexico.
Never.

190
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,500
They assumed if there was a border with
this first independent republic of Texas

191
00:14:05,171 --> 00:14:08,770
and now state of Texas,
it was to be the Nueces river.

192
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:14,290
Can you see the Nueces river? Not
very visible, but it's up here.

193
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,290
My hands not to steady anyway,

194
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,970
the Rio Grande was never
accepted as the border by Mexico,

195
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,710
but that's never stopped.
Wars of conquest before.

196
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,870
And why would it then
now,

197
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,980
just to give you a bigger
sense of this store, uh,

198
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:44,610
we've already talked a lot about how the
westward expansion of a slave society

199
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:49,651
in the westward expansion of the south
was just booming from the 1820s to the,

200
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:56,260
into the 14th and there was a deep
and abiding assumption in America.

201
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,870
We call it manifest destiny.
At the time,

202
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:03,680
not everybody was walking around
mouthing the phrase manifest destiny.

203
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,470
People didn't meet in bars and
taverns and say, what do you think?

204
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:11,440
Manifest destiny?
But they spoke a language of um,

205
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,830
inevitability.

206
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,760
They spoke a kind of racialism
about what needs to be done,

207
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:19,610
should be done,

208
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:24,611
has been done about Indians and the Indian
removal policies under Jackson of the

209
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:29,330
1830s. Did indeed of course
remove Indian removal.

210
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,040
I have a whole map of that.
I love my maps.

211
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,660
This one's cool,

212
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,830
but of course it's a brutal story.

213
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:44,831
The five great tribes some times called
the civilized tribes of the American

214
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,500
south, the creeks, the
Chickasaw, the Choctaw,

215
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:52,100
the Cherokee,
and the Seminole from Florida.

216
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:57,310
We're indeed between the early 1830s
in the mid to late 1830s remove by and

217
00:15:58,011 --> 00:15:59,720
large,
not all of the Seminoles,

218
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,400
but remove it out west to what became
Oklahoma territory or was originally

219
00:16:04,401 --> 00:16:08,580
called Indian territory.
But that Indian removal was in great.

220
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:13,650
There's part and parcel of opening up
this southern frontier to expansion into

221
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,930
the possibilities now of the cotton boom

222
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,600
and the development of the greatest,
as we've said, no more than once.

223
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,330
Source of wealth in the United States.

224
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:33,510
No, the presidential election
of 1844, James K. Dot. Polk,

225
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,540
the Democrat,
um,

226
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:42,680
kind of hard money
successor to Andrew Jackson,

227
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:48,550
avid expansionist and a slave
owning cotton planner from Tennessee

228
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:54,610
got elected president. They called him
young and Hickory instead of old hickory.

229
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:00,060
He ran against Henry Clay who ran for
president three, four or five times,

230
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:05,061
depending on how many times you count
them in the antebellum years as well.

231
00:17:05,461 --> 00:17:07,770
Daniel Webster,
the Henry Clay,

232
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,160
essentially the intellectual
or ideological founder of
the Whig party ran is the

233
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:16,530
wig,
uh,

234
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:21,900
clay to ran on an expansion as
platform of a car of a kind,

235
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,730
but the winds tended to argue for
expansion isn't by negotiation.

236
00:17:26,731 --> 00:17:28,980
We were going to negotiate
treaties of experience.

237
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:32,010
We were going to negotiate
our way into the southwest.

238
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:35,460
We were going to negotiate the
British out of the northwest.

239
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,000
Polk said,
negotiation

240
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,740
bullshit is what he said.

241
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,150
Elect me and I will give you a Mexico
elect me and I will give you Oregon.

242
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,700
He did.
It was a close election,

243
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:55,680
poke one by only about 36,000
votes out about 2.8 million cast.

244
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:56,750
Yeah.

245
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:01,750
He barely won New York state democratic
stronghold in part because of

246
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,480
immigration to New York and he carried,

247
00:18:05,481 --> 00:18:10,481
therefore New York's 36 electoral votes
and was elected the Liberty Party of

248
00:18:11,751 --> 00:18:12,800
James G.

249
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,800
Bernie got 16,000 votes in 1844 most of
them and about three counties in upstate

250
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:24,260
New York. They didn't cause a
lot of Ruckus, but they existed

251
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,110
now just before Tyler,

252
00:18:29,111 --> 00:18:31,690
John Tyler left office as a lame duck,

253
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,470
he pushed through the
annexation of Texas as a state,

254
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:41,140
not as a negotiated treaty, which
would have required as I hope you know,

255
00:18:41,141 --> 00:18:45,730
two thirds vote of the US Senate.
He just did it.

256
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:47,960
Okay.

257
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,690
And Texas was annexed.
Now, Congress eventually,

258
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,240
uh, did vote approval of this
in a frankly sectionalized vote,

259
00:18:57,241 --> 00:19:00,000
which was a harbinger of things
to come. But James K. Polk,

260
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:02,310
this expansion as president expansion,

261
00:19:02,311 --> 00:19:06,540
the slave holding president now became
the sixth of the first 10 American

262
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,670
presidents who was a slave holder.

263
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:14,910
This is significant if you'll actually
look back, there's a great book on this,

264
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,330
the demonstrators, lots of
writing on this, a demonstration,

265
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,830
but don Fehrenbach or his book
called slave holding republic,

266
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,850
shows us that before
the American civil war,

267
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:28,470
two thirds of all American presidents
were slave holders or deeply sympathetic

268
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:32,400
with slave holding.
As in the case of James Buchanan,

269
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:33,690
by the late 1850s,

270
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,250
two thirds of all members of the u
s supreme court were slave holders.

271
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,750
And so far as we know, James K. Dot.

272
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:47,751
Polk was the only president in American
history to actually buy and sell slaves

273
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:49,800
from the Oval Office of the White House.

274
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:50,890
Okay.

275
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,300
He kept on retainer,

276
00:19:52,301 --> 00:19:56,760
a broker with whom he communicated
regularly buying and selling, slice,

277
00:19:56,761 --> 00:20:00,490
speculating and slaves.
It was kind of his hobby.

278
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:07,870
You know, some presidents engage in the
hot stove league in the winter, you know,

279
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,950
do some baseball and paper poke
was selling and buying and people,

280
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:13,760
yeah.

281
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,810
Poke who was aggressive toward Mexico.

282
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:19,860
He ordered American troops demarche
south to the Rio Grande River in Texas.

283
00:20:19,861 --> 00:20:24,630
There were, were already, you know,
occupy patient troops in Texas.

284
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,770
He ordered the middle of south of the Rio
Grande and just in effect see what the

285
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:29,850
Mexicans would do.

286
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:31,730
Yeah.

287
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,050
Any sense?
Zachary Taylor,

288
00:20:33,051 --> 00:20:38,051
the American general to matter Mauras
on the Mexico border in early 1846 there

289
00:20:39,891 --> 00:20:44,060
was a negotiation initially set up
between the American and Mexican military

290
00:20:44,061 --> 00:20:44,894
commanders,

291
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:49,030
which was conducted by the way in French
because of the Americans did not speak

292
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:51,910
Spanish and the Mexicans
did not speak English,

293
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,450
but they find enough people on either
side of good to understand at least some

294
00:20:55,451 --> 00:20:56,284
French.

295
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:00,920
Yeah,

296
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,410
Mexico had never
acknowledged the Rio Grande.

297
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:09,490
It said their border was the
nooses north about 150 200 miles.

298
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,690
That was a kind of a three weeks standoff
between troops along the Rio Grande

299
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,270
River.
And then on the 24th of April,

300
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,820
1846 a Mexican cavalry contingent,

301
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:24,821
ambushed American troops on the
north side of the Rio Grande killed,

302
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,650
killed 11 American troops captured 63

303
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,440
two days later,

304
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,480
Zachary Taylor,
a dispatch overland to Washington DC.

305
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,700
It took two weeks to get their hot news

306
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:48,240
and it simply announced,
quote, hostilities had
been commenced with Mexico.

307
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,310
Briefly told the story of the Mexicans
attacking on the north side of the Rio

308
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,143
Grande.

309
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:02,890
Polk receive the news and he immediately
went to Congress and ask for a

310
00:22:02,891 --> 00:22:05,790
declaration of war. He announced, quote,

311
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:10,420
Mexico had passed the boundary of
the United States and had invaded our

312
00:22:10,421 --> 00:22:14,170
territory and shut American
blood on American soil unquote

313
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,120
blood and soil.

314
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,670
I May,

315
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:25,670
1318 46 the house of Representatives
voted a declaration of war 174 to 14 u s

316
00:22:27,811 --> 00:22:32,811
senate voted 40 to two with
a lot of abstentions from
northerners to declare war

317
00:22:33,571 --> 00:22:36,810
on Mexico
and off we went.

318
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:41,520
The first major expansionist
war of American history,

319
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,580
war fever broke out all over the country.

320
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,110
The romance of going abroad
and exotic place like Mexico,

321
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,320
full of strange people speaking in weird
languages and they're Catholics and

322
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,600
you'll never know what
you're going to find there.

323
00:22:57,601 --> 00:23:02,190
They all kinds of strange practices.
Herman Melville,

324
00:23:02,191 --> 00:23:06,420
the young writer and
yet published Moby Dick,

325
00:23:06,421 --> 00:23:11,220
but he was working on it from
is upstate New York home.

326
00:23:11,221 --> 00:23:15,990
He said in his tone that people here,
he said, are all in a state of delirium,

327
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,640
a military art or pervades all ranks.
Nothing is talked about,

328
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,230
but the halls of Montezuma,

329
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,940
meaning Mexico City,

330
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,890
this was going to be an adventurous war.
It was going to be quick.

331
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:36,980
It was going to be a war of a destiny
in Illinois.

332
00:23:36,981 --> 00:23:40,880
Newspaper justify the war on
the basis that Mexicans were,

333
00:23:40,881 --> 00:23:45,020
I quote reptiles in the
path of progressive.

334
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:51,190
Now, you know, in Vietnam we called
some people goofs and you know,

335
00:23:51,191 --> 00:23:54,960
they were doing that horrible huns and
we've got all kinds of names for our

336
00:23:54,961 --> 00:23:57,360
enemies, but then they will
get more direct than that.

337
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,300
Reptiles and I'm sorry.

338
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,180
Reptiles in the path of
progressive democracy. Yes. Well,

339
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,940
uh,
people rewrote the lyrics to the song,

340
00:24:10,941 --> 00:24:14,930
Yankee doodle to fit the Mexican
war went like this. I promise you.

341
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:16,040
Only one verse.

342
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:21,860
They attacked our men upon our
land and crossed our river to sir.

343
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,840
No. Show them all with a sword
in hand. What Yankee boys can do.

344
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:30,200
Booster, I'm sorry, I have a cold.

345
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,513
Oh,

346
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,080
actually you should

347
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:39,130
do that with an Irish brogue because
that's the way it would have been done.

348
00:24:39,131 --> 00:24:44,131
Then making fun of the Irish while
you make fun of the Mexicans while you

349
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:47,590
recruit the Irish to go fight in Mexico.

350
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,750
Many abolition is tat very serious
things to say about this war.

351
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:58,040
Lots of them. I already mentioned
Douglas and many, many others.

352
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,760
The abolitionists,
James Russell Lowell considered the war,

353
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:06,680
his words and national crime
committed in booth of slavery.

354
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,390
Our common sin and most pointedly of all,

355
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:17,000
and a title for this lecture was
Ralph Waldo Emerson. As usual.

356
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:22,001
Emerson wrote this into his private
journals from his study and conquered.

357
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:27,740
It wasn't no something, too many public
platforms on this one, at least not yet.

358
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:33,820
Emerson wrote into his journals in
early 847 the United States will conquer

359
00:25:34,941 --> 00:25:39,870
Mexico, he said, but it will be
as though a man swallows arsenic.

360
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:40,783
Okay.

361
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:45,950
Which brings him down in
term Mexico will poison us.

362
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:53,680
It did. Um, by the end of 1846,

363
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:58,710
the u s had established dominion
over the southern half of California,

364
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,090
which Mexico also claimed

365
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,120
1847.

366
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:11,540
United States forces in the face of pretty
ferocious resistance invading largely

367
00:26:13,671 --> 00:26:16,880
through Vera Cruz on the Gulf coast.
But also from the north

368
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,460
conquered Mexico City,
the halls of Montezuma,

369
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,670
hence the line in the Marine Him

370
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:32,650
United States lost 13,000 Americans in
the war with Mexico and about a year and

371
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,323
a half of fighting

372
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:40,270
by far the vast majority died
of disease and not in battle.

373
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,040
An estimated 50,000 Americans

374
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,630
died.
Okay.

375
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,550
The sword and the Canon
of American troops.

376
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:50,250
Okay.

377
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,880
And by the end of the United States
negotiated a treaty with Mexico.

378
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:59,060
We conquered them and we dictated the
terms and the terms that everything to do

379
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:01,200
with American geography.

380
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:05,010
The Mexican cession as it became known,

381
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:10,011
the land the United States gained from
Mexico is of course the whole southwest.

382
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,320
Okay.

383
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,590
In the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848

384
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:19,520
United States obtained what is today

385
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:24,980
all of the western part of Texas, New
Mexico, Arizona, southern California,

386
00:27:24,981 --> 00:27:29,570
all of California, uh,
Utah. Parts of Colorado,

387
00:27:29,571 --> 00:27:32,630
Nevada,
the great southwest.

388
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:34,860
Yeah.

389
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,810
That same year,
1848

390
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,473
yeah.

391
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,680
Was a terribly important year
of turning point in the world,

392
00:27:43,681 --> 00:27:44,730
especially in Europe.

393
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:50,420
There are those arguing now that in
some ways 1848 should be as important a

394
00:27:51,151 --> 00:27:55,410
turning point year in American history
as it is in Europe because of the great

395
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,710
democratic Republican
revolutions in Europe. Uh,

396
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,590
there are debates now and
some history departments,

397
00:28:01,591 --> 00:28:05,310
whether the U S survey courses
should be divided in thirds now,

398
00:28:05,311 --> 00:28:07,740
cause since American histories
into the 21st century,

399
00:28:07,741 --> 00:28:10,160
now it's getting too long as countries,

400
00:28:10,161 --> 00:28:13,230
it's got too much history
now and instead of dividing,

401
00:28:13,231 --> 00:28:18,231
our survey of course is at 1840
at 1877 or 865 it should be 48

402
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,740
who cares?
But

403
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:26,340
as these nationalistic
revolutions against monarchy,

404
00:28:26,341 --> 00:28:30,990
we're breaking out all over
Europe in Hungary, Austria,

405
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:32,670
Italy, Germany, France,

406
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,210
some will succeed in established republic,
some will not.

407
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,560
Republican America

408
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,480
was seizing territory and launching
an empire and its own continent.

409
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,793
Okay.

410
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,830
Oh by the way,
for seeding us,

411
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:57,890
all of that territory of the great
southwest Mexico was paid $15 million.

412
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:00,930
Okay.

413
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:04,860
Sitting in the US House of Representatives
at that very time during the Mexican

414
00:29:04,861 --> 00:29:06,540
war in his only two term,

415
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:12,290
two year term US Congress was a young
congressman from Illinois named Abraham

416
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:16,650
Lincoln. He voted against the
Mexican war. Every chance he got,

417
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:21,330
he opposed it.
He called it pokes war

418
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,143
and then

419
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,160
he said,
pokes justification.

420
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,340
These are the days of
direct political language.

421
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,380
Is it pokes justification for the war?

422
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:36,300
Was Ha a half insane
mumbling of a fever dream?

423
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,443
Tell him aid

424
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,430
mince any words, fever, dream.

425
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,330
All right,
but what are the Mexican war on leash?

426
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,400
What are the legacies of the Mexican war?

427
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:56,320
Why was this such a fuss and the outline?
It says,

428
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:01,770
why all the fuss slavery in the
Western territory who cared?

429
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:07,150
Daniel Webster, who will play a big
role in this compromise of 1850 debate,

430
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,970
the great wig of Massachusetts,

431
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:15,190
probably the most powerful
and important northern,

432
00:30:15,191 --> 00:30:19,220
certainly New England politician
kept warning that this was,

433
00:30:19,221 --> 00:30:20,590
it wasn't all that important.

434
00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:24,970
He said the problem of slavery
in the West is like his quote is,

435
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:30,270
is a big fuss over quote an imaginary
Negro in an impossible place.

436
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,940
And the idea there wasn't
all that Southwire. It's all
desert, isn't it? I mean,

437
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,610
what's, what's the problem? It's
not Louisiana in New Mexico.

438
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:44,440
It's not Alabama in Arizona.

439
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:50,350
Cotton wool boom. There he
called it a mere abstraction.

440
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,960
But if it was a mere abstraction,
why did so many people care?

441
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:01,960
Let's examine this just for a moment.
Why the fuss? First northerners,

442
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,290
and I know I'm generalizing here,
there's no thing, there's no,

443
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:10,770
there's no such thing as the north
and thus south at this point.

444
00:31:10,961 --> 00:31:15,460
I hope you've grasped that there are
complexities within, but to northerners,

445
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:20,610
one that cared about this because there
was the belief that slavery could indeed

446
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,420
take root in the southwest.

447
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:28,080
Why wouldn't it be a perfect environment
for mining of silver and gold?

448
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,720
And Lo and behold,

449
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:35,500
right after the treaty of Guadalupe
Hidalgo and the end of the Mexican war,

450
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:38,530
what happened,
gold was discovered in California

451
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,120
and it just capitalize.

452
00:31:43,121 --> 00:31:46,090
It just made all bets off.

453
00:31:46,091 --> 00:31:49,360
Now on just how important
this question might be,

454
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,690
why wouldn't slavery worked for
the building of the railroad?

455
00:31:55,470 --> 00:32:00,120
Why wouldn't slavery worked for
building canal and for that matter,

456
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,120
nobody wanted to compete with the slave
labor system cause it denigrated or

457
00:32:06,121 --> 00:32:09,990
degraded the ID of free labor.
Secondly,

458
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:16,290
there were a lot of
northerners particularly in
in politics who wanted a Nanex

459
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,950
who favored here a non
extension approach to slavery,

460
00:32:19,951 --> 00:32:24,951
whatever they thought of black people
and the future of their rights and the ID

461
00:32:25,991 --> 00:32:27,450
of any kind of racial equality.

462
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,390
They favorite non extension
on constitutional grounds.

463
00:32:30,391 --> 00:32:35,130
The idea was that those who would not
attack slavery where it already existed

464
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:39,830
because slavery slaves were property
and protected by the amendment.

465
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:46,150
They nevertheless believe they could use
the constitution under Congress's sole

466
00:32:46,671 --> 00:32:49,580
authority to admit new
states to the union.

467
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:55,360
Just stop this system from expanding
to stop America's future from becoming

468
00:32:56,090 --> 00:33:01,090
defined by slave labor rather than
free labor for the little man.

469
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:10,550
Nine extension of slavery therefore became
a kind of idea whereby you could cold

470
00:33:11,711 --> 00:33:14,520
NOFX slavery and blunt it's future

471
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:21,140
three for northerners bills in Congress
for the territorial organization which

472
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:24,300
already existed.
Now as soon as the Mexican war,

473
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,860
before the Mexican war was even over,

474
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:31,050
there were bills before Congress to
establish the territory's now of Utah and

475
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:35,970
New Mexico. No, in in
large swaths of land.

476
00:33:35,971 --> 00:33:38,940
Mind you that could become
more than two states

477
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:46,100
and there were northerners who found these
bills simply personally obnoxious and

478
00:33:47,431 --> 00:33:50,340
they were being asked.
They said to be complicit to us.

479
00:33:50,341 --> 00:33:54,670
Now in the expansion of slavery,
they there was,

480
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:57,870
there were known enough northern
politicians just said, look,

481
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:03,560
I can't stop anything that's going on
in Alabama and I won't try but don't ask

482
00:34:04,201 --> 00:34:09,201
me to vote to create a new territory
that will become a slave state

483
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:16,240
and already in the language of the
free soil party and eventually in that

484
00:34:16,241 --> 00:34:21,241
Republican party that will come out of
it is this idea that what northerners had

485
00:34:22,691 --> 00:34:23,890
to work to do,

486
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,900
they said what's to make
slavery sectional but freedom,

487
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,720
national slave labor,

488
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:36,721
sectional regional bound
to a place but free labor,

489
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,920
national eternal and the
definition of a future.

490
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:43,660
Yeah.

491
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,070
It was also racism as a motive in this.

492
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:50,180
There are a lots of northerners who saw
the West is the hope of the northern

493
00:34:50,181 --> 00:34:51,014
immigrant,

494
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:56,060
the hope of the young farmer in Ohio
who's got three sons and they want to go

495
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:59,150
west and I don't want,
they don't want black people around.

496
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:04,990
They want to Kansas or Nebraska eventually
that's free for small white farmers

497
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,520
and that's rooted of course.

498
00:35:10,521 --> 00:35:12,630
And what we're going to come
back to again and again,

499
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:17,650
the next three four lectures as this
idea of a kind of a free labor ideology,

500
00:35:18,411 --> 00:35:23,330
a cluster of ideas, no single
idea, but a cluster of impulses,

501
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,190
assumptions,
ideas,

502
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,380
one of which was defensive representative
government has other voice,

503
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:33,890
wasn't devotion to individual
liberty for small people,

504
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,640
small farmers,

505
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:42,140
loan mechanics coupled with no fear of
concentrated power and what could be more

506
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:46,500
concentrated form of power and an
oligarchy of slave holders who can lo and

507
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:51,030
behold, control of the presidency, the
Supreme Court and enough of Congress,

508
00:35:51,031 --> 00:35:54,990
especially the Senate, if they can keep
getting more states into the union,

509
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,620
then the south as a concentrated power

510
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,420
free labor ideology.

511
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:07,421
It was also rooted in this kind of now
old fashioned American fear of conspiracy

512
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,730
against individual liberty,

513
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,080
free labor on you know how old he was
really a fanfare for the common man,

514
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:18,790
defensive,

515
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,010
the white Anglo Saxon Protestant,
small farmer.

516
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:33,840
And of course finally there were some
real abolitionists in the room who oppose

517
00:36:33,841 --> 00:36:35,610
the expansion of slavery on moral grounds

518
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:39,080
and sometimes that

519
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:43,000
person who believes in free Labor ideology
and may not want it too many black

520
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:47,890
folks around also takes a kind of moral
position against slavery all at the same

521
00:36:47,891 --> 00:36:48,724
time.

522
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:55,710
And His name was Abraham
Lincoln. No, in the south.

523
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,620
Why the south care about slavery in the
West in part because in an assumption

524
00:37:02,621 --> 00:37:07,620
it's set in among southern
leadership now for a long time

525
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:14,660
that it was not only the destiny of
the American people to expand west,

526
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:19,620
it was only the destiny of the slave
society does it spray spraying west and

527
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,310
remember there are manufacturing
decade by decade and more intensive

528
00:37:23,311 --> 00:37:24,960
justification of this system,

529
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,470
but it was a necessity.

530
00:37:28,471 --> 00:37:33,471
They're going to argue that it expand or
it would die to check the expansion of

531
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:38,640
slavery would be to strangle the southern
economy and way of life is what so

532
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:43,470
many southern politicians are now
arguing slaves in existing states.

533
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:46,800
Also, they came to realize
we're becoming a burden,

534
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:51,830
possibly a danger as the slave
population in Georgia or in Alabama or

535
00:37:52,351 --> 00:37:55,290
Mississippi continues to grow
and grow and grow and grow,

536
00:37:55,650 --> 00:38:00,360
but nowhere to expand to
that's my population may be
coming, dude. A powder keg.

537
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:01,760
Yeah.

538
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,650
One of the things that southern
statesman feared the most,

539
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,920
and I cannot stress this enough because
there's going to be right there at the

540
00:38:08,921 --> 00:38:13,690
heart of their succession debates in 1860
is they feared what they kept calling.

541
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:18,250
Now, this is more than a theory to
them, this theory of a shrinking south.

542
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,990
If they couldn't expand the system
beyond its limits and beyond its borders,

543
00:38:22,991 --> 00:38:27,070
get into Arkansas, get out in
Oklahoma, Texas, West Texas,

544
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,260
further west Caribbean.

545
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:31,330
Yeah.

546
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:34,960
At the south would begin to
shrink as an economic entity,

547
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,070
as a political culture,
as a force in the national government,

548
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,440
and if you cordoned off slavery,

549
00:38:41,441 --> 00:38:44,860
what's going to happen to the price
of slaves around it's borders?

550
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,020
They might be going to go down and what
happens with the price of a slave starts

551
00:38:50,021 --> 00:38:54,790
going down in Kentucky, Virginia,
Maryland, around the edges.

552
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:58,420
Well, people start selling them off. We're
going to sell them Alabama, Louisiana,

553
00:38:58,450 --> 00:38:59,283
Mississippi,

554
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:05,690
and you would have the beginnings now
have an economy turning in on itself.

555
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,293
Okay?

556
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,260
Southerners,

557
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,850
many southerners came to believe
slavery had to expand or it could die.

558
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,710
They also want to political parody
in the United States Congress,

559
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,800
every new statement to new
senators and the number of states,

560
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:24,800
free states,

561
00:39:24,801 --> 00:39:29,660
the slave states folks
in 1850 was 15 to 15

562
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:36,290
they wanted to sustain that
parody and California there is,

563
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:41,291
it's going to sudden statehood in 1850
because of gold being discovered is going

564
00:39:41,851 --> 00:39:46,100
to be the problem and the test case,
the newest,

565
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,950
this question of a constitutional power.

566
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:50,650
Yeah,

567
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:55,030
the question of checks and balances. The
states' rights question if you weren't,

568
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:02,890
did anybody have the right
to PR to prohibit anybody
from taking their property

569
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,260
anywhere? The John C. Calhoun,
at the end of the day,

570
00:40:08,261 --> 00:40:10,540
all these other arguments
here were important,

571
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:15,110
but the only argument at the end of the
day that mattered to him and he could

572
00:40:15,111 --> 00:40:19,400
drive it home with a brilliance unlike
anybody else's. You have no right.

573
00:40:19,401 --> 00:40:24,401
You northerners have no right
to stop me from taking my wagon,

574
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,820
my horse,
and my slave anywhere.

575
00:40:27,821 --> 00:40:30,730
I wish and he would just
recite the fifth amendment.

576
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:38,550
Let me put it yet one more way.

577
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:41,420
There is a certain element of honor.

578
00:40:41,421 --> 00:40:45,440
It stinks here in the south about slavery.

579
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:50,300
Their moral stance comes from this belief,
this position,

580
00:40:50,301 --> 00:40:51,920
and think about this in your own time.

581
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:58,720
The idea set in among northerners that
the legal status of slavery in the

582
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:04,270
Western territories stood as a measure
of its moral standing everywhere.

583
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,260
Let me repeat that.
Okay.

584
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:11,330
The legal standing of slavery
in the Western territory
stood as a measure of its

585
00:41:11,331 --> 00:41:13,130
moral standing everywhere.

586
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:18,370
If you tell me slavery is wrong enough
that you will not have it in America's

587
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:20,803
future,

588
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:26,220
then you're telling me it's wrong where
I have it and I don't accept that and I

589
00:41:26,541 --> 00:41:31,541
won't live in the same political
culture with you if I have to,

590
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:34,400
if I don't have to on that basis.

591
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:41,920
So why all the fuss?
I mean think today.

592
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:46,390
Think today about some of our
greatest salient, polarizing issues

593
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,850
at the risk of bringing them up.

594
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,730
If I were a gay American and I
believed in my right to be married,

595
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:05,070
I would believe that the legal status
of gay marriage in a Kansas where they

596
00:42:05,071 --> 00:42:09,240
have a referendum is a measure
of its moral status everywhere

597
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:19,260
and extrapolate from there to other
issues. You outlaw who I am, what I do,

598
00:42:19,261 --> 00:42:22,860
what I stand for in one state.

599
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,530
What are you saying about it in another,

600
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,250
oh, we shouldn't talk about the
president in history courses. I'm sorry.

601
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:41,780
The first is because it's really a debate
about America's future kind of future.

602
00:42:41,781 --> 00:42:44,390
Would it have? Well, there
were four plans put in place,

603
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,680
and as these four plans are going
to come together around this debate,

604
00:42:48,681 --> 00:42:53,060
over the compromise of 1850,
the first plan,

605
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:57,330
uh, these were all on your outline.
If you could see it earlier,

606
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,193
you want that backup.

607
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,533
Okay.

608
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:09,270
The first we call the Wilmot
proviso for good reason.

609
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:13,090
It's named for David Wilma,
well,

610
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:18,091
young Democratic Party representative
in the House of Representatives who in

611
00:43:18,601 --> 00:43:23,190
1846 got up in the midst of the
Mexican, well, this is a Democrat now

612
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:29,190
and not a wig or a free soiler.
He's from Pennsylvania.

613
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,610
Any didn't particularly
care about black folks.

614
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,370
But he got up in the debates over
the Mexican war about, uh, about, uh,

615
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:40,590
provisions for the troops and all
those debates. And he said, okay,

616
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:42,930
we're going to war with Mexico.

617
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:47,310
But in any new territory we
gained from Mexico, slavery,

618
00:43:47,311 --> 00:43:50,850
she'll never exist. It's as simple
as that. That's the Wilmot proviso.

619
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,530
It's a great trivia question.

620
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,450
If you have to ever have to play trivia
in a bar ass, what's the Wilmot Proviso?

621
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,470
Nobody knows.

622
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:03,960
But it was the rallying cry of
the free soil movement. Okay,

623
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,270
a war. We're going to get
millions of acres of territory.

624
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,830
Slavery will never exist.
This was the free soil formula.

625
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,200
The language was borrowed
from the northwest door news,

626
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,940
all but one northern state
legislature endorsed it. All.

627
00:44:23,941 --> 00:44:28,440
Southern legislatures condemned it.
Ge,

628
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:34,550
a little harbinger of things come there
perhaps at first passed the House of

629
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:39,660
Representatives and the first try 83 to
64 rep reflecting that the house has far

630
00:44:39,661 --> 00:44:42,720
more northern representatives because
the north has more population,

631
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,880
but it did not pass the Senate

632
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,570
where the slave states still have parody.

633
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:56,330
There was a good deal of racist support
for this will mount himself said,

634
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,920
well, I'll quote him here. You get this.

635
00:45:00,921 --> 00:45:04,460
Free is free Labor ideology,
ideologies, a mixture of ideas.

636
00:45:04,461 --> 00:45:05,900
This is Wilma in the debates.

637
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:10,340
I have no squeamish sensitiveness
upon the subject of slavery. Norm,

638
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:13,070
no morbid sympathy for the slave.

639
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,460
I plead the cause and
rights of White Freeman.

640
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,150
I would preserve to free white labor,
a fair country,

641
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:25,330
a rich inheritance where the sons of
toil of my own race and color can live

642
00:45:25,761 --> 00:45:30,761
without the disgrace which association
with Negro Slavery Brings Upon Free

643
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,640
Labor,
doesn't get more direct than that.

644
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:40,300
Keep the West free of
slavery and black people

645
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,140
was really David wilmotts position.

646
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:50,510
The second possible plan
is what was known formally,

647
00:45:50,511 --> 00:45:54,740
legally a state sovereignty.
This is the state's rights position.

648
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,070
This is the south position,
at least on this question,

649
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:04,840
the individual's constitutional right
of ownership and slaves as property and

650
00:46:05,001 --> 00:46:08,000
transport of slaves as property.

651
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:11,150
State sovereignty.

652
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:16,420
States rights wasn't deed deeply at the
root of the south growing position here

653
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:23,090
that ultimately no federal legislature,
president,

654
00:46:23,091 --> 00:46:27,710
no federal authority existed
to stop slavery's expansion.

655
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:33,410
The third position,
a very American position,

656
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:36,740
a natural outcome of the first two,

657
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,980
the first two mix like oil and water,

658
00:46:39,981 --> 00:46:42,920
you need a compromise position
and that's popular sovereignty.

659
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:48,170
Popular sovereignty was not a new idea
in the midst of the Mexican war and its

660
00:46:48,171 --> 00:46:49,930
aftermath and been around for awhile.

661
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:55,060
It was the simple idea that there
would be no act of Congress on this.

662
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:00,170
Take Congress out of the story and
simply let the people in the Western

663
00:47:00,171 --> 00:47:03,140
territory have a vote. What?
I'm, have a referendum.

664
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:05,510
Let there be popular democracy.

665
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:09,230
If the people who settle Utah
when a vote to have slave labor,

666
00:47:09,231 --> 00:47:13,070
then they vote for it. If they
don't, they don't. Democracy.

667
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:14,683
What could be better?

668
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:20,010
This had the wonderful kind of charm
of ambiguity is David Potter ones

669
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:23,600
beautifully put it a term of ambiguity.

670
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,730
It is kind of a place there for everybody.

671
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:29,060
As long as you trusted the democratic,

672
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:33,010
yeah,

673
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:34,360
but if you're going to
have that referendum,

674
00:47:34,361 --> 00:47:38,230
the problem of course always
was when do you hold the vote?

675
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:42,470
Do you hold the vote early
in the territorial process

676
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:47,540
where to hold the vote laid
in the territory process?
Do you establish a rule?

677
00:47:47,541 --> 00:47:51,260
There's gotta be a certain amount
of population before, excuse me,

678
00:47:51,261 --> 00:47:53,890
before you hold that vote,
southerners,

679
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:57,830
one of that vote held late in the process
because it would give their system

680
00:47:57,831 --> 00:48:01,730
longer to get there.
It would take a while.

681
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:06,200
If you're going to take 50 slaves out
to Kansas or Nebraska or further west,

682
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:10,070
it's going to take awhile for that
loan farmer in his Conestoga wagon.

683
00:48:10,071 --> 00:48:10,940
He can get there quicker

684
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:20,520
and fourth they went back to
the old Missouri compromise.

685
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:28,080
It's the principle of
geographical division here.

686
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:32,200
It's the old principle
of geographical division.

687
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:36,610
The Missouri compromise of 1820 you
all learned this somewhere in school,

688
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:42,060
established the 36 30 parallel from the
Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean

689
00:48:42,431 --> 00:48:47,431
and it's said in 1820 a very important
act of Congress in 1820 in this store and

690
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:54,690
know to be so twisted and abused and
debated in the 1850s as a sacred act.

691
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:59,920
It said slavery shit would
never exist north of that line.

692
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:04,880
The problem was it half of California
was already north of that line.

693
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:08,200
Now a lot of people,

694
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,270
all right in the way we're going to head
this problem off now is just to keep,

695
00:49:11,271 --> 00:49:14,450
keep drawing careful geographic
lines across the continent,

696
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:20,240
free soil above slave labor. Below. We'll
just, we'll just keep drawing that line.

697
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:25,000
All right.

698
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,020
I'm going to have to leave you hanging
here about the color from eyes itself.

699
00:49:29,021 --> 00:49:31,690
That's fine cause we can
do the cut of promos.

700
00:49:31,691 --> 00:49:35,620
It's collapsing lead right into
the Kansas Nebraska pro. Hold on,

701
00:49:35,621 --> 00:49:36,454
I've got a minute.

702
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:40,720
I think the election of 1848 was crucial.

703
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:46,330
Democrats ran Lewis Cass of Michigan,
thoroughly forgettable politician.

704
00:49:46,331 --> 00:49:47,500
I'm sure you've never heard of him,

705
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:50,350
but he was a great proponent
of popular sovereignty.

706
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,030
They run in a popular sovereignty
platform, the wet, the promise,

707
00:49:55,031 --> 00:49:58,270
slavery in the West. Now there's whole
Mexican war problem. We'll solve it.

708
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:02,830
Popular Democracy,
the wigs run Zachary Taylor war,

709
00:50:02,831 --> 00:50:07,690
hero of the Mexican war or rough and
ready problem was he was a Louisiana slave

710
00:50:07,691 --> 00:50:08,524
holder

711
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:15,810
and out of this furor over the expansion
of slavery in the West came to new

712
00:50:18,981 --> 00:50:23,690
political off shoots.
One was called the conscience Whigs.

713
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:29,120
They were created first in Massachusetts
and they gave us Charles, among others,

714
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:32,570
a group of abolitionists Wiggs
who broke with the Whig party.

715
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,460
Now it would never go back.

716
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:40,350
A harbinger of the ultimate death within
the next four years of the Whig party

717
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:46,380
and the other was the free soil party
born in the convention in Buffalo,

718
00:50:46,381 --> 00:50:51,381
New York in 1848 it ran Martin van Buren
and I'd choice for president in 1848 a

719
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:58,380
former president,
they stood for one thing,

720
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,900
stopping at all costs,

721
00:51:00,901 --> 00:51:03,990
the expansion of slavery
into America's West.

722
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:06,750
The free soilers took 10%

723
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:13,270
of the auto vote in 1848 election when
Zachary Taylor war hero was elected

724
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:22,700
and then gold was discovered
in California over night,

725
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:24,590
it seemed like it was overnight.

726
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:28,400
California was going to be
ready for statehood and Oh God,

727
00:51:28,401 --> 00:51:33,200
what to do with it because if it comes
in as this free state or a slave state,

728
00:51:33,201 --> 00:51:35,630
it's going to upset the balance
in the Senate in a setting,

729
00:51:35,631 --> 00:51:37,370
huge territory out there

730
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:44,070
and suddenly there was a need, a desperate
need, threats coming from the south.

731
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:44,970
John C.

732
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:49,620
Calhoun is calling us southern convention
threats from some northerners who were

733
00:51:49,621 --> 00:51:53,790
saying no on her all costs.
We will stop the expansion of slavery.

734
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:56,700
There's a need to fund
yet new Middle Ground.

735
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,080
A night in January,

736
00:52:00,081 --> 00:52:04,040
teen 50 Henry Clay got together and
she washed down and a hell of a lot of

737
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:06,560
brandy with Daniel Webster.
And they cut a deal

738
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:13,220
that became the compromise of 1850.
I'll leave you hanging there.

739
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,860
Clay and Webster are drunk.

740
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:20,090
They're fashioning the great compromise,

741
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:23,970
or are they hoped it would save the union?

742
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:30,290
Clay at the end of that month would go
before the US Senate and announced the

743
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:36,220
five provisions of his compromise.
And in so doing,

744
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:40,450
he stood up and he held a piece of
the coffin of George Washington.

745
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,250
No, I don't know if it really was or not,
but it was a piece of the true cross, uh,

746
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:51,040
bowl piece of wood. This is from wash
George Washington's coffin. He said,

747
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:54,250
we must circle the wagons.
We must save the Union.

748
00:52:54,251 --> 00:52:56,500
We must swallow this and do that.

749
00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:01,120
And then we're grows.
And there were cheers.

750
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,450
People wept,
people shouted.

751
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:10,540
And people were really worried that
the union was going to unravel and fall

752
00:53:10,541 --> 00:53:14,140
apart. And it almost did. So you.
