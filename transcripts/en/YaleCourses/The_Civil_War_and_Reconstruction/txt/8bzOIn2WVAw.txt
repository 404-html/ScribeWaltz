Speaker 1:          00:12          If you haven't noticed at the back of my addition of Douglass's narrative, which is the one I am hoping you are using, come on down in quickly. Anyway, if you haven't noticed at the back of this edition of Douglass's narrative, they're not only,

Speaker 2:          00:40          okay

Speaker 1:          00:43          a variety of ancillary documents. Douglas is greatest speech was also included a word on that. It's Douglas is 4th of July speech. If you've never read it, you should read it. It is the rhetorical masterpiece of American abolitionism, one of the greatest works of Oratory and American history. It was Frederick Douglass as Beethoven on steroids, but with language, it's like a symphony in three movements. I say that in a little headnote introduction to it.

Speaker 1:          01:28          He gave that speech in 1852 I may refer to it at the end of this lecture, depending on the time it is all about the crisis that has gripped the country in the wake of the compromise of 1850 in the midst of this expansion of slavery into the West and the way it has begun to tear apart America's political culture, and on the 4th of July I missed his friends in Rochester, New York. He was invited to give the 4th of July oration. He says, thank you very much. The invitation was from the ladies in antislavery society of Rochester, New York, many of whom were his friends.

Speaker 1:          02:14          He gave the address in the house of his friends, Corinthian Hall and Rochester, 600 people in the audience. Double more than double your numbers. Read that speech because it's as if Douglas, after that first opening gentle introduction where he sets his audience at ease about the greatness of the founding fathers, the genius of the Declaration of independence. He calls it the ring bolt of American independence, the ring bolt of American identity. He just makes them feel good about the founders. And then it's as if he has a staff bolting doors around the hall. And then he's got a staff riveting people into their seats, puts metaphorical seatbelt on him and says, you won't move until I rain. Held on on you for the next 20 minutes, which is what he did. And he says, in effect, he says more than in effect. He says it directly, why have you invited me speak to you on your 4th of July? And then it just rains the pronouns on them. You, you, you, you, your, your, your, your 4th of July is yours and not mine. You may rejoice. I us mourn and 90 90 goals. And then there's the moment, one of the most brilliant rhetorical moments in American letters in my view, but certainly an abolitionist writings where he doesn't even announced his texts to his well rooted biblical audience. And he says, after raining down on them, this passage as long passage about the 4th of July is yours. You may rejoice imas mourn to drag a man and he fetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty. And call upon him to join you. Enjoy his anthems is in human. Mockeries says, and then he just floats without announcing his text and does 137 song

Speaker 1:          04:32          and he's simply reads by the rivers of Babylon. There we sat down. Yay. We wept when we remembered Zion. We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst of their, uh, for their, they that carried us away captive required of us a song and they who wasted us required of US mirth saying, sing us one of the songs of Zion. How can we sing the Lord's song in a strange land? If I forget the Old Jerusalem, but my right hand, forget her cunning. If I do not remember the but my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth. What does Douglas just done to his friendly audience? He just, one of the most famous passages in the Bible, his audience would have known that passage. People wouldn't today in little circles by the rivers of Babylon. There we sat down, we were the captives from Egypt and he said, you made us sing for you. And in effect, he was saying to them, I'll sing for you, but you may not like it. That was Douglas as you did it hundreds of times elsewhere. It was Douglas is most brilliant expression of, or critique of this American hypocrisy about freedom in a land of slavery, but a lot of people were worried about this contradiction.

Speaker 1:          06:11          It was Douglas as well in the midst of the Mexican war, which is what we're about today in 1847 myths are that expansionist war where at least modest numbers of northerners, certainly abolitionist opposed it because they saw it as a war for the expansion of slavery. It was Douglas who said, America is a nation of in consistencies, completely made up of it's in consistencies. Do you know the young Abraham Lincoln had always been worried about this? Very same question. He comes at it from different perspective. He comes out of from different experiences largely.

Speaker 2:          06:55          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          06:56          he's never going to be an abolitionist, but it is very first public address. The young men's lyceum speech of 1838 the first public address that a young Abraham Lincoln ever gave in the middle of it is this quite remarkable passage where it says though he's almost predicting we don't want to him too much credit for his predictions, but it's almost as if he's predicting this crisis that we're now about to try to understand for the next several weeks. At what point said Lincoln in this speech way back in 1838 at what points shall we expect, the approach of danger, by what means shall we fortify against it, shall we expect we hear is this American nation? Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step over the ocean and crush us at a blow? He answers never. All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined with all the treasure of the earth could not by force take a drink from the Ohio river or make a track on the Blue Ridge mountains in a trial of a thousand years. If destruction is to be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and it's finisher is a nation of free men. We must live through all time or die by suicide.

Speaker 1:          08:35          He doesn't say what that problem in the midst would be

Speaker 2:          08:43          directly.

Speaker 1:          08:46          It's already implied it. What is civil war? What a kind of collective suicide. No, briefly, and I'm going to put the underground railroad story off until after we do the aftermath and collapse of the compromise of 1850 oh, I just predicted it would collapse. Sorry about that.

Speaker 1:          09:11          But this antislavery impulse that does take hold, and the American north went through various stages. That first stage is the 1830s into the 1840 [inaudible], which is largely a time of great expansion and abolition as organizations and societies and newspapers. It tends to be a decade, decade and a half, driven largely by a kind of Garrisonians and I outline the various tenants of Gareth and isn't, but it tended to be a kind of Gareth Sonian moral suasion. This was an era in which most abolitionists were largely devoted to this idea of reforming or changing the heart of the American people. This was, this was driven very much by the kind of evangelical second grade awakening impulse of changing the conscience. Oh, the American people indeed just changing the conscious of the slave holder himself.

Speaker 2:          10:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:11          A second stage of American antislavery impulse. It's not, there's no single moment when it begins, but that second stage is essentially a political stage. It begins largely with the birth of the Liberty Party as it was called an 1837 the first attempt at an antislavery political party founded by some pretty serious abolitionists. These were, these were, these people were the real thing. They're going to run James G Bernie for president a couple of times and they got minuscule numbers of almost comfortable votes. James G, Bernie, who had been born in Alabama, former slave holder who moves north and becomes an abolitionist. His symbol was quite remarkable that liberty party will morph in the 1840s after its record of very little success into, especially in the midst of this Mexican war, what became known as the free soil party play 848 and we'll pick up the free soil is here in a few minutes. The free soil party as it was founded in 1848 directly in response to this expansion. This war with Mexico was a party largely devoted by its very title to keeping the West free of slavery, it political impulse to try to keep America's future free of slave labor system.

Speaker 1:          11:40          But what's really going on here is a shift out of the moral suasion, just impulses of early abolitionist to a learning of the art of politics.

Speaker 2:          11:51          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:51          I've engaging a larger culture with the nation's greatest issues, and it is of course when abolitionism or an antislavery impulse is what I want to call it here because this isn't these, these are not necessarily rabid abolitionists to become free soilers and Nora Nora who become the Republican's after 854 but it is a fear of slavery, of fear, of it's power, of fear of it's a denigration of free labor, a fear of the way slavery as a system could control America's future. The becomes a special in the wake of the Mexican war front and center, the greatest political issue in America.

Speaker 2:          12:35          Okay,

Speaker 1:          12:36          well how did we get a Mexican war?

Speaker 2:          12:39          Now,

Speaker 1:          12:40          I don't know if you know much about the war with Mexico. We speed right over it and a lot of American history classes, but after the annexation time for some maps,

Speaker 2:          12:57          uh, I think that does a bull mostly well

Speaker 1:          13:06          after the annexation of Cuba in 18 third as Cuba, Texas in 1836 the south was always trying to annex Cuba four times before the civil war. I can't get that out of my head, but after the annexation of Texas by the United States, Texas became a state. So said the United States after eight and 36

Speaker 2:          13:29          okay.

Speaker 1:          13:29          Texas was to be that great western territory, seemingly limitless. It's western border had never been determined for that matter. A southern border with Mexico had never been negotiated. You know, he's, today's just took Texas and said, wow, we'll figure out its boundaries later. Oh, by the way, Mexico will let them know. Mexico never accepted the Rio Grande as a border between United States and Mexico. Never. They assumed if there was a border with this first independent republic of Texas and now state of Texas, it was to be the Nueces river. Can you see the Nueces river? Not very visible, but it's up here.

Speaker 1:          14:17          My hands not to steady anyway, the Rio Grande was never accepted as the border by Mexico, but that's never stopped. Wars of conquest before. And why would it then now, just to give you a bigger sense of this store, uh, we've already talked a lot about how the westward expansion of a slave society in the westward expansion of the south was just booming from the 1820s to the, into the 14th and there was a deep and abiding assumption in America. We call it manifest destiny. At the time, not everybody was walking around mouthing the phrase manifest destiny. People didn't meet in bars and taverns and say, what do you think? Manifest destiny? But they spoke a language of um, inevitability. They spoke a kind of racialism about what needs to be done, should be done, has been done about Indians and the Indian removal policies under Jackson of the 1830s.

Speaker 1:          15:25          Did indeed of course remove Indian removal. I have a whole map of that. I love my maps. This one's cool, but of course it's a brutal story. The five great tribes some times called the civilized tribes of the American south, the creeks, the Chickasaw, the Choctaw, the Cherokee, and the Seminole from Florida. We're indeed between the early 1830s in the mid to late 1830s remove by and large, not all of the Seminoles, but remove it out west to what became Oklahoma territory or was originally called Indian territory. But that Indian removal was in great. There's part and parcel of opening up this southern frontier to expansion into the possibilities now of the cotton boom and the development of the greatest, as we've said, no more than once. Source of wealth in the United States. No, the presidential election of 1844, James K. Dot. Polk, the Democrat, um, kind of hard money successor to Andrew Jackson, avid expansionist and a slave owning cotton planner from Tennessee got elected president. They called him young and Hickory instead of old hickory. He ran against Henry Clay who ran for president three, four or five times, depending on how many times you count them in the antebellum years as well. Daniel Webster, the Henry Clay, essentially the intellectual or ideological founder of the Whig party ran is the wig, uh, clay to ran on an expansion as platform of a car of a kind, but the winds tended to argue for expansion isn't by negotiation. We were going to negotiate treaties of experience. We were going to negotiate our way into the southwest. We were going to negotiate the British out of the northwest. Polk said, negotiation

Speaker 1:          17:41          bullshit is what he said. Elect me and I will give you a Mexico elect me and I will give you Oregon. He did. It was a close election, poke one by only about 36,000 votes out about 2.8 million cast.

Speaker 2:          17:56          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          17:56          He barely won New York state democratic stronghold in part because of immigration to New York and he carried, therefore New York's 36 electoral votes and was elected the Liberty Party of James G. Bernie got 16,000 votes in 1844 most of them and about three counties in upstate New York. They didn't cause a lot of Ruckus, but they existed now just before Tyler, John Tyler left office as a lame duck, he pushed through the annexation of Texas as a state, not as a negotiated treaty, which would have required as I hope you know, two thirds vote of the US Senate. He just did it.

Speaker 2:          18:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:47          And Texas was annexed.

Speaker 1:          18:51          Now, Congress eventually, uh, did vote approval of this in a frankly sectionalized vote, which was a harbinger of things to come. But James K. Polk, this expansion as president expansion, the slave holding president now became the sixth of the first 10 American presidents who was a slave holder. This is significant if you'll actually look back, there's a great book on this, the demonstrators, lots of writing on this, a demonstration, but don Fehrenbach or his book called slave holding republic, shows us that before the American civil war, two thirds of all American presidents were slave holders or deeply sympathetic with slave holding. As in the case of James Buchanan, by the late 1850s, two thirds of all members of the u s supreme court were slave holders. And so far as we know, James K. Dot. Polk was the only president in American history to actually buy and sell slaves from the Oval Office of the White House.

Speaker 2:          19:50          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:50          He kept on retainer, a broker with whom he communicated regularly buying and selling, slice, speculating and slaves. It was kind of his hobby. You know, some presidents engage in the hot stove league in the winter, you know, do some baseball and paper poke was selling and buying and people,

Speaker 2:          20:13          yeah.

Speaker 1:          20:13          Poke who was aggressive toward Mexico. He ordered American troops demarche south to the Rio Grande River in Texas. There were, were already, you know, occupy patient troops in Texas. He ordered the middle of south of the Rio Grande and just in effect see what the Mexicans would do.

Speaker 2:          20:31          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          20:31          Any sense? Zachary Taylor, the American general to matter Mauras on the Mexico border in early 1846 there was a negotiation initially set up between the American and Mexican military commanders, which was conducted by the way in French because of the Americans did not speak Spanish and the Mexicans did not speak English, but they find enough people on either side of good to understand at least some French.

Speaker 2:          21:00          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          21:00          Mexico had never acknowledged the Rio Grande. It said their border was the nooses north about 150 200 miles. That was a kind of a three weeks standoff between troops along the Rio Grande River. And then on the 24th of April, 1846 a Mexican cavalry contingent, ambushed American troops on the north side of the Rio Grande killed, killed 11 American troops captured 63

Speaker 2:          21:29          two days later,

Speaker 1:          21:31          Zachary Taylor, a dispatch overland to Washington DC. It took two weeks to get their hot news and it simply announced, quote, hostilities had been commenced with Mexico. Briefly told the story of the Mexicans attacking on the north side of the Rio Grande. Polk receive the news and he immediately went to Congress and ask for a declaration of war. He announced, quote, Mexico had passed the boundary of the United States and had invaded our territory and shut American blood on American soil unquote

Speaker 2:          22:15          blood and soil.

Speaker 1:          22:19          I May, 1318 46 the house of Representatives voted a declaration of war 174 to 14 u s senate voted 40 to two with a lot of abstentions from northerners to declare war on Mexico and off we went. The first major expansionist war of American history, war fever broke out all over the country. The romance of going abroad and exotic place like Mexico, full of strange people speaking in weird languages and they're Catholics and you'll never know what you're going to find there. They all kinds of strange practices. Herman Melville, the young writer and yet published Moby Dick, but he was working on it from is upstate New York home. He said in his tone that people here, he said, are all in a state of delirium, a military art or pervades all ranks. Nothing is talked about, but the halls of Montezuma, meaning Mexico City, this was going to be an adventurous war. It was going to be quick. It was going to be a war of a destiny

Speaker 1:          23:36          in Illinois. Newspaper justify the war on the basis that Mexicans were, I quote reptiles in the path of progressive. Now, you know, in Vietnam we called some people goofs and you know, they were doing that horrible huns and we've got all kinds of names for our enemies, but then they will get more direct than that. Reptiles and I'm sorry. Reptiles in the path of progressive democracy. Yes. Well, uh, people rewrote the lyrics to the song, Yankee doodle to fit the Mexican war went like this. I promise you. Only one verse. They attacked our men upon our land and crossed our river to sir. No. Show them all with a sword in hand. What Yankee boys can do. Booster, I'm sorry, I have a cold.

Speaker 2:          24:30          Oh, actually you should

Speaker 1:          24:36          do that with an Irish brogue because that's the way it would have been done. Then making fun of the Irish while you make fun of the Mexicans while you recruit the Irish to go fight in Mexico. Many abolition is tat very serious things to say about this war. Lots of them. I already mentioned Douglas and many, many others. The abolitionists, James Russell Lowell considered the war, his words and national crime committed in booth of slavery. Our common sin and most pointedly of all, and a title for this lecture was Ralph Waldo Emerson. As usual. Emerson wrote this into his private journals from his study and conquered. It wasn't no something, too many public platforms on this one, at least not yet. Emerson wrote into his journals in early 847 the United States will conquer Mexico, he said, but it will be as though a man swallows arsenic. Okay. Which brings him down in term Mexico will poison us. It did. Um, by the end of 1846, the u s had established dominion over the southern half of California, which Mexico also claimed 1847. United States forces in the face of pretty ferocious resistance invading largely through Vera Cruz on the Gulf coast. But also from the north conquered Mexico City, the halls of Montezuma, hence the line in the Marine Him United States lost 13,000 Americans in the war with Mexico and about a year and a half of fighting by far the vast majority died of disease and not in battle. An estimated 50,000 Americans

Speaker 2:          26:44          died. Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:46          The sword and the Canon of American troops.

Speaker 2:          26:50          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:50          And by the end of the United States negotiated a treaty with Mexico. We conquered them and we dictated the terms and the terms that everything to do with American geography. The Mexican cession as it became known, the land the United States gained from Mexico is of course the whole southwest.

Speaker 2:          27:11          Okay.

Speaker 1:          27:11          In the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848

Speaker 2:          27:16          United States obtained what is today

Speaker 1:          27:20          all of the western part of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, southern California, all of California, uh, Utah. Parts of Colorado, Nevada, the great southwest.

Speaker 2:          27:34          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          27:34          That same year, 1848

Speaker 2:          27:38          yeah.

Speaker 1:          27:39          Was a terribly important year of turning point in the world, especially in Europe. There are those arguing now that in some ways 1848 should be as important a turning point year in American history as it is in Europe because of the great democratic Republican revolutions in Europe. Uh, there are debates now and some history departments, whether the U S survey courses should be divided in thirds now, cause since American histories into the 21st century, now it's getting too long as countries, it's got too much history now and instead of dividing, our survey of course is at 1840 at 1877 or 865 it should be 48

Speaker 2:          28:19          who cares? But

Speaker 1:          28:22          as these nationalistic revolutions against monarchy, we're breaking out all over Europe in Hungary, Austria, Italy, Germany, France, some will succeed in established republic, some will not. Republican America was seizing territory and launching an empire and its own continent.

Speaker 2:          28:49          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:50          Oh by the way, for seeding us, all of that territory of the great southwest Mexico was paid $15 million.

Speaker 2:          29:00          Okay.

Speaker 1:          29:00          Sitting in the US House of Representatives at that very time during the Mexican war in his only two term, two year term US Congress was a young congressman from Illinois named Abraham Lincoln. He voted against the Mexican war. Every chance he got, he opposed it. He called it pokes war

Speaker 2:          29:22          and then

Speaker 1:          29:23          he said, pokes justification. These are the days of direct political language. Is it pokes justification for the war? Was Ha a half insane mumbling of a fever dream?

Speaker 2:          29:38          Tell him aid

Speaker 1:          29:42          mince any words, fever, dream. All right, but what are the Mexican war on leash? What are the legacies of the Mexican war? Why was this such a fuss and the outline? It says, why all the fuss slavery in the Western territory who cared? Daniel Webster, who will play a big role in this compromise of 1850 debate, the great wig of Massachusetts, probably the most powerful and important northern, certainly New England politician kept warning that this was, it wasn't all that important. He said the problem of slavery in the West is like his quote is, is a big fuss over quote an imaginary Negro in an impossible place. And the idea there wasn't all that Southwire. It's all desert, isn't it? I mean, what's, what's the problem? It's not Louisiana in New Mexico. It's not Alabama in Arizona. Cotton wool boom. There he called it a mere abstraction. But if it was a mere abstraction, why did so many people care?

Speaker 1:          30:57          Let's examine this just for a moment. Why the fuss? First northerners, and I know I'm generalizing here, there's no thing, there's no, there's no such thing as the north and thus south at this point. I hope you've grasped that there are complexities within, but to northerners, one that cared about this because there was the belief that slavery could indeed take root in the southwest. Why wouldn't it be a perfect environment for mining of silver and gold? And Lo and behold, right after the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and the end of the Mexican war, what happened, gold was discovered in California and it just capitalize. It just made all bets off. Now on just how important this question might be,

Speaker 1:          31:52          why wouldn't slavery worked for the building of the railroad? Why wouldn't slavery worked for building canal and for that matter, nobody wanted to compete with the slave labor system cause it denigrated or degraded the ID of free labor. Secondly, there were a lot of northerners particularly in in politics who wanted a Nanex who favored here a non extension approach to slavery, whatever they thought of black people and the future of their rights and the ID of any kind of racial equality. They favorite non extension on constitutional grounds. The idea was that those who would not attack slavery where it already existed because slavery slaves were property and protected by the amendment. They nevertheless believe they could use the constitution under Congress's sole authority to admit new states to the union. Just stop this system from expanding to stop America's future from becoming defined by slave labor rather than free labor for the little man. Nine extension of slavery therefore became a kind of idea whereby you could cold NOFX slavery and blunt it's future

Speaker 1:          33:16          three for northerners bills in Congress for the territorial organization which already existed. Now as soon as the Mexican war, before the Mexican war was even over, there were bills before Congress to establish the territory's now of Utah and New Mexico. No, in in large swaths of land. Mind you that could become more than two states and there were northerners who found these bills simply personally obnoxious and they were being asked. They said to be complicit to us. Now in the expansion of slavery, they there was, there were known enough northern politicians just said, look, I can't stop anything that's going on in Alabama and I won't try but don't ask me to vote to create a new territory that will become a slave state and already in the language of the free soil party and eventually in that Republican party that will come out of it is this idea that what northerners had to work to do, they said what's to make slavery sectional but freedom, national slave labor, sectional regional bound to a place but free labor, national eternal and the definition of a future.

Speaker 2:          34:43          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          34:43          It was also racism as a motive in this. There are a lots of northerners who saw the West is the hope of the northern immigrant, the hope of the young farmer in Ohio who's got three sons and they want to go west and I don't want, they don't want black people around. They want to Kansas or Nebraska eventually that's free for small white farmers and that's rooted of course. And what we're going to come back to again and again, the next three four lectures as this idea of a kind of a free labor ideology, a cluster of ideas, no single idea, but a cluster of impulses, assumptions, ideas, one of which was defensive representative government has other voice, wasn't devotion to individual liberty for small people, small farmers, loan mechanics coupled with no fear of concentrated power and what could be more concentrated form of power and an oligarchy of slave holders who can lo and behold, control of the presidency, the Supreme Court and enough of Congress, especially the Senate, if they can keep getting more states into the union, then the south as a concentrated power free labor ideology. It was also rooted in this kind of now old fashioned American fear of conspiracy against individual liberty,

Speaker 1:          36:12          free labor on you know how old he was really a fanfare for the common man,

Speaker 2:          36:17          defensive,

Speaker 1:          36:20          the white Anglo Saxon Protestant, small farmer. And of course finally there were some real abolitionists in the room who oppose the expansion of slavery on moral grounds

Speaker 2:          36:36          and sometimes that

Speaker 1:          36:39          person who believes in free Labor ideology and may not want it too many black folks around also takes a kind of moral position against slavery all at the same time. And His name was Abraham Lincoln. No, in the south. Why the south care about slavery in the West in part because in an assumption it's set in among southern leadership now for a long time that it was not only the destiny of the American people to expand west, it was only the destiny of the slave society does it spray spraying west and remember there are manufacturing decade by decade and more intensive justification of this system, but it was a necessity. They're going to argue that it expand or it would die to check the expansion of slavery would be to strangle the southern economy and way of life is what so many southern politicians are now arguing slaves in existing states. Also, they came to realize we're becoming a burden, possibly a danger as the slave population in Georgia or in Alabama or Mississippi continues to grow and grow and grow and grow, but nowhere to expand to that's my population may be coming, dude. A powder keg.

Speaker 2:          38:01          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          38:01          One of the things that southern statesman feared the most, and I cannot stress this enough because there's going to be right there at the heart of their succession debates in 1860 is they feared what they kept calling. Now, this is more than a theory to them, this theory of a shrinking south. If they couldn't expand the system beyond its limits and beyond its borders, get into Arkansas, get out in Oklahoma, Texas, West Texas, further west Caribbean.

Speaker 2:          38:30          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          38:31          At the south would begin to shrink as an economic entity, as a political culture, as a force in the national government, and if you cordoned off slavery, what's going to happen to the price of slaves around it's borders? They might be going to go down and what happens with the price of a slave starts going down in Kentucky, Virginia, Maryland, around the edges. Well, people start selling them off. We're going to sell them Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and you would have the beginnings now have an economy turning in on itself.

Speaker 2:          39:06          Okay?

Speaker 1:          39:09          Southerners, many southerners came to believe slavery had to expand or it could die. They also want to political parody in the United States Congress, every new statement to new senators and the number of states, free states, the slave states folks in 1850 was 15 to 15 they wanted to sustain that parody and California there is, it's going to sudden statehood in 1850 because of gold being discovered is going to be the problem and the test case, the newest, this question of a constitutional power.

Speaker 2:          39:50          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          39:50          the question of checks and balances. The states' rights question if you weren't, did anybody have the right to PR to prohibit anybody from taking their property anywhere? The John C. Calhoun, at the end of the day, all these other arguments here were important, but the only argument at the end of the day that mattered to him and he could drive it home with a brilliance unlike anybody else's. You have no right. You northerners have no right to stop me from taking my wagon, my horse, and my slave anywhere. I wish and he would just recite the fifth amendment. Let me put it yet one more way. There is a certain element of honor. It stinks here in the south about slavery. Their moral stance comes from this belief, this position, and think about this in your own time.

Speaker 1:          40:53          The idea set in among northerners that the legal status of slavery in the Western territories stood as a measure of its moral standing everywhere. Let me repeat that. Okay. The legal standing of slavery in the Western territory stood as a measure of its moral standing everywhere. If you tell me slavery is wrong enough that you will not have it in America's future, then you're telling me it's wrong where I have it and I don't accept that and I won't live in the same political culture with you if I have to, if I don't have to on that basis. So why all the fuss? I mean think today. Think today about some of our greatest salient, polarizing issues at the risk of bringing them up. If I were a gay American and I believed in my right to be married, I would believe that the legal status of gay marriage in a Kansas where they have a referendum is a measure of its moral status everywhere and extrapolate from there to other issues. You outlaw who I am, what I do, what I stand for in one state. What are you saying about it in another, oh, we shouldn't talk about the president in history courses. I'm sorry.

Speaker 1:          42:37          The first is because it's really a debate about America's future kind of future. Would it have? Well, there were four plans put in place, and as these four plans are going to come together around this debate, over the compromise of 1850, the first plan, uh, these were all on your outline. If you could see it earlier, you want that backup.

Speaker 2:          43:01          Okay.

Speaker 1:          43:05          The first we call the Wilmot proviso for good reason. It's named for David Wilma, well, young Democratic Party representative in the House of Representatives who in 1846 got up in the midst of the Mexican, well, this is a Democrat now and not a wig or a free soiler. He's from Pennsylvania. Any didn't particularly care about black folks. But he got up in the debates over the Mexican war about, uh, about, uh, provisions for the troops and all those debates. And he said, okay, we're going to war with Mexico. But in any new territory we gained from Mexico, slavery, she'll never exist. It's as simple as that. That's the Wilmot proviso. It's a great trivia question. If you have to ever have to play trivia in a bar ass, what's the Wilmot Proviso? Nobody knows. But it was the rallying cry of the free soil movement. Okay, a war. We're going to get millions of acres of territory. Slavery will never exist. This was the free soil formula. The language was borrowed from the northwest door news, all but one northern state legislature endorsed it. All. Southern legislatures condemned it. Ge, a little harbinger of things come there perhaps at first passed the House of Representatives and the first try 83 to 64 rep reflecting that the house has far more northern representatives because the north has more population, but it did not pass the Senate where the slave states still have parody.

Speaker 1:          44:51          There was a good deal of racist support for this will mount himself said, well, I'll quote him here. You get this. Free is free Labor ideology, ideologies, a mixture of ideas. This is Wilma in the debates. I have no squeamish sensitiveness upon the subject of slavery. Norm, no morbid sympathy for the slave. I plead the cause and rights of White Freeman. I would preserve to free white labor, a fair country, a rich inheritance where the sons of toil of my own race and color can live without the disgrace which association with Negro Slavery Brings Upon Free Labor, doesn't get more direct than that. Keep the West free of slavery and black people was really David wilmotts position. The second possible plan is what was known formally, legally a state sovereignty. This is the state's rights position. This is the south position, at least on this question, the individual's constitutional right of ownership and slaves as property and transport of slaves as property. State sovereignty. States rights wasn't deed deeply at the root of the south growing position here that ultimately no federal legislature, president, no federal authority existed to stop slavery's expansion. The third position, a very American position, a natural outcome of the first two,

Speaker 1:          46:38          the first two mix like oil and water, you need a compromise position and that's popular sovereignty. Popular sovereignty was not a new idea in the midst of the Mexican war and its aftermath and been around for awhile. It was the simple idea that there would be no act of Congress on this. Take Congress out of the story and simply let the people in the Western territory have a vote. What? I'm, have a referendum. Let there be popular democracy. If the people who settle Utah when a vote to have slave labor, then they vote for it. If they don't, they don't. Democracy. What could be better? This had the wonderful kind of charm of ambiguity is David Potter ones beautifully put it a term of ambiguity. It is kind of a place there for everybody. As long as you trusted the democratic,

Speaker 2:          47:32          yeah,

Speaker 1:          47:33          but if you're going to have that referendum, the problem of course always was when do you hold the vote? Do you hold the vote early in the territorial process where to hold the vote laid in the territory process? Do you establish a rule? There's gotta be a certain amount of population before, excuse me, before you hold that vote, southerners, one of that vote held late in the process because it would give their system longer to get there. It would take a while. If you're going to take 50 slaves out to Kansas or Nebraska or further west, it's going to take awhile for that loan farmer in his Conestoga wagon. He can get there quicker and fourth they went back to the old Missouri compromise. It's the principle of geographical division here. It's the old principle of geographical division. The Missouri compromise of 1820 you all learned this somewhere in school, established the 36 30 parallel from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean and it's said in 1820 a very important act of Congress in 1820 in this store and know to be so twisted and abused and debated in the 1850s as a sacred act. It said slavery shit would never exist north of that line.

Speaker 1:          49:01          The problem was it half of California was already north of that line. Now a lot of people, all right in the way we're going to head this problem off now is just to keep, keep drawing careful geographic lines across the continent, free soil above slave labor. Below. We'll just, we'll just keep drawing that line.

Speaker 1:          49:24          All right. I'm going to have to leave you hanging here about the color from eyes itself. That's fine cause we can do the cut of promos. It's collapsing lead right into the Kansas Nebraska pro. Hold on, I've got a minute. I think the election of 1848 was crucial. Democrats ran Lewis Cass of Michigan, thoroughly forgettable politician. I'm sure you've never heard of him, but he was a great proponent of popular sovereignty. They run in a popular sovereignty platform, the wet, the promise, slavery in the West. Now there's whole Mexican war problem. We'll solve it. Popular Democracy, the wigs run Zachary Taylor war, hero of the Mexican war or rough and ready problem was he was a Louisiana slave holder and out of this furor over the expansion of slavery in the West came to new political off shoots. One was called the conscience Whigs. They were created first in Massachusetts and they gave us Charles, among others, a group of abolitionists Wiggs who broke with the Whig party. Now it would never go back. A harbinger of the ultimate death within the next four years of the Whig party and the other was the free soil party born in the convention in Buffalo, New York in 1848 it ran Martin van Buren and I'd choice for president in 1848 a former president,

Speaker 1:          50:57          they stood for one thing, stopping at all costs, the expansion of slavery into America's West. The free soilers took 10% of the auto vote in 1848 election when Zachary Taylor war hero was elected and then gold was discovered in California over night, it seemed like it was overnight. California was going to be ready for statehood and Oh God, what to do with it because if it comes in as this free state or a slave state, it's going to upset the balance in the Senate in a setting, huge territory out there and suddenly there was a need, a desperate need, threats coming from the south. John C. Calhoun is calling us southern convention threats from some northerners who were saying no on her all costs. We will stop the expansion of slavery. There's a need to fund yet new Middle Ground. A night in January, teen 50 Henry Clay got together and she washed down and a hell of a lot of brandy with Daniel Webster. And they cut a deal

Speaker 1:          52:08          that became the compromise of 1850. I'll leave you hanging there. Clay and Webster are drunk. They're fashioning the great compromise, or are they hoped it would save the union? Clay at the end of that month would go before the US Senate and announced the five provisions of his compromise. And in so doing, he stood up and he held a piece of the coffin of George Washington. No, I don't know if it really was or not, but it was a piece of the true cross, uh, bowl piece of wood. This is from wash George Washington's coffin. He said, we must circle the wagons. We must save the Union. We must swallow this and do that. And then we're grows. And there were cheers. People wept, people shouted. And people were really worried that the union was going to unravel and fall apart. And it almost did. So you.
