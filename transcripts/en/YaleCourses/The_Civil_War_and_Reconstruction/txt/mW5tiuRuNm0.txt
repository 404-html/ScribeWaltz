Speaker 1:          00:12          I suppose every war, the short ones and long ones, the ones that get televised and the ones that don't, the ones where we get to see the coffins and the ones where we don't have their romance and their reality, it seems to be an endless in the face of whatever modernization of war, media coverage of war, the devastating critique of wars and individual human experience by so many great poets and writers for a century and a half. It doesn't seem to matter what changes or what happens, but youth grow up to be excited about war. Ambrose Bierce once wrote that only, I quote him, only fools forget the causes of war,

Speaker 1:          01:21          but then it's the same. Ambrose Bierce one of the most, certainly I think the unique American writer about the civil war in so many ways. A kind of bitter, brutal realists too, was wounded three times in the war, hit in the head with a shell shot from a cannon should have died Carston and part of his skull, which may explain Ambrose Bierce actually, but as beers who also wrote that lovely little line where he said the soil of pieces thickly sown the seeds of war. Yeah. Too much peace for a while and people get anxious. Americans win this war broke out and braced it with a fever that is, uh, an enthusiasm and an almost, um, undefinable joy. Uh, that may be a little tough to understand today or appreciate. It's only in the wake of war or in the face of real war. Of course, the people get reflective at the end of it all at the end of it all. And Lincoln's second inaugural is this famous passage. And by the way, there may be more book titles drawn from this one page and a half speech than any other piece of prose ever Penn by an American. I mean, I can just start ticking off the book titles that come out of phrases. The latest is a Jim Mcpherson, his latest book of essays called this mighty scourge of war. At some point we will run out. It's only a page and a half. I'm after all on the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, this is Lincoln, March, 1865 remembering March, 1861

Speaker 1:          03:17          all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it all sought to avert it. Well, the inaugural address was being delivered from this place devoted all together to saving the union without, or hmm. Insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war.

Speaker 2:          03:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:43          Seeking to dissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation. Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it parish. And the war came. Well, now that's Lincoln's argument, isn't it?

Speaker 2:          04:20          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:21          Once I would make war,

Speaker 2:          04:24          no,

Speaker 1:          04:26          the other side would except war.

Speaker 2:          04:29          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:30          We're going to revisit that moment in just a minute. Lincoln, so called April policy of April, 1861. His maneuvers against Jefferson Davis maneuvers about the single fort in Charleston harbor or the civil war would actually begin. Did Lincoln maneuver the south end of the first shot? Always been a question on answered. Um, quickly, let me revisit with you. Um, whoops, sorry.

Speaker 1:          05:14          Um, this question of causation. I left that in a bit of a bay. It's, uh, there was, uh, there was a school of interpretation of this war that has had a tiny, tiny little revival of lake, uh, in the hands of greatest stories. People I greatly admire, like Edward Errors. And you've read two of his essays for this week, worrying about the civil war. Um, and, uh, my colleague here skip scout in a different way. There's been a kind of a little revival of this notion that the civil war might've been preventable, that it might've been needless. Um, no one is arguing that as, as vigorously as James G. Randall and Avery craven and our host of other American historians do it in the 1920s, thirties and forties, up to World War II. World War Two is going to really reshape that interpretation and put it on the run. But I wanted to just visit it a moment because it shows us not only the historical interpretations as will be yours are influenced by one's own times, one's own experiences, one's own assumptions, one's on sentiments and how the world shapes us.

Speaker 1:          06:34          Sometimes it comes out of conviction. The needless wars school interpretation was led by James Round on every craven and Avery Cravens. Casey was a Quaker, but these were men deeply influenced by the outer disillusionment of World War One. They came of age and cut their teeth on history at a time when the world had collapsed into what seemed to be in the end. And explicable meaningless war is that unforgettable scene at the very beginning of, um, the guns of August by Barbara Tuchman. No one reads her anymore. She was at one point the most popular historian in America, um, turn it over the Middle Ages. She wrote about world war. She wrote up all kinds of things. Anyway, at the very opening of the guns of August, there's a scene, we're on a German general meets of French general, somewhere in the mid or late 1920. And the one general says to the other, uh, sir, why did it happen? And you're the general says,

Speaker 2:          07:47          I don't know. I really don't know.

Speaker 1:          07:53          In the wake of the Bay of Pigs and before the Cuban missile crisis, President John Kennedy gave a copy of the guns of August and ordered every member of his National Security Council in his cabinet to read it. And he quoted that passage and he said, never will. We never, shall we be caught having to answer that question about war. I don't know, in that kind of disillusionment and interpretation that fines, sheer politics and fanaticism and uh, you know, uh, aggressive emotionalism and overblown kind of, uh, what did Randall call it? Anxious fury as the essential explanation of why the war came in 1861 can make a certain sense. There's a bug geiling quality of that argument. When we look at the folly

Speaker 1:          08:56          of human history and the folly of human nature at all changed in so many ways. In the wake of the Second World War, a war that was all about it, he ology all about racism, all about the survival of enlightenment, ideas against [inaudible], against fasteners, fascism and so on and so on. And the generation led by such as storage is Arthur Schlesinger Jr and many, many, many others came to see the American civil wars coming when they started writing in the 1950s and sixties and into the 70s as what they would call and your repressible conflict and this array of arguments, they all get kind of all lumped under this heading. Irrepressible conflict thesis began to flow from American historian Don Fehrenbach or may have captured that interpretation best in a line when he said the civil war came and it was fought.

Speaker 2:          10:01          MMM.

Speaker 1:          10:02          To bring, well, how did he put it to bring to bring great national progress at great national cost.

Speaker 1:          10:11          I remember mind entirely comfortable with that idea. You know? Well, it all had to happen. It was bloody and horrible and terrible and all those people died. But we all got better for it. That never, never, never sits very well with me, especially when you study the memory of the war and the aftermath. But what happened in post war, World War II scholarship, and it's still there, it's still at the heart of how we try to explain this most pivotal event. The one of the most pivotal events in American history is a certain respect for moral questions, a certain respect for ideas and in a, and the, and the notion that politics sometimes about something,

Speaker 2:          11:00          oh, that's a

Speaker 1:          11:02          utterly horribly streamlined way of saying you don't find many historians anymore who argue from a needless war perspective. Although what you do find is a kind of roller coaster ride through American scholarship about this, the civil war, sometimes deeply influenced by Vietnam, sometimes deeply influenced. Even today, some have argued about Harry Stack, uh, skip stouts book. Um, if you know professor stout, he is remarkable new book out about whether the American civil war was a just war. And I will revisit that question at the end near the end of this course and use a couple of his arguments. It's controversial in your book. It's an interesting book. It's a question we've never truly asked about this good war. Was it just, does it fit? Does it fulfill the principles of just war doctrine? Can it, does it matter?

Speaker 2:          12:13          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:15          All right. Um, but back to April, 1861 whether it was just and just why it became so bloody and so prolonged, we're going to take up over and over,

Speaker 1:          12:41          but it surely did happen and it began, I dunno if that map works terribly well. Probably doesn't. It's the best I can do this morning is a map of Charleston harbor, which had their last remaining federal installation fort around the coast of the American south, still in federal hands. By march and April of 1861 the seven states of the seceded south, the deep South had begun to cs coastal forts. They began to see these federal arsenals. They seized post offices and they seized federal courts. Now, I can guarantee you today if you seized a federal court office building, and if, particularly if you killed anybody in the act or if you took over the US post office,

Speaker 3:          13:46          uh,

Speaker 1:          13:48          I know nobody cares about post dogs is because you do everything online. I mean, it was putting those people down there on, on, uh, on elm street. You mean? No such sweet people that if somebody's taken over that post office at gunpoint is, is not, not a thought. But if you did that today, I, and you'd be in federal prison and no time and you could be charged with treason. Now we can come back to that issue of treason when the course ends, uh, revisited if you want, um, about this war. But by and large, every federal installation in a seceded state, the seven seceding states had been seized by those states. Confederate states except Fort Sumpter.

Speaker 2:          14:32          Okay.

Speaker 1:          14:33          And it was a brand new forte.

Speaker 3:          14:36          MMM.

Speaker 1:          14:37          Oh God. It can't be more than 200, maybe 300 yards across diameter. It had just been built in the late 1850s is part of the coastal fort system, a big, huge high stone walls, but 20 feet high. It sits out at the mouth of Charleston harbor. Here it is nearly a mile from fort Sumpter to the tip of the town of Charleston, which is here from the battery park and Charleston to the fort is nearly a mile. You can almost not see it. Um, there is today a monument. I wish I had a slide of it to show you. It's one of my favorite for strange reasons. Civil war monuments, the thousands upon thousands of civil war monuments. Many of them are so generic you don't even notice them. This one you notice it's right at the tip of battery park in Charleston where they used to hang pirates. It looks right out at Fort Sumpter. It was put up in the early 20th century. It's a confederate monument of our wing Roman soldier. I think Roman, because of the helmet I'm told is Roman. He's some combination of of a winged creature and a soldier. He's about four times the size of life he is looking out at Fort Sumpter.

Speaker 1:          16:11          And the inscription around the bottom says to the defenders of Charleston, quote, count them happy. Who for their faith and courage endured a great fight. I'm gonna repeat that. Count them happy. Who for their faith and courage endured a great fight on our monuments of this war. Almost all of them, you will find almost nothing about what caused the war or even about what its consequences were. Almost all it was just a great fight.

Speaker 2:          16:59          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:59          And the dead are happy.

Speaker 1:          17:05          Well, what to do about fort Sumpter. Uh, in his first inaugural of March four, 1861, Lincoln promised, he said, promised to quote, hold, occupy and possess remaining federal property. Now think about it. If Lincoln and the Republicans are going to make a stand against the session, and once he finally comes into office, by the way, the day he entered off, as all at federal property had been taken by those seven states, it's already done. He inherits the situation. Now he could have backed away and continued to try to negotiate. And there was a compromise negotiation under John Jay Crittendon, a Kentucky senator, Washington for a while going on in late February and it never came up with anything new. They were going to try again, a geographic boundary out in the west with slavery, although don't forget the dred Scott decision declared that on leads illegal, um, they're going to try to, or the rub up something again about fugitive slaves to satisfy the south. They just couldn't come it. Any new ideas and Lincoln could have tried to continue to whole compromise Nikos negotiation conventions he could have or he could have held firm to the Republican position. That's the session was illegal and impossible and unconstitutional and had to be stumped. But if he lets fort Sumpter go, there was a garrison there led by a, um, a colonel named Anderson.

Speaker 2:          18:44          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          18:45          He just lets it go and effect. He's saying, well maybe all that seizure federal properties legitimate, um, maybe it's a session is possible. Right. It was about the only place he could have taken a stand if he was going to take a stand on Lincoln was buying time and he took a whole month of time before he acted.

Speaker 2:          19:11          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          19:11          he was hoping for what he called privately quote, voluntary reconstruction. He was hoping for Saner minds in the south to some, you know, a union spirit in the south to somehow take whole and as much been said over the years about Lincoln overestimating union sentiment across the south, he may have indeed over estimate at union sentiment, but there was a good deal of it. There were a lot of frightened people and the upstate counties of Virginia and a Western Virginia and in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee and northern Georgia. Those Union is pockets of the south were scared about this because they have to make terrible decisions. Now, if this cozy, if this goes to war, who do they go with and stay home? Well, colonel, I'm sorry, Major Robert Anderson had about 80 men. He was from Kentucky. That's from slave holding in his background,

Speaker 2:          20:15          but

Speaker 1:          20:19          he'll never end up with the south. A commissioners from South Carolina.

Speaker 2:          20:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          20:26          Had come to Washington as early as January of [inaudible] 61 to negotiate that specific forts release. They wanted it. Federal government had basically stonewalled president of Buchanan. Then the lame duck president tried actually to reinforce the fort and by reinforce it for, I mean send food to the garrison of um, between January five and nine of 1861, Buchanan the only act Buchanan even tried to make about secession. He was begging to get out of office. Buchanan send a ship called the star of the west full of supplies down the coast of Fort Sumpter to feed the men shore batteries around the harbor actually opened up fire and one had a direct hit on the ship, but nothing came of it. No, it's January five to nine. South Carolina was the only succeeded state wasn't until the 11th that Mississippi went and then Georgia and then about six others in the next three weeks. Lincoln's April policy if you like, was a process of trying to buy time and if there was to be war or firing or shooting about Fort Sumpter, he was trying to make sure the shots were fired by the south. Now there were Harkes and his administration, there were Harkson the Republican party who wanted him to act faster. One of them wrote to Lincoln privately and said, quote, give up Sumpter, sir, and you are as dead politically is. John Brown is physically

Speaker 2:          22:14          yeah.

Speaker 1:          22:14          Newspapers across the north strongly republican newspaper started to print headlines like, do we have a government wanted a policy or come to the point Mr Lincoln and so on. People were ready now do something. Now his secretary of state duly appointed in great part of this, Doris Kearns Goodwin is shown and argued in a recent bestselling book team of rivals was boy, he makes Seward, Lincoln's principal rival for the, uh, the nomination of the Republican Party. My not only put a few of his enemies in his own cabinet to control them and use them politically in the end, made an absolute best friend out of William Seward. But not yet. Seward was a dove on this. Seward wanted to negotiate. He urged evacuation of the fort and then he said, leave the door open to voluntary reconstruction as it might take hold around the south as southerners might see that this new Lincoln administration was willing to talk.

Speaker 2:          23:30          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          23:31          and it isn't. All the sewer did. Seward launched a crazy plan to declare war on Spain and France to direct America's attention outward to the world and therefore cause national unity wag the dog. All right, you see the movie? Let's just go to war with Spain and France and all those crazy southern is realize, oh, the nation is at risk. Lincoln immediately rejected this idea, although unfortunately it got out there and the foreign ministers, Spain, France needed explanations. Thank you very much. Stuart also made private promises as secretary of state to southerners that Sumpter would ultimately be evacuated. Just hang in there. Just wait. Well, Lincoln found that out. He said the Seward in effect shut up.

Speaker 1:          24:28          Now, Lincoln tried in his approach to Sumpter two separate reinforcement of these troops and military act from provisions and Humanitarian Act and he wanted to stress the ladder. He notified finally southern officials, you never forget them as the confederate government just notified South Carolina. He said that he was going to send food and provisions to Hungary soldiers. Now who could be against that. You just got to feed some people. He called it a mission of humanity, bringing food to a hungry man, quote unquote. But the confederate leadership took, this is a direct challenge and Lincoln did indeed send a ship down the coast about the eighth or ninth of ape known sixth or 7th of April, uh, any 61 and the prolonged suspense finally came to an end that one ship was provisioned with food. Now the truth is there were some arms and some weapons and the whole as well, and the end isn't going to matter a lot. The confederate cabinet met under Jefferson Davis and the 9th of April and they made a decision that if Blinken tried to sail that ship into Charleston harbor, they would fire on it. On the 11th of April, Major Anderson in the fort was going to chance to surrender by the authorities in Charleston. He refused. And at four 30 in the morning, in the dark of night, April 12th, 1861, about 100 cannon from all around Charleston Harbor, 100 federal Canon's originally now seized by the confederate states of America, opened up m bombarded. Charleston bombarded Fort Sumpter for 35 hours.

Speaker 2:          26:35          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          26:36          Anderson's men hid underground and dug out. They'd been well prepared for this and none of them died. And the of thousands of shells lobbed into the Ford. The relief expedition arrived out of the mouth of the harbor during the firing and it never got to the fort. On the 14th of April, after the bombardment ended, Anderson was forced to surrender the fort to take down the United States flag, a brand new confederate states flag with stars and bars was put up. And then Anderson's men held, uh, a gun salute. 21 gun salute. And the first casualties of the war occurred when two of Anderson's troops were killed on a powder keg blew up because it was too close to one of the muskets for April's later 620,000 dead and the 1.2 million wounded before I go go back up at Fort Sumpter.

Speaker 2:          28:00          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:02          On April 14th, 1862 it will be attended by William Lloyd garrison and 3000 freed people.

Speaker 2:          28:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:16          But that's a long way away.

Speaker 2:          28:19          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          28:19          The day after the firing on Fort Sumpter all across the country, the headline was war and Lincoln sent an executive order dot declaring war. Lincoln's position on this was clear. He to him anyway, that no nation can declare war on itself. He never accepted succession as legal or constitutional or appropriate, but he called for 75,000 volunteers to put down a domestic insurrection. And in the constitution, the President United States is given control over the military to put down domestic insurrection. He called it a rebellion.

Speaker 2:          29:05          No.

Speaker 1:          29:06          The most immediate and the most important immediate result of the firing on Fort Sumpter, of course, was the succession of the upper south

Speaker 2:          29:15          part of the upper south. Where's my map? Well,

Speaker 1:          29:30          oh, I apologize. I should have had that map, right. Well, you'll remember the map for more southern states. Slave states will succeed in the wake of something to the most pivotal course was Virginia. But Note Virginia had held a secession convention back in February and decisively voted against the session after Fort Sumpter in this state of war, hysteria and fever and fear, and under. Now this new argument that what the Lincoln Administration had really done was an act of coercion against the south coercion. Now, the feeding of some 80 soldiers in the fort was being interpreted as coercion. Okay, but Virginia quickly, overnight held a new secession convention, actually had state legislature held it and it voted 88 to 55 devote 88 to 55 lots of those, no votes, almost all of those no votes coming from the western part of Virginia. West Virginia didn't exist yet. The western part of Virginia where there was very little slavery and some of the upper counties of Virginia.

Speaker 1:          30:47          April 17th only three days after the surrender of Fort Sumpter, Virginia seceded from the union by may six Arkansas seceded by a vote of 69 to one in secession convention, North Carolina on May 20th voted to send the look. We're North Carolina is now, it's between Virginia and South Carolina. What are they gonna do? They voted unanimously in convention just to seed and finally on June 8th by a two to one vote of a popular referendum. These we've done different ways in different states on in a popular referendum, Tennessee in a two to one vote, approximately seceded from the union or the confederacy was now 11 states. It would never really be any more than that, but there was great tension about what Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky, and Missouri would actually do. Lincoln is reported to have said that he hoped to have God on his side, but he was certain he wanted Kentucky. Now there's been a whole flurry of emails recently on the slavery in history network of historians online. I'm trying to trace that quote just in the past couple of weeks and the truth is nobody can actually find it anywhere. It's one of those many, many, many probably Apocryphal Lincoln quotes. He must probably said something like it's somewhere, but I just couldn't resist using it. I've used it for so many years, so footnote might be apocryphal. Okay.

Speaker 1:          32:36          He did need Kentucky and whatever. He said, all those states were deeply divided about what to do and what they will do in the war will prove that and they will be terrible, horrible places to be geographically, emotionally, physically. In the war. Maryland was horribly divided. Node where it is, it's right above Washington DC, approximately 50,000 white men fought for the union in Maryland and the civil war, approximately, I'm sorry, about 50,000 white men in Maryland fought in the civil war, 30,000 on the Union side, 20,000 on the confederate side. And of those 30,000 on the union side, 9,000 of them were African Americans. Kentucky had about 50,000 men fight for the union, and about 35,000 men fight for the confederacy. And per capita, Kentucky, uh, produced more African American soldiers for the Union army than any other state. 24,000 total.

Speaker 2:          33:51          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          33:51          Missouri. The numbers are even greater. In Missouri, about 80,000 men fought for the union, about 30,000 fought for the confederacy, and there were about 3000 to one on either side. They were gorillas looking for the best pay day.

Speaker 2:          34:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          34:11          Early versions of Jesse James Without ideology later. Jesse James got real ideology though. That's another story. And folks, especially in those states, this was immediately, you've heard all the cliches about how it was a fratricidal conflict kind of brothers war immediately. It was a brother's war and thousands of families in April and May and June of 1861, brothers and fathers looked each other in the eye and had to decide what they would do.

Speaker 2:          34:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          34:47          Henry Clay had seven grandsons in Kentucky. Three fought for the union and for fought for the confederacy.

Speaker 2:          34:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          34:58          John Jay Crittendon of Kentucky, of these as a senator of the Crittendon compromise efforts in this position. Winter had one son who became a general in the union army and one son who became a general in the confederate army. Both survived and I've always wanted to know about Crittendon family reunions, but I've never looked into it. Mrs Lincoln, Mary Todd Lincoln, who was of course born and raised in Kentucky, I had four brothers who all fought for the confederacy and three brothers in law who fought for the confederacy.

Speaker 2:          35:41          Okay.

Speaker 1:          35:42          It will lead late at all kinds of charges. Well, some charges about treason against her and so on. Le Sympathies for the south and so on. And so John See Pemberton from Pennsylvania became a confederate general and was ultimately the general who surrendered Vicksburg to grant in 1863 George Thomas was Virginia born old slave holding family, but he never resigned his commission and he became known as the rocker Chickamauga. The union general who won the battle of chicken was a Virginian and the stories go on and on and on. There's the story of Clifton and William Prentice. One of them fought in the sixth Marilyn Infantry, uh, union regimen. The other fought in the second Marilyn Infantry, a confederate regiment. Both were wounded at Petersburg on April two on the same day, 1865 and the last week of the war. And they died and cots right next to each other in a field hospital.

Speaker 2:          36:53          Okay.

Speaker 1:          36:54          And the list goes on and on.

Speaker 2:          36:59          No.

Speaker 1:          37:01          When people went to war in 1861, what did they say they were doing? What did they say? Where their aims were there? What were their reasons? We have, uh, thousands of diary entries and letters and editorial and all sorts of things to draw upon. But on the northern side, what you find that summer is not only the sense that this will be a short war, and that's a preface worth

Speaker 2:          37:31          pointing out.

Speaker 1:          37:34          But people would say over and over, they were fighting for the flag, but they were fighting for the union. They were fighting for the constitution. They were fighting to save the republic. They were fighting two quotes, save the government and you keep hearing those phrases and you, you keep thinking, oh man, these are abstractions. What were they really doing?

Speaker 1:          37:55          You keep reading and You keep hearing them say the same damn thing. Well, there's a lot of good scholarship on this now that shows us that in 1860 [inaudible] in America, the u s constitution was important to people. They saw it as a kind of protection. They saw it as a source of social order. They saw the American nation as now something they were directly experiencing. Millions were directly experiencing the government as never before in those debates of the 1850s and as I've said before now voter turnout just zoomed in the 1850 to 75 and 80% in each general election from 852 on a pallet and then a marvelous book about this. They said that the constitution and the government for so many northerners was like a shield of protection and the southern succession now was not just a threat to this government. It was a threat to social order itself and are therefore had to be stopped.

Speaker 2:          39:04          Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:04          Uh, New Hampshire farmer who became a buck private in 1861 said, quote, the question now is country or no country liberty or slavery is a beautiful clarity to that isn't there? Now I don't know what he said after bull runner after Antietam or after Spotsylvania, if he survived a 50 year old railroad contractor named Robert mcallister threw down his lucrative job in 1861 and enlisted at age 50 quote to help us put down this wicked and unjustifiable rebellion. Our country and property is worth nothing if we don't, nor will life be secure.

Speaker 2:          39:50          Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:50          This is all over people's letters. They said they were fighting for liberty

Speaker 2:          39:57          of course. So Soda Southern,

Speaker 1:          40:02          no. Another argument here, and again, Phil Pallen and has made this better than anyone I think is he's argued that sun is a northern, is it sort of come to view the U s constitution? This, you know this document we live under Dan, different ways that northerners that come to see the constitution as a kind of protector, much violated now by Kansas, Nebraska Act, dred Scott decision, et cetera. Whereas southerners had come to see that constitution more as a destroyer, as something to fear. It might if the wrong people get hold of it, begin to attack or erode their society. There were a lot of people, particularly in the north, but then quickly in the south as well, who when this war broke out began to see it in terms of cosmic dualism, good and evil. God was entering history right away. Christian America began to interpret this in millennial terms. God had a quarrel in America. People start arguing and they're going to really be arguing this after the enormous bloodshed of 62 and 63 when they have to try to explain why this is happening.

Speaker 2:          41:16          Okay?

Speaker 1:          41:16          They're going to say, God has an appointment with America and he's going to decide whose sins are worse. Now on the southern side, as I said, people have to make tough choices, horrible choices. Who Do they go with and join their neighbors or pose their neighbor Mary Chestnut. The great dire is from South Carolina who indeed kept the most famous diary by a southern woman. There are many of them.

Speaker 2:          41:51          Okay.

Speaker 1:          41:51          She remembered March and April, 1861 this way and here we have another kind of beautiful clarity.

Speaker 2:          41:57          Okay,

Speaker 1:          41:59          we separated, said Mary Chestnut because of in Kampala, in compatibility of temper. We are divorced north from south because we hate each other so much. Okay, Mary, I get it. Doors, papers you hate us. Walter knew Jenna, Mississippi lawyer who did not own slaves, nevertheless declared in 1861 there without slave labor. Now the non slave holders arguing this, that without slave labor the country would be quoted in his words, a barren waste and desolate plane. We can only live in exists by this species of labor and hence I am willing to continue the fight to the last, well Nugen hadn't seen any fight yet,

Speaker 2:          42:53          but nevermind.

Speaker 1:          42:59          Well in the end, the south from the highest ranks of Jefferson Davis on down to buck private's are all going to say they were fighting for their liberty. Everybody was fighting for their liberty and what blocks to get into this thing and 62 and 63, uh, they're fighting for their liberty too.

Speaker 2:          43:21          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          43:21          everybody is. Lincoln later said, everybody declared for liberty.

Speaker 2:          43:28          Okay,

Speaker 1:          43:32          no, I'm making a mistake. I love to cook. My friend Uriah over there on the stone wall and Woolsey a walk every time, every morning on the way over here to class, I'd go by and I rub my finger on his name for, I dunno, good luck or something. If I teach her long enough, it's probably going to wear off. But everybody in the union army, it wasn't a Uriah parmelee. In fact, the vast majority were not going to free the slaves just yet. There's a story of a Yankee soldier in Virginia in 1861 oh encounters a slave woman in it. And he's taken that woman's goods and that woman's, well, wait a minute, aren't you coming here to help us? And, uh, he answered her and said,

Speaker 2:          44:21          MMM,

Speaker 1:          44:24          no. He answered her and said, no. The woman says, we were told you are coming here to help us and instead you steal from us. And the soldier replied, you're a Goddamn liar. I'm fighting for $14 a month. And the union, there's a beautiful clarity in that too. I ain't ain't here to free you. Oh, I got behind on this outline, didn't I? That's okay. That's actually just fine.

Speaker 2:          44:55          MMM.

Speaker 1:          44:58          When we resumed that don't, don't leave yet. When we resumed next Tuesday, I will talk a little bit about west point and what happened at West Point on union and confederate or southern and northern men began to leave. And then we'll begin the war and we'll talk about comparative strengths and so on. But let me leave you for today and the weekend if you don't mind. With Walt Whitman, again, Whitman's opening poem of his immortal collection called drum taps in a kind of agonizing way, may have captured what was in the heads of most Americans in 1861

Speaker 1:          45:43          to the drum taps prompt. He writes, the young men falling in and arming the mechanics, arming the troll, the Jack plane, the blacksmith's hammer tossed aside with precipitation. The blood of the city is up armed arm. The cry everywhere. The flags flying out from the steeples of churches and from all the public buildings and stores, the tearful parting, the mother kisses or Sun, the sun kisses the mother low. This is the mother to part, yet not a word. Does she speak to detain him? War and armed races advancing the welcome for battle. No turning away now. War be it weeks, months or years and armed race is advancing and it welcomes it.
