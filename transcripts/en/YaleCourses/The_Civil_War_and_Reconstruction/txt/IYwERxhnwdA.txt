Speaker 1:          00:01          The last book you're reading in this course is about great journalist Nick Lemann. It's called redemption, the last battle of the civil war. That seems to be a contest right now in writing about and publishing about the violence of reconstruction. It's really been discovered by American publishers and certainly by American writers and in less than three new books out on either the Colfax massacre, which we'll talk about in a minute or what lemon does mostly in his book, which is the story of Mississippi, sometimes called the shotgun policy, sometimes called the Mississippi plan, but in effect the coup d'etat whereby the White Democrats of Mississippi took back control of that state largely by terrorist violence, political violence in 1875 the titles of these books strike me redemption, the last battle of the civil war, Charles Lane's book, the pop, good journalistic popular writer, a whole book in the Colfax massacre, current title, the day freedom died one day and there's another book by a young New York private high school teacher. Proof that good books can be written by anyone. The Colfax massacre, the untold story of black power, white terror, and the death of reconstruction. All those titles are true.

Speaker 1:          01:45          It's not the redemption of course that you hear Button Bob Marley's redemption song, but am I recommended you put Marley on while you're reading about this stuff? It might be a nice antidote. No, I'm not going to sing it, but I'm gonna start with a very brief little poem.

Speaker 1:          02:13          One of the best illustrations in poetry. I know of this idea that revolutions can go backward, that revolutions usually do go backwards for awhile. That revolutions always cause counter. It's a poem by Langston Hughes. He wrote it right near the end of his life in 1965 note the date he entitled it emancipation and then a subtitle. Long view. Negro two simple versus emancipation. In 1865 cited through the telescope of dreams looms larger, so much larger, so it seems than truth can be, but turn the telescope around, look through the larger in and wonder why what was so large becomes so small. Again, the metaphor is powerful. If vexing, look through the opposite end of a telescope. Look back at history and not forward and wonder why was what was such a dream, what was so large, it can become so small again

Speaker 1:          03:46          now, and I'm on that 15th Amendment Pass that I talked about briefly the other day. There were just amazing celebrations in 18 set when it was finally ratified in 1870 all over the place. Um, I only saw it a couple, um, grant and his message to Congress in effect said reconstruction was now largely over Frederick Douglass. Though he wasn't thrilled with the fact that it was the most conservative version of the 15th amendment and so on. Nevertheless said we can now breathe a new atmosphere. We have a new earth beneath and a new sky above. That's a dream. One Republican newspaper called it the nation's second birth,

Speaker 1:          04:48          second founding and Wendell Phillips, the again the Massachusetts abolitionists said it was now the real birthday of the nation because now the declaration of independence applied to all know that was placing a great deal of hope in a somewhat limited amendment to say the least. That's 1870 now go ahead. Just five years with me. This is the period now of southern redemption defined of course as the southern White Democratic Party's counterrevolution and taking back control of its state. Governments happens very quickly in some southern states. Some are redeemed as early as 1870 by the Democrats and the last three or so, not until 1876 77 but think of what you just heard there, that that almost unfathomable hope rooted in this voting rights amendment. And then listen to this statement from the floor of Congress, one of the most brilliant young black who got himself elected among those hundreds of got elected among the 16 who got elected to Congress, John Roy Lynch, a former slave self taught.

Speaker 1:          06:10          He educated himself like Frederick Douglass. There's, there's, there's mysteries about the brilliance of this guy, but he's elected to Congress when he's 26 from Mississippi under Mississippi's radical reconstruction government. So long as it lasted, he's still there in 1875 and on the floor of the congress, which was then, as you'll see in a moment after the 74 election now ruled by a majority of Democrats. He looks them in the eye and he says, think of it for a moment. My colleagues, when I leave my home in Mississippi, to come to the capitol of the nation, to take part in the deliberations of this house and to participate with you in making laws for the government of this great republic. I am treated not as an American citizen, but as a brute force to occupy a filthy smoking car both night and day with drunkards, gamblers and criminals. And for what? Not that I am unable or unwilling to pay my way. Not that I am obnoxious in my personal appearance or disrespectful in my conduct, but simply because I happen to be of a darker complexion. Now, here's the irony and the point, the majority of those men, he was speaking to that day in the congress,

Speaker 1:          07:41          in their minds when they heard him say it, to the extent they listened, when he said that, I think we can safely assume we're thinking, yeah, that's just exactly the way you should be treated.

Speaker 2:          08:00          No.

Speaker 1:          08:02          1873 for the moment. Uh, the day freedom died according to Charles Lane's book is the day of the Colfax massacre. That day, I wouldn't quite say freedom died on one day. That's a little a historical, but so be it. That's probably a publisher's title more than an author's title. But April, 1418 73 is in some ways, one of those days we could call in American history a day of infamy. The Supreme Court that day, at least it's the date of the decision, even though it was Easter Sunday, handed down his decision, five to four in the slaughterhouse cases, so called a collection of five cases that came out of Louisiana, which was the courts first major ruling on the civil war amendments on the of the 13th, the 14th and the 15th amendments

Speaker 1:          09:02          that day, same day, Easter Sunday and Colfax. Louisiana, a town, not very big name for Schuler Colfax, the vice president of the United States and the grant administration in grant parish, renamed by the republican regime where you list these grant. The largest mass murder of Americans ever in American history occurred in the political violence stemming from the divided election in Louisiana back in the fall of 1872 now nine 11 of course, killed more Americans. We can get caught up in categories of what is domestic violence and foreign violence and so forth, but this is the largest mass murder of Americans in our history so far as we can tell. That divided election produced in effect two competing governments in Louisiana, the republican regime, which per did win the election for all practical purposes in spite of the tremendous political violence committed against particularly black voters in that fall 72 election, but it's still called fusion ticket of basically a kind of white supremacists coalition also claimed to be the legitimate government of Louisiana and in this situation of essentially and ongoing vigilante war throughout many of the parishes, counties of Louisiana, a standoff took place in Colfax. I'll come back to that in a moment.

Speaker 3:          10:46          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          10:46          But back to the slaughterhouse case that came down that day. It wasn't the end at testing of the privileges and immunities clause of the 14th amendment. In 1869 the city of New Orleans under its republican state government created a corporation to move the slaughterhouse of New Orleans. They're actually, I had never been a legitimate slaughterhouse in New Orleans. What the butchers of New Orleans would do, the white butchers of New Orleans would do is they heard the hogs through the streets of New Orleans and basically they'd butcher the things wherever they wanted to and they always threw all the, it gets ugly. All of the old fall from the hogs into the Mississippi River up river from the city before the river reached the main water pipeline into the city. This has long been a problem. Long been set, a series of complaints and so this was an attempt that clean government and clean cities, the city and the state backing it up, created a corporation.

Speaker 1:          11:54          They created a new slaughterhouse. They moved across the Mississippi River and downstream from the city for health reasons. They put in a a state appointed inspector and the white butchers of New Orleans were angry, some bushes and some critics charge. This was a monopoly and an unfair practice. 25 butchers brought suit with support from the reviving Democratic Party, white butchers, the lower courts in this particular suit found in favor of the new corporation. It was appealed to the u s supreme court. It got on the docket in 72 it was decided April, 1418 73 it was a five to four decision seemingly on the surface that when you read it, it's like many court decisions. It's a bit boring at first five cases from butchers and so on and so on. And you want to, what the hell is this about? And then you keep reading and you realize it became a fundamental decision.

Speaker 1:          13:02          Justice Samuel Miller for the majority, argued that the 13th and 14th amendments were intended. This was the good part of the decision to end slavery and advance the rights of the Friedman. But he made a sharp, just in other words, not to protect a bunch of white butchers in New Orleans. And by the way, the lead lawyer for the butchers in the slaughterhouse cases was none other than a man named Johnny Campbell. Uh, Georgia born former member of the supreme court. He had been part of the six men majority in the dred Scott decision of 1857 resign his position on the u s supreme court in 1861 to go home and fight for the confederacy. He didn't fight on the battlefield. He became assistant secretary of state and the confederacy and serve through in that position and other high ranking official positions in the confederate national government throughout the civil war.

Speaker 1:          14:04          And when the war was over, he was one of those high ranking confederate officials. Denied the right to vote disfranchised for up to four years. He was part of the final set of amnesty and pardons that Andrew Johnson enacted just before leaving office in spring of 69 and Campbell and made it as business as a redeemer now in the south to Swart and fight reconstruction at every turn. He hated black suffrage. He hated black people. He was a very white supremacist. He took this case on because he wanted to crush reconstruction. He even argued, by the way, in the slaughterhouse cases which Miller turned right back on his head. He even argued that the rights of the butchers were being under the 13th amendment. They said that he said that these butches were now being forced into a form of involuntary servitude because they had to take their hogs across the Mississippi and of them down river. It was violating their right to make a proper livelihood by their own individual choice.

Speaker 2:          15:13          Okay,

Speaker 1:          15:13          and frankly, folks, I read this decision this morning. I got through most of it. If you want to read the origins of our modern day uses, and some would say misuses of civil rights, language and legislation in our own time, the ways in which some American politicians, lawyers, judges, et Cetera, pundits, et Cetera, et Cetera, et Cetera, have appropriated the language of the modern civil rights movement, especially the language of the content of our character

Speaker 1:          15:49          too. Sometimes some scurrilous ends. The roots of that are in John Campbell's arguments in the slaughterhouse cases in 1873 Miller through the 13th amendment argument back at, at Thompson and told him in effect to well stick it somewhere now, however, back to Miller's opinion in, in a five, four case. The real importance of the slaughterhouse case is that even though Miller argued that the purpose of these amendments were to, were to advance, uh, uh, black freedom and the rights of the Friedman, he nevertheless made a clear distinction between national and state citizenship in these years. We don't even think him. Well, I don't think we think in terms of the day of our states citizen. Do you think of yourself as a citizen of the state of Virginia? Maybe you do. I don't. Maybe today in town Sylvania where people are voting in droves, they're thinking of their citizenship was Pennsylvania and I don't know.

Speaker 1:          16:54          But we tend to think of terms of citizenship now from the, certainly in the early 21st century is a national phenomenon. One has Portuguese or, or, or German or American or whatever, Brazilian citizenship. And in some countries dual and so on. Rarely do we think of ourselves as citizens of states, but they did in the 19th century. Now what Miller did in this decision though was a bit weird in retrospect, he named various national privileges and immunities. That's the language of the 14th Amendment, uh, like entering the nation's ports or protection out on the high seas. The ability to run for federal office and to travel to the seat of government and so on. But he never mentioned basic civil rights, access to public facilities, et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera. He never mentioned the right to vote. He said all of those rights are only under the jurisdiction of the states, not the national government. In other words, traditional federalism. This separation of what states can control, like the right to vote, like what is the civil rights, which civil rights, what kinds of equality or it'd be adjudicated in court would be left to the states

Speaker 1:          18:25          slaughterhouse set in motion. This federal retreat, at least in the courts, and it's a retreat, is already happening elsewhere from Miller's zone definition, ironically of the meaning of the 13th and 14th amendments back to Colfax Colfax, Louisiana, April, 1418 73. I don't have time for the, all the gruesome details of this massacre and I'll spare you the most of it, but it is in some ways in the American mee Lai massacre, uh, Katyn forest massacre with the Soviets did in 1944 and Poland, it's a, it's one of these authors of this new book, I think a bit inappropriately uses the term genocide, that it was a result of a wish for genocide. Um, it is mass murder by any definition. What happened is that where these two competing governments in Louisiana, Democrat fusion government, the Republican government, both would appoint sheriffs in the same parish. So there was the Republican sheriff who was black and there was the democratic sheriff who was white, uh, local officials of all kinds of being appointed.

Speaker 1:          19:48          Well, what happened is that the violence in the countryside got so bad in grant parish that the blacks in the area began leaving their cabins and leaving their small farms and they came into Colfax because Colfax had become a symbol of protection and safety for blacks and the Great Red River district of central Louisiana. By the way, the Red River region of central Louisiana with some of the richest soil in all of the south. It was a tremendous sugar and cotton plantation region. Several thousand acres of that Red River district right around Colfax was zone by a white land owner name of Willie Calhoun, William Calhoun. He was the son of a Meredith Calhoun who had been a very, very pro slavery, huge slave holder before the civil war, but his son, Willie, who had been raised in part in Europe because his parents kept living half, half the time in Paris as a kid was badly, terribly injured.

Speaker 1:          20:51          His back was broken. He spent his life as a hunchback and God only knows how he came by, his sympathies and his beliefs in the rights of former slaves. But he became a union during the civil war in an area where it was not healthy to be a union and the Red River district and after the war was over, Willy Calhoun became an early and often scale away or Republican and he in effect turned over much of his land without even selling it to the settlement of hundreds and hundreds of Friedman and their families. Willie Calhoun would spend the Colfax massacre watching probably 150 odd blacks murdered in cold blood as a kind of a prisoner on his front porch. But at any rate, black gathered and Colfax for weeks before the spring of 73 cause it was, it had been at least a co or a, the Calhoun landing as it was called, had been a place of safety.

Speaker 1:          21:58          Blacks took over the courthouse in Colfax. They occupied it, they'd collected lots of weapons, they were ready. They build trenches all the way around the courthouse. They were ready for battle and it is battle. They got from a huge mob of disparate para military whites, many of whom were for four former confederate soldiers, many of whom are former members of the Ku Klux Klan. Some now called themselves knights of the white community. Then went by all kinds of different names and what had happened on April 14th was indeed in effect, a pitched battle. The whites had a cannon, lots of weapons.

Speaker 1:          22:43          Blacks couldn't hold them off. They fled into the courthouse. The whites captured a black men and forced him to take a torch and they said, we'll kill you or you take the torch and light the roof on fire. He let the roof on fire and the courthouse began to burn down, which of course smoked most of the blacks out of the courthouse, although a few stayed and were burned to death, hiding under the floorboards, and as they came out, many of them were executed right around the door before the thing was over that night, the estimate runs from about 82 possibly as high. We'll never really know as 150 blacks were killed. Most of them execution style. Most of them will shots to the head. Many of them shots to the back of their heads and many of them in the wake of being shot, uh, having their bodies mutilated the first representatives of the Louisiana state government, uh, the Republican will, Louisiana state government arrived 48 hours after the massacre and recorded one after another corpse shot in the back of the head and then shot many more times and then somebody mutilated and they kept us.

Speaker 1:          24:06          This is this kind of gruesome need to describe you find in these reports. They also described many of the bodies being eaten by dogs and Turkey vultures.

Speaker 1:          24:19          Well, Colfax led to a national sensation, Harper's weekly and Leslie's weekly had illustrated articles about it. Within a week, a famous pictures of blacks carrying their dead home to bury them quotations from women describing a woman describing, dragging her son away from the dogs who are eating his body and so on and so forth. And it led to a national investigation of federal investigation led by the US attorney. The Republican appointed us attorney in New Orleans, who's name was James Beckwith, a northern born new England old abolitionists fellow with a good deal of zeal who heroically tried to bring indictments and prosecutions. There were indeed many indictments, but only three convictions in the wake of Colfax. It took over two years and it led to the second great Supreme Court case that turned around reconstruction.

Speaker 1:          25:29          That case first argued in Louisiana was for the three men convicted of leading the Colfax massacre. One of the names was a man named William Cruickshank Cru, I. K. S. H. A. N. K. I don't think I put it on the outline or did, I guess I didn't. Sorry. In the United States versus Cruickshank, the u s supreme court took up the case of these prosecute these convictions in Louisiana. The court, by this time, early 1876 when the crook shank case came down, had a new chief justice, his name was Morrison Remick. Wait, w. A. T. E. We've been appointed by grant and 1874 to replace the recently deceased salmon p chase, who had been appointed chief justice by Abraham Lincoln. The court by 1876 was seven Republicans and two Democrats. Most of them now had been appointed by Lincoln or grant. This was a thoroughly Republican Party Supreme Court.

Speaker 1:          26:42          Um, wait, by the way, we've been through many Supreme Court appointments in our recent lifetime and we know how political these things can get weight with grants. Fifth Choice, the first two people he asked turned him down. I don't want to be on the Supreme Court. There's no political future. Their Supreme Court justice in these years often ran for president while they were on the court and it's, they don't do that. At least they don't do that. Now, the next two people he appointed or he wanted to appoint were turned down by the Senate way, was his fifth choice. Nobody ever heard of it. He was known in Ohio, but as one of his own supreme court colleagues called him said, wait, was quote at the front rank of second rank lawyers.

Speaker 1:          27:32          Maybe it proves the old adage, apologies to anyone from Ohio. You know, the old saying, Ohio has had more presidents. I think even in Virginia. Some are born great, some achieve greatness, so I'm just coming from Ohio, Morrison. Wait, we'll write the opinion in a nine zero decision unanimous decision and the Cruickshank case. This was a test, this case now of really the enforcement act passed in 1870 the enforcement act as part of the Ku Klux Klan acts authorizing the federal government to enforce the right to vote with military action if necessary in the south. This was a case now testing that also of course testing the 14th and 15th amendments, the court decision and Cruickshank found the indictments had said faulty. It overturned two of the three convictions. It ruled that those immortal phrases of due process and equal protection, those two great clauses in the fort and then part one of the 14th amendment applied.

Speaker 1:          28:53          They said only to state actions and not to the actions of individuals. If a man murders another man in Colfax, Louisiana in a, in a, in a political way or any other way, that's a state matter. Even if it's around voting, it's a state matter. Not a federal matter can be adjudicated in federal court. Federal government does not have the power to enforce the right to vote, the right to civil rights and so on. The Cruickshank case, the implications of the Cruikshank case immediately were obvious. It meant number one, that mass murder, one unpunished in the United States to and meant that blacks increasingly not would be at the mercy of now hostile state governments. Back when Justice Miller wrote that decision in slaughterhouse, there was still a lot of republican regimes and he's not, he claimed to his dying day he was leaving adjudication to states under sympathetic Republican governments. Yeah, but Justice Miller or what if the government's no longer sympathetic? What if it's run by Klansmen?

Speaker 1:          30:14          And three, it opened up. Crude now opens up as a federal court decision, all manner of discriminatory laws passed by what will be democratic redeemer governments in the southern states. Why was there a nine zero decision in 1876 on this with seven of the justices appointed by Lincoln and grant and so on? Well one, you have to realize that by 75 and 76 when these guys were were adjudicating this decision, there was a tremendous amount of just flat out fatigue with reconstruction. And I've been to all, I've been to a lot of your sections now, and I've heard you say the same thing, and I'm not chastising you,

Speaker 2:          30:57          I'm not,

Speaker 1:          30:58          but sometimes we, we, we read back into the past, even our own fatigue with certain issues, they were sort of fed up with reconstruction in the north. Well, yeah, they were. Look at the consequences.

Speaker 2:          31:13          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          31:14          it's clear. And even in their own writings that many of the justices just wanted to get rid of reconstruction and leave it to the south. It's signaled now, most importantly, a phoner makes this point in the one little paragraph he gives you on the Cruickshank case, it's signal now with the federal government was ineffective exiting reconstruction. Certainly the supreme court was, and his phone, her says terror was given a green light anywhere that is state government was unwilling

Speaker 2:          31:49          to enforce the law or protect people. Now,

Speaker 1:          31:55          why was radicalism waning in the 1870s or even at the beginning of the 1870s. What is about about the grant years, especially the second grant administration that leaves, you know, the, this pay practically paves these roads to a southern redemption, a southern counterrevolution? Well, there are many factors, and let me kind of run through them and then focus, especially on the scandals for a moment. And then on this larger question of, of violence, in case you haven't heard enough about violence and mean, first of all, there's the panic of 1873, um, which set in, in the spring of 1873, a major economic depression that hit the country, the entire country, and led to a great deal of labor, strife, and violence.

Speaker 3:          32:45          Okay?

Speaker 1:          32:46          It meant in the wake of the well in the midst of the panic of 73 and [inaudible] 74 [inaudible] 75 that the issues now that politicians were most concerned about and the voters were most concerned about, particularly in the north, were things like currency, tariffs, unemployment, railroad subsidies, labor strife. Whether a union had the right to strike here, the right to strike there and across the great Midwest among farmers. The biggest issue was the price of wheat, which dropped from $2 a barrel to 50 cents in a year and a half.

Speaker 3:          33:22          Okay.

Speaker 1:          33:23          Wages for manufacturing laborers in the United States in a year and a half drop by 50% across the country. That's for those who kept their jobs. The panic of 1873 shifted people's mind to say the least.

Speaker 3:          33:46          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          33:46          Then there's the factor of the grant, the nature of grants presidency, the way in which granted himself even defined the presidency, grandchildren remember, was a rather reluctant politician. At first. He actually got a little better at it. Then his historical reputation is sometimes led us to believe grant could be very political, although he did have this idea that the presidency ought to be, especially in these crisis years with the tremendous bitterness bloody shirt tensions after the civil war and after all, he's the general that won the war and obliterated Virginia that the president ought to be. Now just basically a caretaker ought to have as few opinions as possible. A caretaker presidency, not so much a leader as a unifier.

Speaker 1:          34:39          No, he is hands off approach to so many things of course is what in part led to the scandals that are so long have long, so long been associated with him or at least with his administration. I would argue that grant has gotten to some extent a bad rap from some historians. Although if you look at any of those lists that come out every year when they survey historians, the greatest presence, the worst presidents, you know, Lincoln's always at the top and then you get to Fdr. Now Reagan has always in the top three for reasons I don't even want to discuss. A lot of airports are named forums. I guess that's why at any rate, um, enough on that grant is always down here near the bottom. I can't resist this. The great American cynic of the 19th century, one of our greatest historians and one of our most beautiful writers, but what a cynic. Henry Adams, son of Charles Francis Adams, grandson of Quincy, great grandson of John. This was his description of grant and he was living the grant administration. Grant had no right to exist.

Speaker 2:          35:58          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          36:01          he should have been extinct for ages that 2000 years after Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar, a man like grant should be called and should actually truly be the highest product of the most advanced evolution made evolution ludicrous. The progress of evolution from President Washington to President grant was alone evidence enough to upset Darwin. Grant should have lived in a cave and Warren Skins,

Speaker 2:          36:35          Ooh,

Speaker 1:          36:38          that's Cole and unfair, but under his leadership, a whole series of four or five different scandals that sort of set the standard for scandal to come in American history. Although we've, we've had some much worse one since then. Some of these, most of them were of course financial. There's almost no sex in the grant scandal years so far as we can tell. Um, the first one is the gold scandal. This was an attempt to corner of the gold market by one Jay Gould and James Fisk. He's are Wall Street guys in New York is an 1869. Right after grant took office. They did indeed corner the market on goal. They tried to buy up all the gold in New York and then they plan to force bankers and business people to buy the gold from them and inflated prices. It's an old cornering a trick. They uh, they made $11 million in three weeks doing this in the 19th century.

Speaker 2:          37:47          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          37:47          They were eventually selling that goal than $163 and 50 cents per ounce. And the only way to break their corner was suddenly, cause it happened so fast, it was for the federal government to begin selling all of its goal, put it on the market, get the prices down, grants brother-in-law never point your brother in law to anything able. Corban was that sort of personal emissary. He assured and promise the plotters, Gould and Fisk that uh, he had influence on grant and the grant would never permit the government's goal to be sold, but he was wrong. And grant did allow it to be sold. And then grants person, uh, grants a treasury secretary, George Barnwell got involved. The scandal finally broke open in the press. And though nothing ever really happened to Goulder Fisk setting in motion a history of who gets caught and who doesn't get caught in the Wall Street world.

Speaker 1:          38:53          It did, it was the first scandal of its kind to begin to lead to cries of civil service reform, which became, uh, uh, a big rallying cry and the 1870s then there was the whisky ring. Man, this was all fashion just on a Delta rated fraud. This began in the early 1870s. At first started in St Louis. It was really a cartel, what we in modern times would call the creation of a cartel. These were whiskey distillers all over the country who banded together to cheat the US government out of excise taxes. You know the luxury tax on Whiskey, the way that they did it, as many distillers were forced to join this ring of people around the country or have their businesses ruined, join or we'll run you out of business. The whisky ring had branch offices all over the country and cities like Milwaukee, a Peoria, New Orleans, Chicago, Cincinnati in Washington, in many other cities, north, south, west, you name it, and then they started bribing the Treasury Department, which of course is where the excise taxes would, would go to many officials in the Treasury Department.

Speaker 1:          40:07          We're soon on the payroll of the whisky ring, especially the chief clerk of the U S Treasury Department. The man who kept the books, one General Orville Babcock, the president's private secretary was implicated more than implicated. He was involved. He was charged eventually, although acquitted grant entered a deposition on his behalf and a good character and so on in court, which he never showed his done. He didn't really look at the facts. He didn't look at the evidence. The point of all this one is that millions and millions of dollars in liquor revenues were lost. To the u s government from about 1870 to 1875 and most of that money went into the pockets of whiskey distillers, and a lot of it went into the pockets of treasury department officials who were themselves supposed to be collecting the tax. The estimate is that between 40 and $50 million it was grafted. In this particular scandal scandal broke in 1875 there were about 150 people indicted in the liquor business.

Speaker 1:          41:21          About 85 people indicted in the federal government. There were 110 convictions, although nobody served terribly long in any prison. And thirdly, there's this thing called credit Moby lay. This was the company that was first chartered in 1859 as part of it was, it was the finance company for the Pennsylvania. It was called the Pennsylvania fiscal agency. Originally it was the finance company for the Union Pacific railroad that got the greatest contract in American history to build a transcontinental railroad. The Union Pacific had a charter from the federal government to build this great railroad to the Pacific, or possibly two or three of them for each mile of track built. The Union Pacific was to receive 10 sections of public land and from 16,000 to $48,000 depending on how difficult the terrain was to build on. Yeah, Union Pacific arranged the construction contracts with its own from the wood that had called credit Moby lay, so that all government money would get spent.

Speaker 1:          42:35          You know, the old routine, if you get a grant, make sure you spend it because they won't give you as much. Next time credit Moby lay and therefore union Pacific made enormous profits. The shares of stock and credit and Moby lay skyrocketed. And to keep the federal government in line and to let this continue to go on many congressmen, we never know. We'll never know exactly how many were on the take with simply being bribed and old fashion. Handfuls of cash by the Union Pacific. This scandal to broke in 1873 all kinds of people were accused, including vice president Schuler. Colfax Congress reprimanded one government, railroad agent and two Congressmen and then just left it alone. Uh, so far as I know, no one's ever really put a price tag on the graph committed by the Union Pacific and the credit Moby lake case. This kind of spoils men economic, financial corruption became rampant in the grant years and again, a huge political distraction away from the issues of the south.

Speaker 1:          43:58          The issues of the Freedman, the issues of reconstruction, the other major paths to southern redemption, the success of this, the white southern Democratic Party was of course the uses of violence. But before I give you a little more litany and the level of clan terrorism, think with me for just a moment. What those radical Republicans originally, almost none of whom are really in power anymore. That is Stevens died in 1869 Charles Sumner dies in 1874 Benjamin wait is long gone as a senator from Ohio, the old leadership of the radicals is really no longer there by 1874 when the Democrats are going to throw the Republicans out of the leadership of the congress. Anyway, the thing with me for just a moment back to what phone are called the the radicals civic vision. That civic vision again, was rooted in Free Soil Ism, unionism winning the war and to some an anti and an ending, slavery, emancipation, and then two at least the beginnings of racial equality.

Speaker 1:          45:12          You cannot mistake that they believed in at least the beginnings of that in the 13th 14th and 15th amendments, but think for a moment in the 19th century, how would most Americans think about the idea of equality? I would argue that in our history, this nation in the modern world that probably tried to do more about the ID of a quality than perhaps any place else has gone through three definitions of a quality. The first, we might simply call a quality in the eyes of God or natural rights. The old enlightenment, it's not from the inlet, just from the alerts in the epistles of Paul. It's, it's, it's ancient in some ways, but the idea that somehow you're a born equal before God or nature, well, you have a natural capacity that's equal. It doesn't say anything about human affairs and understanding about government or law. The second kind of equality, and it came into history.

Speaker 3:          46:21          Okay,

Speaker 1:          46:23          is it quality before law that was never codified, never spoken until the 14th amendment. The equal protection of the law.

Speaker 3:          46:37          Okay?

Speaker 1:          46:37          That's where it begins. If there's a third kind of equality in our history, it's probably what we came to Carl and the 20th century, and especially in the civil rights revolution in its wake and equality of opportunity in the 19th century. Trust, they never got to that one and they didn't get terribly far with the quality before law. The radical Republicans ideas we're up against. And here you can just give up and say, well, you see what we tried to go too far too fast. They were ahead of their times. Gee Whiz, reconstruction failed. Maybe it should have failed. Can't do anything about it. So be it how the lights went out for 75 or 80 years. But that's, you know, some things are inevitable in history if you're comfortable with that,

Speaker 2:          47:30          uh, fine.

Speaker 1:          47:36          But the radical Republican analogy at least set in motion a tradition. The problem was they got cornered themselves in, they'll by their own language because the language they got cornered by was the language of guaranteed rights. If you've guaranteed somebody, uh, beginnings of a quality in law, what else is there to do? If you and I are equal before the law, at least the law says we're equal before the law, what else can government do? But the radical Republicans in reconstruction launched that question into our history. Has No one ever had, would have governments, old people, and what do people, governments, the trouble of course was that on the ground in the south, the Klan and all of its imitators,

Speaker 2:          48:29          okay,

Speaker 1:          48:30          we're winning reconstruction by terror, by political violence, um, by intimidation. Now you've read about the Klan. I've given you a statistics on Klan violence, especially in 1868 up through 1871, but it was the first grant administration and we've got to give grant credit for this. And Henry, Adam should have at least four out of this. When he wrote that godawful passage, the grant administration did act in 1870 and 71 against the claim. May 31st, 1870 it past the so called force act or the first enforcement act. It made it a federal offense to interfere with any person's right to vote and made it punishable in a federal court. That's the very law. The Crook Shank case is going to come along six years later and say, no federal government can enforce that only the state can. It's one of those moments you want to go back into history and just grabbed some people by the collar and say, no, no, no, no. Think of a think one more time, but of course we can't do that. February 28 80 71 second for sac provided a machinery for the federal supervision of registration and voting in the south. They had at least tried and finally they passed what was called the Ku Klux Klan Act. April, 2018 71

Speaker 2:          50:05          okay.

Speaker 1:          50:05          It authorizes the president to use the army and to suspend the writ of Habeas Corpus wherever he deemed necessary. If there was a state of insurrection, which there was in South Carolina and about 12 counties move the army and if necessary to protect the safety and security of elections. Now under this authority of these enforcement acts and the clacks, approximately, uh, 3000 people, mostly white southerners were indicted for Klan violence, murder, intimidation, torture. Thousands were arrested. Many of those 3000 indicted pleaded guilty and got suspended sentences. About 600 were convicted, 250 acquitted, most received fines or light jail sentences. 65 people were in prison for up to five years in a federal penitentiary in Albany, New York. All of them were out by 1875 before the Cruickshank case, the thousands of people murdered by the Klan. The thousands torture, the thousands kept from voting. 65 people were prosecuted. If you think back to the other day, a quotation I asked you to keep in your head on Frederick Douglass gives that speech in 1875 imagining the following year, the bice, the centennial, the US independence, and he worries about all the Hosannas to American patriotism and independence. And he says, if war among the whites

Speaker 1:          51:56          brought freedom to blacks, what will peace among the whites bring? It is a peace among the whites. That was happening by 1875

Speaker 2:          52:13          okay.

Speaker 1:          52:13          On Thursday, we'll move this toward one of the ends of reconstruction.
