Speaker 1:          00:02          Used to be said that in the old wars fought by the Irish clans that they had an agreement. I Dunno if this is true, but I love the idea. Doesn't matter how much they slaughtered themselves with broad swords and knives and whatever else the maniacs used, that they should always spare the poets. Don't kill the poets because the policy had to be left to tell the story. Most great poets don't go to war. They right. This week you're reading a great poet. He all Dr. Rowe,

Speaker 2:          00:43          okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44          A poet and prose, the poet and fiction. Dr. Rowe is some of you must know is a famous American writer for his historical fiction. Much of his fiction is often very historical and you'll find if any one takes the time someday, that large chunks of the monologue you hear from William Tecumseh Sherman and this novel is directly out of his famous memoir. And then every now and then Dr. Rowe will embellish or add a few lines. Most of the people in this book, we're real people, but there are some invented in some ways possibly the most brilliant inventions in this book are the slave characters or the Friedman character and what doctor road does with them through this sort of anguished crucible of all out war look, especially for those journeys into Sherman Zone, mine, Sherman's psyche, those meditations of Sherman's on death page 88 and 89 to be exact is I think an unforgettable meditation by Sherman on the meaning of death and just what it means and why. He in some ways enjoys it. Herman Melville wrote a whole bunch of poems during the civil war. He was one of the poets spared. It wasn't very famous yet. As you know, for Moby Dick that was to come later. Maybe our greatest writer, the 19th century also wrote a lot of poetry and he wrote all, most all of his poetry during the civil war. As did, by the way Emily Dickinson, I don't know if any of your Emily Dickinson fans, but Emily the Belle of Amherst road between 901,000 poems in her life and fully two thirds of them in the four years of the war.

Speaker 1:          02:55          She became obsessed with the idea of the war. And if you read it closely enough, it's all over her wartime poetry. She became obsessed with it.

Speaker 2:          03:06          Death.

Speaker 1:          03:08          Our greatest death poet was of course Whitman.

Speaker 2:          03:12          More from him later,

Speaker 1:          03:15          but one little uh, piece by Melville cause it's about you. This was Melville's meditation and poetry on the death of college students in the war. It's called on the saline collegians. It's timeless. It could be about any war, although collegians don't go to war anymore

Speaker 2:          03:40          very much in America,

Speaker 1:          03:43          youth is the time when hearts are large and stirring wars appeal to the spirit which appeals and turn to the bladed draws. If woman in sight and duty show though made the mask of cane or whether it'd be truth sacred, because who can aloof remain that shares youths ardor uncool by the snow of wisdom or sorted gain wool for the homes of the north and wolf for the seats of the south. All who felt life spring and prime and were swept by the wind of their place in time. I'll lavish hearts on whichever side of birth or Bain or courage, high arm them for the stirring wars, armed them some to die. Apollo like in pride. Each slay his python caught the maxims in his temple, taught the anguish of maternal hearts must search for bone divine, but well the Stripling's bore, they're faded parts. The heaven. All parts must assign, never felt lives, care or cloy. Each bloomed and died and unabated boy nor dreamed what death was thought at mears sliding into some vernal sphere. They knew the joy, but leap the grief like plants, that flower air comes the leaf which storms lay low and kindly doom and kill them and the flush of their balloon.

Speaker 2:          05:21          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:21          The casualties in the union army alone and the army of the Potomac grants army from the 1st of May through the end of July, 1864 and this horrible war of attrition and the stalemate it produced in Virginia. The casualties in that one arm and about two to two and a half months was 66,000 men is the largest loss of life in the shortest period of time and all of American military history.

Speaker 2:          05:54          How did it get to that? Why did

Speaker 1:          05:58          the war go on and on and on? Well, let's begin with grants and Lee. These two great warriors around whose names, symbols, actions, decisions, a good deal of the war would hinge in the past in the final year, grant from his successes in the West fall of Vicksburg and fall of Chattanooga, the victory at Chickamauga came east, appointed by Abraham Lincoln as general of the army. Congress actually revived a special rank that hadn't used in years called lieutenant general and then just for grant, he came, Easton was appointed head of all union armies on any front anywhere in March of 1864 winter 64 he was wined and dined at the White House and wined and dined and congress. They had to keep telling him to put on a decent uniform. There's a lot of truth to this idea of grant that kind of humbled Puglian he had off. They're all been doing nothing but work in his brother's leather shop and Galena, Illinois. When the war broke out.

Speaker 2:          07:21          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          07:21          but boy did he have a nose for war.

Speaker 2:          07:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:26          It was a great horseman. Cantor like nobody else and Gallup like nobody else and he loved his horses. Been to west point. The only thing he really got good grades in a West Point were painting and drawing. He nearly failed some of the military science courses, some of his biographers of act and made a big deal out of that that because he hadn't studied hard and a genre and i's Germany's manuals, those manuals of combat tactics and strategy. Okay. That he was there for a freer to simply invent as he went. I don't know. This war made grant at the same time he made the war.

Speaker 2:          08:11          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:11          He may have been as many of his bar and by the way, there's been an industry of grant biographies in the past 10 to 15 years. He's been rediscovered after a long period in our history when he just vanished and the country forgot that the, oh by the way, the Union won the war and there was that guy grant.

Speaker 2:          08:33          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:33          There are far, far, far more monuments to Robert E. Lee.

Speaker 2:          08:38          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:38          And the American landscape and they're already Ulysses grant. I'll try to explain that. At the end of the course is cash. Tony rates in these, this last year of the war were ghastly and horrible and it nearly led to a sufficient of war weariness across the north and discussed and just an overwhelmed kind of spirit that it was entirely possible by July and August of 64 if certain events hadn't quickly followed, that the north collectively would have given up the war and sued for peace.

Speaker 2:          09:16          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:18          But grant developed essentially a strategy of victory. And here's what it was. He did it in conjunction with William Tecumseh Sherman, Philip Sheridan, uh, the or the of the previous general of the army, Henry Halleck and most importantly with Lincoln himself. And that strategy was basically this. And it was just the first to determine that Richmond, the capitol of the confederacy was not to be the objective of the war in the east, taken an enemy's capital, not that important. Secondly, grant grasped as does Sherman the political character of this war, that this was now war to be won or lost in public opinion because it had become all out because it was now a war upon people upon resources. It depended deeply upon morale. And the will of either side to somehow see it through third grant and Sherman especially determined that this would now be a war on southern resources. The destruction of slavery of course, becomes a major part of that. And one of the great ironies of the wars that Sherman never ever for a day wanted to free a slave as he told his officer, ain't gonna be no niggers and uncle Billy's army, sorry. That's what he said. Uh, he wasn't in to having black soldiers. In fact, there were no black soldiers who actually served in Sherman's army in Georgia. There will be thousands upon thousands of Friedman following his army and it will force him to a situation of a recognition that will it or not, he's crushing the spirit of the south to destroy slavery and ultimately kind of admits it. Look for that in Dr. Rowe

Speaker 1:          11:19          in the east, the object of the war now was to be Lee's army to fight Lee's army anywhere on ground, especially that the northern troops could somehow choose to try to spring Lee out of his trench works that he would build everywhere they would stop. And to simply kill as many confederates as possible, to force the south to quit. It was to be a war on an army, not for a strategic capital, strategic and rivers and so on would be important. The object now was to destroy the fighting force of the south and it's fighting will and in the western part of the war and there were actually five major armies. Now the grant was to try to coordinate and army under Nathanial banks out in the far west. Lincoln wanted to go into Texas with, they never really got into Texas. What grant wanted eventually, excuse me one second. What grant wanted was it the army on her Nathanial banks in Louisiana to move east to take mo bill the last remaining great southern port and then come smashing right through the deep south across Alabama and Georgia as Sherman's army, as we'll see in a minute, was invading northern Georgia toward Atlanta and sort of just invade the whole middle heartland of the south until the south would give up.

Speaker 1:          13:10          And in Virginia, grant took battlefield command. He didn't have to, he could've stayed at a desk in Washington, but it was by, it was quite decidedly not his style. He went into the field as the commander of the army of the Potomac. Now on the other side in Robert E. Lee, the south had without a question, we've said this before and there is so much been written on this, you can't count it all. The south had a great general and Lee, a daring general, even in spite of his tremendous defeated Gettysburg, or actually they did tender his resignation that Davis didn't accept and couldn't accept. Lee was already a legend, is men saw him as almost godlike. He was beautiful. They said he was gorgeous, he was handsome. No one ever looked quite likely in a uniform. Well, that curly white hair. There's a brand new biography out that I recently reviewed by a woman named Elizabeth prior. It's just one the Abraham Lincoln prize. There's another lovely irony book on Lee Warren is the Lincoln Prize. That's reconciliation. It's called reading the man.

Speaker 2:          14:28          Okay.

Speaker 1:          14:29          I was like a title of a porn movie or something, but, sorry, scratch that Jen. But she did the book from Lee's voluminous letters. He was a tremendous letter writer throughout his life. Lifetime officer, Sun of Light Horse, Harry leave the American revolution fame. His father had been a total scoundrel. He had a brother that was an even greater scoundrel. His brother and probably his father fathered children by slave women and abandon their homes, their wives, their families. He came from a very, very difficult sorted but aristocratic famous Virginia family and he went to West Point just like his daddy and he became an officer in his early twenties he spent his twenties his thirties in his forties spread all over the United States, largely as an engineer. He was a great engineer. He helped build the first bridge across the Mississippi. He helped redirect rivers in the lower Mississippi and on and on. He spent probably two thirds of his life up until the civil war, away from home, away from that mansion that sits today and Arlington Cemetery.

Speaker 1:          15:53          Arlington house was Lee's home. He inherited it by marrying into it. He married a Custus. He married into the family of George Washington, extended family of George Washington, and of course it is Lee's own home, Arlington that before the war and ended the United States government confiscated Lee's wife to say the least, never got over this. They confiscated Lee's home and converted it into the largest national cemetery and the country. Did you ever go to Arlington, go to Arlington House, or at least remember that that was founded to bury the thousands and thousands of union dead killed by Lee's army. At any rate, he may have hated war in the abstract, but his biographers have taken us into least psyche and some useful ways. I won't say all of these many biographies, but some of them have really shown us a complicated man of great daring and audacity and aggressiveness. He always wanted to be on the off fences. He hated being entrenched. He hated being on the defensive and he clearly saw war as an emotional or psychological release. Okay. I think a little led, properly taken is good for a man. He said that was in the Mexican war. Then say that during the civil war, surveying the fetal of slaughter at Fredericksburg and December is 62, he said famously, it is well that wars so terrible so that we did not grow too fond of it.

Speaker 1:          17:40          He appeared to um, to, to change in battle. Uh, his eyes would be like fire people said, and English journalist observer in the Battle of the wilderness. So horrible battle fought and dense woods observe this of Lee. No Man who at the terrible moments saw his flashing eyes and sternly set lips is ever likely to forget them. The light of battles still flaming in his eye. And there are lots of people who said that about the debate about Lee's essentially among his story, his Elise is essentially whether he bled the south to death, so to speak, with his aggressiveness is two major invasions of the north and the costs that meant to the confederacy or whether he was the true military genius of American history and only through that offensive daring that the confederacy survive as long as it did or only through his devotion and his maneuverability of huge numbers of men across difficult landscapes. Did the confederacy survive as long as it did through 1864 and his struggle against grants army, which are numbered him at times two to one in 1864 in 1865 but he hated being on the defensive. Now in 1864 I will strike that man a blow in the morning. I will strike that man a blow in the morning. He would say sometimes yes, that night in his camp, even if he wasn't planning to do it.

Speaker 3:          19:17          Now

Speaker 1:          19:19          the campaign of 1864 the pivotal in so many ways, decisive, despite the fact that it becomes a horrible stalemate. The decisive campaign of the civil war in everyone's hopes in the north. The campaign, once again, that would only be one summer, was launched in April and May of 64 but it wasn't going to end that summer. It would end in a horrible stalemate in a siege of the city of Petersburg,

Speaker 1:          19:51          uh, just south of Richmond. And the war of course would not end until the following spring for April's into the war. But here's roughly what happened. And by the way, I refer you here to the Ken Burns film series and there's of course a very good reason it burns, decided in this nine part film series to give to whole parts to the year 1864. I have my own little criticisms of that film series, which I'll be happy to share with you at some point, but I thought it was actually quite brilliant the way he just makes you agonize to get out of 1864. I mean God, how long must 1864 less because that's actually the way the country feel

Speaker 1:          20:37          in the battle of the wilderness. May Five, six 1864 the two armies basically collided just west of, of uh, Fredericksburg in a densely densely wooded area that was known at that time as the wilderness. They essentially just bumped into one another cause there were only two roads and went north, south or east or west through this area. And they fought it out and woods for two days. It was a totally disorganized battle. Often men would only fire at what they saw other weapons firing cause they could really never see their enemies and hence sometimes killed her own men. And the most horrible thing about the wilderness, of course, as you perhaps have heard, is that hundreds if not thousands of wounded and ended up being burned to death in the woods because the woods caught on fire in several places and the wounded could not be retrieved. Soldiers on both sides lay down at night, make shift trench, works along roadways and listened to their comrades, scream as they were burning to death. In the woods and could not save them.

Speaker 3:          21:49          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          21:50          In two days of, uh, of a really thoroughly disorganize slug fest in woods grants, Army lost 18,400 casualties, dead and wounded.

Speaker 1:          22:03          Lee lost about 11,000 dead and wounded and it appeared that Lee had once again for what the fourth time now stopped a union army invading into Virginia and at that union army would probably have to retreat back out of this densely wooded wilderness. Get up north of the Rappahannock, regroup again again, again as the army of the Potomac always had. Yeah. What happened was of course, grant never intended to stop. No matter what happened. He had the obvious advantage of manpower. He had tremendous resources behind him. Although that manpower was risky because of that very summer, the three year lists, they weren't up by May, but they're going to be up in June, the three year enlistments from 61 to 64, the great mass of the army of the Potomac. I've been in those who had survived the veterans, the real soldiers I've been in for three years, and their terms would be up. How in the hell to get these men to re enlist. When they were in during this

Speaker 1:          23:12          and the government came up with three and $400 bounties, they came up with 30 day furloughs, hearing their percentages of regimen sent home to do anything to get these guys to reenlist and Lincoln call for 500,000 more volunteers. I half a million. Now they will actually eventually get almost that half million men, but the problem as the union army, he's realized that summer is that these new soldiers broadened by being paid bounties and all sorts of other things were terrible soldiers and grant counted by July and August. These new recruits that about three of every four became deserters the first time they face combat. So that manpower was not a certain thing. The grant just kept moving and there's the famous story. It's the night of the second day. It's the fifth or 6th of May 64 and you, most of the Union army is camped along a roadway, a north south roadway.

Speaker 1:          24:10          They've just fought the two worst days of the wharf. They've survived, they're depleted. Woods are burning. They expect any moment to all have to retreat north. And there came grant with just a few members of his staff cantering down the road heading south. He didn't stopped to say anything to anybody in him tip his hat, probably spit from his cigar. And as they saw him moving south, they began to realize they weren't retreating. And for about a mile and a half along this roadway, these scarred soldiers started to get up and scream and holler at the top of their loan for grants for granted. They were going south and they did the rest of this terrible campaign would be an attempt by grant now to outmaneuver Lee to try to keep moving left grants left to try to get around Lee's army to move faster than Lee if possible. And ultimately to cut off lease supply line either to Richmond or further south from Richmond and if possible, forget about taken Richmond, but to try to cut off Lee's army from the rest of the south and if possible with Sheridan's army in the Shenandoah valley cut him off from the West.

Speaker 1:          25:39          So when grant gets accused of being a butcher that summer, there's some truth to that, but it really was a war of maneuver, maneuver, maneuver. They collided. They actually, the first attempt was to see who could get first to this crossroads called Spotsylvania courthouse and it Spotsylvania. They fought for about six, seven consecutive days. This was the rehearsal for World War One. Everywhere the army stopped, they dug the deepest possible trenches they could and it's possible date veiny indeed. Lee's army got there just before grants army and they built this incredible trench work that was in new u shape. And for about six days, grant's army just made one frontal assault on this after another. And it produced these horrifying scenes of the dead and wounded three and four deep in these trenches, day after day after day. Most of it fought in rainstorms at Spotsylvania when you add it all up,

Speaker 3:          26:48          okay?

Speaker 1:          26:48          Uh, they first encountered each other and the 8th of May and it didn't really stop fighting there though about the 19th of May, grant's army lost almost 30,000 casualties. Lee's army, almost 20,000 casualties.

Speaker 1:          27:08          And yet grant just kept moving and kept moving left and south, left in south, and then grant the first week of June would make his greatest mistake of the war. And he admitted it is the only place in his great to volume memoir when he used the word regret and he really regretted cold harbor at cold harbor. Grand had misinformation. He somehow did not understand how much of Lee's army had actually concentrated in front of him. And somehow he missed, saw the landscape. He didn't realize that Lee's army on each flank had a river and those rivers were pretty high. It was, you know, may June. And there was no way to flank him. So he just made on the 3rd of June, uh, the largest frontal assault tack of the war, there were 50,000 union troops engaged in this and grants army took 7,000 casualties in a half hour.

Speaker 3:          28:19          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          28:19          And many of them in, and they'd been fighting not day after day after day. And God only knows what fatalist soldiers become in that circumstance. They were asked before the attack had cold Harvard dependent pin their names and home addresses on their shirts. At least much of the Union army was, and they did. They had no dog tags and in that war they were told to pin their names on themselves so they can be identified when dead. And I believe Burns uses this story in the film. It was one union soldier who etched into his diary morning, June 3rd I died today at cold harbor

Speaker 3:          29:01          and he did

Speaker 1:          29:05          this stopped grants movement. It protected Richmond. It meant that the war would now go on and on through that summer rather than attempting anymore assault on Lee's forces, which we're now constantly digging trenches, digging trenches, digging trenches all around the eastern side of Richmond grand kept moving south and this time he got to Petersburg faster than Lee or at least most of Lee's army. And by

Speaker 1:          29:43          mid to late June they put the city of Petersburg, just some 25 miles south of Richmond under siege and Petersburg would be going, you can see many of these great photographs and burns. His film series. Photographers went crazy in 64 and 65 photographing these giant trench works, these trench cities that were built around Petersburg. There would be a quick attempt to break the siege of Petersburg and was known as the battle of the crater. Quick in the sense about a month after grants army concentrated all around the east side on the south side of Petersburg. They were always trying to cut Lee's supply lines off either west or south. Never managed to completely do it until the next spring. But you may know the story of the battle of the crater. Some coal miners in the 48th Pennsylvania went to their colonel who went to his general. I went to general Burnside who went to grant and said, we can dig a tunnel 500 yards under the confederate line and we'll fill it with tons of dynamite and we can do it with ventilation stats. We know how to do these things and I will blow the confederate line to Smithereens. Let us do it. And at first grant and his staff said, no, no, no, no. This is too crazy. They sat down with them, they convinced and they could do it and they did it

Speaker 1:          31:15          500 yards of a tunnel. They ventilated the confederates and the other side and the lines in some areas here, we're never more than 150 to 200 yards apart.

Speaker 3:          31:25          Okay?

Speaker 1:          31:25          Nah, they actually did hear some digging were told later, but they didn't know what the hell it was

Speaker 3:          31:32          and

Speaker 1:          31:33          then they dug a countertrend at the end inside or a tunnel. They put in four tons of dynamite fuses you to this day can see the opening to that tunnel and you can still see the suppression in the landscape where the crater was. And then July 30th, 1864 they blew it up and they blew up an area of the confederate line about 200 yards long, men's bodies were simply exploded into the air. It's the opening scene of cold mountain. If you've seen the movie not bad. One of the best parts of that movie, actually I thought Nicole Kidman was badly cast. I don't know about you. When you're suffering, you haven't got enough to eat and you're laying in the snow. You can't look like Nicole Kidman. I'm sorry, any right. But the problem was the battle of crater became a union disaster.

Speaker 1:          32:34          Instead of exploiting this is they should have and been far, far more organized. They should have managed to get around this crater. Actually, they didn't even understand how big this gigantic hole in the ground would be. A huge hole in the confederate line has been exploded hundreds of yards wide, but union troops started marching into the whole, I'm not kidding, and within an hour or two as confederates regrouped and sheer shock, they said it was just like picking off fish in a bowl and they stood all around this giant hole in the ground and forth. 4,000 Union troops will killed in the battle of the crater, which it turned out to be a union disaster.

Speaker 2:          33:21          Now

Speaker 1:          33:24          out west,

Speaker 2:          33:35          where's Sherman? There he is. Can we see this now?

Speaker 1:          34:02          The other major campaign of the war that of course will ultimately lead to union victory. And I won't get as quite to the dead end of the war today by any means, but it is of course, William Sherman's Atlanta campaign through northern Georgia, fall of Atlanta by September of 64 the campaign lasted all that summer at the same time. The stalemate sets in in Virginia around Petersburg where these thousands of casualties and you must, you must try, if you can imagine, northerners standing and post offices and telegraph offices all over the towns of the Midwest and New England waiting for casualty report and the adjutants of regiments writing the list, standing in a small town post office and the Telegraph comes through with the list of the dead dozen, two dozen, three dozen men from a town that only had a thousand people. It was beginning to destroy northern morale and things weren't that much better and Virgin Georgia. So it seems throughout that summer. Sherman, finally outmaneuvered General Joseph Johnston's confederate army toward Atlanta, one at Kennesaw mountain in two days in June in June, late June of [inaudible] 64 and essentially put Atlanta on under siege in July and August and kept trying to get around around, around, especially to the left to the east and south Atlanta to cut off the supply lines to this biggest city in the heartland of the south.

Speaker 1:          35:51          He finally succeeded at great costs

Speaker 1:          35:56          once when Atlanta fell on the 4th of September in 64 and the fall of Atlanta is in some ways both strategically and in terms of morale, one of the most important little turning points of the war because it has a huge impact on the political situation and the election of 64 about to occur. More on that in a second. It was then that Sherman, based on this strategy of conquest, destruction of resources and war upon people made the decision really quite quickly to launch his march to the sea. It took him a couple of months to organize it, but from November 15th to Christmas Eve, that's about five weeks. Sherman's Army March 285 miles from Atlanta to Savannah with 62,000 troops. They were almost unopposed general John B hoods, confederate army that had surrendered in effect given up Atlanta had retreated south to fight again and hoods idea would actually without Jefferson Davis was approval while the Sherman was going to invade toward the east toward the sea and destroyed Georgia Hood. Took an army of about 30,000 men and invaded backup into Tennessee, hoping the chairman would stop and come after him. Chairman said, let him go.

Speaker 2:          37:28          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          37:30          It was a kind of a game now of time, resources, destruction, who would give up? We are not fighting a hostile army anymore. Sherman said, I'm quoting him, were fighting on hostile people is aim and objective now with the civilian population and Americans had never made war on civilians quite like Sherman would in Georgia. We cannot change the hearts of those people. Sherman wrote of the south, but we can make wars so terrible and make them so sick of war. The generations will pass before they will ever again appeal to it.

Speaker 2:          38:13          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:14          Up in the Shenandoah valley. Philip Sheridan's Union army under similar orders to make war on society, gave a simple order to his officers and most of that arm, it was cavalry. His order was put in the starkest of total war terms. He said, quote leaves them only eyes with which to weep. This was now savage war to win the war with fear was Sherman's goal to win it with destruction and to win it with maneuver. Freed slaves swarmed to behind Sherman's army. He hated it. He didn't want him to be there. He didn't know what to do with them. The hell am I gonna do with these people. First it was five thousand ten thousand fifteen he had 25 to 30,000 refugees, slaves tailing right behind his army. It's about half the size of his whole army. Follow that in. Dr. Rowe Sherman didn't always a play kindness, her niceness with him.

Speaker 2:          39:18          Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:19          At one point, his troops lifted up the pontoon bridge across a river and scores of Friedman trying to get across with them drowned in the river. Sherman's attitude was,

Speaker 2:          39:30          it's where it goes.

Speaker 1:          39:33          They made it by Christmas Eve to Savannah just before that, into Liberty County, just south of Savannah and till this day in Liberty County, Georgia.

Speaker 2:          39:45          Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:45          There are plenty of people around. I have a former student who lives there and runs a historic site who will tell you this is where Sherman turned left. Okay. And you think, well, okay, I'm gonna spend a left turn sign or something. This is where Sherman turn left. I also never forget the time I was doing research and the colon, the Caroliniana collections and the Columbia South Carolina and I don't remember exactly what I asked for and the Arco. It's been a good week there. I don't remember. Oh, I, it was records about the state capitol and the buildings. I want her to know about the ruins and destruction and I asked for this stuff. An archivist who was a woman looked up from the desk admin. She said, don't have it. Sherman burnt it.

Speaker 2:          40:29          Okay, thank you very much.

Speaker 1:          40:32          I won't be able to look at that stuff apparently. Now, if you follow the purple line here, of course you realize that this is the destined, is the route of Sherman's. This is about 280 miles from Atlanta to the sea.

Speaker 2:          40:50          Okay?

Speaker 1:          40:51          It would give us some of the best songs of the war marching through Georgia. It also gave the civil war. It's anti antihero. It's principal villain of union victory. Some say the architect of total war. Oh, that's a little too much for a short delay only on Sherman, but it was now a war of conquest and destruction. He did not destroy Savannah, but when he got to Charleston,

Speaker 2:          41:22          well actually

Speaker 1:          41:24          much of Charleston, he didn't have to destroy because it was being destroyed already by union gunboats and artillery from around the harbor. But the city he did destroy was Columbia. The capital of South Carolina, which was burned to the ground as by the way, was Atlanta. Now, Sherman would always say these were just fires that broke out because of extensive shelling. That was not the case in Columbia. They burned about everything that was standing in Colombia. And then they kept moving north north, North into North Carolina. And I'll come back to that later. Cause the final, final surrender of the civil war of course came in North Carolina. Not In Virginia.

Speaker 2:          42:18          No.

Speaker 1:          42:23          Before we get to app a Maddix, I'm gonna save the CG Petersburg, the lifting of Peter's at the siege and the march two apoe Maddix and the surrender for Thursday. Cause it makes a perfect segue back into wartime reconstruction plans because that, the nature of that surrender at Appomattox is a great deal to do with, uh, the kind of reconstruction ideas and plans that were boiling as early as 1863 really out of congress and from Lincoln himself. And let me just end with this little story I mentioned that Terman, you know, made it to the theater. Havana march part of his troops up to Charleston, took Charleston seed bed of succession and all of that. Uh, although actually Charleston didn't fully fall to union hands until February of 65. It had been bombarded throughout the last eight to nine months, as I said, from union ships and guns all around the harbor.

Speaker 1:          43:30          And if you've ever been to Charleston, that glorious, beautiful colonial city, that Caribbean city as it looks, all those mentions about 15 to 20 blocks up from the harbor, you must imagine it almost completely in ruined by early 1865 all the white people evacuated and abandoned the city and the only people left principally were slaves, Freedman, thousands of them. And they in effect took over the city. The First Union regiment that marched up meeting street in Charleston was a 21st USC tea colored infantry of black regimen and they accepted the surrender of the city from its mayor. And then they began to hold ceremonies. The black folks or Charleston, the beginning hold ceremonies all around the city. They held a parade, um, in late March, or was it early April of 65 they had this huge parade where they had two floats and they had him on one float. They had a little slave auction occurring emoc slave auction with a woman with her baby being sold away. And on the next float they had a coffin labeled slavery and it said Fort Sumpter, Doug, it's grave. April 12th, 1861.

Speaker 1:          44:51          And then they play on one more ceremony. And, and by the way, the war, when it finally finally, finally ended, they held an extraordinary ceremony, a ceremony on Fort Sumpter. Um, they crammed about 3000 people onto the little island. Uh, all kinds of dignitaries came. Now, general Anderson, not the colonel who had surrendered the Ford four years ago, came and raise the u s flag four years, almost to the day he had taken it down. William Lloyd garrison was there from the north, the great abolitionists who wept uncontrollably when he heard us a small black children's choir sing John Brown's body. And the very negative of that ceremony, which was the 14th of April, they held a banquet of a sword in a building that had a roof on it back in Charleston. And that was the very night, of course, that Lincoln was assassinated at Ford's theater in Washington. But the black folks of Charleston had planned one more ceremony.

Speaker 3:          45:57          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          45:57          that's ceremony was a burial ceremony. It turns out that during the last months of the war, the confederate army turn the planters horse track a race course. It was called the Washington race course into an open air cemetery, uh, excuse me, prison. And in that open air prison in the Infield of the horse track about 260 odd union soldiers that died of disease and exposure and they were buried in unmarked graves in a mass grave site out behind the grand Stan of the race track. And by the way, there was no more important and symbolic site and low country planters slave holding life than their race track.

Speaker 3:          46:44          Okay.

Speaker 1:          46:44          All the black folks with Charleston got organized. They knew about all of this. They went to the site, they reentered all the graves, the barrier, the men, they couldn't mark them with names and they didn't have any names and they made them proper graves. And then they built a fence all the way around the cemetery, about a hundred yards long and 50, 60 yards deep. And they whitewash the fence and over an archway. They painted the inscription martyrs of the race course and then on May 1st, 1865 they held a parade of 10,000 people on the race track, led by 3000 black children carrying arm loads of and singing John Brown's body followed then by black women. Then by black men. It was regimented this way. Then by contingents of union infantry, everybody marched all the way around the race track as many as could fit gut into the grave site. Five black preachers read from scripture, a children's choir sang the national anthem of America, the beautiful and several spirituals

Speaker 1:          47:56          and then they broke from that and went back into the infield of the race track and did essentially what you and I do on Memorial Day. They ran races. They listened to 16 speeches by one count and the troops marched back and forth and they held picnics. This was the first Memorial Day African Americans invented Memorial Day in Charleston, South Carolina. There are three or four cities in the United States and north and south. The claim to be the site of the first Memorial Day, but they all claim 1866 they were too late. I had the great blind, good fortune just to discover this story in a messy totally disorganized collection of veterans papers at the Houghton Library at Harvard some years back and once you have there is black Americans recently freed from slavery announcing to the world where their flowers and their feet and their songs, what the war had been about. What they basically were creating was the independence day of a second American revolution. That story got lost. Hey, got lost for more than a century and one I discovered it. I started calling people in Charleston that I knew in archives and libraries, including the Avery Institute, the Black Research Center in Charleston. He does anybody, do you have? You've ever heard of this story? And no one had ever heard it.

Speaker 1:          49:38          It showed the power of the lost cause in the wake of the war to a race, a story, but I started looking for other sources and Lo and behold, there were lots of sources. Harper's weekly even had a drawing of the cemetery in an 1867 issue.

Speaker 1:          49:58          The old oval of that race track is still there today. If you ever go to Charleston and go up to Hampton Park, Hampton Park is today what the race course was then, its name for Wade Hampton, the white supremacists, Redeemer Governor of South Carolina at the end of reconstruction and a confederate general during the civil war, and that park sits immediately adjacent to the citadel, the Military Academy of Charleston, and any given day you can see at any given time about a hundred or 200 citadel jogging on the track of the old race course. There is no marker. There's no memento is only a little bit of a memory. Although a few years ago a friend of mine in Charleston organized a mock ceremony where we reenacted that event including the children's choir and they made me dress up in a top hat and a funny old 19th century suit and made me get up on a podium and make a stupid speech. Yeah, but there is an effort, at least today, yeah. To declare a Hampton Park, a national historic landmark. See you Thursday.
