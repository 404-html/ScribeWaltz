Speaker 1:          00:14          There was trouble in the air. I left you the other day with Henry Clay, sloshing down some brand in a late night and mid January, 1850 to try to come up with ways of solving the great political challenges they faced between the sections and over the expansion of slavery. They were doing this in great part because gold had been discovered in California. This is an original photograph of panners gold miners, white, Asian, and who knows probably somebody mixed black.

Speaker 1:          00:59          If California wasn't ready for statehood in 1850 it's possible that wouldn't have needed to be a compromise of 1850 but it was an already and its inception. People realized how big California was and they already realize north and south that part of it was north of the Missouri compromise line and part of it was south. Would that vast territory of California become a free state or a slave state? The south greatest spokesman. It's intellectual leader of its state sovereignty and states' rights position delivered what became known quickly that year as the southern address and in in Calhoun said many things warning the country what the south might do or at least the deep south might do, but he captured it in this ending of the speech. If you, and he's pointing to northerners who represent a stronger portion, cannot agree to settle on the broad principle of justice and duty.

Speaker 1:          02:04          Say so and let the states we both represent agreed to separate and pardon piece. If you are unwilling we should part piece tell us so and we shall not and we still know what to do. When you reduce the question to submission or resistance. If you remain silent you will compel us to infer by your acts what you intend. In that case, California will become the test question. If you admit her under all the difficulties that oppose her admission, you compel us to infer that you intend to exclude us from the whole of the acquired territories of the west with the intention of destroying irretrievably the equilibrium between the two sections and one of the oldest ideas in our political culture is the great conflict comes when there's an issue around which two sides. Let's assume there too. Sometimes they're more than two, but if there are two sides on a great issue of conflict, one, one side or the other cannot accept the result. When a vital interest is somehow it's stake that they will not or cannot or choose not to accept a political outcome. That's the question and the 1850s can compromise some kind of coalition and consensus around this question of slavery is future future in the west future in the American political culture, future within the constitution can some kind of center hold.

Speaker 1:          04:04          Now, clay invited down there, Webster to deal with this cause Webster's happens to the most at that point in time down, your Webster was the most famous northern Whig politician. He was from abolitionist, Massachusetts. He was antislavery. They'll never a card carrying abolitionists to say the least. He was a great lawyer. Many said the greatest order in the United States. Those were usually the ones that hadn't heard Frederick Douglass yet. He'd been in Congress since 1823 almost as long as clay. He'd been in the Senate since 1844 he was seen in some ways is the lion and the spokesman of New England.

Speaker 1:          04:47          He had been the great voice and the nullification crisis debates of 1830 he had been a voice of union, but also law enforcement. Then, that famous phrase that did, he had become known for liberty in union now and forever one and separable. Webster always seem to be the union man. At the same time. He was an anti slavery man. Henry Clay from Kentucky, founder of the Whig Party candidate for president three and four times over the organizational genius in some ways behind the Whig party and it's so called national system. The idea of using government for economic and social change in the lives of immigrants and everybody else. Clay of Kentucky slave holder, he owned about 60 people, hemp plantation farmer, original founder of the American colonization society, a border state, political titan with great influence in the congress.

Speaker 2:          06:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:06          Polls in Webster and says web to were Daniel. We've got to save the Union cause liquid Calhoun and company in the deep south or threatening. What will we do? How will we solve this? I mentioned the other day that when clay introduced his five measures, which were known first is the claim measures and then as the compromise measures, he stood up in the Senate with great theater and held a piece of what he said with George was George Washington's coffin. What were the issues in 1850? Uh, I hope you've seen enough of the outline. If not, it's gone for the moment. The issues that are on the map, I think I need to, no, they told me that makes it better. Okay. That's better. I guess the issues are the California and the West is ready for statehood overnight because of that vast migration of minors by sea, by land and by imagination. It always been a brewing issue in the u s congress and in the district of Columbia about the fact that the district of Columbia, the Capitol of the United States, was a slave trading center. Northern Congressmen of all stripes had always been bothered by the fact that about two and a half blocks down the street from the United States capitol was a huge slave jail.

Speaker 1:          07:46          People said that when the wind was right, you could smell it on the steps of the capitol. Abraham Lincoln and his one term in the house, call it a human livery stable. Foreign visitors would come and they would say, they would stand in awe at that majestic capital as it was being built in. The Dome was being completed and then they would ask, where's the slave jail? Can we see a slave jail? So there were a lot of northerners. Now we're saying, okay, this is gonna be some big compromise now about California, but slavery in the West. What we're gonna do about this. Let's deal with this question too.

Speaker 2:          08:27          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:28          Thirdly, there was the question of, and this is what southerners were exorcized about a fugitive slaves escaping into the north. And that's so cold underground railroad and the term underground railroad appears for the first time openly over and over in public debate on the floor of the u s congress, southern standing up and saying, we need a, a much stronger federal fugitive slave act requiring the return of fugitive slaves because they are escaping too much in that underground railroad. They didn't have a clue what it really was,

Speaker 2:          09:05          didn't matter.

Speaker 1:          09:09          But southerners wanted fugitive slaves, retrieved to them by law under federal enforcement, no questions asked. And then there was the problem of Texas. Now,

Speaker 1:          09:22          uh, it doesn't quite show it on this map properly, but, uh, the other day you remember the map of Texas, the boundaries of Texas had never been determined to the Mexicans, much less to the Americans. And the idea here now was to how, how would you kind of divide up Texas? There was no New Mexico or Arizona yet. It's just this vast territory called the New Mexico territory. The idea was if you moved back the border of Texas about three or 400 miles and you placed it where it actually is today, you would open up new territory. Lots of it to the establishment of at least one new if not two new. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          10:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:06          And those states in the southern imagination would in all likelihood be slave states. They were southern more to do with the Texas boundary.

Speaker 2:          10:19          Now,

Speaker 1:          10:21          Daniel Webster supportive. This came at some price. It came at a huge price for his own career. The five measures that came out of their discussions, they weren't alone, but they really did conceive of this. The five parts of the compromise of 1850

Speaker 2:          10:38          okay,

Speaker 1:          10:39          we'll be on your citizenship test. You shouldn't have US citizenship if you can't name the five parts of the compromise of 1850 I've always believed that. And the three parts of the Kansas, Nebraska, that should be a test of citizenship. No Lithuanian should ever get us citizenship without being able to name the five parts of the compromise of 1850 nevermind. California would be admitted as a free state. Clay said, there's no way around this. If they hold a referendum in California, it's going to be a free state. The people who have gone there are all, you know, they're all little people. They're all these, you know, these miners and these panners there. They're immigrants. They're people from Germany who have come across the see all in one year to go find a Golden California. They're not going to be slave holders.

Speaker 2:          11:25          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:25          All right. California will be admitted as a free state, but now remember what Calhoun had said, so what are you going to give the south?

Speaker 2:          11:33          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          11:34          and return. The South is going to get a whole new, much stronger federal, fugitive slave act. The most notorious and controversial aspect of the compromise of 1850 secondly, clay said, Webster, let's abolish the slave. In the district of Columbia, we have, we have federal jurisdiction over that. The congress has jurisdiction over the district. Let's abolish the slave trade. Let's get this slave jails out of Washington. Northern has all like that rubs. Just said, yeah, let's move the boundary back three, 400 miles. It was really about 350 miles. Let's open up a whole new part of the Mexican cession to the possible establishment of new slave states. Let's let southerners dream of two and three more states and four to six more US senators in the next three to five years. Let's let them feel secure that California may come in as a free state and get two new senators and the number will now be 16 to 15 free to slave states. People were counting, but the idea was, yeah, but maybe the south gets two or three other Mexicans session. And then lastly, how would slavery be determined in that southwest the big issue? How do you do it? By what principle?

Speaker 1:          13:02          Probably said popular sovereignty. Let the people have a referendum and vote liberal democracy. So that statehood for any territory and the Mexican cession, uh, except for California here, this is the stuff of compromise. Don't look for hard principles here except for California. Everything else in the Mexican session will be determined on popular sovereignty. The people who settled the territory at some stage of the territory of process could be, or it could be late, we'll vote whether slavery shall exist, so I'll look at the five measured. California will be a free state slave trade trade, not slavery itself will be abolished in the district of Columbia. Two issues. The North Wall like

Speaker 2:          14:01          okay,

Speaker 1:          14:01          the Texas bound removed back open to new territory. New possible southern states.

Speaker 2:          14:06          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          14:07          and that fugitive slave act two, two measures. Southerners would really like, and by the way, when clay suggestion of the fugitive slave act to Webster, Webster says, no, no, no, I can't take that home to Massachusetts at won't fly. You can't do that. Clay said you have to do that. We'll have just said, I can't do that. Clay said you have to do that. Have some more branding. Webster said, okay, I don't know how much brand do they drink and popular sovereignty is of course it's American democracy. Let them vote. It's, it's an appeal to both sides, two for each side and one for everybody. It is a great compromise in sense, but how has it actually passed is crucial. Of course, it's substance is crucial the way it was. Finally, path is the [inaudible], and by the way, there was no certainty whatsoever that this would work. After clay initiated the debate with an emotional appeal for union, Daniel Webster spoken what became known in his career and in American history is the 7th of March speech. He held forth for three hours and one of his classic Philippics. It began with the famous lines I wish to speak today, not as a Massachusetts man, Norris and northern man, but as an American. I speak today for the preservation of the union. Any appeal to his fellow northerners, the vote for the fugitive slave to vote to make northern states legally complicit in the return of fugitive slaves in their neighborhoods.

Speaker 1:          15:58          He got groans and he got jeers and he got cheers. Everybody said one of the greatest speeches ever made in the u s senate and it ruined Webster's career.

Speaker 1:          16:10          Poets started writing about as Whittier did the devil and Daniel Webster. Calhoun was unable to deliver. His speech was the 4th of March. Uh, he was too sick. He will be dead by the fall. It was delivered by James Mason. His colleague Calhoun was carried into the u s Senate in a chair. He couldn't walk. They literally carried him in, sat him down. He stared at his shoes on. Mason delivered his speech in which Calhoun said that the south had to stand now as one for a slave society and for states' rights and for the protection of what he constantly argued were minority rights.

Speaker 2:          17:04          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:05          Calhoun's speech, arguably, I think from an interpretive mode now, frightened, frightened, especially some northern into voting for a compromise they hated it. May have even frightened some border state Democrats and wigs to vote for this thing, some of which they hated, like any great compromise them. And you've ever been on major political committees, dorm committees and so on. You got to pass something, but you got two or three things on the, on the bill, and are these people who hate number, item number one, and these people eight. Item number two and these people, eight. Item. Number three, what happens if you vote on all three at the same time? Everybody's got something to vote against. So the way the compromise of 1850 was passed and it was passed largely by the young Steven, a Douglas who took over the management. He's about 38 years old at this point. Senator from Illinois, uh, young Titan, small as he was five foot six, a young tighten over the Democratic Party from Illinois. He was really the parliamentary manager in the midst of the debates from March into the summer of 1850. There were threats of disunion from southerners every other day, brave threats and newt assistant, southern newspapers.

Speaker 1:          18:40          So a Douglas dead is a classic parliamentary maneuver. He voted on each bill separately and ultimately called it the omnibus bill. And in each case, manage just enough of a narrow majority, getting enough northerners, especially northern Democrats, to vote for that fugitive slave act, which they tended to hate. And then Justin enough southern, what's left of the wigs to vote for the end of the slave trade and the district of Columbia. And it passed in early August, 1850 Henry Clay ill, terminally sick, had gone home to Kentucky, maybe out of the picture and out of American history before the end of the year. Calhoun was dying at that very moment was dead, I believe by September Webster was now to be denounced politically forever and his own political party and in his own Massachusetts, but the compromise past and in some ways the nation celebrated or so it's seen the compromise of 1850 did in some ways save the union, at least at that point in time.

Speaker 1:          20:06          But as David Potter, the, the bestest story into this we've ever had said it was far more, and it's the best way to remember it. I think it was far more in armistice than it really was a compromise. It began to collapse almost as fast as it passed. There were huge rallies and marches in northern cities celebrating the saving of the Union. People were frightened, I mean business interests in the north, not just in New York City where the banks all were, but now in this colossus of Chicago, this burgeoning railroad center in the West. And Cincinnati, Detroit worried. I mean, what if there is disunion what happens to the economy? What happens to, to trade? So there were a great rallies at the same time, state of Georgia minutes legislature by December, 1850 and passed what they called the Georgia platform and send it all around the rest of the deep south. And it said, it said the state of Georgia gave only it's conditional acceptance to the compromise measures waiting to see whether the north acted in good faith. In other words, we don't trust you. Some northern state legislature said, Oh really? And they passed a resolution saying we don't think we trust you either.

Speaker 2:          21:28          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          21:33          There were vehement protest against the fugitive slave act. The fugitive slave act above all else in this crisis caused much further conflict. It led directly to an estimated 20,000 African American free blacks. Well free blacks and fugitive slaves. So many of them living in the northern states and in some cases whole church congregations from cities like Philadelphia and Boston moved north of the border into Canada between 1850 and roughly a 1857 58

Speaker 2:          22:14          yeah.

Speaker 1:          22:14          When there was another small wave after the dred Scott decision,

Speaker 1:          22:19          this will lead to the establishment and that fugitive slave act of special federal magistrates whose job the whose sole job it was. Now this is a whole new level of, of, of federal adjudication of fugitive slaves. Magistrates were now appointed to go all over the north to retrieve fugitive slaves. Well, just set up a police apparatus to retrieve fugitive slaves and then the conduct courts to determine their identity. And in the fugitive slave act itself, it determined, or it's said that those magistrates would be paid twice as much money. They actually would be paid $10 for every fugitive slave they convicted of being that person and sent them back to slavery. And $5 for every acquittal. No, no, $5 doesn't seem like much. But on the cert on the face of that, and you look at that and you ain't no wait a second, this is blind justice. You're going to give me twice as much money to convict you as a [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          23:22          Hey,

Speaker 1:          23:24          I need a meal too.

Speaker 1:          23:29          It led now to famous fugitive slave rescues like the rescue of Jerry Mchenry in Syracuse, New York in 1851 and a violent rescue by abolitionists to spirit who killed one of his captors and carted him off to Canada. It led to the rescue of Shadrack minkins in early 1852 in Boston, a fugitive slave from Virginia who was working in an abolitionist coffeehouse in Boston, retrieved by slave catchers, taken to a jail, broken out of that jail. One of the jailers murdered on the spot by a mob of abolition is led by Louis Hayden himself, a fugitive slave from Kentucky who lived in Beacon Hill in Boston and dared federal magistrates to come to his house and try to retrieve Strad rec minkins by putting an entire posse on the street and a keg of gunpowder in front of his door, which he threatened. He would blow up if any magistrate garden near it.

Speaker 1:          24:24          And that night they spirited shed Rakoff to Concord, Massachusetts, where the descendants of abolitionists to this day like to argue which hosts he stayed in and then off cross route to cross northern Massachusetts and on up into Canada where shed rec remained the rest of his life as a grocer in Montreal and there were many, many other fugitive slave rescues. Now, there was the fugitive slave rescue at Christiana, Pennsylvania in 1851 it was really at a farm, a slave holder named Gorsuch, and a posse of only five or six men cornered a group of his former slaves. Four of them in a barn group of abolitionists. Black and white defended them in a gun bottle in a gun battle. One of the Gorsuch, his sons was killed. The future, the slaves escaped. They ended up going across upstate New York. Two of them ended up in Frederick Douglass, his house in Rochester, New York. Douglas drove them personally in a carriage to the wharf on Lake Erie and when he bid them goodbye, one of them gave him the revolver that he had used it. Christiana, I'm a Mento. The Douglas kept the rest of his life.

Speaker 1:          25:45          Resistance to slavery was now direct, sometimes violent. The underground railroad had been filming over ground railroad. It was no longer caught up in the romance of a whole lot of people spiriting people to secret hideaways. It was sometimes now a matter of gun violence and one could argue that the most important thing that happened in the wake of the fugitive slave act and therefore the compromise of 1850 was the publication of uncle Tom's cabin, Harriet Beecher Stowe, that brilliant, very short little woman would live for quite a while with her husband Calvin stoves, a theologian teaching in Cincinnati and lived in a house on a hill in Cincinnati for several years where she first met slave women, where she first met fugitive slaves coming through Cincinnati may have hit a few, heard their voices, tried to learn their dialect, and wrote the greatest novel of the 19th century and still on any list, any shortlist of the best selling works of literature and the history of the world. That sugarcoated antislavery story of several characters. Eliza young allies, a light skinned where their babies gaping across the Ohio jumping from iceberg, the iceberg iceberg. They, Ohio doesn't have icebergs anymore. Didn't have any of that either.

Speaker 2:          27:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          27:19          Our uncle Tom Himself, the most important Christ like figure in all of American literature. Harriet Stowe wrote a brilliant book, whatever I want and anyone wants to say about it, she made everybody complicit in complicit as in the slave story. The most despicable character in the book is Miso Phelia who was born in Vermont, who's racist to the core, who can't stand black people and goes down south preaching at southerners. What's wrong with slavery? At the same time, just can't get near black people. And in some ways, the most admirable character in that book was a southern slaveholder and actually the most evil character, the most heinous characters, missile field yet, but the most evil character. Of course, it's Simon legree and Simon legree was himself from New England. The whole world was suddenly reading a work of fiction about slavery. It's so 300,000 copies in the first year by far broke every sales record of any book ever published, ever anywhere reprinted into at least to 20 languages. And its first five years of existence made into stage plays within two years.

Speaker 2:          28:41          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:42          It brought an awareness to the slavery problem as never before. And then the election, the congressional off year elections of 1852 four every four votes for every four votes cast for Franklin Pierce, the Democrat who will win one copy of uncle Tom's cabin sold somewhere in the United States. I mean name a book today that we could even imagine doing that. What did they are worth? A novel that are electric was electrified by in some way

Speaker 2:          29:32          now

Speaker 1:          29:36          in the wake of the Kansas and excuse me, in the wake of the compromise of 1850 the country now though had to face this question, not just what'd you going to do with the Mexican cession territory's. That's going to take a little while. Northerners, a lot of northerners are pissed off about the nature of the Utah Territory Bill and in New Mexico territory bill. Cause there are southerners immediately propose a slave territories for Utah and New Mexico. But the real question by 1853 and early 854 was all the territory that was left of the Louisiana purchase, the Kansas and Nebraska territories, which is simply what they were at that point in time. Now it is worth stopping for a moment to realize that not every American woke up in 1850150250 three you're worried every moment of every day about the expansion of slavery. They are worried about it. And it proves to us without question that there was a political crisis, a brewing that the electric cared about.

Speaker 2:          30:49          Okay?

Speaker 1:          30:50          But it's worth remembering that a lot of Americans were preoccupied with the same things. They always work. Price of wheat, a sick cow, wages at a textile mill, a son who wants to marry him, needs land. A daughter wants to marry an Irishman or, uh, most of all, all those Catholics arriving in New York City and Philadelphia, huge numbers of Irish Catholics. They're going to Catholicized America. They're going to turn every, every small outhouse into a confessional. We laugh today. It's easy to laugh at this, but nativism caught hold in the early 1850s more on this a bit later. Um, with the breakup of the American party system as we take it through the 1850s but a lot of Americans were really worried about those Catholics, but the Kansas Nebraska Act or the establishment now of the territory's of Kansas and Nebraska and what to do with them was front and center on the agenda of the United States Congress by late 1853 in the wake now of numerous of these celebrated violent rescues of fugitive slaves. The attempts to enforce the fugitive slave act in some parts of the north where it was very successfully prosecuted and dozens and dozens and dozens of fugitive slaves were returned to the south. But in some celebrated cases, they weren't

Speaker 2:          32:32          quickly.

Speaker 1:          32:33          The most celebrated case of all came in the spring of 1854 at the time, Congress is debating this thing called the Kansas Nebraska act and people are politically waiting with bated breath and if I find out what are they actually going to do here?

Speaker 1:          32:50          We had the rescue in Boston have a fugitive slaves name. Anthony Burns, who was a young guy in his early twenties he had escaped out of Virginia, Boston by sea. He too was working in a actually a store at one point a coffee shop. At another point he was even distributing copies of William Lord Garrison's liberate her and been there even a year and a slave catchers found him, captured it. Now after Shad Rec minkins got out of Boston in 1852 the Anthony Burns rendition case capture the imagination of the nation because Franklin Pierce, president of the United States move federal troops about 3000 of them into the streets of Boston to guard the courthouse and the guard the jail and make sure nobody broke Anthony Burns out. It became a test case for the Democratic Party of Massachusetts. Yes, and on the day Anthony Burns was marched. He was convicted, marched from the jail down to the wharf and put on the ship back to slavery in Virginia, the abolitionists community, black and white of Boston and all of Massachusetts gathered in Boston. They held an all night vigil with candle light, but outside of the jail and they drape the streets of Boston or some of the streets and black crepe in the morning.

Speaker 1:          34:17          Burns was sent back to Virginia. It's his story is amazing though. Is owner then sold him. It was to a famous sold in the North Carolina and one day a white woman in North Carolina wrote a letter to her sister in Amherst, Massachusetts and said, Helen, that slave name Burns that they captured up in Boston. He's living on the farm next door. Isn't that interesting? And her sister wrote from the first Baptist Church of mammary, Massachusetts back to her sister and said, really, um, what if we could raise some money to purchase him? Would you talk to your neighbor? She talked to her neighbors. One thing led to another abolition is beginning in Amherst, Massachusetts. And then around the state of Massachusetts raise the money, made the offer and Anthony Burns freedom was sold. And you came north by 1856 he first arrived in Amherst, Massachusetts where he was celebrated. They took him out on the road, exhibit a and he went to Canada and he died in 1860 prematurely of disease. Lonely, lost, almost unknown.

Speaker 1:          35:43          But it was in that environment. Now that the congress has to decide what to do with Kansas and Nebraska now, here was the situation. It was in part a big deal because what was firing the American imagination now was not just to the west, but it was the railroad west. Who would build these railroads? Where would they be built and where would this eastern terminus be? Would there eastern terminus of the transcontinental railroad being a North Chicago or maybe St Louis in a slave state, or maybe further south in New Orleans, or maybe Memphis. Maybe there'd be two of them. Maybe we can have a compromised transcontinental railroad bill. Two of them. Well then people said, no way. I was gonna be hard enough to build one of them over those mountains.

Speaker 2:          36:33          Okay.

Speaker 1:          36:33          The chairman of the Senate territory's committee, very powerful position in these years was Stephen Douglas. He's not about 40 years old, 1954 a political genius with a few terrible flows. Douglas, one of the terminus of the transcontinental railroad to be in Illinois, in Chicago, and to go across the north to the North West in the northern California.

Speaker 1:          37:09          Douglas is approach to slavery though is terribly important here it is in some ways all of the story. Stephen Douglas believes that the climate would solve the problems of slavery. He's famous for all these speeches he would make where he would say, you know, often soil is good and the temperatures are right and then slavery will probably exist or the soil is not proper and the temperatures aren't right. Or if you've got mountains, slavery won't exist, climate will solve the problem and wouldn't that be great? And we did. We'll just lift them. All of our great political troubles with just lifted off our shoulders by the weather. Just watch the weather channel the hell with MSNBC and CNN, all those blabbering pundits just watch the weather channel.

Speaker 1:          38:01          He really believed that don't have, you know, there was some reason to believe that no problem was southern is one, one thing out of this and a lot of northerners one another thing, but here was the question, which principle will you apply about slavery in the Kansas and Nebraska territory? Think now the recent past, think of the distant past in American terms to the compromise of 1851 had the compromise of 1850 already superseded the Missouri compromise. Think about that. You had that sacred bargain. They said of the 36 30 parallel line dividing free territory from slave territory forever pass back in 1820 that was that vow that the northerners concerned about the expansion of slavery could always assume the great northwest would be free of slavery, but cal, half of California is below it, below it and half of it's above. It had the compromise of 18 and half. The Mexican session is above it and now you said popular sovereignty will determine the Utah territory and not the Missouri compromise. So which rule is in play?

Speaker 2:          39:22          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          39:23          Which principle do you apply? Do you apply? The oldest principal of the northwest ordinance of 1787 the northwest ordinance folks had said slavery shall never exist in the northwest territory, which became those five states of Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin will never exist. Explicit territorial exclusion. That's one principle. Second principle, geographical division, Missouri compromise. Draw a line across the continent. Do you go back to that one or do you use the third one now? The third one that's employee popular sovereignty. Just let the people choose. Forget geography. Forget old laws and have a referendum. In other words, and this, this is the great question of the 1850s and the terrible tragedy that in the end nothing worked. Would the American pragmatic tradition now, yeah, we got this. We got principal ab and C here. We all want principled politicians. Don't we want principal professors and principal politicians, principled stock brokers? At the end of the day. Sometimes the three principles in play, what American pragmatism continue to solve. This one, well maybe that principle is best now, but that principal is better than Douglas wrote, the bill, the Kansas, Nebraska bill as it was called

Speaker 2:          40:58          or act. Now, um,

Speaker 1:          41:11          in this case, folks, numbers matter. We're going to look at a vote, but first of all, he wrote three different versions of the Kansas Nebraska Act. This is important. He went from Vegas to most specific because southerners put his feet to the fire and made him do it. He first introduced a bill in December, 1853 this is for the establishment of Kansas and Nebraska territory. Everybody said that's nice. Was that was doing this to the, you know, there's millions of acres and square miles, but it's slavery going to exist. The first version that he put before Congress in January four 1854 said that a state shall be admitted from those territories, quotes with or without slavery as their constitution may prescribe at the time of admission. Note the vagueness and you all know the new politics. Sometimes the Vagaro you are, the more you get done. Slavery, widow without slavery as their constitution may prescribe at the time of their admission. How that's to be done was not mentioned. Douglas said, leave it to time. Climate and good sense. It was silent about the old Missouri compromise line. Southerners quickly reacting and said, Steven, his own fellow Democrats in the south that were now dominant in the south said, nope, not enough. And there were a lot of powerful southerners in the Senate.

Speaker 1:          42:50          So he drafted six days later, January 10 of 50 for a second version of the Kansas Nebraska Act, and he, he gave a direct statement of popular sovereignty quote, the decision on slavery shall be left to the people residing there in. Now he's moved one step further, so there's going to be a vote out there and how are they vote? That'll determine again, his fellow southerner said, no, not enough. And there was a famous episode where as a kind of spokesman for the southern point of view, a Kentucky wig from the other party name Archibald Dixon took Steven Douglas for a ride in a carriage one day in March of 1854 after these, these uh, excuse me, uh, in late January, they are going to vote on it later in March, but in late January it took her a carriage ride and Dixon and no uncertain terms told Douglas No, no. What'd you have to do is you have to draft an explicit repeal of the Missouri compromise line, a specific repeal of any geographic division between slavery and freedom in the West. In other words, Steven, you'd have to open up the entire west to the possible expansion of slavery.

Speaker 1:          44:22          Douglas didn't want to do that. He knew this was going to cause a bad time in the north and he is alleged to have said back to Dixon quote by God, sir, you are right. I will incorporate it in my bill though. I know it will raise a hell of a storm. And he was right. It may seem a bit odd to us today that Americans could care this much about what was to be done to Nebraska or for that matter with Kansas. We didn't even know about Dorothy yet and the yellow brick road, but no other than it was really did care visit. Think back again to this idea of Free Labor radiology and we'll bring this up again and again and the next three lectures. The American dream to the average northerner immigrant or not was land free land of possible cheap land if not a place to move to mobility where you would never have to compete with any kind of oligarchy that could control that land.

Speaker 1:          45:39          The bill that he finally brought forth and that actually passed had two measures and I'm going to leave you here. The two measures were they explicit repeal of the Missouri compromise line and the principle of popular sovereignty. The formula for the settlement of Kansas and Nebraska. The Kansas Nebraska Act is arguably the pivotal event politically of the 1850s that will now sectionalize American politics break apart forever. The Whig party, what was left of it, and give birth to the first successful third party coalition movement in American history. The Republican Party immediately, which comes into existence immediately in the wake of the Kansas Nebraska Act. And if you want to understand how sectional that vote was right down that vote, count in the house. No Northern Democrats, but right in half. That's Douglas as party, but nearly half of his own party in the House voted against this bill. Southern Democrats 57 to two I can't explain those two.

Speaker 1:          46:52          I don't know what happened to them. Northern Whigs 45 to zero against this. This is a polarization folks. We've heard a lot about that recently. Southern wigs 12 to seven the Whig party is diminishing. It's all, but it will be dead in the wake of Kansas, Nebraska, and the four free soilers elected in 1852 now our platform that oppose the fugitive slave act voted of course against Kansas, Nebraska, that vote 113 to 10 got the Kansas Nebraska Act passed, but in the long run with terrible results, it will break apart the American political party system. It will bring about for the first time, a genuine antislavery political coalition that will elect a president within six years. See you on Thursday.
