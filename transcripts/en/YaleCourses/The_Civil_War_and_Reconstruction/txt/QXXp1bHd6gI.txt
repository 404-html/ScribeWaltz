Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. There's an outline up here. I'm going to try to write a little bigger from now on and it's been already suggested. I use capital letters and maybe practice my printing a little better. I will do that too. I'm not very high tech. I will occasionally use some visuals slides here and there, a painting here and there, an image now and then and certainly maps, especially in dealing with the 1850s in the coming of the civil war. But every lecture we'll have an outline in front of you and the intention in every case is to get to the fifth part of that outline. I almost always do almost, uh, but at least you'll have a, a sense of the structure of the topics or the themes that this lecture is supposed to work. It's way through. I do welcome your questions. I'll ask at times if you have any questions.

Speaker 1:          00:58          This is obviously a terribly formal situation. Me Up here on this stage and you out there looking into your laptops in some cases, uh, doing whatever you're doing on your laptops. Just don't do what one student did a year ago though. He was right back there and that, uh, that I always, like halfway back, he came in, it was the day I was lecturing on the dred Scott decision for some reason I've never forgotten that. And you whipped out the Yale Daily News and he just was enjoying the Yale Daily News. I know it was that much to read in it for that long at the time, but he's just reading the Yale Daily News in front of them. And at one point I stopped rather loudly and I said, the dred Scott decision is not covered in today's Yale Daily News and you didn't hear me. So I shouted it again. And by that time, the whole class has meaning to laugh or uncomfortably. And he finally realized it was going on tour, got crumbled up his newspaper and walked out the back and he never came back. I felt a little badly about it, but just don't make it so obvious. All right. Um, does everybody have a syllabus? Anyone lacking a syllabus? Everyone's got a copy. Uh, we may need some more in the balcony. People need needs, bye. They're hiding up there. Which uh, David, do you have any extras or, oh, okay. No, it's why none left. Okay. We'll have more on Thursday and I should put it on the web.

Speaker 2:          02:53          Dom,

Speaker 1:          02:57          I will put it up this afternoon. We'll get it up on the web, uh, through the registrar's site or however. Um, Teddy, I'm going to take up the topic primarily of why the American civil war period has had, still has such a hold on the American and for that matter, international historical imagination. That's what I want to talk about primarily, but I want to say a word or two about the structure of the course and what you need to do as quickly as possible. First of all, every lecture, if you look at the syllabus, has a topic, a title of a kind. I will not get behind spite of what it may feel like. The readings are listed each week we are using, among other things, there's a combination of readings. In fact, a rich combination of historical monograph, historical kind of syntheses two works of fiction to novels worn by the Louisa.

Speaker 1:          04:18          May Alcott, a famous short, um, classic little book called Hospitals Sketches, which was based on Alcotts personal experience as a nurse in civil war hospitals and experienced that all bit overwhelmed her emotionally, psychologically, and she in some ways could not stop thinking about it. Uh, we also are reading using to readers that is collections of documents. One is a collection of documents by mostly by and somewhat about Abraham Lincoln, a reader edited by Michael Johnson. There's Nicole Ivy entering as we speak, the eighth teaching assistant. Sorry Nicole. We just did intros. Um, anyway, one of the readers is, is Lincoln the great speeches, the great public letters. We won't use every document in the book, but the Great Lincoln stuff is all there and well introduced the other reader, which we use virtually every week in the course. And teaching assistants will be free with this to assign whichever documents they so choose. And any given week, I'm still taking the plastic off the farm. Um, it's edited by Bill Ganapathy, Napa, great civil war historian, recently deceased. It's a collection of documents from essentially the Mexican war, right on through reconstruction. Many of them very brief and short documents allowing us at times to teach with a document. It's possible you'll have an entire discussion section that centers around a single document as well as the other reading you did his background.

Speaker 1:          05:57          Uh, the other novel I neglected dimension is a very new novel and I'm taking a risk in this course for years and years. I want to admit how many I've always taught Michael Sharice great civil war novel. The killer angels, which I would venture quarter of you have probably already read. All right. How many have already read killer angels? We're not reading at this time. You can't take that week off. We're reading the Eel, Dr Rosen new novel called the march, which has only been out about a year just into paperback. It's doc doctor Oh, the great modern novelists of Urban America, of, of race in America have so many things. He has actually a brilliant short story in the current New Yorker. If you haven't read it, it may not appeal to all of you. It's really about middle aged men in the suburbs. I got it. Um, any rate dr o's March is about Sherman's march to the sea.

Speaker 1:          07:03          It's about Sherman, but it's also about all the people around him. And I think Dr. Rowe accomplished something extraordinary in that novel, which so few American writers of fiction I've ever quite been able to imagine. He's not alone, but not many have, and that is fully realized slave characters, those, he invents a lot of real people in that book and much of it, like so many of other, uh, of Dr. Rose. Great works like ragtime. If you've read ragtime or others, much of the much of the language, the dialogue is verbatim out of historical sources. You might even want to reach Sherman's memoirs in tandem with it if you have the time, because the whole portions of it come directly out of Sherman's memoirs. Then there are characters invented around. Anyway, it's that last horrible, devastating, destructive, evil, sometimes good year and a half of the civil war in Georgia and South Carolina when the civil war became a truly kind of total modern, um, affair. Uh, it's a novel about this beast of war itself, but it's very much a novel about what this war was about. Anyway. Um, I don't want to go into all the readings were I divide this course in three parts, which may or may not be obvious the first time he glanced at the syllabus, but essentially the first third of the course is the coming of the civil war. It's the story from roughly the mid 1840s through fort Sumpter.

Speaker 1:          09:00          And the second, third of the course is essentially the war itself where we tackle not only how the civil war was fought, but we tackle what it was about. We tackle the question of confederate defeat and union victory. How do we explain that? And we especially tackle questions of meaning. If a war is such a devastation can have meaning in the end, what are those meanings? It's, I think, arguably the most important take home set of questions and answers you might take out of this course. And of course that means we do a good deal on emancipation, the single most revolutionary a result of the civil war. And arguably the single most revolutionary historical moment in American history, the liberation of 4.2 million slaves to some kind of freedom and some kind of citizenship at least for a while. And the third third of the courses of course reconstruction, that a brief shining moment is do boys, one's called it of about 11 years from the end of the civil for mathematics to the disputed election of 1860 76 and 77 12 years, one of the most vexing topsy turvy turbulent embittered periods of American history that historians still fight over to say the least.

Speaker 1:          10:27          It is there what we'll try to understand the consequences of a civil war. This is a course at the end of the day about the causes and consequences as well as the course of this event.

Speaker 1:          10:47          Now, um, but today is January 15th. It is Martin Luther King's birthday. I want to start with a very famous passage. It's not usually the passage you hear from the, I have a dream speech. Almost always one of the dream speech is quoted and now it's quoted in commercials, right? Numerous times or in an radio spots, background kings voices though it's some kind of American chorus for what our, when it went, any moment we need to feel better about ourselves and about race relations. We often just skip right over the first two or three paragraphs of the speech where the central metaphor he sets up in the speech is what he called the promissory note in the Bank of Justice. I am happy to join with you today and what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.

Speaker 2:          11:55          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:55          And so we have come here, excuse me, five score years ago and here he is drawing directly off Lincoln five score years ago. A great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today signed the emancipation proclamation. This was of course, August, 1963 uh, hot, brutally hot August Day king on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak. He says 10 the long night of their captivity, that sentences almost directly from the Bible, but 100 years later, the Negro still is not free. 100 years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. 100 years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. 100 years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land.

Speaker 2:          13:18          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          13:19          and so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition in a sense. We've come here, we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the constitution and the declaration of independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes black men as well as white men would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned, instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked insufficient funds, but we refused to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation, and so we've come to cash this check a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. I would be thrilled if you walked

Speaker 2:          14:52          out of this course and we're able to explain to somebody why king made the promissory note, the central metaphor of his. I have a dream speech and you could somehow explain why it hadn't been cashed by 1963 and could then begin to discuss

Speaker 1:          15:19          whether it's fully cashed yet.

Speaker 2:          15:23          Now

Speaker 1:          15:26          that was just my homage to king.

Speaker 1:          15:31          Now, um, I like to do a little ritual at the beginning of every class. If you'll forgive me, it only takes me about 10 seconds. Do you know we live in a world where all of us in this room take books for granted? We throw books on the floor, we throw books at people, we load them in and out of our backpacks. We drop him here and drop him there. We lose them, we wrap them up, we write all over them. I wrote all over mine. It's only a few generations ago when there really weren't having any bookstores to go to. Your great, great grandparents couldn't meander a bookstore to speak up unless they lived in a special section of a special city. Books are precious things. A lot of them are assigned in this course. Short ones, little ones, big ones, syntheses novels, monographs. Think of a book just for a moment and then you can forget this. If you want to think of a book, any book, it's hard to think of a really bad book this way, but think of a good book, one of your favorite books ever as like a newborn child, a newborn child brought into the world a book. Probably a lot more planning and thought and design and construction at least intellectually goes into that book and it goes into, most babies

Speaker 1:          17:06          books have a cover. They have beginnings, middles and ends. There's somebodies dream, there's somebody creation. They never satisfy just like people, but they're in some ways the greatest things we have and sometimes it's nice to remind ourselves of that in the places where we take the most for granted. I want a quote from for you to you, I'm the oldest history book in Western civilization, not just because it's a book, but I think this is a 0.1 can make about any history course. It doesn't what the subject is. It can be social history, political history, intellectual history, any history. It can be the history of ancient Rome. It could be post 1945 United States. It could be any history, but any history course ought to do. The two things that Herata named and the opening sentence of the oldest history book we have. This is Heraclitus, the history and a great, when you, when you're writing the first book, what are you going to call it? The history, no subtitles, nothing fancy. Just I Herata test of can narcis m here setting forth my history. The time may not draw the color from what man has broadened to being nor those great and wonderful deeds manifested by both the Greeks and the barbarians fail of their report and together we'll all of this, the reason why they fought one another,

Speaker 1:          19:05          I don't know how closely you listen to that, but what does the rotted has just said. He's basically said history is two things. It's the story, it's the color, it's the great deeds. It's the narrative that takes you somewhere, but it's also the reason why it's also the explanation. That's what history does. It's supposed to do both of those things. Some of us are more into the analysis and we're not so fond of story. Some of us just love stories and don't care about the analysis. I'll stop giving me all that interpretation. Just telling me the good story. Again, this is what goes on of course out in public history all the time. Just tell us the old stories or just sing us the old songs. Make us feel good again. Stop interpreting you historians and worst of all, stop revising

Speaker 1:          20:06          you. You how that word revision has crept into our political culture on politicians. Don't like the arguments of people would disagree with them. They accused him of being revisionist historian. It was even a poll tested word for awhile when Condoleezza Rice was using it. Revision is revisionist as though all history isn't revisionist. Now, favorite story about revisionism is my buddy Eric Foner was on a talk show once by 1992 he was not one of those shouting talk shows with Lynne Cheney. Who would that? Dick Cheney's wife who was then head of the Neh and this was a time you won't remember this. We were having this national Brouhaha over what were called national history standards and Lynne Cheney of m, a real critic of these national history standards cause he didn't particularly like some of the ideas that the historians were coming up with. It's on his talk show. It was firing line or you get two people on this shout at each other for an hour or half hour and the producers love it and phoner is pretty good at rapid fire coming back. He's pretty good at that. Anyway, they had this sit too and she had kept accusing him and other historians of being revisionist. And Eric says, the next morning he got a phone call from a reporter at Newsweek and she said, professor phoner, um, when did all this revisionism begin? If owner said, probably with Heraclitus and the Newsweek had, porter said, do you have his phone number?

Speaker 1:          21:39          Never underestimate the ignorance. Hl. Mencken said this, I did never underestimate the ignorance of the American people or if journalist or of

Speaker 2:          22:00          no,

Speaker 1:          22:03          as to this question of why the civil war has a hold on us or a hold on a historical imagination in this country. There are many, many ways to think about that. I'm going to take you through seven or eight possible answers to that in just a moment. Almost like a list, but again, sometimes if you go back to the oldest explanations, you find things that we haven't thought about in facilities. The Peloponnesian war, the first great modern text in Western civilization. At any rate about a civil war, the great Greek civil war, and through acidities great work, he has this little sentence or he actually captures a good deal about why civil wars are such vexing, difficult problems in nations memories once they've had them. There's this, the acidities said quote, the people made their recollections fit in with their sufferings. They began to tell a story that reflected their own suffering. Now they hear might be white southerners. They suffered, they lost it, were truly defeated. Conquered. That's suffering might be African Americans. Emancipation wasn't a day of jubilee. It was an agonizing, horrible, terrible, sometimes wonderful set of experiences into the unknown

Speaker 1:          23:40          and the suffering might be northern unionist. Yes, about 300,000 Yankees soldiers died in the civil war and about 650 to 700,000 were wounded people, made their memories fit their sufferings. I also like this little passage, they're just put into your craw about any history course I bought any interpretation, and of course I'm going to have a point of view at times in this course. All historians do don't have been listened to a historian if he or she doesn't have a point of view. None of us are blank slates. None of us can just tell it like it was the op interpreting, please.

Speaker 2:          24:34          Okay?

Speaker 1:          24:34          But I always try to remember William James, this passage and one of his pragmatism essays, and I say, I think that should be required for us citizenship. If you know, if I ruled the world and you'd have to read this for us. Citizenship in it. James says, the greatest enemy of any one of my truths is the rest of my truth. It's as though James is saying, damn, every time I think I really know something. That's the truth. Along comes some other possible truth in it. Screws it up.

Speaker 2:          25:08          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          25:09          Why can't history just be settled and not far ready? If it was, it wouldn't be any fun. It was, it wouldn't be interesting but was, it wouldn't be good for business either now.

Speaker 2:          25:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          25:31          Why does the civil war have a whole, why are you here at 280 of you here for a course on the civil war? I know it fits 10 30 on Tuesday, Thursday a hundred other reasons you want to lecture course lots of possible answers to all that kind of question, but why does this event hold people there now? Approximately 65,000 books that have been written on the American civil war. This doesn't even really include the books on reconstruction that had been written since Apple Maddix. Now I realized recently in, uh, giving a public talk that you can't always say since happen Maddix and people know what you mean. I'm going to assume Yale students do, but that's actually where the surrender was signed to end of the civil. I was giving a talk recently and I said before Appomattox and after Fmx and Emma said that four or five times, one of the first questions in Q and a is this woman innocently asked what, what has happened? Maddix oh dear. Well you see ma'am. Anyway, since [inaudible] 65, you know what that is? That's more than one per day had been published in this country on this event. Why?

Speaker 1:          26:49          What does Robert Penn Warren mean when he said the civil war draws us as an oracle darkly on riddled in poor tentious of our personal and our national fate? That's pretty grandiose language. But what did Warren mean? What a Gertrude Stein mean when she said there never will be anything more interesting then that American civil war of all people, Gertrude Stein was hopelessly interested in this event. Oh, never will be anything more interesting than that. American civil war. She said, why are so many people into this? Why do people want to read about it? Reenact it, go play it. Go visit it. Is it just heritage tourism? Is it Josh? The attraction of military history? What is it that compels us to remember the most divisive, the most bloody, the most tragic event in our national history?

Speaker 2:          27:59          Okay,

Speaker 1:          28:01          and how do we remember it? Have we sometimes cleaned it up with such pleasing mythology that we've just made it fun? Why is the confederate flag a problem? Why doesn't it just go away? It's the second most ubiquitous American symbol across the world, especially since Michael Jordan quit playing, other than the u s flag, the confederate flags and most ubiquitous symbol of the United, maybe Coca Cola. Okay? But Coca Cola is an international symbol. Now you can find the confederate flag everywhere in this world. I spent a year in Germany and I traveled a lot in eastern Europe. I saw it all over the place. I was in Prague, the Czech Republic in 1993 Jim Mcpherson is battle cry of freedom book your assigned largely as background, largest selling book on the American civil war, published in the last 25 years. International best seller was 16 weeks in New York Times bestseller list was translated into Czech. I mean, nobody reads check except the checks and even them even they tend to read fiction in German. Anyone in the bookstore, they had a big display and Jim Mcpherson's battle cry of freedom. The whole bookstore window, I couldn't believe it, but how did they display it with confederate flags?

Speaker 1:          29:28          They missed the point of the title of the book, but nevermind. How do you portray the American symbol wars symbolically? Oh, it's that confederate flag that will tell us right away with this is about why. Why does this confederate flag just go away

Speaker 1:          29:50          or put it another way? Why do you love the civil war? I can't tell you how many thousands of times in public lectures, et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera. In my end, all civil war historians, faceless people will come up afterwards. Usually they want to show you the grandfather's letters, but they'll say, I just love the civil war and you want to just stop them for a moment and say you need a shrink or what is it you love? Is it the aftermath it in Tetum? Is it the trenches of Spotsylvania? Is it the latrines at Andersonville? Is it both killing Lincoln? What is it you love it?

Speaker 1:          30:41          Is it because we love epics? This is it because a lot of people really are kind of hard wired. Maybe we may even be hard wired biologically for story. I can't prove that, but there's a lot of research on this. Are we hard wired for story and therefore to some degree for epic stories that have heroes and villains and beginnings and ends and great collisions, maybe. Is it because Americans love redemption and people around the world love to think that about us sometimes too. Is it because we liked to see or we've converted this terribly divisive experience into a great unifier? Did we go back and look at the civil war, not only to see the beginnings of our own modern time and a modern American nation, a second American republic born out of the death of the first and so on and so forth, but do we actually go back to this most dividing experience to figure out how are we became unified? Or as William Dean Howells put it in 1900 and a lovely line, he said, what the American people always like is a tragedy as long as they can give it a happy ending.

Speaker 1:          31:58          Is it because we see the American civil war or have learned to see it as America's first great racial reckoning? We're the nation's national sin of slavery as some like to put it had to finally be remitted in some way, purged, cleansed, and the language used by both sides in this war of purgings and cleansings, the war that brought a reckoning from 250 years of slavery, destroyed a slave society brought the end of the first American republic and the revolution of emancipation.

Speaker 1:          32:45          I think there's a lot to argue that Americans have big gun, at least they've just begun this to love the civil war because they love emancipation. They want to live in the nation that freed slaves. My favorite line in George Bush, the first inaugural address in 1989 and I'm probably the only one that ever bothered to remember this line. Maybe the only one who cares, but Peggy Noonan wrote him a sentence. It's classic inaugural rhetoric. It comes right and it comes right after the section and Bush ones inaugural where he's two. He's saying, we must put the war in Vietnam. Behind us. It is too definitive and so on. And there's a line where he says, we must remember, we are the nation that sent 600,000 of its sons to die. Rather than have slavery now, who wouldn't want to live in that country? That's a great line in an inaugural address. Of course, it's ignoring the fact that at least half of those people died to preserve slavery, but nevermind. Do we love the civil war because sometimes there's a lot of guilty pleasure or not so guilty pleasure and just loving the details of military history and if you're one of those, fine. That's great. I had that stage two, I will confess if you make me, but what is all that nostalgia about for those battlefield?

Speaker 2:          34:30          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          34:31          or is it because this experience in American history is ultimately about loss? Are we attracted to loss? Is loss more interesting sometimes than victory and by loss, I mean defeat, but also loss in terms of human life, treasure proportions of civilizations that die.

Speaker 1:          34:54          Take loss for just a moment. If you took the 620,000 out of Americans who died in the civil war, you moved it ahead to the Vietnam era and roughly the 12 years in the United States fought in Vietnam per capita. Okay. Approximately 4 million Americans would have died in Vietnam. That's the scale of death and loss and the civil war. 4 million Americans will never sustain for a million casualties in a war. I would argue, I mean, I can't prove that. I mean, unless Osama bin Ladin is coming through that window, who knows? Maybe he will one day. Would that be cool? I mean that you wouldn't slip through that lecture, but I don't think Americans will ever sustain that Chi. But 4 million, if you came per capita from the civil war era population to the era of Vietnam every year at Antietam in rural Maryland on the anniversary of the battle, 17th of September.

Speaker 2:          36:00          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          36:00          They put out a little Illuminati or the Luminari. Excuse me. Uh, no, no. Whoa. That's a slip I luminaria or the little, the little candle lamps all over the battlefield. They put 23,000 of them out, which was the number of casualties in eight hours at Antietam and when the sun goes down, you can look at the battlefield and get a sense of this kind of powerful, almost artistic sense of the loss. Every one of those little candle lights wasn't human life. Um, related to that is the American imagination for this event still stimulated in part because sometimes we just like lost causes. We are attracted to defeat sometimes more than we are attracted

Speaker 2:          36:59          to victory.

Speaker 1:          37:01          Wasson war is sometimes more interesting. Lost Causes Somehow represent the rebel spirit, a rebellious spirit, an insurrectionary spirit. And in surgeon spirit, some people may be attracted in that way and maybe last but not least in this list could go on and on.

Speaker 1:          37:27          There is, I think an interest in the civil war among serious readers in particular because it does have somehow house satisfy that search we offer. It's an [inaudible] for origins. The origins of the modern nation state, the origins of big government, the origins of centralized power, the origins of what seemed to be the death of state's rights, but should surely didn't die, did it? We have a states rights supreme court now in case you didn't notice the birth of a kind of modernity in America and many form comes out of this year. It doesn't just come out of the battle of Gettysburg, but it surely comes out of the euro. There's also this sense in which somehow in that experience of the civil war in the middle of the 19th century fought for the existence of an American nation and for the new definition of that nation and just how free and equal the people in it would be is where we may somehow see that transformation from a premodern to a more modern world. And sometimes I suspect that's what attracts. Now the watch is, I only have about two minutes, so let me leave you here.

Speaker 1:          38:54          I do think sometimes we're attracted because war is just so big. Geiling Lee, fascinating and drew Faust. I'm wonderful historian whom you now know as the president of Harvard University has just published a brand new book. It's literally just out this week. I read it in manuscript, but I have a blurb on the back. It's called the Republic of suffering and she has much to say in that book, which I highly recommend about why death is so interesting. Let me leave you with this Thursday. I'm going to take up the old south and begin this comparison of the old south to the growing capitalist that both sides were highly capitalists, northern society, but in 1850 or 1840s America you could find both extremes of, on the one hand, a tremendous, seemingly unfathomable optimism about America. It seemed to be limitless and boundless and nobody captured it ever any better than Walt Whitman, but you can also find expressions all over the culture, especially from African Americans and abolitionist and some slave holders of a great dread about the direction of the country. In Whitman's first line of his drum taps, his color, his famous collection of civil war poetry comes that phrase which is up here first though songs for a prelude and that first poem and drum taps is a Whitman trying to capture just how exciting war can be. But he'd also written a poem like democracy,

Speaker 1:          40:49          and I'll leave you with this and I'll start with a response to it on Thursday in Whitman's democracy as well as several other Whitman poems, you can find this limitless sense of optimism. Just listened to his words, sail, sail. That best ship of democracy of value is by freight. Tis not the president only the past is also stored in the this America, this thing called America to him is the whole world's new beginning. Thou holdest not the venture of myself alone, not the western continent alone. Earth's resume, entire floats on Die Keel. Oh ship is steadied by an ice spar with the time voyages in trust, the antecedent nations sink or swim with the America is everything according to Whitman, with all their ancient struggles, martyrs, heroes, epics, wars, thou barest the other continents. There's, there's as much as the line, the destination port triumphant, steer them with good, strong hand and wary eye. Oh, helmsmen thou carious great companion. How can I pierce the impenetrable blank of your future? I feel I ominous greatness, evil as well as good. I watched the advancing, absorbing, the present, transcending the past. I see that light lighting and eye shadow shadowing as if the entire globe, but I do not undertake to define the hardly can I comprehend the

Speaker 1:          42:45          well, that's Whitman saying as we all do at times, America is an idea. This course is the story of what that idea was and what happened to it and the chance it had coming out of it.
