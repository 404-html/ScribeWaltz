Speaker 1:          00:13          Faster than might seem appropriate and faster than I wish.

Speaker 2:          00:21          We've

Speaker 1:          00:23          come to the succession crisis. I wish we had another week to three weeks,

Speaker 2:          00:31          but we don't

Speaker 1:          00:36          martyrdom. What does a martyr term we hear all over the place now there are martyrs of this cause and martyrs of that cause. John Brown was a martyr.

Speaker 2:          00:54          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:55          The most important thing about John Brown is I tried to say the other day and I want to conclude with several comments about that. Now he's in how he died and in the aftermath of his death. United States was a Christian country. Europe was essentially a Christian civilization. John Brown would be filtered through a Christian imagination either way, whether people came to admire and sort of agonizingly love him or agonizingly hate him. John Brown's raid on Harper's ferry was all his own, said Frederick Douglass. His zeal in the cause of freedom was infinitely superior to mine. Mine was a taper light. His was the burning sun. Mine was bounded by time. His stretched away to the silent shores of eternity. I could speak for the slave. John Brown could fight for the slave. I could live for the slave. John Brown could die for the slave. There's a clarity and that among the many you logistic statements about John Brown and the many of the Frederick Douglass himself. May Douglas you'll remember had great ambivalence about this man and chose not to join him on the rate at Harper's ferry. I Brown was captured in the raid. Raid only lasted 48 hours. It was in some ways the military strategic blunder.

Speaker 1:          02:51          He was taken to a jail, a four miles from Harper's ferry, Charles Town Virginia, now West Virginia, and he would reside there for about the next six weeks,

Speaker 2:          03:02          six

Speaker 1:          03:04          in that period, he would be put on trial and the most celebrated trial. To that point in American history, there were three charges, all of which were punishable by death, at least in Virginia, treason against the United States. It was considered treason to attack a federal arsenal. I suppose it's still would be, although we don't try too many people for treason anymore to inciting a slave insurrection. Pretty serious crime and Virginia and third from Mara for murder.

Speaker 2:          03:48          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:48          Trial began on the 27th of October. It lasted three and a half days. State of Virginia famously tried to provide a lawyer for John Brown and Brown refused that states supplied lawyer. He laid on a cot because of his injuries and his wounds and the courtroom, this would be drawn and put it up in lithographs and pictures all over the country. He was eventually defended in court by three northerners, uh, lawyers who came down to help closing arguments for the 31st of October, the jury deliberated 45 minutes, returned a verdict of guilty on all three counts and it was announced he would be hung a about a month later on December 2nd, 1859 from November 2nd to December 2nd that one month, November 2nd was the last day in court where they sentenced him.

Speaker 2:          05:01          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:02          He had one month in jail. He apparently went over as a jailer who found John Brown and one of the most fascinating characters you'd ever seen. People came from the north and we're allowed to visit him, including his wife from jail. He wrote approximately 100 letters all over the country to newspapers, to editors, to magazines, to members of his family, particularly to his wife. He was writing his own epitaph. He was creating his own romantic legend. He was arguing his own case. He, of course, had pled innocent.

Speaker 2:          05:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:44          Are many of those letters. I had the great privilege to read a whole batch of the originals once, how's did of all places, the Pennsylvania historical society. He wrote this one to his wife, which may be indicative of Brown's vision of his own ax and a vision that was now going to stick in some ways in poetry and in song. I have been whipped, he wrote to his wife as the saying goes, but I'm sure I can recover all the last capital occasioned by that disaster by only hanging a few minutes by the neck. And I feel quite determined to make the utmost possible out of my defeat. Uh, I love you dear, but I can't wait to hang.

Speaker 2:          06:39          Okay,

Speaker 1:          06:40          John Brown,

Speaker 1:          06:44          it was a troubled man. He was morbid man. He was an old testament man, but he probably was not crazy as so many people said at the time, people have said, ever since is altruism on behalf of black people was not utterly selfless, but he was an extraordinary example of an American or white American, uh, who, uh, put his money where his mouth was. He didn't have any money, but his life for his mouth was and took it into the south. Now he was executed, hung out in a field outside of Charlestown, Virginia, guarded by some 3000 American troops. Um, there were all kinds of fears of attempts to break him out and season by northern Yankee bands. There were all kinds of threats of escape plans in the newspapers. And by the way, one of the most startling things about the John Brown story, once it broke and had never been a sensation quite like this in American newspapers, here was the south oldest greatest, worst fear and abolitionists from the north with a band of men and a bunch of weapons invading the south and trying to incite slave insurrection. They'd been kind of predicting this all along.

Speaker 1:          08:17          Oh and behold it happened in a trunk of stuff back at the farm in Maryland that he had rented for several months whereas men had gathered after his capture.

Speaker 2:          08:29          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          08:30          it was found a whole stash of letters and maps. The old man had kept all kinds of maps of the south. He had maps of sections of Alabama, Georgia. He even had extra certain towns on those maps. I don't know, the old guide is like maps maybe just stayed up at night kind of plan with his maps like some of us do with our rand McNally maps when we want to wish our selves out of where we are. But when these maps were found in the press got hold of these all over the south, these stories spread and local newspapers for 20 stories about the maps of their county or their section of a state. There was hysteria. Uh, northern teachers working in the south were tarred and feathered and I turned her a piano tuner in Tennessee was lynched.

Speaker 2:          09:29          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:30          Cause he was from Massachusetts.

Speaker 2:          09:32          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:33          Fear set in across the south that they were going to be other abolition emissaries. That was always the term used and there were, there were predictions and threats of all kinds, especially in South Carolina.

Speaker 2:          09:46          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:47          John Brown, when when you, and he did read some of these newspapers, must've smile. Nope. He was hung. His body was delivered to his wife.

Speaker 1:          10:03          It traveled all the way by train all the way up to know upstate New York to North Alabama, New York, where he was buried aside in a very remote place, I must say, in upstate New York, they have a gathering there every year of something called the John Brown society. It's run by a bunch of people from New York City and they have an annual speaker and an annual pilgrimage to old John Brown's grave. And I had the privilege of one year of giving that lecture and the courthouse, whereas body had laid in state. It was interesting to meet the erstwhile folks at the John Brown society who are strange and interesting lot and I can assure you,

Speaker 2:          10:43          yeah,

Speaker 1:          10:44          but it's an isolated place.

Speaker 2:          10:47          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          10:47          But pilgrimage, pilgrimages already started happening, especially among African Americans in the north to that remote site.

Speaker 2:          10:57          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:58          Right in the wake of his burial. The most important thing about John Brown's raid and John Brown was the aftermath. It's what people made of it in the north. Certain members of that secret six so called of white abolitionists to ad served him and helped him and raise money for him and wrote letters with him, fled the country,

Speaker 2:          11:22          some to Canada,

Speaker 1:          11:25          Frederick Douglass himself. And there were letters discovered between Douglas and John Brown.

Speaker 2:          11:32          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:33          Uh, himself will flee the country, uh, out of Rochester, New York, across Lake Erie and to Canada and out the Saint Lawrence River to England

Speaker 2:          11:44          because of

Speaker 1:          11:46          fear of his arrest. And there was a warrant put out for Frederick Douglas. Douglas is arrest and a federal marshal arrived in Rochester, York. Only about a day after Douglas left town intellectuals and poets and writers and the press throw in Whittier and Emerson all over the north and in England and in France began to try their hand at the meaning of John Brown as Christian hero, as martyr of a cars, as a man who would do that, which the rest of them would not have done. And I want to suggest, I'm going to give you really for arguments, just try them on or why John Brown matters. Why you matter then and why you still matters in any discussion we have in American society about what constitutes terrorism now, what constitutes revolutionary violence when is a cause? So just that the means justify the ends. When is violence in a moral cause justified? Is it ever justified? Go answer those questions in an ethics course. Go answer those questions in a politics course. Go answer those questions in a history course and you have one of the hardest questions of wall was John Brown, a midnight terrorist or revolutionary hero.

Speaker 1:          13:22          John Brown is a very troubling legacy. Nobody should pretty fine and nobody should totally dismissing. I'd say he leaves us with four essential questions and you can add to this or if you want first, he really makes his face this question of the meaning of martyrdom. What is a martyr? How do we define a martyr? What constitutes the value? Is there elements of martyrdom to how do we deal with revolutionary violence in history or today? One kind of Cosby just as I just said earlier, so just,

Speaker 2:          14:10          yeah,

Speaker 1:          14:10          that violence in its name is somehow justified

Speaker 1:          14:19          three and here I'm going to give you a list within the list. I think John Brown is our template in American history. There are others you could point to the leaders of the Hay market riot, the, there, there are many other cases, um, in our history of people who acted in a cause and used violence. But John Brown, um, forces us to face the almost natural ambivalences about his ax. He is disturbing and inspiring. Note all these opposites. He in some ways worked for the highest ideals, human freedom and the idea of equality. But it also uses the most ruthless deeds. There's a certain majesty about his character, at least in the aftermath, but there's also a lot of folly. He was a monster to some to others. He's, he's a saint. He's a warrior. St He killed for justice.

Speaker 2:          15:24          Yes.

Speaker 1:          15:25          When does that work for you? He was a great example of what had been brewing all over the, the culture by the 1850s. We've talked about this over and over of this struggle between human law, law, fashion and congress, law facet and fashion by people and the so called higher law. When do you abide by a higher law than the laws of your society? When is it just a break human law in the name of higher law? Who Decides? And lastly, I think he's one of those Avengers of history who do the work. Other people won't, can't or shouldn't.

Speaker 2:          16:20          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:20          Men consented to his death, said Frederick Douglass and one of those eulogy speech was much later. The speech is much later in 1880 men consented to his death and then when home and taught their children to honor his memory. And then fourth, and the last question that's always laying out there, John Brown was a white man who killed white people to free black people. And that's actually one of his deepest legacies. In my first years of teaching a bigger term in highschool and Flint, Michigan, I taught lots of young black people who thought John Brown was black. They had been taught that he was black. Sometimes in churches, there's a church in Springfield, Massachusetts, the John Brown went to, attended. They say he was a member. It's called the John Brown church. There's some people there. You still have to convince that it was white. Does it matter? Why does it matter? Why is John Brown's and been such a romantic hero in black culture and poetry and painting and song?

Speaker 2:          17:37          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          17:39          Michael Harper, the great modern African American poet has a little line on, one of his poems is called the poem is called history and Brown. The line is come to the crusade, not as Negroes, but as brothers like brother Brown.

Speaker 2:          18:03          Well,

Speaker 1:          18:05          you can try all those questions on and if you come up with some perfect answers, do let me know. But before we leave John Brown, I want to leave you with my favorite passage ever written about the meaning and memory of John Brown.

Speaker 2:          18:22          And

Speaker 1:          18:24          you can see if it fits or not. It's in a speech by WB Dubois, greatest black scholar writer of the 20th century. Dubois gave a speech about John Brown at Harper's ferry in 1932 they were dedicating a plaque memorial. Uh, this has been done before, but they were dedicating and yet another sort of John Brown marker at Harper's ferry, and the ending of that speech, I think is the most poignant thing anybody ever said about John Brown, and it's why he's so troubling. This is dubois is ending. Some people have the idea that crucifixion consists in the punishment of an innocent man. The essence of crucifixion is that men are killing a criminal, that men have got to kill him, and yet that the act of crucifying him is the salvation of the world. John Brown broke the law. He killed human beings. Those people who defended slavery had had to execute John Brown, although they knew that in killing him, they were committing the greater crime. It is out of that human paradox that there comes any crucifixion. Okay, good morning sermon is over. I've named my text. Now let's do some history.

Speaker 2:          20:07          Okay.

Speaker 1:          20:10          The raid on Harper's ferry and the execution of John Brown of course, came.

Speaker 2:          20:20          Whoops. There we are

Speaker 1:          20:24          on the eve of an extremely pivotal American election to say the least. You all know the Republican party had a good showing in 1856 and nearly won it's first time out. Now, what will this Republican Party be by 1860 how will it threaten the south? Well, it's threatened the south John Bronze, right on Harper's vera in his execution or a template

Speaker 1:          20:52          all into that next spring as the American political culture held it's conventions and nominated candidates and prepared for an election that now people said, my decide whether the union would hold together or not. The Democrats held their convention in late April, early May in the worst possible place they can hold it. They had scheduled it well ahead of time in Charleston, South Carolina. Charleston was a hotbed of southern rites and southern nationalism, if you want to call it that, and southern secessionism already. It was now the the can to the front running candidate of the Democratic Party by 1860 and this man had been working for this for a decade and a half. It was of course, Stephen Douglas of Illinois. Same Stephen Douglas of popular sovereignty fame, but Stephen Douglas had made one a slip up. Oh, he made more than one, but he might one or two really big slipups in terms of his fellow southern Democrats, I mean is by far the most prestigious person in their party. But in one of his debates with Abraham Lincoln, one of those incredible debates with Lincoln, the one in Freeport, Illinois, and much ado was made about this. It was almost a throwaway line, although it wasn't thrown away.

Speaker 2:          22:22          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          22:23          Lincoln pushed Douglas and he said, do you mean then judge Douglas? Is he always called? He would never call him senator. Judge Douglas. Do you mean then that if the people who settle the Western territory pop your popular sovereignty business, what does that, that really means the folks can vote it out, right? In spite of what the dred Scott Decision says, dred Scott decision just said that because of the Fifth Amendment, you cannot stop a person taking his slaves anywhere he wants. And Lincoln says, but, but judge, what's that done to your popular sovereignty, Douglas as well? That people can still vote? And if the people vote slavery out and they voted out.

Speaker 2:          23:02          Okay.

Speaker 1:          23:03          And his fellow southern Democrats immediately started writing to him and wiring him and saying, wait a minute, Steven, did we live in the land of the dred Scott decision or not? It became known to southern Democrats as the so called free port. Doctor

Speaker 1:          23:22          and Douglas kept trying to dance around it, avoid it in opposition to so called Freeport doctrine and in opposition to Douglas at this southern Democrat at the, at the Democratic Party convention, and by the way, that Democratic Party is by anyone with his eyes open. The only truly national political party left in America, the hope of saving the union, just in a political sense, by 1860 was with the Democrats. This Republican Party is resumed to see was a northern party almost exclusively countering the Douglas southern Democrats, led by none other than Jefferson Davis, a senator from Mississippi at that point, a long distinguished member of Congress, secretary of war, coming on a west point and so on. They came up with what they now call a slave code for the territory's. That's what they called it. And that slave code for the territory's was now to be a protection in the constitution and explicit protection in the constitution of slave ownership anywhere in the western territories of the United States. They wanted, in essence, not just the dred Scott Decision Supreme Court case, they wanted a federal gay. They wanted not just the repeal of the Kansas Nebraska Act, geographical division, not just the dred Scott Case, which said, prisoners, right, take slaves anywhere. They wish. They wanted a explicit federal guarantee of the right to slave ownership and he wanted it to be a constitutional amendment if necessary.

Speaker 2:          25:15          Now,

Speaker 1:          25:16          this is why the Democratic Party toward self apart at Charleston, they had a two thirds rule. So even though Stephen Douglas did muster a small majority of support in the first balloting, he could not win the nomination. And when Douglas, his supporters managed to pass a platform without the so called slave code for the territory's southern delegates of eight states, they'd all prepared for this stocked out of the convention. The convention ended. They nominated nobody and they split into two parties, the southern Democrats and the northern Democrats. And everybody knows that when a party does this, it almost guarantees that we'll lose.

Speaker 2:          26:06          And

Speaker 1:          26:08          it did the southern Democrats re to reconvene in Baltimore and June 18

Speaker 2:          26:16          and um,

Speaker 1:          26:19          I'm sorry, the northern Democrats reconvened the so called official Democratic Party. We convene to Baltimore and June 18 they nominated a Stephen Douglas. No surprise. They called themselves the National Democrats, the southern Democrats of those eight southern states. It's the deep south.

Speaker 2:          26:39          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          26:40          Met in Richmond, Virginia. Shortly after that and nominated John See Breckenridge of Kentucky slave holder, but a moderate known to be some kind of an old Henry Clay moderate. Although he'd never been a wig.

Speaker 2:          26:57          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:57          To be their candidate for president. And by the end of June, 1860, the democratic party had to two candidates, Breckenridge, southern Democrat Douglas, the northern Democrats. Now the Republican Party had its convention in Chicago. There's an extraordinary convention. It had never been one quite like it in American history. It was Rawkus. They would just parades and waves of people sometimes hired, sometimes induced den by lots of drink to come into the so called a Wigwam, which was this big convention hall of a kind they had constructed in Chicago. It was sometimes called the shouters convention because these people were sort of hired to shout for one candidate or the other. What fun and nonsense it must have been.

Speaker 2:          27:50          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          27:51          The leading Canada, the Republicans of course was William h Seward, sort of New York, longterm time senator from New York had strong antislavery credentials as a good solid free soiler and indeed even had fairly strong abolitionist ties.

Speaker 2:          28:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:14          And He'd been there at the creation of the Republican Party and he had a kind of a machine. I have a sword, but there was this strange insurgency out of Illinois behind a favorite son named Abraham Lincoln, and wasn't all that well known, even though he had become fairly well known in his run against Stephen Douglas and 1858 but of course he'd lost that election narrowly to Douglas and 58 he doesn't one term in the u s house back in the late 1840 [inaudible] during the Mexican war. And then he lost on is tempted reelection two years in the House of Representatives, or rather inexperienced. But it turns out brilliant politician,

Speaker 1:          28:59          the platform of the Republican Party, which was very important these years, people were reading platforms, believe it or today, platforms SMAPP forms, right? Southerners were really reading the dumb, the Republican party platform. The platform of 1860 was a little broader and had somewhat more moderate appeals in it then they're 1856 deeply free soil platform had had, they made big appeals in 1860, uh, to create higher federal tariffs to create free homestead law in the West. These are all appeals. You know, the, the common man and to the rights of immigrants because the Republicans were now successful by the late 1850s at all, but desolving that native as party, the know nothings or the American party and we're drawing. Most native is not quite all, but most native is into the Republican Party and, and they'd manage this strange marriage of a kind of a pro immigrant platform. At the same time, they're attracting nativist who are as worried about slavery as they were about Catholics. They appealed to a certain anti southern feeling. There's no question about that.

Speaker 1:          30:17          Now Lincoln got the nomination largely because in, well one the convention was held in his home state to William made Seward had made a fair number of enemies around the Republican coalition. He was in the limelight too long in a sense. You could argue politically and Ilana Republicans were looking for a candidate who seemed more moderate than that is Seward. They wanted to run in this election in a way that, you know, the upper south, maybe the border states would actually support them. And this Lincoln, yeah, man. After all. He was born in Kentucky, you know, he's the kind of a border state guy himself. Seward's just a Yankee. So there's a certain irony and the Lincoln got some support because he wasn't seen as abolitionists. Now that isn't necessarily as true. Lincoln was on record all over the place saying such things as he had an 1859 I quote him, Republicans believe that slavery is wrong and they insist and we'll continue to insist upon a national policy which recognizes it and deals with it as a wrong. There can be no letting down on

Speaker 2:          31:42          this reasonably clear language. Oh dear, I got to move him. Sorry. There you are.

Speaker 1:          32:03          Does Matthew Brady's famous photographs that he took on the day of Abraham Lincoln's Cooper Union speech in New York. The speech, the introduced Lincoln to the east and according to Harold Holter and a reason book made Lincoln President. Now it's a bit overstated, but ms pre beer didn't grow the beard of the next year, but the crisis was so serious now. Well, this northern antislavery free soil Republican Party to democratic parties, one southern one northern splitting themselves that are a group of American politicos got together practically overnight late that summer, 1860 and decided to run yet a fourth candidate. His name was John Bell of Tennessee and they called themselves the Constitutional Union party. They drew together some old Whigs. The Whig party doesn't exist anymore. There's still some old Whigs looking for a political home.

Speaker 2:          33:07          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          33:08          They drew some nativists and no nothings and they drew border state people who were just frightened of how this mess was possibly gonna destroy the union. Their platform was extremely simple. They pledged themselves simply to quote, defense of the Union and enforcement of the law. Oh, it could be against that. They were for the Union and law, both nice things and almost unbelievably this party had quite a few followers overnight.

Speaker 2:          33:49          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          33:50          no. When the election came, and I'll go back to the map if you forgive me. Um,

Speaker 2:          33:59          okay.

Speaker 1:          34:01          It's worth looking at some quick numbers, more than worth it. This is one of the great for way races for the presidency in American history. We've only had really one or two other four ways. 1912 was a four way. Of course that guarantees almost you're going to have a minority president that is the one who wins, is not going to win a majority, and that's exactly what happened in this case. Now, Abraham Lincoln, the Republican was not even on the ballot in 10 slave states. Republicans weren't even put it on the ballot in all of the deep south.

Speaker 2:          34:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          34:40          Lincoln carried all of the northern states and all of their electoral votes except three in New Jersey. Breckenridge, the southern Democrat carried all the slave states except parts of the Upper South Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri. Oh, well you can see that on that map. John Bell, the Constitutional Union Canada, there's overnight party that just said, please save the Union. Whatever it takes. We needed a new national compromise. Bell Won Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Upper south.

Speaker 2:          35:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          35:24          Stephen Douglas, who'd been kind of running for president in his heart for 15 years. One only one state, Missouri. Lincoln received only 26,000 votes in the south in all the slave states. He received only about 40% of the total raw vote. 60% of Americans who voted in 1860 and they voted in huge percentage is 75 80% turnout. 60% of all those who voted did not vote for Abraham Lincoln,

Speaker 2:          36:03          but he was elected.

Speaker 1:          36:06          And now of course the question was what would the south to do? What all this rhetoric about southern unity and the possibility of of succession,

Speaker 2:          36:19          uh, sorry. Oops. I hope that work

Speaker 1:          36:39          colors aren't great or anything. Well, this is session crisis is an unprecedented moment in American history and happily we haven't quite had it since. There were always rumors of Texas wanting to succeed and the upper peninsula of Michigan wanting to secede, but nobody quite does a session anymore. We got a lot of states rights going on, but we don't necessarily do succession. Would the south really do it now? Lincoln made one thing clear within his party. He made almost no public appearances after the election of 1860 into that winter. Inaugurations were not held in the 19th century until March. As you may know, the interregnum was a long time, four months, four or five months. This was the succession winter of 1860 61 but he made one thing very clear within his party circles and his quote after quote about this in private correspondence. He said, whatever the south does that he wanted the Republican Party to stand absolutely firm on one thing and that was opposition at all costs to the expansion of slavery into the West.

Speaker 1:          37:54          He said that was their reason to be. That was why they came into existence. That is what they had been arguing for six years and they would not give up that line as he put it on December 20th, 1860 South Carolina Helda secession convention December 20th and voted unanimously to secede from the union. They said in that act that they were quote not in rebellion against the United States. They said they were only exercising their sovereign power as a state to withdraw. They rooted there succession as they had always rooted state sovereignty and states' rights positions in the old notion of a compact theory of government that which a state chooses to join in a central government. It shall have the right end power to withdraw from. But the question now is would anybody join them? Oh and by the way, they declared themselves the Paul Meadow Metal Republic, but would anybody join South Carolina? And this is where your book by Charles Do, parcels of disunion comes right into play here. That wonderfully short and I think quite brilliant treatment of these succession commissioners is South Carolina was the first date to send out succession commissioners and other states in the deep south and basically say, please join us, were hanging out on this limb. It's scary out here and here are the reasons you should join us. The next state to go though, it wasn't until the 9th of January of [inaudible] 61 it was Mississippi.

Speaker 2:          39:45          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          39:45          Zippy held the secession convention and then several deep South states fell like dominoes. Next Day, January 10 Florida succeeded Alabama on January 11th Georgia. I want to come back to Georgia. And just a second, cause it's in a very interesting case. George, on January 19th in a very divided vote, Louisiana in January 26 and Texas on February 1st by February 1st, 1861 the seven states of the deep South, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas had seceded from the union. They declared themselves the confederate states of America. They met at their first declared capitol of Montgomery, Alabama. And they, in effect a pointed, there was no general election. At first they appointed the representatives or the states appointed Jefferson Davis of Mississippi, Mississippi as their president.

Speaker 2:          40:49          Okay.

Speaker 1:          40:50          By the time Lincoln would take office and first week in March and deliver his first inaugural seven states in the deep south had formed a new government.

Speaker 1:          41:04          Now why did they do it? I'm going to have to leave you a, we have about seven, eight minutes, which is great. Um, I want to focus briefly on Georgia to show you the succession was no simple process and many of these states and it was great division, which we will see later kind of come out of its shell in the midst of a war and some extent afterwards in reconstruction. And I don't want to at least leave you today with some explanations of why is the session happened, interpretations we've developed over the years of why the south seceding I may have to leave you hanging as to just what happened to the rest of the south and so on. But the opera south doesn't budge and are many reasons for that. Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas and so on. Maryland, there are many reasons for that. It was somewhat less strong attachment to slavery, uh, in many of these regions, especially in the mountain regions are much more closer economic ties to the north that now caused a whole variety of fears are what's going to happen if there's conflict or two countries or war.

Speaker 2:          42:25          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          42:25          fear that the war would actually happen if there was war on their soil.

Speaker 2:          42:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          42:30          You're not, you didn't have to be too bright to figure that out. And many people in the upper south, some of whom have actually voted for, for Bell and the Constitutional Union party still had faith that somehow America would reach a compromise.

Speaker 2:          42:48          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          42:48          That the party system would somehow work this through. This was, this was a very difficult patch, you know, but they work at this room and there was a spirit, especially in the upper south at first and some of this in Georgia to, to wait for 64, wait four years. I let this Lincoln Republican Party have its way for a while. We'll see. We, they would say, still have a majority on the supreme court.

Speaker 2:          43:21          Okay.

Speaker 1:          43:23          Now, um, explanations. Now Georgia can't, we can't, we can't, we can't leave Georgia because Georgia succession votes fascinating. And that's what this map in some ways shows you, I don't know if you can see this very well, but the darker greenish color up there is that green to you or blue and the rest is kind of a puke yellow. Um, those bluish greenish regions are the regions that tended to be against the session there. The regions that had the least slavery there, the mountainous regions or the upland regions. And we've now had detailed studies of succession done in state by state, especially in in, in Georgia and North Carolina, Alabama. Other places that show us that by far the highest support for succession was in those counties or those regions with the largest numbers of slaves. And this is where Charles do fits right in. Read them closely.

Speaker 1:          44:30          What are those? The session commissioners arguing when they go from Alabama up to Tennessee to try to convince the Tennessee legislature or the South Carolina Succession Commissioner going to Virginia and sitting down in the Virginia State House, the Virginia legislature and arguing with these people, come join us. Come join us. What are they arguing? And he's got document after document. They're arguing for the preservation of white security of white supremacy there arguing for the preservation of a slave economy. They're arguing for the preservation of white political supremacy there arguing for resistance again, and he's against any semblance of those Republicans in the north. May May somehow represent about racial equality. They're arguing for the preservation of a slave labor system. Put simply, there are no for the preservation of a slave society.

Speaker 2:          45:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          45:26          What's the session about slavery read Charles. Do. All right. And the three minutes I have, let me leave you with some arguments. Why does south succeed,

Speaker 2:          45:51          oops, sorry. One

Speaker 1:          45:58          is what? Um, we might simply call, uh, what I've just argued, the preservation of a slave society, the preservation of a slave system, the preservation of a certain kind of racial control over a society that they now greatly feared would be threatened. And this is in part what happened in Georgia in their divided vote because in Georgia, the upper counties of Georgia, those more hilly, mountainous regions of north Georgia voted against the session, the vote on succession and Georgia on January 19th, 1861 was one 66 to one 30 130 of those people who were elected to go to the Georgia secession convention is delegates voted against it. And here was the theory that was at stake. It was really an argument between waiting til 64 or the argument used by southern slave holders now, but people from south Georgia and all over the deep south, it was the theory of a shrinking south.

Speaker 1:          47:05          And I really do believe this is one of the most compelling arguments they had about succession. And it's why they were able to muster enough folks to go with them in their revolution. The theory of a shrinking south was the idea that if the Republicans gained control of the federal government through patronage, through nominations to the Supreme Court, through the much higher numbers they had in the House of Representatives, and even now with California and so on, maybe even in the u s senate, that eventually, and if they close off the expansion of slavery in the West, what does that do? It cordons off and it contains, and it begins to smother southern society and the slave system. And the theory wasn't on the rim of the south. In Kentucky, in Missouri, in Maryland, the price of slaves would begin to dwindle.

Speaker 2:          47:57          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          47:58          And then what do people do when the price of something goes down? They sell it off, where are they going to sell those slaves can't sell him west, can't sell them to the Caribbean. International slave trades illegal. They're going to sell them into the deep south. What happens? The deep south becomes more and more and more rather quickly, a pressure cooker of increasingly large numbers of slaves.

Speaker 2:          48:21          Okay.

Speaker 1:          48:22          And no place to expand to prices as slaves would continue to go down. The value of their most precious asset. Was it stake as was their security? Their safety.

Speaker 2:          48:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          48:47          Second reason, and I'm going to run out of time any minute, I know what I mean. Let me just lay these out. I'm going to name them and I'm going to leave you dangling here.

Speaker 2:          48:57          Uh,

Speaker 1:          49:00          the second is what I will call the fear thesis. The third is what I will call southern nationalism. The fourth is what I will call agrarianism. And the fifth is what I will call the honor thesis. I will resume that argument, uh, when we resume next time. But let me leave you with this. Lincoln does get inaugurated of course, in the midst of this,

Speaker 2:          49:23          yeah.

Speaker 1:          49:23          Inherits a nation divided at the end of his first inaugural speech comes those famous words. Lincoln was of course capable of leaving passages for us to quote and almost everything he delivered in almost everything that he wrote,

Speaker 1:          49:45          but he went to a little Shakespeare at the end of his first inaugural. By the way, at first, inaugural was an olive branch. We will never touch slavery where it already exists. We only intend to stop its expansion. You are our brothers. You are our countrymen. Come back, do not leave us members of a country. He said, cannot divorce. Used a divorce metaphor and then he ended with I am Lowe's to close. We're not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained. It must not break our bonds of affection, the mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot to every living heart well yet swell. The chorus of the Union when again touched is surely they will be by the better angels of our nature. That was beautiful poetry and wishful thinking because in the wake of his nomination, his inauguration, and eventually in the wake of Fort Sumpter for more southern states are going to join the deep south. And I'll pick up that explanation. Why next time. Okay.
