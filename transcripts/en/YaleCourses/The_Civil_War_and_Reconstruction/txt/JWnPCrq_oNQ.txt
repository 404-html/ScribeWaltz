Speaker 1:          00:03          Frederick douglass gave a speech in 1875 that gives us a question that we might keep in mind right through the end of the course. Let's call this Douglas question. It's the speech he gives an 1875 in Washington, D c not the year. It's 1875 he's anticipating it's the 4th of July and he's anticipating the coming year of the u s centennial of independence and he knows there's going to be a big national celebration and it will be, and I'll say something more on that next week, Philadelphia put on an extraordinary exhibition, the nearly one 10th of the American people visited, but Douglas is anticipating this national centennial 10 years after the civil war, and he's worried. He said, the nation of quote, when I'm quoting him with lift to the sky, it's million voices in one grand. Centennial, Hosanna of peace and goodwill to all the white race from golf to lakes and from sea to sea. And as a black citizen, he dreaded the day. He said, listen to his words, it's one of them was racialized speech. This is Douglas ever game. He stayed, he dreaded the day when his words, this great white race has renewed it's vows, the patriotism and flowed back into it's a custom channels.

Speaker 1:          01:41          He was proud, he said to be an American, but he was worried. And then he ended with this question, if war among the whites brought peace and liberty to blacks, what will peace among the whites bring?

Speaker 2:          01:59          Okay,

Speaker 1:          02:00          what would peace among the white brain.

Speaker 2:          02:03          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:04          It's a way of shaping an overall question in Douglas and did it for us as to how and why reconstruction ended up eroding collapsing if you want failing as some say ending. Now, one of the things we're going to begin to examine today and the rest of the course is this question, sorry to keep putting the uh, outline back up. But we are always as historians debating this question of ends. When did reconstruction and uh, there's, we'll see in a moment, many are going to claim it's all over when they pass a 15th amendment. It's what Horace Greeley said. That's 1870. And then there are those who argue reconstruction. Now it really ended in 1873. And the reasons you argue that the horrifying Colfax massacre and Louisiana on Easter Sunday, April 14th, 1873 the largest domestic murder, collective mass murder and all of American history until nine 11

Speaker 2:          03:17          okay.

Speaker 1:          03:17          And the following Supreme Court decision based upon the investigation of that massacre, and I'm going to deal with Colfax next Tuesday.

Speaker 2:          03:26          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:26          Some would argue that really shows us an under reconstruction, but all the southern states weren't yet back under the control of the Democratic Party. So those who are arguing, no, no, no reconstruction doesn't really end until you have the full redemption by the southern Democrats have their state governments, which doesn't occur until the disputed election of 1876 and it's compromise of 1877 and we'll deal with that and a week and a half. But then there are plenty of others now who argued no, no, no reconstruction. Never really ended in the 19th century. Heather Cox Richardson has a book out now, but about the story of reconstruction and its issues moving west in the United States throughout the rest of the 19th century.

Speaker 2:          04:10          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:10          Steve Prince, one of your teaching assistants has a chapter in his dissertation and titled The ends of Reconstruction. He's playing off that irony or that pun of when did it end? Did it ever end?

Speaker 2:          04:22          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:22          Sam Shaffer is going to argue it didn't end until 1912 and his dissertation, I got another, uh, graduate student, Owen Williams, who's writing a dissertation on the Reconstruction Supreme Court and he's arguing that absolutely ended in 1873. This is the sort of inside baseball that historians love to play mean your Dayton and fight over it. We tell the world dates don't matter and we love to fight over them.

Speaker 2:          04:52          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          04:54          I'm probably going to do what I usually do, which is leave you with a good deal of ambiguity about that. In some ways, reconstruction has never ended. Now think with me for a moment though, back on the ground in the south, uh, about this question of the real lives of the Freedman, the Trans formations to New Labor arrangements, this vexing, naughty, chaotic, uh, in some ways, terrible process by which slave labor converted to free labor and ultimately into sharecropping as a system. In which approximately 80% of all the Friedman found themselves essentially myered in as early as the late 1860s and surely by the 1870s and throughout the rest of that century.

Speaker 2:          05:57          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:58          One of the greatest memoirs we have, it's an odd kind of memoir, but one of the greatest memoirs we have by a sharecropper, and I don't know if you've ever read this book, and of course it gets widely taught often an African American history courses is the autobiography of Neat Shark. All old gods dangerous. His real name was ned cob. Name was changed, I guess to protect him in the title. It's an extraordinary series of hundreds of hours of interviews. Uh, the Ted Rosengarten did with him some 25 years ago. Now, Ned Cobb lived a very, very long life and in the middle of the 20th century. But he grew up a sharecropper and there are a thousand nuggets of wisdom or the secrets from his past as he often calls him, that Ned carb Shaw has to give us. There's this honest section about how he never got an education and now he resents that he never got an education and how he resents actually it his father never even sought to help get him an education. I didn't never get out of the first reader, got no education to speak of. And another hurt addition to that weren't no colored schools through here. And this is central Alabama worth no count. You might find a school close to town somewhere that accommodated the colored. And if you did, you'd doing, you were doing well, said Ned.

Speaker 1:          07:41          My daddy when he had the opportunity, never did send me to school long enough to learn to read. If you send his children, he'd have to supplement the teacher's salary. But if he don't, but if he don't send his children, it don't cost him nothing. And there's nothing said. None of my brothers and sisters, not one by name, got a good book learning and all I can do, I can put down on papers, some little old figures, but I can add them up. Well, ned went on to be a a landowner and one of the most moving passages in this book comes toward the end when he buys his first mule, when he puts his first stinking smelly mule and his own stable. It's like a religious experience. Smelling a mule is not exactly my idea of of religious experience, but it was to ned. But he really is hard on his father.

Speaker 1:          08:51          It's an honest, honest illustration. I've heard the sons and daughters of the freedmen and now it is the son of a former slave we're inheriting so little. I mentioned the other day that what the Friedman had was some human capital, their skills, their bodies, their labor, their dreams, their religion, their ideas, their self worth, the dignity. But they had so little physical capital, they owned nothing. And I had no money, no credit. So few ways of getting any physical capital. He goes on and on and on. I won't quote it, but he continually refers to what he called his father's old slavery thoughts. He complains about how his father never learned how to put up any money, never learned to save anything. And that he didn't learn it very well either. In fact, here's what he says, he said, my daddy was blindfolded, didn't look to the future just throwing him, I'm sorry for the direct language here, just throwing his money in a dead hogs ass and taking shit. Sorry about that on the video.

Speaker 1:          10:19          But Ned cobb's directness is useful. It's in the face of those kinds of obstacles. It we contain, we call them that. Nevertheless, thousands upon thousands of Friedman embraced in education and embrace the hope that literacy could bring. And let me focus on that just briefly. At least mired in the system of sharecropping, working on halves, giving half of their crop to the land owner and half the crop they would keep and hopefully get cashed, but then that cash had to be spent down at the furnishing merchant to get seeds and get tools and get food. Excuse me, clothing. Nevertheless, in the face of all of this, one of the things a Freeman most wanted was this book learning the net carb never gone. Well. We know about slave literacy and Friedman's literacy is essentially this. At the end of the civil war, probably 5% maybe 7% to eight of the American slaves were literate by 1870 that had increased to perhaps 12 to 15%

Speaker 3:          11:36          and

Speaker 1:          11:38          that was due of course to the Friedman schools to the, to the Freedmen's bureau schools. There were tremendous accomplishments in these Freedmen's bureau schools. They created over 4,000 of them. There were some 93 teachers at one time or another employed and Freeman's bureau schools up into the 1870s they had at one point, slightly more than a quarter million students in these schools, Freedman, young and old, 68 72 year old former slaves would sit down in the same room with eight year olds and begin to try to read out of the same reader.

Speaker 2:          12:18          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:19          And there were in some ways nothing more threatening to white southerners. Actually, there were two things most threatening to white southerners around which this southern counterrevolution will be forged. One was the black school, black literacy education, the potential of mobility and the education, particularly of a black political leadership class. And then con. And then on the other hand, directly related of course was the creation of black politics itself. As we'll see in a moment, one of the major targets of the Ku Klux Klan, the knights of the White Chameleon and all the other imitating groups that imitated these were black schools. Dozens and dozens of black schools were burned to the ground by the Klan between 1868 in the middle of the 1870s.

Speaker 1:          13:19          I want to just read just one little example of what these schools meant to people. Uh, I love this little letter because of the assumption, the, let's call it audacity of hope, if you'll want, forgive the title. This comes from a black school principal whose name was PB Randolph. He's running a Friedman school in New Orleans in 1866. They named it for William Lloyd garrison. It's called the garrison school. He has 373, uh, pupils and he has seven teachers, uh, five of them black, two of them white. And this was, this was the revolution, the potential revolution of reconstruction. And he writes this letter to himself, William Lloyd garrison asking for garrison to help them get what they need. Just a small excerpt of it. We are proud of our pupils and feel you will rejoice with us. We feel also that you will not take a miss if we ask a little assistance from Boston in the shape of apparatus to illustrate astronomy, a gyroscope and a microscope, a numerical frame, conic sections, cube root blocks, a magnet, and such other instruments as will enable us to fight this battle for our race against ignorance. Send us the simplest implements to teach some science and a thousands of those such letters all over the record. Literacy among blacks increase to over 80%. Um, uh, by 1880, I'm sorry, over 20% by 1880 and probably 25 to 30%. These things are very difficult to measure by the turn of the 20th century. Now you need to know one other thing here by the 1880 [inaudible] 1890 [inaudible] turn of the 20th century literacy rates among southern whites.

Speaker 3:          15:31          We're not that much higher. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:38          Remember one thing above all else about these new economic social arrangements taking hold from 1866 right on through the 1870s in the south share cropping emerge. This is the argument share cropping emerged essentially as a kind of compromise result of a tug of war between two kinds of interests. Blacks wanted autonomy. They want out of gangs. They wanted their women out of the field. They wanted some control over their economic lives. White folks, the owners, land owners wanted labor to control a stationary dependent poor

Speaker 3:          16:30          labor force.

Speaker 1:          16:33          Both sides end up embracing tenant farming sharecropping because it was such a desperately cash poor society. Landowners didn't want to rent to blacks because they knew in the long run blacks wouldn't get enough cash to pay the rent. Blacks realized quickly they couldn't depend on cash because there wasn't enough. They therefore themselves began to resist wages because they get promised wages and they wouldn't get paid. So share cropping this system that ultimately becomes a frosty and bargain and a dead end and a kind of tragic no exit for the vast majority was nevertheless something they actually negotiated and embraced themselves.

Speaker 3:          17:21          No.

Speaker 1:          17:23          Also on the ground in south emerging out of radical reconstruction as the southern states were put under the first reconstruction act and the subsequent reconstruction acts, what took place in the south was the creation of new state governments run by the Republican party in every former confederate state, at least at first all the acts confederate states were readmitted to the union between 80 and 68 and 1870 Georgia was the last, but by 1870 all 11 x confederate states are back in the union, but they're back in the union. Remember under that radical reconstruction plan. Now this story that's set in about this over the years from the loss cause ideology of the late 19th century to the writings of the so called dunning school of the turn of the 20th century and early 20th century, based on the writings of William h dunning and his many, many students he trained at Columbia University was this idea that what what happened in the south now was essentially carpet bag rule or rule by bayonet or rule by blacks.

Speaker 1:          18:49          Now in the history books we've come to call us for decades, the myth of carpet bag rule. This idea that the south was colonized, taken over by northerners and move south white northerners and move south, uh, plying appealing to exploiting and manipulating the black vote to take over the south to disenfranchise and eliminate white southerners from their own policy. Now this much is true in every former confederate state. The so called radical constitutions did manage to create all sorts of new levels. If you like, of democracy, small d, The number of elective offices increase. It was more direct election, more direct control for people in the south had ever seen. There were more people voting, more constituencies and more people holding office. We'll see in a second, there was more home rule for local governments than they'd ever experienced before. These new radical constitutions. Yes, indeed had eventually a fair degree of corruption.

Speaker 1:          20:07          This was the age of spoils and the kinds of corruption going on in southern state governments was no difference in the kinds of corruption going on in many other places in the country. But there were many social provisions in these new constitutions as long as they lasted. And they lasted seven, eight and nine years in some ex confederate states and they only lasted three to three and four years. And others, uh, for the first time there were social provisions. They not only did away with the black codes, but they established a certain degree of equal civil rights. Some of these new state governments actually pass the civil rights acts. Many of the made it the state's responsibility now to for the first time in southern history. And for that matter, there wasn't much of it is in the north either to provide for the sick, the insane, the disabled, the poverty stricken.

Speaker 2:          21:01          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          21:02          Above all else, they created public schools. The first public schools, the south I'd ever seen. South Carolina had the first comprehensive school law of any southern state passed an 1870 by 1871 they had 32% of people have school age attending some 1700 public schools in South Carolina, blacks and whites, and by 1875 the South Carolina public schools system, creative, other radical republican regime had 50% this is still a rural society and a society riven with problems of race and violence is, we'll see it had 50 probating 75 they had 50% of school age population of South Carolina in school with over 3000 teachers paid by public tax money. Now, the one thing of course, that virtually no southern radical republican southern regime ever accomplished was much in the way of any kind of economic and redistribution of land redistribution. This is our classic problem of reconstruction. How could you advance political liberty, the right to vote, the whole office serve on juries. Run legislatures.

Speaker 2:          22:28          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          22:28          And yet why does economic liberty always, always, always lag behind? Now there were some attempts, however, let me give you just one little example. I don't think phone or really even mentioned to this again, South Carolina, which had a black majority of its legislature for about five years during reconstruction as well as a political revolution. And you can see why white southerners who were organizing against it, but the South Carolina legislature run by blacks, by blacks and white Republicans, some of them native born southerners, some of them from the north created a South Carolina Land Commission.

Speaker 1:          23:12          They created it in 1868 it actually is going to last all the way to 1890 on the books. It, it, it, uh, it's settled some 5,000 South Carolina families, black and white on land that the state purchased or took over, confiscated in effect, and then began to sell to its own citizens on longterm loans at very reduced interest. Approximately $225,000 out of $802,000 eventually it could not be accounted for. There was, there was some fraud and corruption in the South Carolina Land Commission about a quarter of the money that they actually distributed, never was accounted for, but it's extremely important to note here that at least an attempt was made here was the, at least the possibility of radical reconstruction by 1876 that land commission in South Carolina by 76 republican still barely controlled the South Carolina state government. They're about to lose it. That year, [inaudible] 80 76 about 14,000 families had participated, a total of about 70,000 people, about 60% black, 40% white in actually buying land. By 1884 more blacks were losing land in South Carolina. However, then we're buying it.

Speaker 2:          24:54          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          24:55          I'll give you one last little number to show at least what the possibilities had been. In the census of 1890 about 13,000 blacks in South Carolina owned the farm of some signs for thousand of whom had purchased them through that land commission. Now we're always talking about the possibilities, the experiments of reconstruction. What if, what if, what if, what if it had been more enforcement? What has it been more military occupation? What if, what if the Klan and its imitators had truly been crushed? All the other crushed this kind of land commission is one example among others of the kinds of efforts that could have

Speaker 2:          25:44          flourished. Now

Speaker 1:          25:50          in those state governments in the south, you had for the first time in American history and in a kind of a explosion of political activity, you had black elected officials, approximately 2000 African Americans in the southern states served in state legislatures and state government and executive positions. And ultimately in the U S Congress, 16 African Americans from x confederate states were elected to the u s Congress to, to the u s senate, Hiram revels from Mississippi being the first black senator in American history. And how many times do you hear in our political culture today? Uh, the first black since reconstruction, the first this since reconstruction, the first of that, the first black governor since reconstruction was Doug Wilder in Virginia. The first this and the first that since reconstruction, it's because there was this explosion of black political activity for a short period of time, decade really until the lights went out.

Speaker 2:          26:59          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          27:00          of the 1000 delegates to constitutional writing conventions in 1868 69 when these new state governments were created of about the thousand delegates that participated in writing those new constitution, 268 of them were blind. About 680 African Americans served in the lower houses of state governments during reconstruction for presided as speakers of those houses that were 112 African Americans and served in state senates during reconstruction. There were at least 41 black sheriffs somewhere in one of the 11 x confederate states. There were five black mayors of southern cities for awhile. There were 145 blacks is heard on city councils and so on and so on.

Speaker 2:          27:51          Now

Speaker 1:          27:53          this is the heart of the myth of carpet bag rule. The claim against these people in the south, at least in the white south, was always they were not prepared. They were ignorant. All they did is sit around eating chicken bones and spitting in the Gold's platoons that they bought with public money. And if you've ever seen birth of a nation, a DW Griffith's, a white supremacist epic of 1915 he plays out that scene at great length of, of the black politicians in state legislatures would their boots up on tables, literally chewing on chicken bones and spitting in this platoons and laughing and playing happy Darcie until the cows come home.

Speaker 2:          28:41          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          28:44          There were corrupt black politicians and there were a corrupt white politicians. I don't really have time to go into all the great biographical stories of the Robert Smalls is and the John Roy Robert smalls as a South Carolina and the John Roy Lynch's of Mississippi and, and so many others who, many of whom were former slaves, all the, some of them had been free before the war by their own purchase, by manumission mission, by other means. Some of them, only a small percentage. We're northern born blacks who moved south like Hiram revels and eventually got himself elected to the Senate. By the way, just recently, well, I guess it was buddy years ago when the Republicans had control of the Senate, they put up a portrait for the first time of Hiram revels. Our Modern Republican party wanted to claim him. He wasn't Republican. So are they by name? Uh, but anyway there is now today a portrait of Hiram revels.

Speaker 1:          29:44          It took a century more to get it there, but he's finally up in the u s senate, his picture. Now, the other side of this myth of carpet bag rule, and I want to be a little speedy about this, but it's also very important this again this the story, the deep myth that set into American culture for generations, is it all these reconstruction governments really where we're a bunch of Yankees who came south, got themselves elected with black votes and ran these governments and oppressive white southerners. So who were these carpetbaggers so-called the term got into our language and now today anybody who grows up in one state but somehow moves to another and tries to get elected as Hillary Clinton did in New York. And there are plenty of other example is labeled a carpet bagger at least for 10 years or so until she's lived there long enough and gets reelected and I guess I guess you got to get reelected before you no longer a carpet bagger.

Speaker 1:          30:49          What many of these northern isn't one south were former union soldiers. Most of them went before 1867 and 68 before these radical republican regimes were put in place. They want to become farmers. They went to because of the land was so cheap and some of them one because I liked the climate, there were New Hampshire rights, so went to Mississippi because it was warm. Some carpet baggers were industrialists, investors. They saw the south. Now is the place to invest. It obviously was, it was prostate and it needed money. Some are federal agents, Freedmen's bureau agents and stayed and lived there. Many were teachers, some of them stayed and lived if they survive and weren't killed. Some were political opportunists and some were adventurers. A ne'er do wells and I'll never forget as long as I live. One of the best friends I have in the world is a Methodist minister in Chicago who grew up in Mississippi and east Texas. Gene Winkler and a positively brought, he's one of the best read human beings I've ever known. He worries more about the civil war than I do. I used to actually ask him what I should be reading. His real job was being a minister, but he spent most of his time reading and he was one of the most politically radical people I've ever known. I mean, he was still trying to be a socialist during Reaganism.

Speaker 1:          32:19          But one day I asked gene as gene, why do you keep that picture of stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee? And the corner of your office said, you know what, I'm not exactly sure, but it's probably because carpet baggers killed my great granddaddy. I don't think he said, God damn carpet baggers. He's a good Methodist carpet baggers. Killed my great granddaddy.

Speaker 3:          32:52          I said, Whoa, okay.

Speaker 1:          32:58          Like so many southerners, he was a complicated mixture of memories. Uh, and, uh, well enough on gene. I actually got the thrill, uh, some years ago to write an essay epilogue to Fitz Brundage, his book of essays called where these memories grow about southern memory. And I opened the piece with that very story. I was always worried about how gene was going to interpret it.

Speaker 3:          33:26          Any thank God liked it, I think. Anyway,

Speaker 1:          33:33          at no time did carpet baggers ever make up anywhere near a majority of any southern legislature

Speaker 3:          33:42          in the x confederate states. Their goals tended to be financial, economic and to some extent political. And then there's this other kind of southerner. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          33:55          The white indigenous southern or the native born white southerner known to history of course is scalawags who joined the republican part. Yeah. Who became part of these reconstruction regimes who said give up the past, give up the old cars. And they often became the object of the iron and the hatred and the violence

Speaker 3:          34:19          of white vigilante groups as readily as anyone else. Now

Speaker 1:          34:29          what was the scale away?

Speaker 2:          34:34          Uh,

Speaker 3:          34:37          well let me tell you the ways. Hold on. Sorry. We're good. Me got it. Now.

Speaker 1:          34:50          Galloway Egg. So a scallywag is, by the way, our runty little horse. That's actually what it means. If you look it up, it's a runty little horse. I kind of useless a little horse. It doesn't work very well for you. Just gets in the way, stinks and smells and doesn't pay his way

Speaker 1:          35:07          are scallywag is the local leper of the community. Wrote a Tuscaloosa, Alabama newspaper editor in 1869 unlike the carpet bagger, he is native, which is so much the worse. Once he was respected in his circle, his head was level and we would look his name and he would look as neighbor in the face. Now possessed of the itch of office and the salt room of radicalism. He is a mangy dogs. Slinking the alleys haunting the governor's office defiling with tobacco juice, the steps of the capitol stretching his lazy carcass in the sun on the square or the benches of the mayor's court. That's relatively direct.

Speaker 1:          35:58          Scalawags were considered, in other words, turncoats. Now they had a variety of social backgrounds, some worth sort of former. Nobody's, but most of them were actually quite prominent people like the wartime confederate. And governor of Georgia Josephy Brown who said, give up the cars and joined the Republican Party after the war. Perhaps the most famous of all, James Longstreet Lee's second in command. In the last two years of the war, long streets of Georgia moved out to Louisiana after the war embraced the Republican Party, said the war had settled something and the southerners had to face it. And he became a railroad president and he even for awhile commanded US troops in Louisiana who tried to kill off the clan. There are many, many other examples. Um, there's James settle of North Carolina. He's one of my favorites. Um, and these were fascinating people. Um, courageous people. A saddle of North Carolina had been a member of the confederate congress. He'd been a big player in confederate politics in North Carolina. But after the war, he said this, the war had brought a general breaking up. He said of old ideas taking a new start in the world. We are, if we are ever to have prosperity and any concluded, I tell you, Yankees and Yankee notions are just what we want in this country. Now we want their capital to build factories in workshops and railroads. We want their intelligence, their energy and enterprise to operate factories and to teach us how to do it.

Speaker 1:          37:47          Settle, nearly was killed for his views, his actions, his political actions in particular or many other examples. Uh, Amos t Ackerman and Georgia, uh, among others. Look up him and phoner. Uh, if you like. Now I guess the only other thing I want to say about that is there were a carpet bag governors, there were northern born Republicans who ended up governors of southern states. Several of them. There were northern born members of southern state legislatures, some black, some white, and they became many instances the most ready,

Speaker 3:          38:36          um, targets of what was to come. No. Ah, there we are.

Speaker 1:          38:51          I don't know how well you can see this painting. I'll try to blow it up. It doesn't have a date on it, unfortunately. Uh, yeah. I need to figure that out. It is entitled Disfranchisement, which is an interesting title. If you can see on the right, you can see about every kind of a image of a, of a, of a bitter, angry Hayden, the eyes southerner, some sitting on the Canon, others in Ku Klux Klan robes and masks. All of them. Of course looking at the lone black Friedman. Go on your first look. It almost looks like he's holding a machete, but he's not. He's holding a voting role

Speaker 3:          39:44          now

Speaker 1:          39:46          the southern white counterrevolution the move towards southern redemption, which simply means of course the dumber, the southern Democratic Party taking back control of their states between 1870 and 1876 is rooted in their hatred there resentment of the rise of black political and economic independence.

Speaker 3:          40:16          Now,

Speaker 1:          40:18          but first of all, go with me back to Washington and then we'll end at least today back on the ground in the south and try to understand where some of this violence is coming from.

Speaker 3:          40:29          The 15th Amendment Task Congress, the 15th now pass Congress

Speaker 1:          40:36          in the spring, late spring of 1869

Speaker 3:          40:42          okay.

Speaker 1:          40:42          It's right after you listen to it. As grant is inaugurated, president elected in the fall and inaugurated in the spring by 1868 11 of the 21 northern states still denied the right to vote to blacks. You'll remember Republican's are stepping around this question of black suffrage in the north, but they want to plant it into the south, but the trick was what kind of amendment would it be? This is the great voting rights amendment.

Speaker 3:          41:13          Okay.

Speaker 1:          41:14          They went through three versions of, of the 15th Amendment, looked this up and phone. Make sure you understand this. They went through three versions in the debate in Congress as to what kind of voting rights amendment to put in the constitution. The first version, and they went from most conservative to most radical. The first version for bade states the right to deny suffrage on grounds of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. That's all it said. That's the most conservative version. The second version would have four bay, four bades states to impose literacy property or Nativity qualifications. In other words, that whole array of qualifications, tests that will ultimately be used all over the south to prevent black folk from voting and to some extent poor white folk.

Speaker 1:          42:12          And then it was a third version was simply would have affirms simply that all male citizens 21 years of age and older had the right to vote, period. Now they debated and debated, but the one they passed of course was the first one, the most conservative, the one that made absolutely no mention of the possibility of qualifications test. And so the 15th amendment has two kinds of of of impact to great importance is if you want. One is that it was passed at all and it's hugely important. But the other of course is it was a very conservative compromise. The men left the door open to all kinds of machinations over time in states at the local level about qualifications

Speaker 2:          43:04          to vote.

Speaker 1:          43:08          It passed the House of Representatives in March, 1869 it finally was ratified by two thirds of the state legislatures in the United States. A full year later in the spring of 1870 and many people now looked at the situation in the country a year into grants presidency. The man, the Republican who said, let us have peace. You've got the 13th amendment abolishing slavery. You've got the 14th amendment establishing the citizenship rights and equal protection before the law. At least the beginnings of this fledgling thing called civil rights.

Speaker 1:          43:54          You've got the reconstruction acts in place. Southern states have all been brought back into the union. By 1870. Georgia was still being sort of weirdly adjudicated, but it finally was brought back in in 1870 and now comes the voting rights act. And throughout the history of, of modern, uh, know modern political philosophy and modern political history. The idea was that the vote, you know, it was the essence of democracy. And so once you've given people the vote on some level, what else could you possibly do? Republicans now say to themselves that they have established the principle, oh, would that the head of guaranteed rights and that they could go no further. One Republican wrote to another after voting for this, he said, this is the last great point that remains to be settled from the issues of the war and Horace Greeley famously in his New York Herald Tribune in April, 1870 after the ratification of the 15th Amendment said quote let us have done with reconstruction, was the opening line of, of, of under a big headline a lot of us have done with reconstruction. The country is tired and sick of it. Let us have peace. It's over. It's done.

Speaker 1:          45:31          Said official Republican Party people to themselves. Of course, the white south for two years already through it's rising and growing Democratic Party and its violent militant wings is saying, you bet reconstruction is over. Let us show you the ways. Now I'm actually going to save the violence story for an entire lecture on its own. Uh, the clan, it's many actions, examples through the Colfax massacre at least of 1873 for next Tuesday. But let me leave you with this. What happens now? What is already happening now in the first grant administration by 1870 is what we might simply call, it's the waning of radicalism. It's the waning of that, that civic vision, his phone, or calls it in your book of the radical Republicans ideology. And what was that vision phone or lays it all out for you. He said the radical Republicans had an essential ideological vision. On the one hand, it was unionism. On the other hand, it was routed to some extent and trying to create racial equality because the ward necessitated it and forced it on them. They therefore were, were believers in this idea of guaranteed rights within the constitution. And last but not least, they were believers in positive activists, central government.

Speaker 1:          47:12          And you put those three or four principals together and you've got the package that was the civic vision of the radical Republicans. But the problem is that vision is now going to crumble, um, as fast, almost as fast as it ever came into existence. In fact, it's going to crumble faster than it ever came in to existence. I want to leave you with this.

Speaker 1:          47:48          It's not just going to crumble because Republicans are sort of give up the game and it's not going to just crumble because that is Stevens dies and Charles Sumner is out of the way and radicals don't really run this party underground anymore. It's going to crumble because of the most widespread use of political violence in American history. We'll return to this question next Tuesday bid. Let me leave you with this. There is no African American writer and some white writers worth their salt from the 1870s and eighties right on through, into well into the 20th century who could ever avert their eyes from this story. This is a passage from James Weldon. Johnson is the autobiography of an ex colored man. If you've ever read that wonderful 1912 novel, you'll know it's the story of a black man is passing for white, but because he's passing in the south, he gets to see things that people don't know he's seen. And of course the book ends is so many books did in this time with a lynching.

Speaker 1:          48:53          This is x colored man who doesn't have any other name describing what he sees. A railroad tie was sunk into the ground. The rope was removed, and a chain Broughton securely coiled around the victim and the stake there. He stood a man only informing stature. His eyes were full and vacant, indicating not a single ray of thought. Fuel was brought from everywhere. Oil, the torch, the flames crouched for an instant as though to gather strength then leaped up as high as the victim's head. He squirmed, he rides, he strained at his chains, then gave out cries and groans that I show always here. His eyes bulging from their sockets, roll from side to side, appealing in vain for help. I was fixed to the spot where I stood powerless to take my eyes from what I did not want to see. We have never wanted to see what really happened in the south and the 1870s but we'll try.
