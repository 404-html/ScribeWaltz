Speaker 1:          00:12          Good morning. I'm going to talk today about turning points and on Thursday about turning points and beyond that probably about turning points, but let me lay out right now my own sort of selective list, short list of the most important turning points in the civil war. Make the list and then we will come back to them. Now this is any military historians or any civil war historians, guests of course, but uh, there's no question that the Antietam campaign of 1862 is a major turning point in the civil war and I'll select that as my first. There are things happening before that that are terribly important, like the saving of Richmond against Mcclellan's peninsula campaign in June, July of 62 but it is this first invasion of the north by Robert E. Lee culminating in the bloodiest single day of the civil war, over 5,000 dead, 23,000 casualties in eight hours on fields along a little creek in south western Maryland that not only stopped this first major invasion of the north and this threat of a southern army to northern soil, northern resources and northern cities.

Speaker 1:          01:41          But it of course resulted in Lincoln's emancipation proclamation, which transformed the purpose of the war on both sides. Back to that, and the second, the second major turning point in the war, militarily I'd argue as most people do, was the battle of Gettysburg and July of 1863 and the day after the three day's battle at Gettysburg, the bloodiest encounter of the entire war. If you add up the three days casualties of almost 56,000 dead and wounded in three days, that invasion of the not that battle of course stopped least second invasion of the north. And we'll come to that in a moment, at least in brief terms. On the day after tickets charge at Gettysburg on the 4th of July, 1863 the kind of citadel and river town or city of Fredericksburg, excuse me, Vicksburg, Mississippi fell to union forces after a siege of nearly six months. When grant took Vicksburg and the 4th of July in 1863 it virtually opened up the entire river to union control cut geographically the confederacy in half. It isolated Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas from the rest of the confederacy. It was without a question at least in long in the longterm, a decisive turning point in the war in the west.

Speaker 2:          03:22          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:23          A third major turning point I'd argue is the fall of Atlanta in September, 1864 and we'll come back to that later on after the break.

Speaker 1:          03:36          A fourth major turning point in the war politically without any question, I think is the election of 1864 the only time in modern history that a republic attempted the whole day, general election in the midst of civil war and succeeded in doing it. The reelection of Lincoln in 1864 was absolutely crucial to the prosecution of the war to the ends is the Lincoln administration at least by then had determined to fight it, but without the fall of Atlanta first week of September, 1864 is not at all clear. Lincoln would have been reelected and more on that later. And then fifth, you could argue, I would argue the greatest single turning point in the civil war deeply related to these military battle. Front affairs is emancipation. The emancipation of 4.2 million American slaves in the midst of eventually all out near total war by the north on the south to destroy southern society and its institutions transformed American history more than just transforming a war.

Speaker 2:          04:56          Okay?

Speaker 1:          04:58          That's the theme of this lecture and Thursday's lecture and even to some extent beyond it is those results beyond the battlefield that ultimately it is our obligation to understand. It's important. It's an obligation to understand why the battle of Antietam turned the way it did and it's an obligation done. Just stay on why Lee is invading the northwest second time in 1863 and why or that encounter at Gettysburg turned out the way it did, but by then it is a war being fought for something very different and much, much larger than I had been at the outset. One way into this story is a very simple quotation. In one of those interviews held with former slaves and the WPA oral history narratives in the 1930s these were the interviews over 3000 of them done with slaves. Many of them in their eighties some even in their nineties a guy named Cornelius Garner was interviewed in 1937 at age 91 he was asked if he had fought in the civil war and Cornelius replied to his interviewer, who was the black interview or in this case, did I fight in the war? Well, if I hadn't, you wouldn't be sitting there within, you wouldn't be sitting there right in that me today.

Speaker 1:          06:31          He then went on to describe a corner of his native Norfolk, Virginia were slave auctions used to be conducted on New Year's Day. That day, New Year's Day said, Garner should be kept by all the colored people. That is the day of freedom and day, and they ought to remember Frederick Douglass to Frederick Douglass told Abe Lincoln give to black man guns and let him fight. And a Blinken say, if I give him a gun when it come to battle, he might run in Frederick Douglass say triumph and you'll win the war. And Abe said, all right, I'll try them. Oh, that's a simplistic homespun explanation for emancipation came about. Oh, 180,000 African Americans will end up in the union armies. But old Cornelius Cornelius wasn't entirely wrong. All right. Back to Virginia in 1862, I'll put the outline backup if we need it.

Speaker 2:          07:54          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:03          Uh, I don't know if you can see all of that, but I hope you can see some of it. I left you with Mcclellan's army on the peninsula having been defeated. I thought I'd show you a couple of magnificent Matthew Brady photographs. Photography of course finally come into its own. The civil war would be the first major event in world history to be photographed on a large scale. And it's in part what made Ken Burns film possible, especially the use of that camera. They now have the can go into an old, the girl type, which isn't any bigger than this and make it seem like a giant panorama. This is a photograph taken behind union troops overlooking, um,

Speaker 1:          08:51          the Cumberland River and May, 1862. That's before the, of the seven days. That's during the march by Mcclellan's army up the peninsula. This is this. I don't know how well you can see that, but that's an absolutely stunning photograph of a union wagon train. I one of these, a makeshift bridges. They would build these things in a few hours over all these rivers, which in May of 1862 were flooding constantly. It's union troops crossing. Um, the Chickahominy river just east to Richmond, May, 1862. Now what happened next of course was in a Zuora. I left. You was least fateful decision to not stay in, just defend Richmond. So not just leave the war in central Virginia having defeated or held back Mcclellan's army and with a certain degree of confidence in McAllen probably would be McClellan and not move. He decided to invade the north. Now other, we're a high, you know, all these high level councils of war and Richmond between Jefferson Davis, Lee and his generals. There are arguments for and against it. But Lee won the day in the argument and he went West behind the Blue Ridge mountains and invaded the north through the upper part of the Shenandoah valley. The goal of which was to not attack Washington DC by any means. I think I have a better map possibly.

Speaker 1:          10:34          Hm. Yeah. Maybe that helps a little better not to attack Washington or necessarily to even threaten Philadelphia directly. Lee had no intention of taking over in the northern cities. He couldn't do that in other resources, and I'm an army big enough. How would he have occupied them? But what he most wanted to do, the aim of this invasion was wanting to take the war out of ravaged Virginia two to threaten northern cities, especially the US Capitol three to try to bring about, and Great Britain was on the brink of this, and I'll come back to that foreign policy diplomatic story a bit later, but Great Britain was truly on the brink of near recognition, at least a kind of quasi recognition of the confederacy. And the theory here was that as a confederate forces could win a major victory somewhere on northern soil, get into Pennsylvania, do it twice over live off the land, possibly even forced evacuation of the US Capitol. That news of that in Great Britain might bring about British recognition of the confederacy is a legitimate government and especially give the confederacy access to its navy, if not even the possibility of ground forces. And by the way, a British force had already been sent to Canada in early 1862 for the possibility of intervention in the American civil war.

Speaker 2:          12:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:14          Now, there was also a theory here at work that it's going to be dead wrong. Lee believed, as did other confederate leaders, that in Maryland in particular, there was a great deal of confederate sympathy and sentiment and a lot of young Maryland men. The theory was eager to join the confederate forces if they could just get out of Maryland and that marching confederate army was going to attract them. At least that was the theory. The problem was

Speaker 1:          12:47          when young men actually saw that confederate army there were appalled because that confederate army then invaded a across the Potomac river. They cross the Potomac on September four and September 5th 80 62 was an army that had apparently remarkable, almost miraculous morale. They were winners. They adjust, defeated a union army with Mcclellan's whole force, whole force still back on the peninsula. The 40 to 50,000 union troops still guarding Washington DC. We're decisively, horribly defeated in the battle of second Manasses the last two days of August 29th and 30th of 1862 that union army retreated once again, fought on the same fields as first bull run, 15, uh, of 13 months earlier retreated in the Washington DC, Washington, DC on September 1st, 1862 it was like a giant field hospital. There were some three to 4,000 wounded union soldiers all over the streets of Washington. Broken army with Mcclellan's army. Now retreating back up the Chesapeake and the Potomac and this huge flotilla trying to get to Washington in case Lee actually attacked Washington,

Speaker 1:          14:06          but the army Lee had was starving. They weren't very well fed and they weren't very well clad. Here's one description of a young Marylander who saw the confederate army. He said it was nothing but quota set a ragamuffins. It seemed as this every, it seemed as if every cornfield and Maryland had been robbed of a scare. Crow is not Hannah, none had any underclothing. My costume consisted of a ragged pair of trousers. This guy apparently join a stained dirty jacket and old slouch hat. The brim tend up with a thorn a bit grim. The blanket over my shoulder, a grease smeared cotton have sack full of apples and corn, a cartridge box full and a musket. I was barefoot. It it had a stone bruise on each foot. There was no one there who would not have been run in by the police had he appeared on the streets of a normal city.

Speaker 1:          15:09          There's plenty of testimony in the record that a lot of young Maryland man came out to see this. Now, famous army of Robert E. Lee took one look or one smell is one put it and went back to their farms. Lee will get almost no real recruits out of Maryland. What they will do in Maryland, however, is capture several hundred slaves and return them or take them to Virginia. They're going to do the same thing in 1863 and the Gettysburg campaign on an even larger scale. Kidnapping was also part of the confederate army's job. Now the battle would not have occurred at Antietam except for the famous, and it's true. Last order. Here's what happened. Lee went into Maryland. The Union army is all around Washington DC. There's really no union army up in Maryland to stopping yet. He divided his army in three parts, three core about 20,000 roughly men each and they were spread out around Maryland, about 20 miles apart over a 60 mile stretch.

Speaker 1:          16:30          Stonewall. Jackson's core was sent to Harper's ferry. The other two core, they were separated at least by 20 miles in between them. These three parts of his army. One of the cardinal rules of the old manuals they were taught in at west point was in the old, uh, in honorees. Germany's a coat, a military manual of conduct. It said never divide your forces and the presence of the enemy. It's exactly what Lee had done. The problem was that the union command was about find out quickly, Lee wrapped orders around three cigars and his courier out to the three corps commanders over the course of more than a day to deliver. The orders with the orders were lost and they were found by a private in an Indiana regiment whose name was BW Mitchell, the 27th, Indiana volunteers to be exact, who picked up this bundle of three cigars with paper wrapped around it.

Speaker 1:          17:35          And he read the orders and at the bottom it said our ele. And he apparently said something like, I've heard of him. And Lee was already a kind of budding legend because of the seven days and because of second Manassas. And he gave it to his colonel who gave it to his brigadier general who quickly gave it to other generals. Lincoln had little choice but to put Mcclellan back in charge. His commander at Second Manassas had been, uh, uh, a general named John Pope would've been thoroughly defeated and it had a nervous breakdown. Seriously. He had a mental breakdown during the second Manassas battle and pope was out of action to say the least, and he would have been put out of action anyway. It's only can put some calling back in command in Washington DC and within hours, Mcclellan was delivered. Lee's orders. This is though there had been a fourth cigar from McClellan claw clothing.

Speaker 1:          18:40          Looked at these orders. Um, but they were discovered by the way, on the 13th of September of [inaudible] 62 we call them, read them by that night. The orders were basically to have all parts of Lee's army concentrate rather slowly but concentrate toward the area of Sharpsburg Maryland, which is right here alone in Tetum creek. Sharpsburg is a little town Tatum's, a little river, but they were to congregate there within the next three to four days. Mcclellan now has at his command about 90,000 troops. If he marched them quickly. He had the opportunity to defeat Lee's army in parts, but Mcclellan was McClellan. He sat on the loss daughter for about two days before he decided whether one whether to believe it to what to do about it. Lee quickly discovered that his orders never reached his commanders and he worried. He sent out new orders to concentrate as fast as possible near Sharpsburg.

Speaker 1:          19:54          Mcallen finally moved slowly from the camps around Washington up toward Sharpsburg. They encountered each other at a place called South Mountain. At the end of the day of the 15th of September, 1862 and a battle of a sort was fought there. It was only a rear guard sort of thing. Lee retreated out of that South Mountain pass down into this little valley around Sharpsburg Maryland, which is just above the Potomac river. And Ali was taking a tremendous risk here because one of those other rules that had been taught was never engage an enemy, at least in full force with a major river behind you. That's exactly what happened. They fought the battle of Antietam and September 17th, 1862, as I already said, the bloody single day of the war. They fought and cornfields if fought across open fields. Um, they fought along a sunken road. Uh, they fought along a famous bridge now known as the Burnside bridge. I have a couple of photographs to show you. They fought along what's known as the Hagger's town road, which along which 48 hours after the battle won a Matthew Brady's photographers took this awful photograph.

Speaker 2:          21:19          Okay,

Speaker 1:          21:19          these are confederate dead. And along that road there are many, many photographs taken. It emptied them. This was another one of union dead lined up for burial align dead probably 75 yards long

Speaker 1:          21:43          and Tim was in no way necessarily a decisive or strategic victory for either side. I want you to see this photograph because of it's irony. You've probably seen this one before. At the end of the day at Antietam, there were about 23,000 casualties on both sides, over 5,000 dead. Then you may remember back on nine 11 and the weight and the immediate aftermath of nine 11 the estimates were over 5,000 dead at the World Trade Center and people were comparing this to Antidem as the bloodiest day of sacrifice in American history. It turned out not to be the case and nevertheless, um, what happened in the wake of Antietam was it Lee Lee's of invasion of the north had been stopped. Now Mclellan missed a tremendous opportunity to, to press the day, and this has always been a debate among military historians and you can read, Oh God, hundreds of pages on this if you care to. It's always been a debate as to whether if Mcclellan and followed this up, could he have literally crushed Lee's army with the Potomac at his back and in effect ended the war. There's surely was that possibility, but the the day at Antietam had been so devastating to both forces that Mcclellan did not move. In fact, he did not move for days. It's also true though, that Mcclellan kept in reserve at Antietam and it was this act, I think more than anything else. It got Lincoln finally to go out there by October 3rd and fire McClellan.

Speaker 1:          23:38          Mcclellan kept about 20,000 of his troops in reserve at Antietam. Always fearing that he was outnumbered. He didn't use them in a military sense at someone like grant Bennet in charge it in Tetum. It is entirely possible. Lee would have been defeated and at least the war in the east ended, but that was not the case. We retreated back into Virginia to fight again. This is a Matthew Brady photograph taken of Lee, of of Lincoln meeting with Mcclellan Mcclellan right here. There's also a famous photo of them sitting in that same tent. You may have seen burns uses it in the series. It was in this meeting that Lincoln went out to meet with Mcclellan to urge him to move to, to push into northern Virginia to push after Lee's army and early autumn or the weather was so good and Mcclellan did not move, and a couple of days after that he was fired and fired for good. All on Mcclellan will not leave history. Of course, he will come back to be the Democratic Party's candidate for president in 1864 against Abraham Lincoln.

Speaker 1:          25:06          Now it is of course in the wake of Antietam that Lincoln issued his emancipation proclamation. Let me turn to that now and explain why and how emancipation became the new cause of the war. Now let's discuss Lincoln for a moment. First, the biggest problem with Abraham Lincoln has always been not a, that isn't how we interpret him, treat him, understand him, use him, which we do constantly. Every president, every American politician, as David Donald once said famously in the 1950s has to get right with Lincoln. Everybody uses it. We twist him all inside out and make them say whatever we want them to say. And there's no American, no other American in our history who has been given credit for more apocryphal quotations and Abraham Lincoln a little later in the course. I'll use a few of them at the end of when we get to the end of the war. But the problem with Lincoln is indeed his ambiguity, the reality of his historical ambiguity. There is a puzzling dualism about him. There are two, at least two seemingly incompatible legends, if you want about Abraham Lincoln. One has him as the kind of awkward storytelling rails, splitting front tier folk hero, everybody's favorite homespun granddaddy with a corncob pipe who might just tell you a little raunchy story.

Speaker 2:          26:56          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:57          And have you chuckling?

Speaker 2:          26:59          Okay.

Speaker 1:          27:00          He's kind of, you know, fun.

Speaker 2:          27:03          Okay.

Speaker 1:          27:04          The other though is the towering political genius, the moral leader, the shaper of a nation's Destiny's savior of the union and the great emancipator. I ain't never quite asked for any of those. Everybody needs to claim him though. There's a brilliant essay on this by a historian named Scott Sandage came out about 10 years ago. It's called a marble house divided. It's all about the Lincoln Memorial. A lot of you've probably been to the Lincoln Memorial. It is America secular temple. Everybody uses it. The Ku Klux Klan is held at rallies at Lincoln's temple. Uh, Martin Luther King gave the dream speech at Lincoln's Temple. It's been used by every extreme of, of American political culture. If you want to claim the nation's attention, go to the nations temple and claim all day. But behind you, he was never very open about himself. Never wrote an autobiography or didn't write many autobiographical sentences. As a matter of fact, didn't live long enough to do that. He was never an abolitionist. He actually had a lot of personal contempt for radical abolitionist. He didn't like a lot of their arguments and he didn't like their tactics and strategies. He was a genius with language on. And there's no question about that. We've never had a president who could use words, who could find the music of words like Lincoln.

Speaker 1:          28:41          He wrote every word and every sentence of every one of his speeches and every one of his great public letters, Jim Macpherson, every once so far as to write an article saying how Lincoln won the war with metaphors. I don't know whether a metaphor can when you were war strongest battalions might be a little more important in the end. Who knows? Is he the symbol? Oh, a man who held back emancipation as a white supremacist or is he the symbol of the man who outgrew his prejudices and those of his time to become the amounts of pater. Oh, was he just the shrewd politician kind of finding the middle ground and seeing how the wind was going to blow if you tried this or if he threw up that balloon or if he tried that? No.

Speaker 2:          29:43          There are many ways to reflect on Lincoln. My own favorite expression about him and thousands of these, my own favorite comes from Web Dubois, the great black scholar of the 20th century who I think really captured all sides of Lincoln in one quotation. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          30:01          This was two boys and an editorial. He wrote in 1922 in the crisis magazine. He wrote it at the time of the unveiling of the Lincoln Memorial. He also wrote it at a time when he was fed up with all of the national honoring and celebration of Robert E. Lee. So it may have been that that celebration of Lee, which disgusted Dubois may have had something to do with how he wrote this expression about Lincoln. This was Dubois on Lincoln quote. I love him. Not because he was perfect, but because he was not perfect and yet triumphed. There was something left so that at the crisis, he was big enough to be inconsistent, cruel, merciful, peace, loving a fighter, despising negroes and letting them fight and vote, protecting slavery and freeing slaves. He was a man, a big inconsistent, brave man.

Speaker 2:          31:06          Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:06          I'd argue my friends that, uh, the, the most important thing you can grasp it, but Abraham Lincoln is that he had the capacity for growth. He was big enough to be inconsistent,

Speaker 2:          31:20          okay.

Speaker 1:          31:21          Or as Emerson once put it, consistency is the Hobgoblin was simple minds number, all that language about flip flopping. And the 2004 election, one of the candidates was alleged to have been a flip flopper all the time. Well, if Abraham Lincoln hadn't been a flip flopper, we wouldn't have had the emancipation proclamation. So here's the flip flopping. Lincoln's early record on slavery is interesting, is early as 1837 he was one of only two representatives in the Illinois legislature to vote against the resolution declaring the right of slave ownership. He was 28 years old at that time.

Speaker 2:          32:01          Okay.

Speaker 1:          32:01          Is One two year term in the House of Representatives during that term, which was a Mexican war, he found himself appall that the slave trade district of Columbia, you could go visit slave auctions. As I said before, I think two, three blocks down the street from the capitol. He called that slave market quota, sort of Negro lived livery stable. We're droves of Negroes are collected temporarily. Captain finally taken to southern markets precisely like droves of horses.

Speaker 2:          32:31          Okay.

Speaker 1:          32:32          He also sat during that same term. If the Negro is a man, why then my ancient faith teaches me that all men are created equal and that there can be no moral rights in connection with one man's making, a slave of another.

Speaker 2:          32:49          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          32:50          At the same time, Lincoln though was a Henry Clay wig. He was a supporter of the compromise of 1850 he believed in compensation, the slave owners as a way, a hope of setting up some kind of gradual emancipation plan

Speaker 1:          33:09          and he believed as Henry Clay had founded it and this idea, at least he did for a while. This idea of colonization of sending blacks either to Africa or to the Caribbean or to Central America. I don't have time to stop on the those fabulous Lincoln Douglas debates where you can find every extreme of Abraham Lincoln. I was once given an assignment, you know, junior seminars and undergraduate, oh, Fred Williams at Michigan state sent us to the Lincoln collected papers and he said, your assignment is to come back with one passage demonstrating that Lincoln was antislavery on believing in emancipation and come back with one passage. Just showing that he was a white supremacist, not growing up a Lincoln lover. And I thought, oh dear, that's like, you know, you've been raised in a certain religion and somebody says, go read the Bhagavad Gita or you know, read the Koran or study Buddhism for Awhile. I did that too for a while. I didn't learn much. But, and sure enough, you find all of those extremes in the Lincoln Douglas debates. We also know of course that he was a free soiler and he's most famous in the south of course, for that language of putting slave around a course of ultimate extinction in a house divided speech and elsewhere. But once the war came,

Speaker 2:          34:44          yeah,

Speaker 1:          34:45          the imperative about what to do about slavery was a huge indelicate and terrible political question. And this is the link and that will be forever debate it. And there'll be debated next year like, like it's never been debated cause it's the bicentennial, it was birth next year. And as I've warned you, it will be raining Lincoln books and you will have to dodge them

Speaker 2:          35:07          next year

Speaker 1:          35:11          now after the war broke out.

Speaker 2:          35:14          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          35:15          immediately. Some slaves began to come in to union lines, the first word this a, a Ford and Florida.

Speaker 2:          35:23          Okay.

Speaker 1:          35:23          And then as early as May, 1861, some slaves began to come in to union lines, handfuls, uh, near Fortress Monroe in Virginia. And there was a union command, or they're a political general, a former Democrat before the war and anything but an abolition is Benjamin F. Butler, who never the loss will. Nevertheless, when the slaves came into his lines, he realized, no, wait a sec, the confederates are over there using these people to build their fortifications. Maybe we could use them to bill are fortifications. So why don't we confiscate them and him contraband of war, their property under law call contraband and the name stuck of course know that name will end up in poetry and song and even in the law or to contraband property.

Speaker 2:          36:21          Okay.

Speaker 1:          36:21          But at the outset of the war in the summer of 61 fall, winter 61 62 into the spring of 62, the first year of the war, the official policy of the Lincoln Administration and of the Union forces across the land, the official policy was called denial of asylum. It meant that any slave who escaped into union lines, the officer in charge and command of that unit have the responsibility to return that slave to his owner. If the owner, this was the impossible kicker, if the owner was loyal to the union, if that owner was not loyal to the union, it was in the confederate army or something, then yes, you could admit that slave to your lines as contraband of war.

Speaker 2:          37:16          No, of course.

Speaker 1:          37:17          If this had only been a trickle of people here and they're coming in to union lines, possibly this could be enforced, but it wasn't enforceable. How's that union command are going to go out and figure out, uh, Hey, uh, Mr. Enslaved person is your own or loyal or disloyal to the union, that slave, it's probably going to say he's a confederate. What do you think? Of course, most were.

Speaker 2:          37:49          Now,

Speaker 1:          37:51          Congress took the lead before Lincoln ever wrote an emancipation proclamation. Although Lincoln was thinking about this and working on this, all through that summer of 1862 congress took the lead. Now this was a congress. Remember that is now dominated by the Republican Party. You got an 11 southern states out of the union. They don't have any centers. I don't have any. I remember is in the House of Representatives. This is a northern Republican majority, a significant majority. Now they're going to run into trouble in the, in the fall, congressional elections of 1862 and they're gonna lose some of those seats because of what they're doing. Now, Congress took the lead pastor an article of war in March of 1862 which said, fugitive slaves must be admitted to union camps. It didn't say what their status would be. It didn't define anybody. I left illegal status vague. It just said, any escaped slave, Masa now be admitted. Now, the reason they did that is because this denial of asylum policy had caused chaos and a lot of union units. Brief example. Remember this guy, Charles Brewster, whose letters I read from the other day, this guy from Massachusetts, his letters I edited and so on. Well, Charley Brewster, this racist from North Hampton, Massachusetts, 28 years old by now. Nevertheless, in late fall of 1861 he took a runaway slave who was 17 years old and named David

Speaker 1:          39:22          into his, uh, personal care. He made him his personal servant. This is after Brewster. God has commissioned as an officer. He even wrote home to his sister several times, asking the sister to send stocking caps, socks, and old pair of pants. He even named the shirts that he wanted to put on his David. It was as though he was dressing him.

Speaker 1:          39:49          And Brewster was a determined never to send that kid back to slavery. But down came the orders by January, early February, 1862 that all fugitive slaves within their camps must be returned to their owners if those owners came to the union lines to retrieve them. And the future of named David had his owner waiting at the camp. There was a near mutiny and the 10th Massachusetts, which was Brewster's regimen between those soldiers who wanted to protect these fugitive slaves and free them in effect and those who did not, and that's the one on in hundreds of regiments. Brewster's Brewster was threatened with court martial and being run out of the army if he didn't give back this fugitive slave. His compromise was it. He took it as this young David out into the woods and he said, get Outta here, run. I'll just tell him you ran away, and that's what he did. By that Spring, Congress decided any fugitive slave was sketch to union lines. It must be accepted. In April of 1862 congress on the 16th of April, and this was a very significant law. They passed abolition, the end of slavery and the District of Columbia. They gave $300 per slave and compensation to those owners of slaves in the district. The district of Columbia in 1862 had 3,100 slaves.

Speaker 1:          41:32          They also put,

Speaker 2:          41:34          I think the figure was about $300,000 in that bill where they provided for the possible colonization of blacks voluntarily to foreign countries. As a result of emancipation, a policy of the Lincoln administration now was supporting. Okay.

Speaker 1:          41:55          Then third and June, in June of 62 congress by majority vote sort of through a great deal of American history on the dust heap, and they abolished slavery forever and the Western territories, arguably the single most important cause of the civil war stroke of the pen. In June of 62 they ended slavery in spite of the dred Scott decision. Now remember what the dred Scott decision had said here was congress passing a law in direct opposition to a supreme court decision.

Speaker 1:          42:35          That's an argument for not having too many civil wars, you see, because Congress might end up doing anything in the midst of the civil war and they surely did here. And then finally on July 17th, 1862 congress passed what was called the second confiscation act. There'd been a first confiscation act pass back in August of 61 even in the first confiscation. I can. By the way, these were acts authorizing union forces to confiscate confederate property. Even in the first re confiscation act back in August of [inaudible] 61 slaves were mentioned as property. They're status was still very vague, but in the second confiscation act, July 62 the law explicitly freed slaves of all persons, quote in rebellion anywhere, any slave of anyone supporting the confederacy. It did everything. The emancipation proclamation will later do, and then soon it was in some ways more extensive because it included all parts of the south, including those border states that did not seceded from the union.

Speaker 2:          43:48          Now,

Speaker 1:          43:50          well, Congress already having done these things by July of 62 by the way, this is all during the peninsula campaign down in Virginia. Second confiscation act was passed in the immediate wake of the seven days battle. Lee is deciding to invade the North Lincoln. As you may know the story, if you've read team of rivals by Doris Goodwin, you know it would hang out at the war department. He'd go there for some solitude. He had private little office there. He began to draft an emancipation proclamation as a legal brief, a legal document. He kept it in a locked door, have a desk at the war department. Supposedly there was one or two guards that knew about it, not sure about that, but he was beginning to draft an emancipation proclamation probably as early as June, certainly by July of 62

Speaker 2:          44:45          yeah,

Speaker 1:          44:46          the pressure now monitor from every direction. He's secretly held meetings with the delegation of Delaware and a delegation from Kentucky trying to convince them to institute gradual emancipation plans over time with compensation to slave owners that would, that would free slaves over a 35 year period. This was Lincoln, the gradual, this, this was Lincoln trying to condition public opinion, Delaware. At that point, I only had 1800 slaves were far more slaves in the district of Columbia. Then the war and all of Delaware, but the Delaware delegation that came to the White House to meet with Lincoln told him unequivocally no, they weren't going to touch slavery for fear of what it might ignite.

Speaker 1:          45:43          Lincoln waited and waited. He was attacked by Horace Greeley and the New York Herald Tribune. As you know, read the famous Greeley letter and the Johnson collection. This is the famous passage in August of 62 or Lincoln said, I will free the, I will save the union by freeing all the slaves, or I will save the union by freeing none of the slaves. My aim in the end is to say that, yeah, but read that entire letter. Not just that quote. I'm going to leave that to you. Read the entire letter because he's actually honest on both sides of the semicolon. Look for his semi colon and judge both sides. He's a crafty cat. You got to read them closely. Lincoln needed a battlefield victory. He needed some kind of battlefield success and he gets that of course, with Antidem in the wake of Antietam, five days afterward, 22nd September 62 Lincoln issued the preliminary emancipation proclamation that preliminary emancipation proclamation said that slaves in the United States, in the states, in rebellion would be freed. On January 1st there was a carrot and a stick. The stick was emancipation and conquest. If the union forces could ever do it, and the carrot was in effect, he invited the confederate states to throw down their arms, give up the war, come back to the union by January 1st

Speaker 1:          47:28          they're not going to it of course, but

Speaker 2:          47:31          he was hoping or was he hoping? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          47:35          I'm going to leave you with this. Back in Virginia was a young slave, 22 years old. His name was John Washington. He'd grown up in Fredericksburg. Virginia had a white father. I mean he never knew. A slave mother named Sarah. She taught him to read and write. He grows up in urban slave with lots of skills, highly valued, probably a brilliant young man. You gotta hire it out five times in the late 1850s in the first year of the war, he married his sweetheart and January, 1862 in the African Baptist church in Fredericksburg, and he chose his moment of escape at the first appearance of union forces along the Rappahannock river in Fredericksburg on the 16th excuse me, the 18th of April, 1862 he left a narrative that he wrote after the war that I had the great, good fortune to have lopped in my lap and have recently published a book about it. And in that narrative, he tells this remarkable story of the day of his escape. He even drew a map of Fredericksburg of the day of his escape, including a glossary of 16 sites and buildings and crossroads on that map as though he wanted the world to see as well as hear his story.

Speaker 1:          49:01          And John tells the story. He's 22 years old. He tells a story of all the white people evacuating Fredericksburg and his mistress. Mrs Talavera is literally packing her China and her silver, and she says, one day, now, Johnny, you'll be with us tomorrow. You'll be with us tomorrow. She's assuming his loyalty. And he said, yes, Mrs. Yes, Mrs. I'll be with you tomorrow. And then his next scene is he's at a hotel where he's been hired out as a steward, almost like an assistant manager. Can you describe all the white people fleeing the hotel and fleeing the streets of Fredericksburg. And he says he took the 12 workers up on the roof of the hotel and the hotel was called the Shakespeare. I kid you not, he takes all the black workers up on the roof of the hotel where they could see across the river and see what he called the gleam of the Yankees bandits. And then he brought them all back down into the kitchen and he poured a round of drinks and he held a toast and the toast was to the Yankees.

Speaker 1:          50:02          And he instructed his fellow workers, he said to get out of there, but he said, don't get too far from the Yankees. And then John Larson and walk two blocks down to the river. He witnessed the formal surrender of Fredericksburg. He saw the bridges being burned by the confederate forces. And he walked one mile up river and he said he crossed the river at Ficklin, his mill and the old stone ruins of Miller is still there, so I know exactly where he crossed the river. He got into a rowboat. He crossed and that night he slept in the camp of the 30th New York volunteers, a captain in that regiment named Ladd, l a d d formerly freedom. He said, based on the law that had just been passed by Congress 48 hours earlier in Washington, freeing the slaves in the district of Columbia. John Washington spent the rest of that summer as a campaign and a guide for the Union army all the way through second Manassas. He dated his arrival in Washington DC as part of the first great wave of Friedman into the capitol as September 1st and by the following year I found him in a city directory record living at his first address on 19th street in Washington. He had his wife, his newborn child, his mother and his 68 year old grandmother living there with him

Speaker 1:          51:34          apart from beneath next to underneath this great military and political story. Now thousands upon thousands of John Washington's. We're freeing themselves.
