1
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.370
Well go south with me today.
We're going to take up this question initially of

2
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.330
it's an old,
old,
old American question.

3
00:00:22.331 --> 00:00:27.331
How peculiar or distinctive or different is the American south?

4
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.180
That used to be a question you could ask in quite some comfort.

5
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.520
The Dixie difference as a recent book title called it or Dixie rising is another

6
00:00:43.091 --> 00:00:46.210
recent book title called it.
Um,

7
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.730
the south of course as many,
many,
many things,
many,
many,
many peoples.

8
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.470
There are so many south today that has rendered this question

9
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.440
in some ways almost irrelevant,
but in other ways,
of course not.

10
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.950
We still keep finding our presidential elections won or lost in the south

11
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.910
named me and modern American president who won the presidency without at least

12
00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:20.930
some success in the states of the old confederacy.

13
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.580
Look at the great re alignments in American political history.

14
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.810
They've had a great deal to do with the way the south would go or parts of the

15
00:01:35.711 --> 00:01:38.770
south would go.
We're on the verge now,

16
00:01:38.771 --> 00:01:43.771
the first southern primary in this year's election in South Carolina and

17
00:01:44.111 --> 00:01:45.400
everybody is wondering,

18
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.540
is there a new modern South Carolina or not?

19
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.423
<v 1>Now</v>

20
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.490
<v 0>this question is fun to have fun with in some ways because it's fraught with</v>

21
00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:04.070
stereotypes,
isn't it?
The south

22
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.913
<v 1>hot,</v>

23
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.550
<v 0>slow,
long vowels,</v>

24
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.580
great storytellers and so on.
Oh,

25
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.060
and they love violence and football and stock,
car racing and et Cetera,

26
00:02:22.061 --> 00:02:22.894
et Cetera,
et cetera.

27
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.940
I grew up in Michigan and not going to assure you that Michigan,
there's level,

28
00:02:27.941 --> 00:02:31.960
all those things too and probably even more,

29
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.160
but the idea of southern stereotypes is very,
very old.

30
00:02:36.161 --> 00:02:38.530
It isn't a product of the civil war by any means.

31
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.920
The South as an idea,

32
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.120
the south and its distinctiveness was very much there.

33
00:02:46.121 --> 00:02:50.590
Even in the colonial period.
Travelers from England and elsewhere,
France,

34
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.820
who would come to the American colonies would travel throughout the colonies,

35
00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.060
would often comment on this that somehow southerners were different culturally,

36
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.420
attitudinally,
behaviorally,

37
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.190
and none other than Thomas Jefferson himself left this famous

38
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.590
description of characterizations of southerners and northerners.

39
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:24.871
He wrote this in the mid seventies and eighties he was writing to a foreign,

40
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.040
a French correspondent

41
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.880
and Thomas Jefferson describe the people of the north is in the 1780s now than

42
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.660
before the cotton boom and all that.

43
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.200
He described the people of the north this way.

44
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.240
Jefferson northerners are cool,
sober,

45
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.080
laborious,
persevering,
independent,

46
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.420
jealous of their own liberties,
chick canning,

47
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.990
superstitious and hypocritical in their religion.

48
00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.600
Take that Yankees,

49
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.960
but southern or is he said they are fiery,

50
00:04:05.961 --> 00:04:10.670
voluptuous,
indolent,
unsteady,
independent,

51
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.550
zealous of their own liberties.
He Changed Jealous,

52
00:04:16.551 --> 00:04:21.170
does zealous there.
If we're doing close readings,
we might,
you know,

53
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.210
go into that for 20 minutes,
but we're not,

54
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.520
he's not over Gel.
The zealous of it own liberties,

55
00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:35.690
but trampling on those of others.
Generous,

56
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.890
candid,

57
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.360
and without attachment or pretensions to any religion,

58
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.260
but that have their own heart.
Yeah,

59
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.330
we can debate what Jefferson got right or wrong there or what's held up,

60
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.410
but do know how he said both sides or either jealous or zealous of their own

61
00:04:58.011 --> 00:05:02.270
liberties.
That could be an upper graph on this course if you like,

62
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.350
because in the end when this civil war will finally come,

63
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.070
both sides will say over and over and over again that they are only fighting for

64
00:05:13.911 --> 00:05:14.744
liberty.

65
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.660
Everybody in the civil war will say they're fighting for liberty.

66
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.573
Um,

67
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.540
and one of the greatest books ever written on the south by a southerner in

68
00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:34.810
particular,
Wilbur caches.
Great classic in 1940

69
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.320
called the mind of the south.
He,
uh,

70
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.550
did something similar at Jefferson,

71
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.230
although he's focusing only on southerners here.
Cash was a great journalist,

72
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.930
intellectual historian in his own right,

73
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.400
deeply critical of his beloved south.
In fact,
it was cash.

74
00:05:57.401 --> 00:06:00.860
He wrote a book called the mind of the south in which he argued in part the

75
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:02.060
south had no mind,

76
00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:04.683
<v 1>okay?</v>

77
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.540
<v 0>He didn't really mean it.
He said,</v>

78
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:13.340
southerners are proud,
brave,
honorable by.
It's like the south is proud,
brave,

79
00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:16.640
honorable by its lights,
courteous,
personally,
generous,
loyal.

80
00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:21.290
Swift do act often to swift,
but signally effective,

81
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.840
sometimes terrible in its actions.

82
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.690
Such was the south at its best,

83
00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:30.710
said cash and such at its best.
It remains today.

84
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.041
Then comes up,

85
00:06:32.041 --> 00:06:37.041
but at the southeast says is also characterized by violence,

86
00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:39.680
intolerance of versions,

87
00:06:39.681 --> 00:06:44.681
suspicion toward new ideas and in capability for analysis and inclination to act

88
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:50.390
from feeling rather than from thought attachment to fictions and faults.

89
00:06:50.391 --> 00:06:55.391
Values above all to great attachment to racial values and a tendency to justify

90
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.270
cruelty and injustice.

91
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.780
Some of the south greatest critics of course

92
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.720
<v 1>have been southern.</v>

93
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:13.340
<v 0>What's distinctive about the south?
Just specialty.
There's old,</v>

94
00:07:13.341 --> 00:07:17.660
so
there's Shelby Foote to comment on this.

95
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.790
None other than shall be the star of Ken Burns film series on the civil war.

96
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.470
That lovely,
lovely,

97
00:07:24.471 --> 00:07:29.471
lovely geriatric and a blue shirt that American women's fell in love with and a

98
00:07:29.931 --> 00:07:31.340
documentary film.

99
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.060
It's the only time in recorded history that anyone fell in love with anybody in

100
00:07:35.061 --> 00:07:39.320
a documentary.
Shelby Foote said this,

101
00:07:39.321 --> 00:07:40.890
and who is he speaking for?

102
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:47.030
I'm not aware that there is such a thing as southern art said,

103
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:51.800
Shelby,
at least not if you're defining it by technique.

104
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.080
If there's something distinct about it.
Southern Art,

105
00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:02.710
it's subject matter and also inner heritage.

106
00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:04.930
<v 1>Awesome.</v>

107
00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:09.930
<v 0>Southerners who tried to express themselves in art are very much aware that they</v>

108
00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:14.620
are a party to a defeat.

109
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:18.933
<v 1>No,</v>

110
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.710
<v 0>that's Shelby Foote speaking for white southerners.</v>

111
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:28.420
And when Shelby Foote uses the term southerner,
he means white southerners,

112
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.050
but party to a defeat or as Walker Percy,

113
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:36.360
the great southern writer was once asked,
he was asked in effect,

114
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:40.390
why does southerners has such long memories?
They don't seem to forget anything.

115
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.900
And he gave us simple straight declarative answer.
He said,

116
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:45.910
because we lost the war.

117
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.520
<v 1>We lost loss always.
Yeah.</v>

118
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.670
<v 0>I think almost always,
especially in modern history,</v>

119
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:02.820
has led the longer,
deeper troubled memories.

120
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.160
But Shelby wasn't speaking for all southerners.

121
00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.680
They're Toni Morrison was speaking for Black Southerners.

122
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.880
And that I think fantastic line in her novel,
Beloved,

123
00:09:11.881 --> 00:09:14.640
which I know many of you have read because it's taught all the time,

124
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.890
but there's a marvelous little exchange at one point between Paul d and Saffie,

125
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.240
Paul d and Seth,

126
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.900
you're trying to imagine a new life out of the horror of their past.

127
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.910
And at one point Paul de simply says the Sethy Sethy of course,

128
00:09:31.911 --> 00:09:35.360
as a former slave woman who was birth of this child,

129
00:09:35.361 --> 00:09:39.320
which becomes this extraordinary ghost called beloved.

130
00:09:39.321 --> 00:09:44.321
And Paul d was former slave who survived the worst brutalities of slavery and

131
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.720
worse than chain gangs and and so on and so forth.

132
00:09:50.721 --> 00:09:53.570
But at one point he just says to her,
me and you Sethi,

133
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.740
we got too much yesterday.
We need more tomorrow.

134
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.360
Too much yesterday.
We need more tomorrow.

135
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:08.480
Why does the south half such a long memory,

136
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:14.860
why is history and memory sometimes a deep family matter to southerners or as it

137
00:10:15.981 --> 00:10:18.890
isn't necessarily to northerners or so it seemed

138
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.320
<v 1>okay,</v>

139
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.890
<v 0>Faulkner captured this.
Faulkner capture does all over the place with the,</v>

140
00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:30.360
I have a favorite line in his novel called the hamlet where Faulkner has one of

141
00:10:30.361 --> 00:10:32.160
his characters say,
and I quote,

142
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:38.030
only thank God men have done learn how to forget quick what they ain't brave

143
00:10:38.431 --> 00:10:40.230
enough to cure,

144
00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.170
can't curate,
can't solve it.
Can you get rid of it?

145
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:53.090
Forget it or try to forget it or work on forgetting it or create a structure of

146
00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:55.654
forgetting,

147
00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.840
which is of course always a structure of remembering at the same time.

148
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:05.860
And then lastly,
there's Alan Greer,
gayness,

149
00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.610
wonderful modern southern writer who wrote that book called the oldest

150
00:11:09.611 --> 00:11:13.600
confederate widow tells all,
you know,
that bizarre.

151
00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:15.250
It's a wonderful read.

152
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.180
We've always been looking for the oldest confederate widow in case you haven't

153
00:11:19.181 --> 00:11:20.470
noticed.
They keep finding one.

154
00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.320
The latest was just found another five years ago or so.
She was,
I don't know,

155
00:11:26.321 --> 00:11:31.150
90 and she married some 60 year old confederate veteran.
At some point in time.

156
00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.380
We're always finding some woman alive with claim.

157
00:11:33.381 --> 00:11:35.230
She was married to a confederate soldier.

158
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:41.020
I don't know precisely why that's one for an anthropologist to to figure out,

159
00:11:41.021 --> 00:11:41.980
but Alan could gain is,

160
00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:47.530
he actually said this in the New York Times in a commentary he wrote on the

161
00:11:47.531 --> 00:11:52.230
confederate flag.
Whereas a southern writer back during,

162
00:11:52.231 --> 00:11:56.080
oh about five years ago during the worst of the controversies over the

163
00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:59.500
confederate flag flying on South Carolina capital and so on.

164
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.900
Your gayness wrote this wonderfully witty,
wry,
brilliant op ed piece,

165
00:12:04.901 --> 00:12:09.010
long op Ed in the New York Times where he talked about the depth of southern

166
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:11.140
memory and white southerners have such deep memories.

167
00:12:11.141 --> 00:12:13.930
And then he begged his fellow southerners the fold,

168
00:12:13.931 --> 00:12:16.240
that battle flag and put it in museums.

169
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:20.800
But the line I wrote down out of that piece was this,

170
00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:27.270
what's distinctive about the south?
The south has a tradition,

171
00:12:27.271 --> 00:12:32.271
said Greg Louganis of attempting the impossible at great cost,

172
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
proudly celebrating the failure and then gaining admiration for the performance,

173
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:46.130
trying something failing gloriously at it,

174
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.310
getting everybody's admiration.

175
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:52.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

176
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:57.010
<v 0>If that's not a novelist description of what a loss causes,
I've never read one.</v>

177
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.480
Uh,
one could go on and on here.
I mean,

178
00:13:03.481 --> 00:13:08.481
in some ways the most distinctive literature America has is a kind of southern

179
00:13:08.801 --> 00:13:10.270
literature,
white and black,

180
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.020
every major African American writer of the 20th century,

181
00:13:16.021 --> 00:13:20.640
at least until your lifetime when black writers in this country are now born and

182
00:13:20.641 --> 00:13:25.641
raised in cities in California or Minneapolis or New York or modern Atlanta,

183
00:13:27.451 --> 00:13:30.600
and they come from all,
all the same places other Americans do.

184
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:35.640
Sometimes they come from the Caribbean and become Americans,
but that's recent.

185
00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:41.090
Every major African American poet and writer and artists from frankly the mid

186
00:13:43.291 --> 00:13:48.291
19th century on has always been reflecting on this nexus of north and south

187
00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:55.800
south to a very old place as an Albert Murray's famous book,

188
00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:03.160
trouble the water novel about growing up in the south by Melvin Dixon and great

189
00:14:04.191 --> 00:14:04.641
novel.

190
00:14:04.641 --> 00:14:09.641
It gets little attention and his life long struggle to understand just how

191
00:14:10.821 --> 00:14:12.980
southern he was in New York,

192
00:14:12.981 --> 00:14:17.981
Ralph Ellison's famous musings being the southern or come to Harlem and on and

193
00:14:19.221 --> 00:14:20.054
on and on.

194
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:22.580
<v 1>Okay,</v>

195
00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.280
<v 0>but let's go back to the old south,</v>

196
00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.370
this old south that got the United States in so much trouble,

197
00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:34.490
although wasn't all their fault.
First of all,
it's worth remembering.

198
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.670
There are a lot of clear,

199
00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:42.920
undeniable similarities.
I've all kinds things you can,

200
00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.031
you know,

201
00:14:44.031 --> 00:14:49.031
you can measure between south and north in the 40 years before the civil war

202
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:55.820
north and the south had roughly is the northern and southern states.

203
00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:00.860
The free states and slave states had roughly the same geographic size.

204
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.090
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

205
00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:04.860
<v 0>it spoke the same language English,</v>

206
00:15:04.861 --> 00:15:07.770
although in very different regional dialects of course.

207
00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:09.260
<v 1>Okay.</v>

208
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:13.790
<v 0>They had common heroes and common customs and a certain common heritage of the</v>

209
00:15:13.791 --> 00:15:18.230
American revolution.
Make no mistake,
John C.
Calhoun,

210
00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:23.060
one of the great intellectual architects of southern distinctiveness or southern

211
00:15:23.061 --> 00:15:26.110
sectionalism and certainly of southern,
um,

212
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:28.370
states' rights doctrine.

213
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:30.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

214
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.310
<v 0>Was very much an American nationalist,</v>

215
00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.450
at least in the early parts of his career.

216
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:40.580
Northerners and southerners shared basically the same Protestant Christianity,

217
00:15:40.581 --> 00:15:42.620
although they used it in different ways.

218
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.160
They have very similar political ideologies.

219
00:15:46.161 --> 00:15:49.770
A born of the Republican ism,

220
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:54.440
they all kind of breathed in that was breathed into them and they inherited from

221
00:15:54.441 --> 00:15:58.640
the age of the American revolution,
a fierce belief in individual liberty.

222
00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:04.180
When you hear a slave holder preach about his individual liberty and his rights,

223
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.910
you sometimes wonder,
come on,
what do you get off?

224
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.890
But as many of you know,
certainly you will find out here

225
00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:23.110
they had pretty clear ideas of who wat to have those individual liberties and

226
00:16:23.111 --> 00:16:24.430
who would not,

227
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.990
who indeed were born equal and who are not.

228
00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:30.810
<v 1>Okay.</v>

229
00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:35.310
<v 0>Both share both sides of the leadership of both sides shared a rich kind of</v>

230
00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.080
nationalism
about this American experiment.

231
00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.170
You can find a hope that you can stop,

232
00:16:42.171 --> 00:16:46.980
find a deep and abiding kind of American nationalism to steel and a lot of
these,

233
00:16:46.981 --> 00:16:49.410
a budding southern patriots,

234
00:16:49.411 --> 00:16:54.411
even by the 1850 especially when they get scared about what's the session might

235
00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:55.950
actually mean.

236
00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:00.840
You could argue that both southerners and northerners shared a certain degree of

237
00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:05.950
old fashioned American localism attachment to place new Englanders know

238
00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:07.860
something about attachment to place.

239
00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:12.150
And so did people from the low country,
South Carolina

240
00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:17.490
states' rights was nothing that the south owned either.
Of course,

241
00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.200
some of the most open exercises,

242
00:17:22.201 --> 00:17:26.610
the state's rights of course before the 1850s were were conducted by
northerners.

243
00:17:26.611 --> 00:17:29.430
Like in the Hartford Convention of 1814.
Well,
I can,

244
00:17:29.431 --> 00:17:33.840
personal liberty laws will come to a bit later in resistance to the fugitive

245
00:17:33.841 --> 00:17:34.501
slave act,

246
00:17:34.501 --> 00:17:38.430
the state of Wisconsin and acted a personal liberty law that said they were not

247
00:17:38.431 --> 00:17:41.190
going to enforce the fugitive slave act and turn in future the slaves.

248
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:45.990
And the justification was it was that it was their state's right to do so.

249
00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.800
So it doesn't just states' rights to this southern,

250
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:53.760
southern or shared with northern as a faith in progress if you breathe in the

251
00:17:53.761 --> 00:17:57.690
air in America and the 1840s and 50s,
uh,

252
00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:01.600
the idea that America stood for some kind of progress,
that it,

253
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:06.620
that it didn't American meant a prosperous future was just common coin.

254
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:12.810
And both southerners and northerners shared both the reality and the spirit of

255
00:18:12.811 --> 00:18:14.130
that westward movement.

256
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:16.703
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

257
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:19.000
<v 0>Both of them participated in the,</v>

258
00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.950
what David Donald used to call the great American,
uh,

259
00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:27.400
practice or custom tradition actually,
he called it,
of compromise

260
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:32.210
and both sides,

261
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:37.370
both north and south in their political leadership and their economic

262
00:18:37.371 --> 00:18:38.204
leadership.

263
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:42.860
We're led by a hard boiled believing,

264
00:18:42.861 --> 00:18:47.060
practicing capitalist southern slave holders.

265
00:18:47.061 --> 00:18:48.440
We're not pre capitalists.

266
00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:52.580
There's historical scholarship that used to argue that a couple of generations

267
00:18:52.581 --> 00:18:54.680
ago,
but not anymore.

268
00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.270
And throw this statistic up.

269
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:03.800
You could argue that both sides had essentially the same kind of oligarchies,

270
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:10.630
less than 1% less than 1% of the real and personal property in both south and

271
00:19:13.731 --> 00:19:18.731
north by the 1850s was held by approximately 50% of free adult males.

272
00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:25.530
<v 1>Okay.</v>

273
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:29.580
<v 0>The richest 1% in both sections put another way,</v>

274
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:33.600
held 27% of all the wealth the north had.

275
00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.990
I'll budding oligarchies just like the south did.

276
00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:42.200
Oh,
it was Al [inaudible] were based on different things

277
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:44.930
and that's where the rub came

278
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.360
a little more on this distinct south.
Um,

279
00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:52.850
I said earlier that this is an old idea.

280
00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:54.810
I mean it goes back into the 18th.

281
00:19:54.811 --> 00:19:59.811
You can find all kinds of examples of these stereotypical conceptions of the

282
00:19:59.961 --> 00:20:03.610
south and French British visitors.
I,

283
00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.170
one of the most famous Hector Saint John Decrepit core,

284
00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:10.580
who in his famous fictional letters,
letters from an American farmer,

285
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.240
um,
he invented a character.

286
00:20:14.241 --> 00:20:19.241
If you've ever read that great text called farmer James is typical American

287
00:20:20.151 --> 00:20:24.110
farmer.
Farmer James was of course a Pennsylvania Sturdy,

288
00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.260
probably had some German blood in him.

289
00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:34.840
[inaudible] made the north the sight of the true essence of what he saw as this

290
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:39.390
new American man being born in America,
not in the south.

291
00:20:39.391 --> 00:20:42.780
He traveled in the south,
he liked in Charleston,
South Carolina.

292
00:20:42.781 --> 00:20:45.800
Though this isn't the seventies and eighties,
he liked in Charles Sarc,

293
00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:47.310
Charleston,
South Carolina,

294
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:52.390
to what he called the barbarous institutions and traits,

295
00:20:52.391 --> 00:20:56.650
especially slavery,
the Self Indulgence of the planters.

296
00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:00.490
Um,
and then he concludes just like Lima,
Peru,

297
00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:07.490
that's the only known comparison of Charleston to Lima,
Peru than I'm aware of.

298
00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:11.660
Oh,
and on and on and on,

299
00:21:11.661 --> 00:21:15.410
there were travelers from Europe who came and would write these stereotypic

300
00:21:15.411 --> 00:21:18.650
stories.
There's one by a,
an English traveler.

301
00:21:18.651 --> 00:21:22.760
He entitled it a Georgia planters method of spending time.

302
00:21:22.761 --> 00:21:25.760
And it's this litany of how Georgia planner gets up early,

303
00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:28.280
has this first draft of whiskey,

304
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:32.310
talks to his overseer as another draft.
The whiskey.

305
00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:35.680
Eight o'clock has breakfast now,
the draft,

306
00:21:35.681 --> 00:21:39.680
the whisky and the day goes and talks to his overseer.
Again,

307
00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:44.720
gets things started on the plantation that day and then he goes into the village

308
00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:48.290
to the tavern,
just start drinking

309
00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:53.780
lots of these most importantly,
seriously.

310
00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.200
The idea of the south as exotic,

311
00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:01.340
different and dangerous is an old idea.

312
00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:07.900
A new layer of danger sort of was put on top of images of the south,

313
00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:13.250
uh,
not just to northerners minds for that matter.

314
00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:15.890
After the Great Haitian revolution,

315
00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:22.840
after the slave rebels of sand domain made Haiti the first black republican

316
00:22:23.691 --> 00:22:28.691
modern history and someones Haitian rebels ended up in the American south.

317
00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:33.140
And the imagination of southern white southerners are a lot more Haitian rebels

318
00:22:33.141 --> 00:22:35.510
coming into the south and actually ever,
ever got here.

319
00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:41.450
But then if you look at the writings of new Englanders by the early 19th
century,

320
00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:44.180
take Jedediah Morris for example,

321
00:22:44.181 --> 00:22:48.830
the great geographer he called the north.
Hey quote,

322
00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:53.860
happy state of mediocrity are hardy race of free independent Republicans.

323
00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:58.810
And isn't that the Hamilton that New England has always one of them.

324
00:22:58.811 --> 00:23:03.560
So they don't share anything with a free and independent.

325
00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:09.130
Well,
my wife and I first moved to Amherst,
Massachusetts.

326
00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:13.360
I took a job there at once.
We took,
uh,

327
00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:18.080
some baked goods over to our neighbors and we'd been warned about new Englanders

328
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:22.150
and all that and delivered baked goods.
Does that high.
All right,

329
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.580
we're here now.
And a woman sat in effect.

330
00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:32.490
Why have you brought this
anyway,

331
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.980
sorry.
Jedediah Morris described southerners,
however,
as quote,

332
00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:41.590
just constant lint and that represented,
he said by quote,

333
00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:46.400
disconsolate wildness and popular ignorance.

334
00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:52.330
Noah Webster of the great dictionary of fame said famously,

335
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:55.490
Oh,
New England,

336
00:23:55.850 --> 00:24:00.320
how superior are thy habits in morals,
literature,

337
00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:02.210
civility and industry.

338
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:04.783
<v 1>So</v>

339
00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:07.810
<v 0>pairing the north and the south,</v>

340
00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:12.900
trying to understand how difference eventually does bullying into political

341
00:24:14.621 --> 00:24:18.940
crisis,
which eventually boils into conflict,

342
00:24:18.941 --> 00:24:21.780
which eventually boils into disunion,

343
00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:24.130
which eventually boils into war,

344
00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:30.240
does have some root back in these kinds of perceived differences.

345
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.780
There's one of my favorite historians warned me once,

346
00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:39.540
don't leave out the politics.

347
00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:45.230
<v 1>Don't leave out politics now.</v>

348
00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:47.993
Um,

349
00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.430
if I could

350
00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:56.380
<v 0>hang your hat on one kind of southern distinctiveness,</v>

351
00:24:57.010 --> 00:25:01.800
perhaps above or it's fun to play with all these stereotypes and realize that if

352
00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:05.950
so many people were writing this way from personal observation,
yeah,

353
00:25:05.951 --> 00:25:08.260
there must be something to all these differences,

354
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:11.650
but what eventually evolved in the south,

355
00:25:11.651 --> 00:25:15.460
and we will return to this a good deal next Tuesday when I'll devote an entire

356
00:25:15.461 --> 00:25:20.461
lecture to this kind of slave holder worldview and the pro slavery argument,

357
00:25:21.401 --> 00:25:26.401
the pro slavery defense and how that evolved into a political culture.

358
00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.380
But if there's one thing,

359
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:34.180
and this is a little risky because they're always holds in any claim like this,

360
00:25:34.181 --> 00:25:38.410
but it is one distinct feature of old,

361
00:25:38.411 --> 00:25:43.150
the old south society and indeed its leadership and most of its people,

362
00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.840
it would be what we might label anti modernism.

363
00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.350
It was a society

364
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:56.890
that eventually developed a disdain for what they perceived as the corruptions

365
00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.260
of modern commercialism.

366
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:07.710
Southern slave holding leadership in particular were very suspicious of the

367
00:26:09.011 --> 00:26:10.540
spread of literacy.

368
00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:11.930
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

369
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:16.880
<v 0>They were very suspicious of the democratic tendencies or so it seemed the</v>

370
00:26:16.881 --> 00:26:19.640
democratic tendencies of that northern society,

371
00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:23.600
which was spreading literacy more widely and eventually the right to vote more

372
00:26:23.601 --> 00:26:25.280
widely,
at least among white people.

373
00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:30.660
It is a society where the leadership for sure and much of the non-leadership

374
00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:35.030
we're suspicious of reform,
suspicious of change,

375
00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:39.890
suspicious of democracy itself,
democracy,

376
00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.650
the slave holding class of the south came to seed,

377
00:26:42.651 --> 00:26:45.240
small d as a dangerous thing.

378
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:51.770
It was a threat to hierarchy and the south became quite distinctively a very

379
00:26:52.261 --> 00:26:54.870
hierarchical society.
More on that in just a second.

380
00:26:56.010 --> 00:27:01.010
It became a hierarchical society rooted very deeply and an open conceptions of

381
00:27:01.261 --> 00:27:05.490
class and obviously open conceptions of race.

382
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:11.050
Some were born to rule
in the overall attitude of the,

383
00:27:11.051 --> 00:27:15.100
of the planter class in the leadership class of the American south by the 1840

384
00:27:15.101 --> 00:27:18.670
[inaudible] and 1850s some were born to rule and some born to be ruled

385
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.680
<v 1>deal with.
It was their attitude.</v>

386
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:29.350
<v 0>They became deeply protective and insistent upon their own peculiar sense.</v>

387
00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:34.160
And it was a great scholarship on this.
Their own peculiar sense

388
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:36.960
<v 1>of honor,
honor,</v>

389
00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:41.320
<v 0>uh,
old fashioned concept.
It's an old fashioned word.</v>

390
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:43.720
How many of you even use that word anymore?

391
00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:49.930
Do the honorable thing.
Uh,
Oh,

392
00:27:49.931 --> 00:27:53.440
I didn't act today with much honor did I?
We're more likely to,

393
00:27:53.441 --> 00:27:57.760
we have other words for it now.
What would,
what would the,
we might say class,

394
00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:00.820
we did that with class or uh,

395
00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.550
or being effective.
Um,
I dunno.

396
00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:07.090
What would a synonym date today

397
00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.133
<v 1>for honor</v>

398
00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:12.993
anyone

399
00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:15.850
<v 0>a good synonym for honor.</v>

400
00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:20.580
A person of character.

401
00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.313
<v 1>Okay.</v>

402
00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:26.360
<v 0>Oh,
I dunno.
You,
you keep working on that.
Where are you sending them for honor?</v>

403
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:31.240
Well,
honor in the old,
so there's a whole vast scholarship on this and uh,

404
00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.610
two or three of the teachings citizens in this class are real experts on it.

405
00:28:34.611 --> 00:28:37.580
So take it up with Steve and Sam and others.

406
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:43.990
But it was essentially a set of values and it's deep and it was a deeply rooted,

407
00:28:44.051 --> 00:28:46.250
a set of values in the planters worldview.

408
00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:47.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

409
00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:51.760
<v 0>It was a form of behavior.
Demeanor.
Yes.</v>

410
00:28:51.761 --> 00:28:55.960
It meant a certain kind of gentleman's understanding of behavior.

411
00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:57.590
<v 1>Okay.</v>

412
00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:02.420
<v 0>It was the idea that a gentleman must be honest,
a gentleman must be trustworthy.</v>

413
00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:07.130
A gentleman was a man of entitlement.
A gentleman was a man of property,

414
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:12.310
a gentleman had class rank and status and you better recognize it.

415
00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:17.390
And the most important thing and the southern code of honor,

416
00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:22.250
I think safe to say was reputation.

417
00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:28.760
A man of honor must be recognized.
It must be acknowledged.

418
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:33.560
And indeed there must be virtually a ritual of that recognition.

419
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:40.110
The honor is alive and well around the world today.
And make no mistake,

420
00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:43.300
I mean it's alive and well in diplomacy.
It's alive and well in many,

421
00:29:43.301 --> 00:29:45.320
many cultures.
Uh,

422
00:29:45.321 --> 00:29:49.510
I was part of a huge conference last summer and in West Africa on the end of the

423
00:29:49.511 --> 00:29:53.530
slave trade in Ghana.
And we had representative,

424
00:29:53.531 --> 00:29:57.640
we have people participating in that conference from 15 or 16 different African

425
00:29:57.641 --> 00:30:00.490
countries.
We had African chieftains involved.

426
00:30:00.491 --> 00:30:03.880
We are the vice president of Ghana and the president of Togo and on and on and

427
00:30:03.881 --> 00:30:07.540
on.
We spend an entire day doing nothing but borrowing and doing honor.

428
00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:11.500
And for Americans,
all our democratic experience.

429
00:30:11.501 --> 00:30:15.460
And do I have to put a tie on for this event or not?
Uh,
you know,
this,

430
00:30:15.461 --> 00:30:19.210
this kind of ritual on her all the time.
I mean,
after all,

431
00:30:19.211 --> 00:30:22.460
we have a president who just likes to speak like a Texan,
you know,

432
00:30:22.461 --> 00:30:23.980
and do all that honors stuff.

433
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:29.840
I'm sorry if I'm going to do Bush,
I got to work on that.
Don't,

434
00:30:29.841 --> 00:30:33.260
and that's terrible.
What's that guy that does those commercials?

435
00:30:33.261 --> 00:30:34.370
He's brilliant at Bush.

436
00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:37.380
<v 1>Um,
um,
I forget.
Anyway,</v>

437
00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:42.120
<v 0>James Henry Hammond of South Carolina once said,
I quote,</v>

438
00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:45.150
reputation is everything.

439
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:50.510
Everything with me depends upon the estimation in which I am held.

440
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:57.640
<v 1>That's honor.
Personal honor.</v>

441
00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.040
<v 0>For many southerners,
it was more important than law,</v>

442
00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.350
more important than conscience.

443
00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.050
And when they started encountering these northerners,

444
00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:09.320
<v 1>okay,</v>

445
00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.360
<v 0>whether they're from Massachusetts or Ohio,</v>

446
00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:12.470
<v 1>yeah,</v>

447
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:15.350
<v 0>we started talking about a politics of conscience</v>

448
00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.520
or a politics of law.

449
00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:19.790
<v 1>Okay.</v>

450
00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:21.160
<v 0>They're not always talking</v>

451
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.540
<v 1>on the same page.</v>

452
00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:31.090
<v 0>So anti modernism and honor our two hooks,
you can hang your hats on.</v>

453
00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.920
They're all those other claims.
You know,

454
00:31:32.921 --> 00:31:37.210
the south is distinctive because of its climate,
hot weather,
et Cetera,
et Cetera,

455
00:31:37.211 --> 00:31:38.044
et cetera.

456
00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:42.490
This book after book after book on this like Clarence case in his famous book,

457
00:31:42.491 --> 00:31:43.750
90 degrees in the shade,

458
00:31:43.751 --> 00:31:47.050
which is supposed to explain all of southern behavior and ideas.

459
00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:51.910
Ruralness is often used to explain the distinctiveness of southern,

460
00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.650
uh,
writing and art and so on.

461
00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.800
I do love Eudora Welty.
His description of this,

462
00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:04.530
she didn't just say it's all because the south is rural,

463
00:32:04.531 --> 00:32:08.880
but Eudora Welty was once asked why southerners can be such great writers

464
00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:15.460
are such good story tellers and she was a wonderful storyteller.

465
00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.440
Her answer was this,

466
00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:23.910
and it's got something to do with how the last cars took hold to,

467
00:32:23.911 --> 00:32:26.850
but she said southerners love a good tale.

468
00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:27.850
<v 1>Okay.</v>

469
00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:32.020
<v 0>There are born reciters great memory retainers,
diary keepers,</v>

470
00:32:32.021 --> 00:32:35.020
letter exchangers and letters,
savers,
history,

471
00:32:35.021 --> 00:32:39.130
tracers and debaters and out staying all the rest.

472
00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.930
They are just great talkers.

473
00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.620
No,
I met a few New England.
Is there a good talkers too?

474
00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:51.650
Then there's this issue of conservatism.

475
00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:56.330
Why is the south the seat of American conservatism?

476
00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:01.960
Why did a southern strategy in modern American political history reinvent the

477
00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:03.450
Republican Party?
Uh,

478
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:08.500
even though some defenders of that particular movement claim it didn't happen.

479
00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:12.110
Like David Brooks tried to claim in the New York Times.

480
00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.020
David Brooks is a revisionist.

481
00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:21.341
Well,

482
00:33:21.341 --> 00:33:26.341
the tap root of conservatism you could say is right there in the old south.

483
00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:31.380
It's exactly what,
uh,
uh,
Wilbur cash once said,

484
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:34.090
he said,
if you want understand the south,

485
00:33:34.091 --> 00:33:37.480
he said it's taproot is back there in the old south.

486
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:40.150
We so long had this,

487
00:33:40.151 --> 00:33:45.130
a game of sort of always looking for the central theme of southern history.

488
00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:49.330
Now the central theme of the south.

489
00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:55.050
And so often it does come back to this overall claim of a kind of anti reform,

490
00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:03.810
sometimes even anti intellectual conservative defense of a hierarchical

491
00:34:04.931 --> 00:34:09.931
civilization rooted in white supremacy and originally deed and one of the

492
00:34:12.581 --> 00:34:15.850
biggest slave systems the world had ever created.

493
00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:20.800
And there was the old business about violence.
Uh,

494
00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:23.950
you can go away to the lots of books on this and articles on this.

495
00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.680
Why cockfighting was more popular in the south.

496
00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:31.030
Why white country fighting an eye gouging was Elliot Garner.

497
00:34:31.031 --> 00:34:34.300
A wonderful historian up at Brown wrote a brilliant,

498
00:34:34.301 --> 00:34:38.800
fascinating half crazy essay once about eye gouging in southern fighting.

499
00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:41.203
<v 1>And</v>

500
00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:44.400
<v 0>I dunno,
I used to love to quote from it,</v>

501
00:34:44.401 --> 00:34:48.090
but then I began to realize I'm only quoting that because it's about a guy's eye

502
00:34:48.091 --> 00:34:51.000
being gouged out.
So that's not going to do that anymore.

503
00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:52.453
<v 1>Okay,</v>

504
00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:57.650
<v 0>now see,
van Woodward weighed in on this great historian,</v>

505
00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:02.790
worked here much of his life,
but he said,
you know,
finally the south,

506
00:35:02.791 --> 00:35:03.331
he said,

507
00:35:03.331 --> 00:35:08.331
finally the South got liberated from being the place that America always dumped

508
00:35:09.961 --> 00:35:13.500
its sins
and his famous book of essays,

509
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:17.010
the burden of southern history among many other things.

510
00:35:17.011 --> 00:35:21.630
He argued that the south actually had the chance to finally be liberated from

511
00:35:21.631 --> 00:35:24.810
being deceit of all of America's sins

512
00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:30.280
by three things.
He didn't live long enough quite too well.

513
00:35:30.281 --> 00:35:31.480
He actually lived long enough,

514
00:35:31.481 --> 00:35:35.200
but he didn't really write about what I would add as a fourth one.
But he said,

515
00:35:35.201 --> 00:35:38.850
the civil rights revolution finally begin to liberate this out.

516
00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:42.820
And concomitantly.

517
00:35:42.821 --> 00:35:46.510
A second reason is that that civil rights revolution also brought through it's

518
00:35:46.511 --> 00:35:49.330
process,
a huge discovery.

519
00:35:49.331 --> 00:35:53.980
At the same time off northern racism when Martin Luther King brought the

520
00:35:53.981 --> 00:35:56.650
movement to Chicago and nearly got killed doing it.

521
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:59.623
<v 1>Okay.</v>

522
00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.260
<v 0>And in a thousand other ways,
Americans realize,
you know,</v>

523
00:36:02.261 --> 00:36:07.000
racism isn't a southern thing.
It's everywhere,
belongs to everyone.

524
00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:12.630
And then Woodward argued quite directly that the loss of the Vietnam war began

525
00:36:13.151 --> 00:36:18.151
to liberate the south in a sense that the south southerners,

526
00:36:18.371 --> 00:36:22.270
White southerners,
were the only Americans other than we always forget,

527
00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:26.290
native Americans who had ever lost a war.

528
00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:31.660
And then a burden was taken off the south by the loss of that Vietnam War.

529
00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:34.000
Now that's a debatable subject,
isn't it?

530
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:37.450
Because there's a broad revisionism about Vietnam.

531
00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:41.980
Ronald Reagan argued it was our,
our noble cause in Vietnam we could won,

532
00:36:41.981 --> 00:36:43.480
should have won,
we're winning

533
00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:47.200
and so on and so forth.

534
00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:52.840
There's even a fourth idea you might add to how the south may have been a little

535
00:36:52.841 --> 00:36:57.841
bit liberated from this past by what has happened in just the last 20 to 25

536
00:36:58.001 --> 00:36:59.860
years of American political history

537
00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:04.990
and economic history with sunbelt migration,

538
00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:11.280
with southern industrialization and post industrialization with massive

539
00:37:11.321 --> 00:37:13.540
immigration now from around the world,

540
00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:17.710
large Vietnamese populations in Louisiana,

541
00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:22.410
large Hispanic populations in North Carolina,
uh,

542
00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:26.680
huge Cuban and other Hispanic populations in Florida.

543
00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:28.540
You have a very,

544
00:37:28.541 --> 00:37:33.541
very changing demographic situation in the American south and its political

545
00:37:33.881 --> 00:37:35.740
culture has to respond to that.

546
00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:41.100
So we may live in your lifetime to a time when this burden of southern history

547
00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:47.680
may get all but lifted all together from southerners.

548
00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:49.750
Unless,

549
00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:52.533
<v 1>yeah,</v>

550
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:56.570
<v 0>we don't forget the civil war and we don't seem to forget it.</v>

551
00:37:57.470 --> 00:38:00.320
As I said the other day,
if that confederate flag would just go away,

552
00:38:00.321 --> 00:38:01.490
just just vanish,

553
00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:05.600
just stick it in the basement of museums and no one would ever care about it

554
00:38:05.601 --> 00:38:06.434
anymore.

555
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:13.090
<v 1>Maybe,
maybe</v>

556
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:18.130
<v 0>sounds burden would go away.
But there's another kind of burden,
and again,</v>

557
00:38:18.131 --> 00:38:20.350
Woodward and many others have written about this.

558
00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:25.000
One of the most distinctive things about southern the south is of course it's

559
00:38:25.001 --> 00:38:28.930
history.
Not just it's cultural,
not just its attitudes,

560
00:38:28.931 --> 00:38:33.580
not just its behavior,
not the kind of stuff that's,
uh,
uh,
uh,
what's his name?

561
00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:34.680
Um,
um,

562
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:38.830
John Shelton read the great sociologist has always doing these surveys of

563
00:38:38.831 --> 00:38:42.580
attitudes about southerners of Southerners by Southerners.

564
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:46.930
But let's remember the south had a distinctive history.

565
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.690
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

566
00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:54.690
<v 0>The antebellum southern economy became by the 1820s without any question,</v>

567
00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:00.100
a slave economy.
And by the 1820 [inaudible] and 1830s,

568
00:39:00.101 --> 00:39:02.170
the American south became,

569
00:39:02.171 --> 00:39:07.171
what I think you could safely say was the fifth slave society in human history,

570
00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:11.440
maybe the sixth.
This is a debatable

571
00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.800
now for a long time in American scholarship and an American classrooms.

572
00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:23.480
One of the deep mythologies about this whole story of the year of the American

573
00:39:23.481 --> 00:39:28.481
civil war and the old south is that the old south plantation economy was dying

574
00:39:29.691 --> 00:39:30.524
out.

575
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:35.300
Soil was being eroded and wasted along the eastern seaboard.

576
00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:40.790
And they were using up the great soils of the Mississippi Valley.

577
00:39:40.791 --> 00:39:44.320
And over time,
that slave system just somehow wasn't gonna.

578
00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:48.930
I wasn't gonna work out
now.
Oh,

579
00:39:48.931 --> 00:39:51.540
Rick Phillips argued this years and years and years ago.

580
00:39:51.541 --> 00:39:53.670
Others argued from real research.

581
00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:58.680
But along came Robert Fogel and Stanley Angerman and a generation of other

582
00:39:58.681 --> 00:40:00.870
scholars from the 1960s on.

583
00:40:00.871 --> 00:40:04.740
And there were people in before them who looked at the southern economy through

584
00:40:04.741 --> 00:40:09.741
clear metrics and statistics and a broad swath of new economic historical

585
00:40:10.651 --> 00:40:15.510
methods and analyses.
And they discovered that,
sorry folks,

586
00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.240
slavery was extremely profitable.

587
00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:21.840
The southern economy.
Thank you very much.

588
00:40:21.841 --> 00:40:26.190
Was booming south had its greatest cotton crop ever in 1860.

589
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.420
It was affected by the major American depressions of 80 and 37,

590
00:40:31.421 --> 00:40:34.450
857 but not as much as the north.

591
00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:39.610
<v 1>Okay.</v>

592
00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:44.080
<v 0>And Lo and behold,
that idea we had of the southern planter as this,</v>

593
00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.980
oh,
you know,
kind of anti modern,

594
00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:50.950
don't give up entirely on the anti modern label.

595
00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:52.390
I think there's still something to that.

596
00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:56.840
But that anti modern kind of backward looking,
um,

597
00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:00.760
planter who,
uh,
you know,

598
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:03.160
he didn't really like world markets.

599
00:41:03.161 --> 00:41:06.460
He didn't like railroads and trains and all that stuff.

600
00:41:06.461 --> 00:41:09.400
He just wanted to make a decent little living.

601
00:41:09.401 --> 00:41:13.900
If he could off growing some Hamptons and tobacco and indigo and some rice and

602
00:41:13.901 --> 00:41:16.690
some cotton,
and he was good to as slaves.

603
00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:22.240
They had a bad break coming from Africa.
But you know,
it's the way it goes.

604
00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:24.853
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

605
00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:29.390
<v 0>we know.
We now know if we know anything about the old south,</v>

606
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:32.810
the average American plants are they average American slave holders,

607
00:41:32.811 --> 00:41:36.660
small and big ones were raging capitalists.

608
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:40.580
They understood markets,
they understood profits.

609
00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:45.850
They were men of rational choice and the way to wealth in the American south,

610
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:50.530
the way to wealth,
even before the cartons yen,

611
00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:54.440
but especially after Eli Whitney's cotton gin.
And by the way,
folks,

612
00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:59.450
everybody knows Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin and was this originally,

613
00:41:59.451 --> 00:42:01.730
there's a little box smaller than this lectern.

614
00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:05.660
If you don't know that somebody should have taught you that in the sixth grade

615
00:42:05.661 --> 00:42:10.450
or fourth grade or first grade or somewhere good old Eli Whitney and all,

616
00:42:10.451 --> 00:42:11.330
it's his fault.

617
00:42:11.331 --> 00:42:16.331
We had the cotton boom and slavery grew and you got to turn Eli Whitney to the

618
00:42:16.791 --> 00:42:21.680
civil war
and then we have a great war for weeks,
you know,

619
00:42:21.681 --> 00:42:23.000
and it's all Eli Whitney.

620
00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:29.480
He's buried right across the street.
Go into Grove Street cemetery.

621
00:42:29.481 --> 00:42:34.390
So to go visit his grave and say,
it's not your fault,
Eli,

622
00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:37.520
it's okay.

623
00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:43.430
Cause then planners there were raging capital's just waiting for you.

624
00:42:43.431 --> 00:42:45.080
All you did is give them a machine.

625
00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:48.943
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

626
00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:52.690
<v 0>The way to wealth.
Faulkner wrote about this too,</v>

627
00:42:52.691 --> 00:42:56.500
in that immortal character he created and Thomas Sutton and Absalom,
Absalom,

628
00:42:56.501 --> 00:42:57.550
who is Thomas Sutton,

629
00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:02.700
Thomas Sutton is that guy who arrives out in Alabama with a group of Haitian

630
00:43:02.711 --> 00:43:06.550
slaves with them.
He treats him like a absolute tyrant.

631
00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.620
He carves down the forest,

632
00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:13.920
he begins to cultivate the land and he declares what your God I have for success

633
00:43:14.411 --> 00:43:18.940
in the south is a house,
some land and some niggers.

634
00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:26.330
That's another one of those sentences by Faulkner that sort of captured this

635
00:43:26.331 --> 00:43:31.331
spirit of Alabama fever as it was called the 1820s and thirties and Mississippi

636
00:43:31.701 --> 00:43:33.350
fever in the 1830 [inaudible] wheezy Deanna,

637
00:43:33.351 --> 00:43:36.680
Texas fever by the 18 why Louisiana fevers or been earlier,

638
00:43:36.681 --> 00:43:41.681
but Texas fever by the 1840 land was so rich and it was really cheap at first.

639
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:47.750
Now how powerful

640
00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:54.050
was the cotton boom once it took hold?

641
00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:56.523
<v 1>MMM,</v>

642
00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:03.710
<v 0>this powerful sea island cotton,</v>

643
00:44:03.711 --> 00:44:07.610
the kind of cotton grown down there and the Georgia where it was first grown in

644
00:44:07.611 --> 00:44:12.611
North America and the Georgia South Carolina islands was it kind of long and

645
00:44:14.541 --> 00:44:18.920
silky kind of cotton and they weren't very successful in growing it in huge

646
00:44:18.921 --> 00:44:19.880
amounts,

647
00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:25.370
but that's short staple car that eventually was the form of cotton that the

648
00:44:25.371 --> 00:44:30.371
cotton gin made into such a massive marketable world product is what made the

649
00:44:31.531 --> 00:44:36.531
cotton boom boom by the 1820s already within a decade of the war of 1812 and the

650
00:44:38.941 --> 00:44:43.941
opening of the frontier cottons future seems limitless.

651
00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:49.230
And one of the best analogies you can think of is the oil rich nations of the

652
00:44:49.231 --> 00:44:53.040
world in post World War II and the post World War Two era,

653
00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:57.300
whether it's Saudi Arabia,
Iraq and Iran,

654
00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:03.570
the Emirates or Venezuela name today,
Russia,

655
00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:10.050
if you're an oil rich country today,
as long as that oil last you got the,

656
00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:14.400
you got the world kind of,
it's your knees,
you're an OPEC,

657
00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:18.780
and that is exactly what the south began to see itself as.

658
00:45:18.781 --> 00:45:22.890
At least southern leadership began to see itself as as early as the 1820s and

659
00:45:22.891 --> 00:45:23.820
1830s

660
00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:30.980
the cotton crop nearly doubled every decade from 1820 to 1864 decades in a row,

661
00:45:32.221 --> 00:45:35.190
the production of American cotton nearly doubled.
Now,

662
00:45:35.191 --> 00:45:40.191
think of another product in American history that doubled every decade for four

663
00:45:40.801 --> 00:45:41.634
decades,

664
00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:46.110
and then imagine that that product became the countries without question.

665
00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.330
Absolute largest export

666
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:54.020
general motors at its height.
When I was growing up in Flint,

667
00:45:54.021 --> 00:45:57.920
Michigan in boom times would have wished it could have said that

668
00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:06.580
already by 1825 that early the south was the world's largest supplier of cotton

669
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:10.510
and fueling.
Now this dust,

670
00:46:10.511 --> 00:46:14.360
real revolution in textile production and Great Britain and other places,

671
00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:20.270
and think of it this way.
Um,
I need a map for this.

672
00:46:20.271 --> 00:46:21.104
Excuse me.

673
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:26.103
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

674
00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:29.250
<v 0>Oh right.
I pushed the right button.</v>

675
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:33.320
I know you can't see that very well.

676
00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:35.873
<v 1>Okay.</v>

677
00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:40.380
<v 0>I think I can zoom though.
Hey,</v>

678
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:41.303
cool.

679
00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:45.683
<v 1>Well,</v>

680
00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:55.340
<v 0>I don't know if you can see those colors much at all.
Sorry about that.
Um,</v>

681
00:46:56.130 --> 00:47:01.110
but what you've got at the top or the early 17 nine and in the 1820 in terms of

682
00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:04.320
of slave population in the American south.

683
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:07.230
But if you look at 1860 the bottom map,

684
00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:11.190
if you can vaguely see those deep dark red areas,

685
00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:15.000
you can see where cotton moved,

686
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:18.120
where slavery moved in the domestic slave trade,

687
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:21.180
and then where southern political power move.

688
00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:24.930
And you will find as we will in the next few weeks,

689
00:47:24.931 --> 00:47:29.320
the southern political power by the 1850 [inaudible] and 1860s is really no

690
00:47:29.321 --> 00:47:33.760
longer in Virginia or even South Carolina.
It's out in the Mississippi Valley.

691
00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:35.710
There's a very good reason.

692
00:47:35.711 --> 00:47:40.711
Jefferson Davis becomes president of the confederacy in 1860 is because he's

693
00:47:41.081 --> 00:47:45.830
from Mississippi
now.
Um,

694
00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:50.960
fortunes were made overnight.
New Wealth overnight.

695
00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:54.980
A number of men is one historian has written and I think quite effectively

696
00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:57.910
mounted from log cabin to mansion.

697
00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:02.930
I quote on a stairway of cotton bales accumulating slaves as they went.

698
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:09.320
If you had five slaves and a good piece of land in Alabama in 1820 you might

699
00:48:09.321 --> 00:48:13.970
very likely have 50 slaves and a hell of a lot more than a decade later,

700
00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:19.580
but it's also worth knowing that that slave holding population was also fluid.

701
00:48:19.581 --> 00:48:20.780
People moved in and out of it.

702
00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:27.220
There were approximately 400,000 slaveholders white slave holders in the

703
00:48:29.601 --> 00:48:34.601
American south by 1860 about one third of southern white families at one time or

704
00:48:38.511 --> 00:48:42.380
another had at least a toe hold in slave ownership.

705
00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:46.580
That means two thirds did not.
Of course,

706
00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:50.480
two thirds of the white south remained in those classes.

707
00:48:50.481 --> 00:48:53.300
We've come to call the yeoman farmers.

708
00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.330
The poor whites or the sand hill farmers is,

709
00:48:56.331 --> 00:49:01.070
they were sometimes call in certain regions of the south.

710
00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:03.620
The yeoman farmer,
non slave holding,

711
00:49:03.621 --> 00:49:07.850
but landowning usually and in the poor white farmer,
non slave holding me,

712
00:49:07.851 --> 00:49:12.440
usually not even land owning,
usually renting or working for wage labor.

713
00:49:12.590 --> 00:49:16.730
We're 40 50 and even 60% of the white population in a given region.

714
00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:27.400
Jefferson Davis is in fact a classic example of the cotton boom planter.

715
00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:32.770
He was born in relatively meager and humble circumstances in Kentucky.

716
00:49:32.771 --> 00:49:36.610
Not what about 80 miles from where Abraham Lincoln was born and even meager

717
00:49:36.611 --> 00:49:37.480
circumstances,

718
00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:41.800
but his older brother Joseph went out to Mississippi and struck it rich and

719
00:49:41.801 --> 00:49:46.390
cotton and Jefferson Davis went out to join him and Jefferson Davis became a

720
00:49:46.391 --> 00:49:47.224
millionaire

721
00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:49.703
<v 1>on cotton.</v>

722
00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:54.920
<v 0>Chris Jefferson Davis really preferred to be a military officer and went to West</v>

723
00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.900
Point on and on and on and the rest is history.

724
00:49:57.950 --> 00:50:00.740
My Watch says I've run out of time now let me leave you with this.

725
00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:07.910
How successful was the cotton boom?
How important was the cotton boom?

726
00:50:07.911 --> 00:50:11.390
What is the relationship between the spread of slavery,

727
00:50:11.391 --> 00:50:15.640
the spread of cotton and power?
By 1860

728
00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:21.800
there were approximately 4 million slaves in the United States.
The third,

729
00:50:21.801 --> 00:50:26.240
the second largest slave societies,
slave population in the world,

730
00:50:26.241 --> 00:50:29.480
the only one larger Russian serfdom,
Brazil was close,

731
00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:33.890
but in 1860 American slaves as a financial asset,

732
00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:38.600
we're worth approximately three and a half billion dollars.

733
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:40.130
That's just as property.

734
00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:41.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

735
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:46.630
<v 0>Three and a half billion dollars was the net worth roughly of slaves in 1860 in</v>

736
00:50:47.121 --> 00:50:48.260
today's dollars,

737
00:50:48.261 --> 00:50:53.261
that would be approximately $75 billion in 1860 slaves.

738
00:50:54.741 --> 00:50:59.450
As an asset,
we're worth more than all of America's manufacturing,

739
00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:00.710
all of the railroads,

740
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:04.880
all of the productive capacity of the United States put together.

741
00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:11.520
Slaves were the single largest by far financial asset of property and the entire

742
00:51:12.971 --> 00:51:13.960
American economy.

743
00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:19.170
The only thing worth more than the slaves in the American economy of the 1850s

744
00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:25.110
was the land itself and no one can really put a dollar value on all of the land

745
00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:32.040
of North America.
If you're looking to begin to understand

746
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.180
why the south will begin to defend this system,

747
00:51:37.181 --> 00:51:41.650
defend the society and worry about it's shrinking and worry about a political

748
00:51:41.651 --> 00:51:44.560
culture from the north that is really beginning to criticize them.

749
00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:50.280
Thank three and a half billion dollars and the largest financial asset in

750
00:51:50.281 --> 00:51:54.360
American society and what you might even try to compare that to today.

751
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:58.690
I'll pick up with this next Tuesday.

752
00:51:58.691 --> 00:52:01.480
It's a perfect transition into the pro slavery argument

753
00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:05.680
and the southern World View.
Thank you.
