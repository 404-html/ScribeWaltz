1
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.030
The first formally recognized or organized black regimen and the civil war was

2
00:00:20.111 --> 00:00:23.410
known as the first South Carolina volunteers.

3
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.070
It was organized and entirely and exclusively among freed slaves along the sea

4
00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:30.970
islands of South Carolina.

5
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.260
He had had an amazing noncommissioned officer whose name was prince rivers.

6
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.363
<v 1>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.550
<v 0>A man had been a slave yesterday,</v>

8
00:00:46.551 --> 00:00:49.940
but a free man by 1862

9
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.193
<v 1>and whom</v>

10
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.800
<v 0>and who is white commanding officer Thomas weren't worth Higginson said in</v>

11
00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:02.590
another land and another time he could come in any army in the world.

12
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.953
<v 1>Okay.</v>

13
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.770
<v 0>Thomas Wentworth Higginson was an abolitionist from Wooster,</v>

14
00:01:08.771 --> 00:01:12.280
Massachusetts who ended up the colonel and the commander of that regimen.

15
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.680
Nearly 1000 freed slaves recruited among the roughly 35 to 40,000 former slaves

16
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.580
along the Georgia and South Carolina Sea islands.

17
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.710
They're getting someone on to write a great book about it called army life and a

18
00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:33.580
black regimen.

19
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.310
And among the remarkable descriptions,

20
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:43.311
you left in that classic is this description from Thanksgiving day 1862 so it's

21
00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:50.721
November 62 the preliminary Manson pro emancipation proclamation is in place,

22
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.630
but the final emancipation proclamation hasn't quite happened yet.

23
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.170
It was actually the first formally,
legally,

24
00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:05.580
federally recognized Thanksgiving Day,
so decreed by Abraham Lincoln

25
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.210
and Higginson had his headquarters in an old plantation house.

26
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.410
He looked out of broken windows

27
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.890
at this abandoned plantation and the sea islands through what he described as

28
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.610
the great avenues of great live oaks and he observed that quote,

29
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.730
all this is the universal southern Panorama,

30
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.320
but five minutes walk beyond the huddles and the live oaks.

31
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.890
We'll bring one to something so and southern that the whole southern coast at

32
00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:48.390
this moment trembles at the suggestion of such a thing,

33
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.490
a camp of a regimen of freed slaves.

34
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.040
Almost two years later,

35
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.570
one of those freed slaves named George Hatton wrote a couple letters from the

36
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:05.404
front.

37
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.580
George Hatton was a former slave.

38
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.130
He had lived part of his life in Washington DC,
part of his life and Virginia,

39
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.470
North Carolina.
He'd been around.

40
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.390
He was at this point by April of 1864 a noncommissioned sergeant and company c

41
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:31.180
first regimen,
the United States colored troops.
They were in camp near New Bern,

42
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:32.260
North Carolina,

43
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.910
and he sat down to write a letter to reflect upon the circumstance that he found

44
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:39.790
himself in
Hatton.

45
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.780
His fellow soldiers and their families had lived generations of slaves

46
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.860
and this is what he wrote.
He says,
though,

47
00:03:52.861 --> 00:03:57.420
the government openly declared that it did not want the negroes in this

48
00:03:57.421 --> 00:03:58.320
conflict.

49
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.100
I look around me and see hundreds of colored men armed and ready to defend the

50
00:04:04.231 --> 00:04:07.050
government at any moment and such.

51
00:04:07.051 --> 00:04:12.051
You're my feelings that I can only say the fetters of fallen our bondage is

52
00:04:13.231 --> 00:04:16.170
over.
A month later,

53
00:04:16.171 --> 00:04:18.540
Hatton's regimen was in camp near Jamestown,

54
00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:22.020
Virginia and he didn't miss the irony of being a Jamestown

55
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.560
founding side of Virginia

56
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.960
and into his lines came several black freed women

57
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.000
who all declared they had recently been severely whipped by a master

58
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.390
members of Hatton's company,
managed to capture that slave owner,

59
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.130
a Mr. Clayton,

60
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.510
the man who had allegedly administered the beatings on these women.

61
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.740
The White Virginia was stripped to the waist.

62
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.580
He was tied to a tree and he was given 20 lashes by one of his own former

63
00:05:02.341 --> 00:05:05.700
slaves,
a man named William Harris,

64
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.040
who was now a member of the union army.
In turn,

65
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.100
each of the women that Clayton had beaten,

66
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.420
we're given the whip and their chance to lay the lash on the slave holders back.

67
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:24.550
<v 1>Okay.</v>

68
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.580
<v 0>The women were given,
leave,
said Sergeant Hatton,</v>

69
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.790
his words to remind him that they were no longer his but safely housed in

70
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:40.291
Abraham's bosom and under the protection of the Star spangled banner and guarded

71
00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:46.060
by their own patriotic.
Though once downtrodden,
race,

72
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.520
and Hatton's letter,
he wants again,

73
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.730
felt lost for words to describe the transformation he was witnessing.

74
00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.790
Yeah.
Oh,
that I had the tongue to express my feelings.
He wrote,

75
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.860
while standing on the banks of the James River on the soil of old Virginia,

76
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.140
the mother's state of slavery as a witness of such a sudden reverse.

77
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.120
The day is clear.

78
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.930
The fields of grain are beautiful and the birds are singing sweet melodious

79
00:06:19.971 --> 00:06:20.804
songs.

80
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.560
While poor Mr. Clayton is crying to his servants from mercy.

81
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.043
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

82
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.720
<v 0>That's a revolution described</v>

83
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.250
in the words of a former slave words that we're trying to capture the

84
00:06:42.561 --> 00:06:44.990
transformations of history.
At the same time,

85
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.810
his actions were trying to transform history.

86
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.353
<v 1>Okay</v>

87
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.253
<v 0>words.</v>

88
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.590
Now we will forever debate in this society the meaning of the emancipation

89
00:07:02.591 --> 00:07:06.570
proclamation
over and over and over again.

90
00:07:06.571 --> 00:07:08.880
We debate did it really free anybody?

91
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.390
Why did it only freed the slaves in the states and rebellion?

92
00:07:12.391 --> 00:07:17.100
Why was Lincoln so bloody legalistic in this document was Richard Hofstadter,

93
00:07:17.101 --> 00:07:20.130
right when he said it had all the eloquence of a bill of lading,

94
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.440
which means the grocery list.

95
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.990
Why was it written like it was a legal brief in court

96
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.900
here and they're laced with some remarkable phrases.

97
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:38.950
Why was he so careful not to free the slaves in the border states that hadn't

98
00:07:39.861 --> 00:07:43.280
left the union and on and on,

99
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.260
but I think we should make no mistake.

100
00:07:47.261 --> 00:07:52.150
The emancipation proclamation is a terribly important American document.

101
00:07:52.151 --> 00:07:56.470
Emancipation is not just the story of great documents is I'm trying to argue,

102
00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.540
but this one's important.

103
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.710
The second paragraph reads,

104
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.200
and this is by the way,
Lincoln's own handwriting.

105
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.080
This is a fast simile of the original.

106
00:08:11.081 --> 00:08:16.081
He wrote some three or four originals that on the first day of January,

107
00:08:16.661 --> 00:08:18.060
in this year of our Lord,

108
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:23.070
1,863 all persons held as slaves within any state or designated part of a state.

109
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:32.700
The people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States.

110
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.850
God is this legal?
Listic shall be then.

111
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.160
This is not legalistic.

112
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:44.470
Then Vince forward and forever free

113
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:49.340
and the executive government of this United States,

114
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.820
including the military and naval authorities there of the army and navy now

115
00:08:55.651 --> 00:08:57.420
bound to do this.
It says,

116
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:03.410
we'll recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons and we'll do no act or

117
00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:11.511
acts to repress such persons or any of them in any efforts.

118
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.300
They may make four there

119
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.770
<v 1>actual freedom,</v>

120
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.420
actual freedom.

121
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:36.923
No.

122
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.660
<v 0>Yeah,
it was a limited document.</v>

123
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:44.610
It didn't free as many slides as a second confiscation act illegally already set

124
00:09:44.611 --> 00:09:48.370
in motion.
That's true,

125
00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.420
but this is the most important thing to remember about the emancipation

126
00:09:52.421 --> 00:09:53.254
proclamation.

127
00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:59.020
Most black folks didn't care about the details of it.

128
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:00.630
<v 1>Okay?</v>

129
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.580
<v 0>What they cared about is the,</v>

130
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:07.700
that the United States government had acted and said they were going to be free.

131
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:11.160
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

132
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.940
<v 0>There were at least four immediate and visible effects of the proclamation once</v>

133
00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:17.070
it went into effect on January 1st

134
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:18.550
<v 1>okay.</v>

135
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:23.440
<v 0>Every forward step of the union armies now would be whether some of those</v>

136
00:10:23.441 --> 00:10:27.640
officers liked it or not a liberating step.

137
00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.300
Secondly,
news of this proclamation,

138
00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:39.301
whatever the details and the fine print would spread like wild flower.

139
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:43.870
I,
we'll have fire,
excuse me,
across the south.

140
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:45.740
<v 1>Okay.</v>

141
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.540
<v 0>And it would bring about,
there's no question.</v>

142
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.390
It will bring about increased activity,

143
00:10:50.391 --> 00:10:55.391
increased flight and creased movement toward union lines by freed people where

144
00:10:55.521 --> 00:10:59.000
they can do it.
And there's all over all over the record.

145
00:10:59.001 --> 00:11:04.001
We have testimony of confederate soldiers themselves of southerners,

146
00:11:04.041 --> 00:11:07.520
White southerners themselves saying they first heard about the emancipation

147
00:11:07.521 --> 00:11:09.500
proclamation from their slaves.

148
00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:14.223
<v 1>Okay.</v>

149
00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.560
<v 0>Third had committed the United States government in the eyes of the world.</v>

150
00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.820
And it's terribly important when we remember the Great Britain was on the verge

151
00:11:21.821 --> 00:11:23.680
of recognition of the confederacy.

152
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.930
More on that bit later in the course of how that foreign relationship and the

153
00:11:28.931 --> 00:11:33.310
problem of civil war diplomacy is being managed by the two governments union and

154
00:11:33.311 --> 00:11:34.144
confederate

155
00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:36.720
<v 1>and forth</v>

156
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.530
<v 0>on the second page of the emancipation proclamation,</v>

157
00:11:40.531 --> 00:11:44.730
or is it the third and another very legalistic paragraph.

158
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.790
Lincoln formally authorizes once and for all,

159
00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:49.560
although it's already begun to happen,

160
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:54.250
the recruitment of black men into the union armies

161
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.083
<v 2>and navies,</v>

162
00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:01.950
and it authorizes a formal process to recruit black men.

163
00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:03.480
<v 1>Okay.</v>

164
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.620
<v 2>To the union uniform</v>

165
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:06.993
<v 1>and</v>

166
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.200
<v 2>before the war will end,</v>

167
00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:13.160
about 10% of all union forces will be African American,

168
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:19.590
approximately 180080% of whom were former slaves

169
00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.590
from the slave states.

170
00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:28.403
<v 1>No.</v>

171
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.230
<v 2>In that fall of 1862 Frederick Douglass put down as cultural that he'd been</v>

172
00:12:34.231 --> 00:12:36.900
beating Lincoln with for a year.
And is that a tutorial?
Then?

173
00:12:36.901 --> 00:12:40.290
He beat him bitterly at times.
At one point in,
in,

174
00:12:40.291 --> 00:12:42.630
in the late 61 he called Abraham Lincoln,

175
00:12:42.631 --> 00:12:44.820
the most powerful slave catcher in the world.

176
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.370
That was Douglas.
His opinion of that denial of asylum policy,

177
00:12:50.371 --> 00:12:53.610
which said fugitive slaves escaping union lines had to be returned if their

178
00:12:53.611 --> 00:12:55.800
owners were loyal.
Douglas,

179
00:12:55.801 --> 00:12:59.520
like many others saw the nonsense in that policy early on.

180
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:01.450
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

181
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:03.590
<v 2>Douglas finally put down the Cudgel</v>

182
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:10.080
and he said,
lovely irony,
it is really wonderful.

183
00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:12.780
Said Frederick Douglass,
how all efforts to evade,

184
00:13:12.781 --> 00:13:17.781
postpone and prevent its coming had been mocked and defied by the stupendous

185
00:13:19.081 --> 00:13:22.050
sweep of event.
It's coming,

186
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.150
meaning black freedom.

187
00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:26.573
<v 1>Okay.</v>

188
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.280
<v 2>And I'd just say lastly,
if at a fifth to that</v>

189
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:36.040
emancipation transformed the purpose of the war.

190
00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:41.940
Emancipation more than anything else will make the civil war war of conquest or

191
00:13:42.151 --> 00:13:46.000
of near totality on both sides.

192
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:48.700
And it meant now,

193
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:55.490
now that this was going to be a war of conquest on the south social and economic

194
00:13:55.891 --> 00:13:57.000
institutions,

195
00:13:57.001 --> 00:14:02.001
it meant it for probably only end in unconditional surrender.

196
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.970
Now it's a complicated story as to how this will be enforced.
Of course,

197
00:14:08.971 --> 00:14:13.971
and I strongly urge you to read certain of those Lincoln documents in the in the

198
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.050
Mike Johnson reader,

199
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:21.120
and more importantly to read at least that that greatest hits selection I

200
00:14:21.121 --> 00:14:26.121
provided in the reading packet of the documents on emancipation,

201
00:14:26.161 --> 00:14:28.680
which by the way come out of a book called free at last,

202
00:14:28.681 --> 00:14:33.681
which is itself a 500 page collection of the greatest hits of the documents,

203
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.650
the American emancipation,
which are not published in five volumes,

204
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.610
all of which are in the library or in the national archives,

205
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.460
but one of those Lincoln documents I don't want you to miss.

206
00:14:47.461 --> 00:14:49.950
I said to you the day was the James Conkling letter.

207
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.610
It comes August of 63

208
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:59.150
<v 0>one of the reasons that letter is interesting is that it shows us that the</v>

209
00:14:59.151 --> 00:15:01.580
Lincoln could be one crafty politician

210
00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:07.650
and whether emancipation will ever truly succeed in this war.

211
00:15:07.651 --> 00:15:10.260
Of course depends on the union winning on the battlefield.

212
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:15.710
It really depended on all those deaths at Gettysburg and Vicksburg and so many

213
00:15:16.801 --> 00:15:21.000
other horrible places and yes,
it's true.

214
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:21.961
The large,

215
00:15:21.961 --> 00:15:26.940
large numbers of those union soldiers who died didn't necessarily believe they

216
00:15:26.941 --> 00:15:29.640
were fighting to free slaves,
nor did they even want to.

217
00:15:29.641 --> 00:15:33.870
But sometimes history is ahead of anyone's basic human individual motives,

218
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:37.920
isn't it?
But in this Conkling letters,

219
00:15:37.921 --> 00:15:38.930
so called,

220
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:43.970
it's a public letter that link Lincoln mastered this presidential art of the

221
00:15:43.971 --> 00:15:46.400
public letter more than any previous president.

222
00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:51.440
And it was his version of the news conference,

223
00:15:51.441 --> 00:15:54.410
which didn't happen in those days.
It was his version of it,

224
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.140
an exclusive interview with Anderson Cooper or whatever the hell it would be

225
00:15:59.141 --> 00:16:02.830
today.
Um,
he wrote letters,

226
00:16:02.831 --> 00:16:06.580
aim that certain newspapers,
which would then be reprinted across the country.

227
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.370
This was a letter to James Conklin,

228
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:14.550
congressmen from Illinois of his own party who was opposing emancipation,

229
00:16:16.241 --> 00:16:19.330
who was it,
who was the least wary of it and worried about it.

230
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.810
The great worry about the man's patient policy of course,

231
00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.110
was it white northerners would not accept it,

232
00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:29.800
that white northern soldiers were thrown out on their arms and say,

233
00:16:29.801 --> 00:16:32.770
I ain't fighting to free the slaves.
I'm fighting to preserve the union.

234
00:16:32.771 --> 00:16:37.480
Thank you very much.
We can have that great fear himself.

235
00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:39.400
<v 1>Okay,</v>

236
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.860
<v 0>but God read that letter.</v>

237
00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.550
It's one of Lincoln's.

238
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:50.330
It's Lincoln,
the ironist.
It's also Lincoln,

239
00:16:50.331 --> 00:16:52.640
the persuasive lawyer.

240
00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.980
The second page of it,
he says to Conklin,

241
00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.430
he's really saying this to white northerners.
Now is this,

242
00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:04.780
this is letter have published everywhere you disliked the emancipation

243
00:17:04.781 --> 00:17:08.080
proclamation he says in perhaps would have it retracted.

244
00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:13.300
You say it is unconstitutional.
I think differently.

245
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.850
I think the constitution investments commander in chief with the law of war in

246
00:17:18.851 --> 00:17:19.870
time of war,

247
00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:25.420
the most that can be said if so much is that the slaves,

248
00:17:25.421 --> 00:17:28.480
our property is there.

249
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:33.630
Has there ever been any question that by law of war property,

250
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.840
both of enemies and friends maybe taken when needed?

251
00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.400
So there's that argument.
Whatever you think of the morality of this folks,

252
00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.630
slaves were property of the enemy.
I'm taking their assets.

253
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.960
It's a legal argument.
Then you go to the next page.

254
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.210
He's also beginning to make their an argument.

255
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.580
If you read that part of the letter carefully,

256
00:17:56.581 --> 00:18:01.581
it's an argument for total war to unconditional surrender and he's trying to

257
00:18:03.961 --> 00:18:06.090
condition public opinion for this.

258
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.070
Did you go to the next page?
You say,

259
00:18:11.071 --> 00:18:13.260
you will not fight to free negroes.

260
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.650
Some of them seem willing to fight for you,

261
00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:22.900
but no matter fight you then exclusively to save the Union.

262
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:28.270
I issued the proclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the union whenever you

263
00:18:28.271 --> 00:18:30.730
should all have conquered all resistance to the union.

264
00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.220
If I show urge you to continue fighting,

265
00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:39.180
it will be an app time then for you to declare you will not fight to free

266
00:18:39.431 --> 00:18:40.264
negroes.

267
00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.393
<v 1>All right.</v>

268
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:52.370
<v 0>Crawl into your the and say you're only fighting to save the union,</v>

269
00:18:52.371 --> 00:18:56.610
but here's another way to save the Union
and then he goes on.

270
00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:03.250
I thought that in your struggle for the union to whatever extent the Negros

271
00:19:03.251 --> 00:19:06.190
should cease helping the enemy to that extent,

272
00:19:06.191 --> 00:19:10.660
it weakened the enemy and his resistance to you.
Do you think differently?

273
00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:16.300
I thought that whatever negroes can be got to do as soldiers leads just so much

274
00:19:16.301 --> 00:19:19.210
less for white soldiers to do and saving the union

275
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:26.760
almost as if he's appealing to Conklin's racial self interest.

276
00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:29.580
Does it appear otherwise to you?

277
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.890
And then Lincoln says,
but Negros,

278
00:19:34.891 --> 00:19:37.620
like other people act upon motives.

279
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:42.780
Why should they do anything for us if we will do nothing for them?

280
00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:48.840
If they stick their lives for us,
they must be prompted by the strongest motive,

281
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:53.280
even the promise of freedom and the promise being made.

282
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:58.880
Mohs B.

283
00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:04.120
Okay.
Blah,
blah,
blah.
Lots of words,
right?

284
00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:07.350
Words,
words,
words,
words.

285
00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.213
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

286
00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:17.080
<v 0>but meanings.
Xero,
almost always somewhere somehow and better than words.</v>

287
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.333
<v 1>No.</v>

288
00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.030
<v 0>As I said,
now,</v>

289
00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:26.380
every forward step of the union armies is going to be oh,

290
00:20:26.381 --> 00:20:27.730
liberating step.

291
00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:31.930
And I want to show up just a quick map here to illustrate something.

292
00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:33.723
Um,

293
00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:52.780
<v 2>I hope you can see the colors here to some extent.</v>

294
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.570
The simple point of this map is this.

295
00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:01.800
It's a map that shows the conquest of the South by union forces.

296
00:21:01.801 --> 00:21:06.801
It's the movement generally speaking of union lines into the south and what

297
00:21:07.621 --> 00:21:12.621
becomes now by 62 63 and 64 a war of conquest west and east.

298
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:21.440
But I want to especially stress that the most important factor in when and where

299
00:21:22.201 --> 00:21:24.570
a slave might attain his or her freedom.

300
00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:29.220
The first factor had everything to do with where the army's went.

301
00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:34.460
It was proximity to the war that made emancipation possible in northern Virginia

302
00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:37.920
and 80 60 to see islands of Georgia,
South Carolina,

303
00:21:37.921 --> 00:21:42.921
62 around the whole New Orleans region in 62 but not possible at all.

304
00:21:43.501 --> 00:21:47.340
And southern Georgia until after the war was over.
Not Possible really at all.

305
00:21:47.341 --> 00:21:51.180
And Southern Alabama,
southern half of Alabama and told the whole war was over,

306
00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.200
not possible at all and parts of Mississippi until the whole war was over.

307
00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:01.430
Hence that's why the large majority of American slaves were not actually within

308
00:22:01.951 --> 00:22:06.951
union lines or technically free in any way until the war ended.

309
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:11.760
<v 1>Aye.</v>

310
00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:16.260
<v 2>Make one other point about this does it as a nice book by a historian named</v>

311
00:22:16.261 --> 00:22:20.580
Steven Ash.
It's called when the Yankees came and it's,

312
00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:22.750
it's all about the,

313
00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:27.060
the process of union occupation of parts of the south.

314
00:22:27.061 --> 00:22:29.280
He goes in and studies towns in Tennessee,

315
00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:34.490
in towns in northern Georgia and towns in northern Virginia and tries to

316
00:22:34.561 --> 00:22:35.071
understand,

317
00:22:35.071 --> 00:22:39.360
so what happens when an area of the south end area of the confederacy came under

318
00:22:39.361 --> 00:22:42.930
union control?
And he divides the south usefully here.

319
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.740
And it's very useful in understanding how emancipation actually happened on the

320
00:22:46.741 --> 00:22:51.180
ground as a human,
sometimes brutal,
ugly,

321
00:22:51.181 --> 00:22:54.540
chaotic,
painful process.

322
00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:00.630
He divides the south into what he calls one at three regions.

323
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.240
One the confederate frontier,

324
00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:09.140
the second he calls no man's land and the 30 calls garrison towns.

325
00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.920
Now that's pretty easy to understand.
If you think of a,

326
00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:17.340
this just take Tennessee up there in the middle.
Nashville became,

327
00:23:17.341 --> 00:23:22.170
by 1862,
Nashville became a Garrett.
It was the capital of Tennessee.

328
00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:27.300
It became a garrisoned union town.
That is,
it's occupied,

329
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.280
it's resources,
it's railroads,
it's,

330
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:32.850
it's everything were taken over by the union forces.

331
00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:35.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

332
00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.030
<v 2>And then there's the so called no man's land.</v>

333
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:40.730
The region say between,
uh,

334
00:23:40.731 --> 00:23:44.730
Nashville and where the confederate forces were,

335
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:47.240
the land between the army's,

336
00:23:47.241 --> 00:23:50.060
which of course fluctuated a great deal back and forth.

337
00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.353
<v 1>Okay.</v>

338
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:56.240
<v 2>And then lastly,
he calls it the confederate frontier,</v>

339
00:23:56.241 --> 00:23:59.330
or at times he'll call it the confederate hinterland.

340
00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.060
That is the land behind the line.

341
00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.300
It was never taken by union forces.

342
00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:06.510
<v 1>Okay.</v>

343
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:11.040
<v 2>Land the land behind the lines were confederate resources.</v>

344
00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:13.950
Relatively speaking,
remained in tech.

345
00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:16.890
There's still producing cotton crops

346
00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:23.760
in the summer of 64 in the fall of 64 and they're still planting the whole

347
00:24:23.891 --> 00:24:27.700
southern half of Georgia and the whole southern half of Alabama by and large.

348
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.770
Right on and 1865

349
00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:38.360
but where you happen to be geographically was the first important factor and

350
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:43.890
where and how emancipation might occur in proximity,

351
00:24:43.891 --> 00:24:48.891
particularly to the army's now a second factor that would determine when and if

352
00:24:50.311 --> 00:24:51.660
slaves would be free,

353
00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:56.820
was the character of the slave society in any given region,

354
00:24:56.821 --> 00:25:00.720
were they in a densely populated slave region like the sea islands,

355
00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.830
parts of the cotton belt?
Oh,

356
00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:08.340
were they in sparsely populated areas

357
00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:14.080
and it,
I mean again,
it had to do with geography.

358
00:25:14.081 --> 00:25:16.060
Where are you in the Lower Mississippi Valley?

359
00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:20.770
Huge concentrations of slaves when grants forces moved down to Mississippi.

360
00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:21.653
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

361
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:27.350
<v 2>And eventually take Vicksburg by July,</v>

362
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:31.550
1863 this entire region,
the fact it is in the lower Mississippi valley.

363
00:25:31.551 --> 00:25:33.410
This is why some people argue that the war,

364
00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.940
the civil war was really won and lost in the West.
And I'll,

365
00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.760
I'll engage that argument after the break when we talk about union victory and

366
00:25:40.761 --> 00:25:44.750
confederate defeat and the various debates among his story and trying to explain

367
00:25:44.751 --> 00:25:45.170
this,

368
00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:49.800
a lot of people have argued that the war is won and lost in the West because of

369
00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.520
the great significance of the Mississippi Valley,

370
00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.000
which had become the great cotton kingdom of the world.

371
00:25:56.870 --> 00:26:01.490
And when union forces truly conquered the Mississippi River by the summer of

372
00:26:01.491 --> 00:26:06.050
1863,
there are thousands of slaves coming in to union lines.

373
00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:11.030
The reason that grant and Sherman and other officers in the west begin to create

374
00:26:11.031 --> 00:26:15.260
these things called contraband camps for freed slaves is because they didn't

375
00:26:15.261 --> 00:26:16.340
know what,
what to do with them.

376
00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:20.290
And there are these amazing dispatches written by grant,
uh,
to,

377
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:23.390
to the war department saying,
what am I going to do with all these people?

378
00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:27.470
How do I feed them?
Where do I put them?
What is their status?

379
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.550
What are they legally?

380
00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.840
And eventually it's why you get the largest contraband camps anywhere.

381
00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.420
The largest ones were not in Virginia.
I'll go.

382
00:26:35.421 --> 00:26:37.640
There was a huge one around Washington DC.

383
00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.540
The largest of them were in northern Mississippi to place called Corinth.

384
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.890
You can see it on the map,
right?

385
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.300
There was a huge contraband camp at Memphis is eventually one in Cairo,
Illinois,

386
00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.160
all up and down this region.

387
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:56.960
This is where conquest really happened first and that the true disruption of

388
00:26:59.041 --> 00:27:03.990
southern society and the beginnings of the destruction of plantation,

389
00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:10.080
it will lead even to the beginnings of,
it's going to,

390
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.900
it's going to take another year for it to happen along the east coast,

391
00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:18.260
but it begins in 63 [inaudible] 62 but especially 63 where many plantation

392
00:27:18.421 --> 00:27:22.980
owners in Louisiana and Mississippi started refugees.
They're slaves.

393
00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.880
They would flee their plantations in the face of the Yankee armies,

394
00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.520
often going west towards Texas,

395
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:34.830
sometimes just further inland or wherever they could go and they would try to

396
00:27:34.831 --> 00:27:39.040
take their slaves with them.
It was called refugees and often what that means,

397
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:42.060
I'll,
I'll cite some examples of that after the break.

398
00:27:42.061 --> 00:27:45.630
There's a famous diary memoir by a southern woman,

399
00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.400
Kate stone,

400
00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:52.940
who kept a diary of her plantation called broken burn.

401
00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:54.893
At any rate,

402
00:27:56.190 --> 00:28:00.840
she left with some hundred and some slaves to try to get out of Louisiana or

403
00:28:00.841 --> 00:28:03.480
into Texas.
But the time she got there,
half of them were gone.

404
00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:07.740
And she kept wondering why Ge,

405
00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:12.360
why would they leave happened to their loyalty.

406
00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:16.430
Then thirdly,
uh,

407
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:21.620
the third factor that would determine when and how and if a slave became free

408
00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:24.600
was indeed,
um,

409
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:30.170
what policy was actually being enforced at any given time by those union troops

410
00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:31.981
or for that matter,

411
00:28:31.981 --> 00:28:35.910
by the confederate troops in terms of freeing slaves or not freeing.

412
00:28:35.911 --> 00:28:37.290
So I was taking them into their lines,

413
00:28:37.291 --> 00:28:42.180
are not taking them into the lines and establishing some kind of legal status.

414
00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.750
And then the fourth factor,
of course,

415
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:52.580
and this one you can't measure,
you can know it when you read it and you see it,

416
00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:53.810
you hear it.

417
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:59.230
And there's so many wonderful documents that demonstrated the fourth factor in

418
00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:04.130
when and how American slaves became free.
What is it?
Their own ingenuity,

419
00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.890
their own initiatives,
their own cunning,
their own bravery,

420
00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:12.410
their own willingness to risk everything to try to get to something called

421
00:29:12.411 --> 00:29:13.244
freedom

422
00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:18.490
and not knowing what that freedom would be when they got there.

423
00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:22.150
Would they be employed but their shelter,

424
00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:24.160
we're going to be able to feed their children,

425
00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:27.340
but they get their wives and husbands out with them.

426
00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:32.500
What about women with three children?
Where would that go?

427
00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:37.570
What would the status be?
Would they actually have any rights?

428
00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:44.940
We learned much about this
and please in the,
in the,
uh,
reading packet,

429
00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.050
have a close look.

430
00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:50.690
I included some of those,
uh,

431
00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:57.660
documents from the contraband camps where the superintendents of the de of the

432
00:29:57.661 --> 00:30:00.780
contraband camps were all asked a series of questions.

433
00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:04.860
They were asking things about the motives of the slaves that escaped into their

434
00:30:04.861 --> 00:30:08.070
camps.
They were asked to describe why had these people come.

435
00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:10.710
They were asked to describe their physical conditions.

436
00:30:10.711 --> 00:30:15.060
They were asked to describe,
uh,
what they thought,
what they felt,
what they said.

437
00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:20.120
And all these superintendents have all these contraband camps are just stunned

438
00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:26.770
at the re at the way that black folk keep coming in spite of the hardships,

439
00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:30.380
half close,
half fed,
if that,

440
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.520
and they're stunned at the religiosity of escaped slaves.

441
00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:38.180
You superintendents right back and they said he's people singing their worship

442
00:30:38.181 --> 00:30:40.910
all night long.
Strange,

443
00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:46.160
but almost to a man,
these superintendents of contraband camps,

444
00:30:46.161 --> 00:30:47.930
when asked what were the motives,

445
00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:53.930
they simply fall back on the most basic of things.
They say things like,
um,

446
00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:55.820
they wanted their freedom.

447
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:06.170
No maths patient also would depend here and there on a whole lot of other

448
00:31:06.171 --> 00:31:09.350
factors,
but again,
they come under these categories.

449
00:31:09.351 --> 00:31:13.730
I've already given you the close proximity to the war.
Now,

450
00:31:13.731 --> 00:31:14.564
for example,

451
00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:20.820
one of the war moved into Georgia in 63 and 64 when Sherman invaded northern

452
00:31:21.861 --> 00:31:26.450
Georgia and the war really went to the deep hinterland.

453
00:31:26.451 --> 00:31:28.580
The heart of the southeast

454
00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:34.010
confederates were already,
and they're already doing this in Virginia.
They were,

455
00:31:34.011 --> 00:31:35.840
they were beginning to do it out in the west.

456
00:31:35.841 --> 00:31:40.460
They surely did it in the in the city of mobile and other confederate held

457
00:31:40.461 --> 00:31:41.294
cities.

458
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:46.870
Confederates had begun to employ or impress their slaves into service.

459
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.740
Thousands of them,
about 3000 slaves were put to work in mobile,

460
00:31:51.741 --> 00:31:54.170
Alabama building its fortifications,
slaves.

461
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:57.470
Hundreds upon hundreds of slides we'll put to work building afford occasion

462
00:31:57.471 --> 00:32:02.390
fortifications of Richmond and estimated 5,000 slaves were put to work building

463
00:32:02.391 --> 00:32:07.391
the fortifications all around Atlanta by late 63 to try to stop Sherman's

464
00:32:10.341 --> 00:32:14.750
advance.
Very often they were hired out.
That is,

465
00:32:14.751 --> 00:32:18.650
they were supposed to be paid or their owners were supposed to be paid for their

466
00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:19.513
service.

467
00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:25.270
They were used as teamsters in nurses and cooks and boatman and blacksmiths and

468
00:32:25.271 --> 00:32:26.800
laundresses and so on and so forth.

469
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:31.030
If you saw a confederate army and eight from [inaudible] 62 to 64 you've seen

470
00:32:31.031 --> 00:32:32.110
hundreds of black people.

471
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:36.003
<v 1>Okay,</v>

472
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:38.240
<v 2>well,
and as those armies moved,</v>

473
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:44.020
sometimes those slaves had opportunities to fleet in the wake of battles on any

474
00:32:44.781 --> 00:32:48.670
scale.
Some slaves would always flee.

475
00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:51.103
They were often

476
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:58.100
used as the burial crews on both sides.

477
00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:00.680
They were also hired out,

478
00:33:00.681 --> 00:33:04.760
and this was really significant in Virginia to the iron works in Richmond.

479
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000
The tredegar ironworks at one point employed almost 4,000 slaves who tended to

480
00:33:10.461 --> 00:33:13.760
be hired out from the western parts of Massachusetts in the northern parts of

481
00:33:13.761 --> 00:33:14.690
North Carolina.

482
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:16.520
<v 1>Okay.</v>

483
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:21.520
<v 2>That movement of people on this getting movement of slaves on this scale that</v>

484
00:33:21.651 --> 00:33:25.490
never happened in the south.
And in the midst of that movement,

485
00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:30.920
Linda Morgan wrote a fine book on emancipation in Virginia and she showed this

486
00:33:30.921 --> 00:33:33.380
for the first time that all of this movement of,

487
00:33:33.381 --> 00:33:37.400
of hired out slaves to Richmond and other small iron works by the way,

488
00:33:37.401 --> 00:33:42.170
over in the Shenandoah valley meant a certain percentage of them began to flee

489
00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:45.290
and escape further north.

490
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:50.460
They worked on railroad crews.
Uh,

491
00:33:50.461 --> 00:33:53.340
it was estimated that in,
in northern Georgia,

492
00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:56.010
during Sherman's campaign against Atlanta,

493
00:33:56.970 --> 00:34:01.970
that about 40% of all the women working as nurses and confederate hospitals all

494
00:34:02.191 --> 00:34:03.930
over the state were slave women.

495
00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:08.930
That means I had been taken off of their plantations that are farms or out of it

496
00:34:08.931 --> 00:34:11.520
with their domestic situations,
wherever they were,

497
00:34:11.970 --> 00:34:13.590
and put the work in the hospitals.

498
00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:21.580
So the point is movement of the army's met movement of slaves as well and that

499
00:34:24.411 --> 00:34:26.450
moment of freedom,
that moment of escape,

500
00:34:26.451 --> 00:34:31.451
that opportunity might come when you would least expect it and that that

501
00:34:31.491 --> 00:34:34.610
American slave had to make a choice every time.

502
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.730
Do I go and risk everything or do I not?

503
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:42.950
Let me tell you one little story in midst that it's the other half of this book

504
00:34:42.951 --> 00:34:43.784
I just did.

505
00:34:45.490 --> 00:34:48.080
So young slave named Wallace turnage.

506
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:54.250
He was born in a little tube on a little tobacco farm in North Carolina in 1846

507
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:57.260
green county North Carolina,

508
00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:02.890
sold by his indebted owner to a Richmond Virginia slave trader named Hector

509
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:03.771
Davis,

510
00:35:03.771 --> 00:35:07.100
who was one of the largest slave traders in the United States and kept enormous

511
00:35:07.101 --> 00:35:07.934
records.

512
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:12.890
It's been about six months in 1860 working in the slave,

513
00:35:12.891 --> 00:35:15.860
the three stories,
slave jail auction house in Richmond.

514
00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:20.720
His job every day was preparing the slaves and what was called the dressing room

515
00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:26.120
to take them out to the auction floor,
and one day he simply told,
boy,

516
00:35:26.121 --> 00:35:26.960
you're in the auction,

517
00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:31.550
and it was sold to an Alabama cotton platter planter named James Chalmers.

518
00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:36.070
72 hours later by training,
he found himself on a huge cotton operation.

519
00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:39.180
Your pickings Ville,
which is

520
00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.510
all right,
right about there,

521
00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:49.560
right on the Mississippi border plantation with about 85 slaves and the

522
00:35:50.141 --> 00:35:55.120
narrative he left us,
which was discovered in lopped into my lap a few years ago.

523
00:35:55.850 --> 00:36:00.850
The extraordinary narrative he left is the story largely of his five attempts to

524
00:36:01.121 --> 00:36:06.121
escape in the midst of the war from the age of 14 to 17 he was one passionate,

525
00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:12.880
half crazy one might say,
no doubt,

526
00:36:12.881 --> 00:36:17.881
traumatized teenage slave who just couldn't be controlled.

527
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:21.880
He ran away four times in the Mississippi.

528
00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:27.250
The second two of which certainly at least he was always trying to get up to

529
00:36:27.251 --> 00:36:29.800
northern Mississippi to get to the union armies,

530
00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:34.600
which he knew had controlled the whole northern tier of Mississippi by late

531
00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:38.370
spring 1862 in fact,
three of his escapes over there.
We're really,

532
00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:42.790
he would always go up the mobile in Ohio railway line at one time.

533
00:36:42.791 --> 00:36:46.300
He was at large for four and a half months hiding another slave cabins and

534
00:36:46.301 --> 00:36:50.240
hiding in the woods and forests and gullies and wherever he could hide and he

535
00:36:50.241 --> 00:36:51.220
was always captured.

536
00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:55.900
He was trying to actually get to Corinth and the big contraband camp and corn

537
00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:58.540
and he almost made it on his fourth try.

538
00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:01.040
<v 1>Okay.</v>

539
00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:05.300
<v 2>Kept being captured by slave patrols,
confederate patrols and so on.</v>

540
00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.840
His master would always come after him because he was so valuable.

541
00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:15.240
He'd been sold by the way,
for $950 the first time out of North Carolina,

542
00:37:15.241 --> 00:37:16.780
it was sold for $1,000.

543
00:37:16.781 --> 00:37:21.781
The old [inaudible] in Richmond and Chalmers now got fed up in early 63 of

544
00:37:22.961 --> 00:37:27.070
constantly trying to retrieve this kid and he took him down to mobile,

545
00:37:27.071 --> 00:37:31.570
Alabama and soul limit the slave jail and mobile in the spring of 1863 for

546
00:37:31.571 --> 00:37:36.230
$2,000.
That's about the price today.

547
00:37:36.231 --> 00:37:37.670
Have a good Mercedes Benz.

548
00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:40.533
<v 1>Oh whoa.</v>

549
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:44.310
<v 2>As opposed to a bad Mercedes Benz.
I'm not sure what that would be.
Um,</v>

550
00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:51.190
and Wallace is fifth and final escape attempt.

551
00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:54.610
The one that succeeded came after a vicious beating.

552
00:37:54.611 --> 00:37:57.070
He'd been beaten many more times than he could count.

553
00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:02.640
He'd been putting neck braces in leg chains and ankle chains and risks chains

554
00:38:02.771 --> 00:38:05.220
and every kind of need to experience about it.

555
00:38:05.221 --> 00:38:08.590
We kind of brutality slavery could wreck upon a teenage kid.

556
00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:15.580
One day he crashed his master's carriage and a master got so angry he took him

557
00:38:16.201 --> 00:38:17.160
to the slave jail,

558
00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:20.850
hired the jailer to give him 30 lashes with the ugliest whipped they had.

559
00:38:20.851 --> 00:38:22.500
This contraption,

560
00:38:22.501 --> 00:38:25.890
they had the would make you bleed on every lash,

561
00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:30.960
the end of any standing there.
Naked bleeding is master says go home.

562
00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.340
Instead of going home,

563
00:38:32.341 --> 00:38:35.680
he put his clothes back on and he walked right through the army,

564
00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:39.730
a garrison of 10,000 troops where he was no doubt,

565
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.190
simply mistaken for yet another black camp pan.

566
00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:46.780
And it does can you just crossed through the confederate camp and he walked out

567
00:38:46.781 --> 00:38:50.830
of mobile and his final escape is a three week trek,

568
00:38:50.831 --> 00:38:55.420
which she narrates,
uh,
uh,
in a,
in a,
in remarkable ways.

569
00:38:56.230 --> 00:39:00.610
The three week trek down the western shore of Mobile Bay for 25 miles through a

570
00:39:00.611 --> 00:39:05.500
snake,
an alligator infested swamp,
now known as the fall river estuary.

571
00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:12.010
I've been there,
I've seen the alligators in the snakes from a large ferry boat.

572
00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.233
<v 1>Okay.</v>

573
00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:18.990
<v 2>Then he describes one day praying especially hard when he got out to the tip of</v>

574
00:39:18.991 --> 00:39:23.310
mobile bay and the tide brought in an old rickety rowboat.

575
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:25.080
You tipped over the row boat,

576
00:39:25.081 --> 00:39:30.081
took a plank of wood and it just started rowing out into the ocean and quite

577
00:39:30.721 --> 00:39:33.840
dramatic form.
He,
which is no doubt,
a little embellished.

578
00:39:33.841 --> 00:39:38.841
He describes how a wave is about to swamp is a little boat and he hears oars and

579
00:39:40.201 --> 00:39:44.790
the ors were a union gunboat with eight sailors.
They said,

580
00:39:44.791 --> 00:39:45.624
jump in.

581
00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:50.130
He jumped in and he said as he sat down in their boat,

582
00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:55.710
he said the Yankees sailors were struck with silence as they looked at him.

583
00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:59.580
And I don't know if that's true or not,
but I don't doubt it.

584
00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:01.590
They probably were struck with silence,

585
00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:04.380
wondering who he was and how he got there.

586
00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:08.190
They took him to a sand island fort and clothed him and fed him

587
00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.180
the first kind acts by a white person,

588
00:40:12.181 --> 00:40:14.520
the 17 year old turnage had ever experienced.

589
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:18.930
And the next day they took him to fort gains on Dolphin Island,

590
00:40:18.931 --> 00:40:22.950
which is the big beautiful sandbar island on,
at the mouth of mobile bay.

591
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:27.930
And he was brought before the union commander of all forces in,
in the area,
uh,

592
00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.210
Gordon Granger,
oh,
interrogated.

593
00:40:30.211 --> 00:40:34.980
And probably because they wanted intelligence about mobile and Granger gave him

594
00:40:34.981 --> 00:40:35.970
two choices.

595
00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:41.290
He could either join the black regiment that they were forming at that very time

596
00:40:41.291 --> 00:40:45.700
in the Gulf region,
or he could become a servant to a white officer.

597
00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:50.410
And Wallace chose the ladder.
Didn't tell us why,

598
00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.950
but probably because he'd had enough suffering.

599
00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:59.970
He'd seen enough of his own war with the confederates and he served out the war

600
00:41:01.511 --> 00:41:06.511
for another year as the mess cook for a captain from a Maryland regimen whose

601
00:41:07.211 --> 00:41:08.860
name was Junius Turner

602
00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:13.240
and Wallace was would that regimen in Baltimore,

603
00:41:13.241 --> 00:41:16.390
Maryland in August of 1865 when was mustered out?

604
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:18.300
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

605
00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:22.710
<v 2>he lived three years in Baltimore and I moved to New York City where he lived</v>

606
00:41:22.711 --> 00:41:24.930
the rest of his life till 1916

607
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:32.210
but by 1870 I found him in a sense manuscript living on the 300 block of

608
00:41:32.211 --> 00:41:35.060
Thompson Street.
What you and I called Greenwich Village,

609
00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:39.950
he got his mother,
his four siblings,

610
00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.680
somehow out of North Carolina,

611
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:49.540
and they were all living in a tenement house surviving as part of the first

612
00:41:49.671 --> 00:41:52.700
generation of a black working class,

613
00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:55.250
former slaves in a northern city.

614
00:41:56.570 --> 00:42:01.340
He lived till 1916 he's buried in Cypress Hill cemetery in Brooklyn,

615
00:42:01.341 --> 00:42:02.174
New York.

616
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:07.160
The point of all of that is that these slaves escape and we're real people with

617
00:42:07.161 --> 00:42:09.410
real names,
real family,

618
00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:13.010
real hopes and desires and those who survive.

619
00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:16.610
Some of those who survived told us what it meant.

620
00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:20.780
Now,
um,

621
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:24.500
the war of course rage don,

622
00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:28.510
<v 1>and at the end of the day,</v>

623
00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:36.870
<v 2>it's a photograph whether we're taken an 1862,
I believe</v>

624
00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:39.810
<v 1>I'm in Virginia.</v>

625
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:46.690
<v 2>The photographer simply called it
a group of contraband</v>

626
00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:53.810
or rage down.
And of course,
in the spring of 1863,

627
00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.740
the union armies will invade Virginia again.

628
00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:02.060
I'm going to come back the lots of this after the break when we get back to the

629
00:43:02.061 --> 00:43:07.061
military history and try to explain how the union side won this war.

630
00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:12.860
They'll fight are horrible battle at a place called Chancellorsville near

631
00:43:12.861 --> 00:43:17.861
Fredericksburg and may of 1863 which will be another smashing victory by Robert

632
00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:24.740
E.
Lee and stonewall Jackson over a union army commanded by Joseph Hooker.

633
00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:31.720
It will give Lee his occasion for his second invasion of the north,

634
00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:34.370
the riskiest of all,

635
00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:38.660
which will lead him up through northern Virginia crossing the Maryland and

636
00:43:38.661 --> 00:43:41.960
eventually all the way into Pennsylvania will lead to the fateful battle at

637
00:43:41.961 --> 00:43:45.740
Gettysburg first three days of July,

638
00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:49.850
1863 arguably the most important military turning point of the war,

639
00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:57.010
but it is in those same first six and seven months of 1863 that this war has now

640
00:43:57.011 --> 00:44:00.990
been transformed indoor of unconditional surrender,

641
00:44:00.991 --> 00:44:05.991
a war of all out attempt at least all out mobilization at home and conquest in

642
00:44:10.621 --> 00:44:11.454
the south.

643
00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:15.810
It is during this period that black soldiers are being recruited.

644
00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:19.680
The 54th Massachusetts,
the famous regimen from Massachusetts,

645
00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:21.570
but I watch the movie glory was made,

646
00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.450
was recruited that winter and spring of course,

647
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:29.160
and marched off to South Carolina to its fate,
um,

648
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:32.640
in May of 1863

649
00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:36.310
<v 0>they will reach to their fate at Fort Wagner,</v>

650
00:44:36.311 --> 00:44:40.900
the within a week of the battle of Gettysburg back up north.

651
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:47.120
But just as a way to take this out today,
back with me to July 1st,
excuse me,

652
00:44:47.121 --> 00:44:50.360
January 1st 80 63 of the day,

653
00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:53.330
the emancipation proclamation actually went into place.

654
00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:57.620
I said at the outset that for most black folk,

655
00:44:57.621 --> 00:45:00.840
they didn't really care about what actually the details are.

656
00:45:00.841 --> 00:45:05.841
The words of the document where the point was that now somehow the United States

657
00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:10.340
government was sanctioning emancipation

658
00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:16.100
and go back with me at a Thomas Wentworth Higginson.

659
00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:23.010
This is Higginson's description of emancipation day on Hilton head island,

660
00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:28.130
South Carolina,
near Buford,
north,
uh,
Buford,
South Carolina.

661
00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:34.790
He was given orders to read the emancipation proclamation to the people,

662
00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:38.480
to the,
to the Friedman.
And this by the way,

663
00:45:38.481 --> 00:45:40.640
became a policy throughout the union army.

664
00:45:40.641 --> 00:45:44.420
Thousands of copies of the emancipation proclamation were given a union officers

665
00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:49.070
who were ordered to spread it around the south Higginson not only spread it,

666
00:45:49.071 --> 00:45:52.160
he held us a ceremony.
They built a little stage,

667
00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:55.630
and this is his description of what happened

668
00:45:58.430 --> 00:46:03.220
is describing the scene.
All this was according to the program rights.

669
00:46:03.221 --> 00:46:07.930
Higginson then followed an incident.
So simple and so touching,

670
00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:13.390
so utterly unexpected and startling that I can scarcely believe it on recalling

671
00:46:13.391 --> 00:46:17.320
it though,
it gave the keynote to the whole day.

672
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:19.190
<v 1>Okay?</v>

673
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:24.190
<v 0>The very moment the speaker had ceased and Justice I took in waved the flag,</v>

674
00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:28.070
which now for the first time,
men,
anything to these poor people,

675
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.970
there's suddenly a rose close beside the platform,

676
00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.310
a strong male voice,

677
00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:39.940
but a little cracked in elderly and to which to women's voices instantly blended

678
00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:46.210
singing as if by an impulse that could no more be repressed than the morning

679
00:46:46.521 --> 00:46:51.170
note of a song sparrow
my country,

680
00:46:51.171 --> 00:46:55.520
tis of thee sweet land of liberty of thee I sing.

681
00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:02.900
People looked at each other and then at us on the platform to see once came this

682
00:47:02.901 --> 00:47:07.901
interruption not put down in the program firmly and irrepressibly.

683
00:47:08.811 --> 00:47:13.160
The quavering voices sang on verse after verse my country,

684
00:47:13.161 --> 00:47:15.980
tis of thee sweet land of liberty.

685
00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:20.720
Others of the colored people joined in.
Some whites on the platform began,

686
00:47:20.721 --> 00:47:25.550
but I motion to them to be silent.
I never saw anything so electric.

687
00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:28.400
It may all words cheap.

688
00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:32.800
It seemed the choke voice of erase that last on loose.

689
00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:38.640
Nothing could be more wonderfully unconscious art could not have dreamed of a

690
00:47:38.931 --> 00:47:42.610
tribute to the day of Jubilee.
That should be so effective.

691
00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.010
History will not believe it.

692
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:49.150
And when I came to speak of it after it was ended,

693
00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:50.980
tears were everywhere.

694
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:56.650
If you could have heard how quaint and innocent it all was,

695
00:47:57.430 --> 00:48:01.090
just think of it.
The first day they had ever had a country,

696
00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:05.290
the first flag that ever seen,
which promised anything to their people.

697
00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:06.753
And here,

698
00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:11.260
while mere spectators stood in silence waiting for my stupid words,

699
00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:17.130
these simple souls burst out in their lay as if they were by their own hearths

700
00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:21.190
at home.
When they stopped,

701
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:27.010
there was nothing to do but to try to speak and I went on.

702
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:33.030
But the life of that whole day was in those unknown people's simple song.

703
00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:38.080
Have a good spring break.
