1
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.590
In some ways the greatest witnesses.
There are many,

2
00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:09.550
many witnesses of the coming of the civil war.
What causes it?

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.790
What's percolating from beneath the society of the South?

4
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:17.160
We've looked at in the society in the north

5
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.490
and in so many ways,
of course,

6
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.800
the greatest witnesses and their stories have only been with us in a serious,

7
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:32.670
robust way for the past couple of decades or so,
few decades.

8
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.250
How are those of the slaves themselves

9
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.940
if it was somehow all about them

10
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.210
and in varying kind of ironic ways,
folks on both sides,

11
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:49.320
we'll say that if it is somehow all about them.

12
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.620
What did they think this week?

13
00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:56.280
You're reading the greatest of the slave narratives.
Frederick Douglass,

14
00:00:56.281 --> 00:01:01.050
his first autobiography published in 1845 is I though it would maintain the

15
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:03.900
greatest of the slave narratives.
Certainly in the literary sense.

16
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.820
He was an almost mystically brilliant writer for one so young.

17
00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:17.250
He first drafted this when he was 26 he escaped from slavery when he was 20

18
00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:18.150
years old.

19
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.740
You'll find out in the text how he learned his literacy learned first from his

20
00:01:25.081 --> 00:01:26.760
white mistress,
Miss Sophia,

21
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:31.761
who became like an angelic mother figure to her until she took language away

22
00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:36.840
from him.
The book is full of metaphor.

23
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.050
It is full of one kind of tale and story after another that Douglas Shapes into

24
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.720
telling a free story.

25
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.480
Telling a free story is the great literary critic of this genre.

26
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:52.201
Bill Andrews,

27
00:01:52.201 --> 00:01:57.201
this put it for a fugitive slave to emerge in the northern states for that

28
00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:00.300
matter,
a future.

29
00:02:00.301 --> 00:02:05.301
This slave who goes to Britain like a lot of Equiano did African barners.

30
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.110
So we still think

31
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.830
and writes his sorry in in Britain,

32
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.370
but for a fugitive slave to write his or her story and publish it in English in

33
00:02:16.711 --> 00:02:20.880
the Western world was just say,
I'm a person of letters.

34
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.420
I am somebody.
I have a history,

35
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.700
I am free,
but I am not free until you let me.
Right?

36
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.480
And I will make myself free if I must by telling you who I am.

37
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.800
I want a fugitive slave could go to England and hold up his book in front of

38
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.420
huge audiences.

39
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.420
Douglas spoke in London at one point before 10,000 people in 1846 and you've got

40
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.620
to hold his little book up in his hand.

41
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.100
He could probably at that moment feel freer than he'd ever felt because he could

42
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.150
actually say,
this is who I am.

43
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.750
I'm not a manufactured identity.

44
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.140
I'm not what you necessarily want me to be.

45
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.440
I won't talk the way you expect me to talk.

46
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.370
I won't scratch my head when I tell my story,

47
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.130
but what a story.

48
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.920
When I was a fledgling graduate student not knowing what I was doing and writing

49
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:25.930
a dissertation on Frederick Douglass

50
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.530
couple,
few decades ago,

51
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.550
a new book had come out called Young Frederick Douglass.

52
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.610
It was a wonderful study of Douglas as youth.

53
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.800
We had been written by a journalist so he was hard to find.

54
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:45.730
He wasn't an academic.
This is pre email,
pre Google,

55
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.100
pre lots of things.
I wrote to his publisher,
Johns Hopkins University Press.

56
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.130
I said,
can you give me a phone number for Dick Preston Dixon?

57
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.970
Preston was his name.
They said,
yes.

58
00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:59.380
Here's his phone number.

59
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.110
I was in Washington DC doing research called him.

60
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.550
He lived on the eastern shore of Maryland that much I knew,

61
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.440
which is where Douglas grew up.

62
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.870
I didn't know much about Dick except that he had written this extraordinary book

63
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:18.190
on Douglas as youth.
In fact,

64
00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:21.040
it was Preston who actually discovered Douglass's birthday.

65
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.600
Douglas was one year younger than he ever knew.
Wouldn't that be cool?

66
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.260
I'll take a year back anytime at this point.
Um,
called him,

67
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:34.240
he said,
yeah,
come on out to the eastern shore.

68
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:38.140
Meet me in the eastern community college parking lot at 9:00 AM on whatever

69
00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:40.030
Wednesday morning.
It was in July.

70
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.720
I'll give you a tour of the sites of Douglass's youth.

71
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.220
And it was on of the most extraordinary days of my life.
Uh,

72
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.570
I folded myself and to his station way and we drove back roads all over the

73
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:54.670
eastern shore.

74
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.930
He took me for a walk through a muddy cornfield is,

75
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:03.760
I believe it out to the back lot of a field to a bend in Tuckahoe Creek.

76
00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:05.950
And he said,
this is where Douglass was born.

77
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.840
Here's where his grandmother Betsey's Kevin ones and he took me down all kinds

78
00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:15.610
of back roads and we ended up at the Freeland farm.

79
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:17.501
Read the narrative,

80
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:22.501
you know the Freeland farms among Douglas three or four masters he had as a

81
00:05:22.991 --> 00:05:23.850
youth Freeland.

82
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.860
He admired the most or respected the most and then he said,

83
00:05:29.951 --> 00:05:33.340
you want to see Covey's farm?
Edward Covey,

84
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.530
the cell called slave breaker.

85
00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:40.531
Douglass had been hired out to or sent to by his master Thomas old when he was a

86
00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:46.360
17 year old,
quite rebellious and rather uncontrollable teenager.

87
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.660
I said,
sure,
show me cubbies,
Fun Ben,

88
00:05:49.661 --> 00:05:52.660
back roads again that I couldn't find it if my life depended on it.

89
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.840
We get out of a car and in my memory we stepped over a fence post and we walked

90
00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:02.900
out this Ridge and Dick said something like,
turn around

91
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.810
and there they were.
He hadn't made it up

92
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.450
in the narrative.
If you've read far enough,

93
00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:16.640
if you read the page 83 in my edition,

94
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.910
you've encountered the most beautiful metaphor and antislavery literature is

95
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:26.660
Douglas as metaphor of the white sailing ships on the Chesapeake that he would

96
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:28.880
see from Covey's farm for eight months,

97
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.120
and he would try to dream and imagine his way onto their decks that are gallon

98
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.370
decks as he called them.

99
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.960
And I realized that day sometimes metaphor is not just a metaphor.

100
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.610
Our house stood within a few rods of the Chesapeake Bay.

101
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:48.980
This is Douglas is Douglas's description,

102
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.260
who's broad bosom was ever white with sales from every quarter of the habitable

103
00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:58.190
globe.
Those beautiful vessels robed in purest white,

104
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.900
so delightful to the eye of Freeman to wish you could write like this when

105
00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:03.740
you're 26

106
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.360
were to me so many shrouded ghost to terrify and torment me with thoughts of my

107
00:07:10.761 --> 00:07:11.990
wretched condition.

108
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:17.450
I have often in the deep stillness of a summer Sabbath stood all along upon the

109
00:07:17.481 --> 00:07:22.390
lofty banks of that Noble Bay and traced was saddened,
heart and tearful.

110
00:07:22.391 --> 00:07:26.750
I the countless number of sales moving off to the mighty ocean.

111
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.600
Douglas was fond of adjectives.

112
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.230
The site of these always affected me powerfully.

113
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:38.000
My thoughts would compel utterance and there with no audience,

114
00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:41.870
but the Almighty.
I would pour out my soul's complaint,

115
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.040
a phrase right from the book of job in my rude way,

116
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:50.720
with an apostrophe to the moving multitudes of ships.

117
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.580
And when you read this,
note what he does.

118
00:07:52.581 --> 00:07:57.581
Then he puts his own teenage voice or his memory in quotation marks

119
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.940
and he speaks to the ships.

120
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.690
You are loosed from your moorings and her free.

121
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.330
I am fast in my chains and I'm a slave.

122
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:15.430
You move merely before the gentle Gail and I sadly before the bloody whip you

123
00:08:15.431 --> 00:08:19.630
our freedoms,
swift winged angels that fly around the world.

124
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:24.100
I am confined in bands of iron.
Oh,
that I were free.
Oh,

125
00:08:24.101 --> 00:08:28.360
that I were on one of your gallon decks and under your protecting wing,

126
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:33.820
but alas betwixt me and you,
the turbo water's role.
Go on,

127
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.130
go on.
Oh,

128
00:08:36.131 --> 00:08:41.131
that I could also go and he still goes on or another paragraph

129
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:47.570
milking if you like the sailing ship metaphor for all it's worth.

130
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.750
How many of us,
perhaps all of us,

131
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.890
I think everybody has their Chesapeake.

132
00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:00.580
It may be every morning when you have to go to class.

133
00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.090
We all have our own Chesapeake Bay is we've looked out on and wondered,

134
00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:10.600
I wouldn't,
I'd rather be there or how can I get out of here?

135
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:15.490
Or is there a sailing ship that will liberate me?

136
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.593
<v 1>Okay.</v>

137
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.290
<v 0>Telling a free story is what the slave narratives were bound.</v>

138
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.800
They were acts of telling it in some ways made the former slave almost literally

139
00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:31.500
free by an act of language.

140
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:37.010
Language itself to a former slave who could write was a form of liberation.

141
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:43.530
We tend to take it for granted today.
These books,
language,

142
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.970
okay.
Abolitionism.
It's roots reformers,

143
00:09:50.971 --> 00:09:52.380
the barriers that they faced.

144
00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:56.340
I'm going to run through this with some speed and then the stages in the

145
00:09:56.341 --> 00:10:00.840
development of an anti slavery in pulse,
let's call it that.
To begin with,

146
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.320
that begins with this idea of colonization.

147
00:10:04.321 --> 00:10:09.321
Colonizing African American freed people or former slaves outside the United

148
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.900
States.
An idea that never lost.

149
00:10:12.901 --> 00:10:17.310
It's kind of beguiling hole and the American imagination even well after the

150
00:10:17.311 --> 00:10:18.630
civil war,
ironically,

151
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.920
and then on to a more radicalized form of antislavery thinking and action

152
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:29.330
exemplified especially by William Lloyd garrison by,

153
00:10:29.331 --> 00:10:33.150
by a host of other black and white abolitionist,

154
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:39.290
and I want to work you at least to the story in myth and reality of the

155
00:10:39.901 --> 00:10:44.880
underground railroad since it is so much a part of our imagination of this story

156
00:10:44.881 --> 00:10:46.470
and it would at least I hope,

157
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:51.480
take us to the point of understanding why that fugitive slave act that we'll

158
00:10:51.481 --> 00:10:55.320
hear about on Thursday and into next week,
that fugitive,

159
00:10:55.321 --> 00:11:00.321
that federal fugitive slave act passed in 1850 and the compromise of 1850 that

160
00:11:01.291 --> 00:11:02.940
flowed out of the Mexican war.

161
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.350
Why that fugitive slave back was so pertinent,

162
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.180
so divisive,

163
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:15.050
so significant in the kinds of ways Americans were beginning to divide over the

164
00:11:16.951 --> 00:11:19.590
future of free labor and slave labor,

165
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.920
whatever they may have thought about African Americans as their neighbors,

166
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:30.990
but permit me to use Emerson again at least briefly.
This idea of reform.

167
00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:35.991
I mentioned last time that we sort of hinted there that in American history

168
00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:41.541
we've had at least four major reform eras or waves of reform.

169
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:47.900
And certainly this is the first in antebellum America from the 1820s through the

170
00:11:47.911 --> 00:11:48.840
1850s.

171
00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:53.290
All kinds of reform ferment came to the surface.

172
00:11:53.291 --> 00:11:55.870
Sometimes that was against flogging in the navy.

173
00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:01.350
Sometimes it was in utopian experiments in communities as sometimes that was in

174
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.210
women's rights.
Uh,
sometimes that was in temperance,

175
00:12:07.211 --> 00:12:10.520
which was by far that is the anti,
um,

176
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:14.050
alcohol and taboos,
Anti Demon rum movement.

177
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:19.350
Temperance was by far the most widespread American reform movement and pre civil

178
00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:20.614
war time.

179
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.300
It was probably the only major reform movement that got ahold in the south.

180
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:31.180
Personal reform of some sort was something that,
uh,
that,

181
00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:35.590
that southern society,
we looked at a slave society,

182
00:12:35.591 --> 00:12:37.420
a very hierarchical society,

183
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:43.110
certain kinds of personal reform that the dealt with personal piety and behavior

184
00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:49.050
could take hold in this broader social reform that would challenge the social

185
00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:52.780
order.
Not so much,

186
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.820
but listen to Emerson and his essay called man the reformer.

187
00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:04.120
I think about our own times.
What does man born for us at Emerson?

188
00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:08.920
What is a man born for?
But to be a reformer,

189
00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.350
and he may be right or wrong about this.

190
00:13:11.351 --> 00:13:16.351
You can decide a remake or of what man has made a renowned Sir of lies,

191
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:22.990
a restore of truth and good imitating that great nature,

192
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.060
not the metaphor here,

193
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:30.020
which in Bosoms is all and which sleeps no moment on an old pass,

194
00:13:30.021 --> 00:13:33.730
but every hour repairs herself yielding us,

195
00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:37.840
excuse me,
yielding us every morning,
a new day,

196
00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.870
and with every pulsation,
a new life.

197
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.920
Let him renounce everything which is not true to him,

198
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:50.250
and put all his practices back on their first thoughts and do nothing for which

199
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.100
he has not the whole world for his reason.

200
00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:58.330
Emerson is arguing right or wrong,

201
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:03.130
that you are a reformer by nature.

202
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:09.240
Nature recreates itself daily and Soda Humans,

203
00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:12.133
is he right?

204
00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:22.080
Call home tonight to your parents and say,
uh,
you're a senior.

205
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:26.280
I've decided what I'm going to do.
Dad,
I'm going to be a reformer.

206
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:31.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

207
00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.250
<v 0>If I were your parent,
I'd say of what?</v>

208
00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.940
For why everyone's leaving?
Do they pay you for that?
You know,

209
00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:43.670
will it be safe?

210
00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:52.170
Who even talking to
or what?

211
00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:55.770
I'm going to be a reformer.

212
00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:02.170
This was an age though by the 18th 30th

213
00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:08.700
for a small group and the rest assured abolitionist in particular were never a

214
00:15:09.131 --> 00:15:13.240
large group.
They probably were never,
excuse me,

215
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:17.710
I was in Montana and the weekend giving lectures and the mountains are gorgeous,

216
00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.560
but it was cold anyway.

217
00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:27.180
Abolitionists were never even at their peak of organizational action or never

218
00:15:28.451 --> 00:15:33.451
more than probably probably at most 15% of the population of the northern

219
00:15:34.481 --> 00:15:35.080
states.

220
00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:40.080
Now in some communities they might be larger upstate New York,

221
00:15:40.451 --> 00:15:43.300
parts of Massachusetts and Connecticut or New Hampshire,

222
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:45.610
always a small group,

223
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:51.580
but like most vociferous and eventually highly organized operating by the

224
00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:55.640
printing press reform groups.

225
00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:59.370
There's significance is much greater than their numbers.

226
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.220
Now what were they up against?
Real quickly,
let me run through these.

227
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.050
I may have begun here last time and it's had to stop

228
00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:15.940
the American abolition.
Is there anybody concerned about slavery?

229
00:16:15.941 --> 00:16:20.941
Let's just take the slavery question has to deal by the 1820s now with the new

230
00:16:22.511 --> 00:16:27.511
generations being born who did not experience the revolution and they are

231
00:16:28.511 --> 00:16:32.650
inheriting now this great experience of there parents,

232
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:34.750
the American revolution,

233
00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.130
but that revolution had at least a two fold legacy.

234
00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.120
On the one hand,

235
00:16:42.121 --> 00:16:46.860
it was an event that really ushered those great enlightenment ideas into the

236
00:16:46.861 --> 00:16:47.231
world,

237
00:16:47.231 --> 00:16:51.810
but an antislavery impulse in America is going to draw upon constantly black and

238
00:16:51.811 --> 00:16:55.650
white abolitionists.
They're all going to do it.
Those great enlightenment ideas,

239
00:16:55.651 --> 00:16:59.820
hostility,
the monarchy,
the growth of republicanism,
representative government,

240
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.680
the faith in human reason,

241
00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:06.920
the notion of individual liberty that you're born with certain natural rights.

242
00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:10.890
He's a revolutionary ideas and work them out.
Yeah,
I do there.

243
00:17:10.891 --> 00:17:15.030
How about the right of revolution on a Jefferson's for first principles,

244
00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.900
the doctrine of consent,
popular sovereignty,

245
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.630
not a brand new idea.

246
00:17:21.631 --> 00:17:24.640
It's all the way back there in the epistles of Paul and even before that in

247
00:17:24.641 --> 00:17:25.720
certain kinds of writings,

248
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:29.740
but how many times did the world actually invented governments truly based on

249
00:17:29.741 --> 00:17:31.870
the doctrine of consent

250
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.250
and it's fledgling idea of equality.
Human equality had been put in play,

251
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:44.030
but the other side of the American revolution is that it had all had also

252
00:17:44.031 --> 00:17:49.031
fostered in the south the necessity of an intensification of slavery's defense.

253
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:52.220
In many ways,

254
00:17:52.221 --> 00:17:56.480
the success of the American revolution and putting slavery on the run in the

255
00:17:56.481 --> 00:18:00.470
northern states where it was gradually abolished in every northerns immediately

256
00:18:00.471 --> 00:18:04.460
abolish and a few but gradually abolished in most of the northern states by the

257
00:18:04.461 --> 00:18:09.461
1820s the south now had to have answers that had to have justifications at him.

258
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:14.570
And we went through a lot of those defenses and justifications.
The other day.

259
00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:17.030
This was what Edmund Morgan,

260
00:18:17.031 --> 00:18:20.500
the great colonial revolution historian here at Yale for years,

261
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:25.340
argued so brilliantly over and over.
It was the American paradox,

262
00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.410
this great American contradiction,

263
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:31.790
largest slave system in the world.

264
00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:32.770
<v 1>Okay.</v>

265
00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:37.750
<v 0>Being built by one of its first functioning,
thriving republics.</v>

266
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.770
Three or I'm sorry to

267
00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.710
anybody trying to work against slavery.

268
00:18:48.711 --> 00:18:53.711
Even the most gradual modest ways by the 1820s thirties it's got a got a bump

269
00:18:53.961 --> 00:18:57.620
his head right into what we might simply call the sanctity of the u s

270
00:18:57.621 --> 00:18:58.490
constitution.

271
00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:04.040
Constitution was revered in American society.
It was a sacred thing

272
00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.330
and look what it was rooted in.

273
00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:12.620
Now garrison is going to call it a covenant with death,
you know,

274
00:19:12.621 --> 00:19:13.670
deal with the devil.

275
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:15.180
<v 1>Okay.</v>

276
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.220
<v 0>Because of its complicities and slavery,</v>

277
00:19:17.221 --> 00:19:20.970
but it's also rooted deeply in federalism and in what northerners and

278
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.230
southerners and northerners would practices,
states rights doctrine,

279
00:19:25.231 --> 00:19:30.231
all that localism that the constitution was designed in Madison's genius to try

280
00:19:31.321 --> 00:19:36.321
to control whole together and you take the three fifths clause and the fugitive

281
00:19:39.481 --> 00:19:44.280
slave clause and the postponing for 20 years of any consideration of the banning

282
00:19:44.281 --> 00:19:49.281
of the foreign slave trade and you realize that the US Constitution is morally

283
00:19:50.581 --> 00:19:53.760
complicit in slavery even though I'd never used the word

284
00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:00.880
why did abolitionism and America or any kind of concern,

285
00:20:00.881 --> 00:20:05.260
let's just put it that way,
about slavery become more radical with time.

286
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:11.870
It is because ultimately an anti slavery movement in the United States to

287
00:20:12.091 --> 00:20:17.091
succeed had to become extra legal or put another way it had the break the law.

288
00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:26.540
That's why law breaking is such a central theme and Harriet Beecher Stowe is

289
00:20:26.541 --> 00:20:28.250
great novel uncle Tom's cabin.

290
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

291
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:35.160
<v 0>And then of course antislavery activists were up against the increasingly deep</v>

292
00:20:35.161 --> 00:20:37.680
defense of slavery,
which we've already dealt with.

293
00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:43.340
They were up against an increasingly highly organized and widely written racial

294
00:20:43.591 --> 00:20:45.840
theory about black inferiority.

295
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:47.910
<v 1>Okay.</v>

296
00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:52.910
<v 0>And antislavery impulse in the United States was an impulse,</v>

297
00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:58.530
a set of ideas that eventually would have to call cause some form of social

298
00:21:00.351 --> 00:21:01.101
revolution,

299
00:21:01.101 --> 00:21:05.840
legal revolution and political revolution in a society that did not want it.

300
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.020
And in this society,

301
00:21:09.021 --> 00:21:14.021
we're increasingly a tremendous amount of wealth was of course staked in

302
00:21:14.421 --> 00:21:16.130
slavery.
A point we've also made.

303
00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:24.520
Just a last thought on that.
Think today,
just think around you.

304
00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:29.330
Think God of your box for a moment of an issue in the world,
a great concern.

305
00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:34.640
It really affects you or most of us for that matter,
the whole bloody world.

306
00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:41.270
How confident are you in succeeding in solving it

307
00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:47.450
in your lifetime?
World poverty,

308
00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.600
global warming,
take your pick.

309
00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:53.990
Uh,
racism

310
00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.513
<v 1>go into</v>

311
00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:02.150
<v 0>to be an abolitionist and the 1830s was to take on an issue like this and say,</v>

312
00:22:02.151 --> 00:22:06.800
well,
you know,
maybe not in our lifetime,
but
maybe sometime

313
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.660
it doesn't mean they were altruistic.

314
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:15.480
I'm not sure that we're any altruistic abolitionist.

315
00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:21.770
As you'll see when you read about them in Bruce Levine's book or any other way

316
00:22:22.621 --> 00:22:23.454
we look at them,

317
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:29.280
they could be as egotistical and his vein and is conflicted in their tactics and

318
00:22:29.281 --> 00:22:31.650
their methods and their personalities as anybody.

319
00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:37.620
Certainly William Lloyd garrison was not an easy guy to get along with.
Now,

320
00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:42.080
the I met,
as I mentioned earlier,
anti slavery in America.
They'll take stages.

321
00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.380
It goes through periods,
stages.

322
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:49.390
The first of these is this idea of colonizing black people elsewhere.

323
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.980
Now,

324
00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:56.810
colonization as an idea is not brand new.

325
00:22:56.811 --> 00:23:01.250
By 1816 on the American colonization society was formed,

326
00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:07.150
but it finally took hold in the political soil of the United States.

327
00:23:07.671 --> 00:23:11.450
In the wake of the war of 1812 was at the American colonization society was

328
00:23:11.451 --> 00:23:16.370
actually founded in the US Capitol.
This thing had congressional funding.

329
00:23:16.371 --> 00:23:17.204
At first,

330
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:23.140
it was actually founded by some of the greatest statesmen in America at the
time.

331
00:23:23.141 --> 00:23:28.000
Henry Clay was there.
The original meeting,
James Monroe,
John Marshall,

332
00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:32.110
chief justice of the Supreme Court and many others,

333
00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:34.060
especially border state,

334
00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:37.930
upper south leaders like clay from Kentucky,

335
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.980
the great wig who will come,
the kind of father figure of the Whig party,

336
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.220
many of them slave holders like clay.

337
00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.770
I owned about 60 slaves and his hemp farms in Kentucky.

338
00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:54.080
The idea here is that somehow over time and that America of the future,

339
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:57.920
that vast,
infinite,
boundless America of the West,

340
00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:02.810
and eventually this problem of slavery might have to be faced.

341
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:08.480
But the way it could be faced eventually is if you start gradually removing

342
00:24:08.481 --> 00:24:13.481
black people from the United States and you do it first with volunteer freed

343
00:24:14.271 --> 00:24:17.870
people,
free blacks,
they would be asked,

344
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:21.800
never coerced was the theory of the original colonization society.

345
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:26.150
That colonization society of course is the organization had a lot of money in

346
00:24:26.151 --> 00:24:30.830
its first decade or so.
It was such a book geiling idea.

347
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:31.820
It fits.

348
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:36.850
It fit in so many ways this generation and was actually the revolution Jen and

349
00:24:38.231 --> 00:24:42.080
revolutionary generation in the immediate post revolutionary generation who

350
00:24:42.081 --> 00:24:47.081
really were infused with what you might call a kind of Jeffersonian idealism or

351
00:24:47.721 --> 00:24:51.740
even a Madisonian ideal.
Is that somehow this America,
yeah,

352
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:55.600
it had problems or as Jefferson said,
we got to,
you know,

353
00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:58.730
we have got the wolf by the years with slavery,

354
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:04.650
you can't get off cause the wolf will devour you if you stay on.

355
00:25:04.651 --> 00:25:06.300
You're you to write that down.
We'll forever.

356
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:12.980
But he said that in private,
but this kind of Jefferson I,
Josue an idealism,

357
00:25:12.981 --> 00:25:17.981
this somehow this grand American continent with its resources physically and

358
00:25:18.191 --> 00:25:20.260
this grand American constitution,

359
00:25:20.261 --> 00:25:23.650
this great experiment would dissolve this problem,

360
00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:26.050
especially if you're helped it.

361
00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:31.860
American colonization society founded the colony of Liberia on the west coast of

362
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:36.980
the nation of Liberia was founded in 18 2022 by the acs,

363
00:25:40.201 --> 00:25:41.790
the American colonization society.

364
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:48.440
It would ship approximately 1500 free African Americans to Liberia.

365
00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:53.970
1500 that's it.

366
00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:57.450
Between 1821 and 1831 yep,

367
00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:02.790
and they would found its capital at Monrovia named Virginia is from neuro,

368
00:26:02.791 --> 00:26:07.110
the United States.
President.
Liberia today,
as you may know,

369
00:26:07.111 --> 00:26:10.740
has been through a vicious,
horrifying civil war.
It's a disaster.

370
00:26:10.741 --> 00:26:15.200
It does have the only African woman president.
Now it's,

371
00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:18.570
it's a fascinating story of what's happening to Liberia,

372
00:26:18.571 --> 00:26:23.571
but its roots are back here in the impulse of white Americans to remove black

373
00:26:24.991 --> 00:26:29.970
Americans from their native soil.
Now,
some African Americans bought onto this.

374
00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:34.170
It's the immigration impulse.
Go elsewhere,

375
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:35.730
make a new start.

376
00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.990
Some of them were even inspired by this idea of a return to an ancestral

377
00:26:39.991 --> 00:26:42.090
homeland that they knew so little about.

378
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:48.350
The colonization had all kinds of flaws at its root.

379
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.680
Well,
you know,
can we can call these flaws when you call these realities,

380
00:26:55.681 --> 00:26:56.970
when you call them whenever we want.

381
00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:00.480
Commonization was essentially rooted in these ideas.

382
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.920
It was the first day or assumptions we might call it.

383
00:27:03.921 --> 00:27:07.620
This is the first assumption was that equality and racial equality in America

384
00:27:07.621 --> 00:27:08.700
was never going to happen.

385
00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:14.270
Just that to start there is what the colonizations would argue be real ain't

386
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:15.893
going to happen.

387
00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:17.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

388
00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:22.380
<v 0>There was a fear of the rising free black population that that really boomed in</v>

389
00:27:22.571 --> 00:27:25.480
numbers in the wake of the American revolution with all the men you missions

390
00:27:25.481 --> 00:27:29.650
that went on in the upper south and then the emancipation said it occurred in

391
00:27:29.651 --> 00:27:34.570
the north where the slave population of a state like New York had been six or
7%.

392
00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:39.610
It was the fear now of the specter of slave insurrection.

393
00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:43.930
There've been the Gabriel Prosser plot and 1800 in Richmond had been the Denmark

394
00:27:43.931 --> 00:27:48.931
Vesey insurrectionary plot and Charleston and 1822 which brought a lot of

395
00:27:49.781 --> 00:27:53.260
converts to colonization.
Of course,

396
00:27:53.261 --> 00:27:58.261
Nat Turner's bloody and Stovall insurrections in 1831 may colonization and

397
00:27:59.041 --> 00:28:01.450
looked pretty nice too.
A lot of Americans.

398
00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:08.540
There was this idea too that somehow colonization would be a safety valve.

399
00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:13.660
It might only remove five or 10% of American free blacks and slaves over say a

400
00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:20.300
few decades,
but even that five or 10%,
the theory was,
um,

401
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:23.240
would ameliorate conditions in the south.

402
00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:28.300
It would begin to d fuse this powder keg of our rising slave population being

403
00:28:30.921 --> 00:28:32.600
fueled by the great cotton boom.

404
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.840
And it had a kind of a strange attractiveness,

405
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.570
but mostly to white folks.

406
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:48.590
It was roundly loathed by make no mistake by a majority of free African

407
00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.720
Americans in the north or upper south

408
00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:56.510
and feared to the extent they even grasp

409
00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:01.030
the idea,
my slaves in the deep side,

410
00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.350
but it wasn't gradualism that fueled the idea of colonization.

411
00:29:07.351 --> 00:29:12.351
And it was gradualism that a lot of American America's first early youthful

412
00:29:13.621 --> 00:29:18.621
generation of abolitionists thought might still be the best way to go in the

413
00:29:19.171 --> 00:29:24.150
1820s gradual plans had been used.
For example,
in states like Connecticut,

414
00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:29.430
Connecticut passed the law in the late 1790s the said that every slave born in

415
00:29:29.431 --> 00:29:33.670
that state after that date on his or her 21st birthday would be freed.

416
00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.540
That's a very gradual plan.

417
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:41.750
Abraham Lincoln is still voicing this very kind of gradual plan of emancipation

418
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.280
at the outbreak of the civil war.
He's still going,

419
00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:50.980
he's still going to suggest it to the states of Kentucky and Delaware when he

420
00:29:50.981 --> 00:29:55.981
calls them in and ask those states in 1862 to consider emancipation on a gradual

421
00:29:57.971 --> 00:30:02.110
plan and he would even compensate the slaveholders 600 bucks a slaver.

422
00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.850
I forget exactly what the figure was.

423
00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:06.813
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

424
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:10.820
<v 0>Gradualism one,
you know,
many people have argued is a kind of the American way,</v>

425
00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:14.900
a longterm plan cushion the chain,

426
00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:18.883
<v 1>but</v>

427
00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.010
<v 0>several things began to happen,</v>

428
00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:27.070
especially in the 1820 [inaudible] and into the 1830s that radicalized

429
00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:30.850
antislavery thinkers in the United States.

430
00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.880
And this is indeed the roots,
if you like,

431
00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:38.940
of a more radical abolitionism the roots of what came to be known among the

432
00:30:39.581 --> 00:30:44.230
Garrisonians as immediate TISM and those roots are these,

433
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:46.150
let me give you four.

434
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:50.490
I wrote an essay on the first essay I ever published in graduate schools on this

435
00:30:50.491 --> 00:30:55.491
subject and you never quite forget your argument of your first essay even even

436
00:30:56.831 --> 00:30:57.790
if it wasn't very good,

437
00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:04.050
but what began to radicalize American antislavery activist.

438
00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:08.800
First it was evangelical Christianity.

439
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:11.740
Some of the radicalism they took from their faith,

440
00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.530
they took from the so called second great awakening.

441
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:18.760
They took from this idea that somehow it was their duty,

442
00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:20.890
it was their place in the world.

443
00:31:20.891 --> 00:31:25.891
Many of them were the sons and daughters of ministers to save souls.

444
00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:30.100
And if you'd been inspired by Charles Gratis and Finny out in Oberlin,

445
00:31:30.101 --> 00:31:32.320
Ohio or as theater,

446
00:31:32.321 --> 00:31:36.070
our weld hat or a number of other ministers across the north,

447
00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:40.600
that it was your duty to go save souls.
It was only one step further.

448
00:31:40.601 --> 00:31:45.601
And Finny told him that to save society as well and if conversion to Christ or

449
00:31:46.901 --> 00:31:51.901
conversion to faith conversion to salvation can happen immediately in a person.

450
00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:58.570
Why not a whole society?
If you can revolutionize a single soul,

451
00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:02.020
why can't you revolutionize a hundred a hundred thousand a million,

452
00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:10.690
a second source

453
00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:17.530
and I can say so much more about the significance of evangelicalism,

454
00:32:17.531 --> 00:32:20.980
this idea of the rebirth of faith,
the rebirth of the soul,

455
00:32:20.981 --> 00:32:23.380
the born again notion.

456
00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:25.500
<v 1>Okay.</v>

457
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:30.500
<v 0>In this year at least we were living in a different kind of era of evangelical</v>

458
00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:35.250
ism in the United States,
although some evangelicals are indeed reformers,

459
00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:39.150
they tend to be seen today largely as political,

460
00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:43.660
social conservatives.
Some of the Evangelical isn't love.

461
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:48.670
The 1820s in in America and the 1830s became a much more radical kind of

462
00:32:50.001 --> 00:32:54.890
evangelicalism in terms of the social changes that they were advocating.

463
00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.230
Having said all of that,

464
00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.890
that same evangelical Christian who becomes an abolition is may indeed have been

465
00:33:00.891 --> 00:33:04.700
a very violent temperance advocate and saw a demon.

466
00:33:04.701 --> 00:33:07.220
Rum is as big a demon.
The demon slave holder.

467
00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:16.270
Second cause of this roots of radicalism is what we might call perceptions of

468
00:33:17.991 --> 00:33:22.790
southern intransigence or perceptions of southern truculence.

469
00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:26.780
Any 1820s a lot of these really young,
they're youthful.

470
00:33:26.781 --> 00:33:31.350
They're only in their 20s antislavery advocates are,
some of them are.

471
00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:35.060
Even William Lloyd garrison flirted with colonization at first when he was about

472
00:33:35.061 --> 00:33:36.650
2124 years old.

473
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:40.970
They were gradual listed first until they began to realize how deeply committed

474
00:33:40.971 --> 00:33:43.250
the south actually was to slavery.

475
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:44.563
<v 1>Okay.</v>

476
00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:49.650
<v 0>And that leaving it to them,
leaving in it,
leaving it to their own resources,</v>

477
00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:52.170
was never going to solve anything.

478
00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.320
An early,
early abolitionist sick,

479
00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:00.290
an 1818 George born said quote,

480
00:34:00.291 --> 00:34:03.020
when southerners are challenged on the slavery question,

481
00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:08.080
they quote are choked for they have a negro stuck fast in their throats.

482
00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:16.100
The more and more that early abolition is began to realize just how deeply

483
00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:20.780
committed the south was morally,
biblically,

484
00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:22.220
socially,

485
00:34:22.221 --> 00:34:26.390
philosophically to sustaining the slave society.

486
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:28.230
<v 1>Okay.</v>

487
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:31.020
<v 0>More,
they began to realize that if they were serious about this,</v>

488
00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:34.380
they had to have much more radical strategies.

489
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.140
The young William Lloyd garrison started by,

490
00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:43.170
by 1829 do you use metaphors in his writings of cement and ice bergs that went

491
00:34:45.981 --> 00:34:50.981
only melt with decades and decades to characterize what he perceived now as this

492
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.090
deep kind of southern intransigent,

493
00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.970
a third root of American radical antislavery.

494
00:34:58.971 --> 00:35:02.540
Though it wasn't the British influence.
Make no mistake,

495
00:35:02.541 --> 00:35:06.050
I won't go into any detail here because time doesn't permit,
but these Americans,

496
00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:10.790
these early American abolitionists were deeply influenced by the now decades
old,

497
00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:15.740
two,
three decades old antislavery crusade in England,

498
00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:20.960
which at first then of course the crusade against the slave trades succeeding in

499
00:35:20.961 --> 00:35:23.930
that great act of parliament in 1807,

500
00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.240
which was just celebrated last year.

501
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:29.960
It's still being celebrated in Britain as we speak everywhere.

502
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:36.650
And then ultimately the movement in England against slavery itself and the

503
00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:36.921
British Empire of course,

504
00:35:36.921 --> 00:35:41.730
will it slaves by active parlor in 1833.

505
00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:46.560
And thirdly,
I would argue that uh,

506
00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:51.610
immediate TISM or a radicalization of antislavery also stems from events.

507
00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:57.690
I think,
you know,
very often historians are asked,

508
00:35:57.691 --> 00:36:01.980
so what was the most pivotal thing or what's the principle cause of,

509
00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.680
or what do you expect that you're always asked to predict?

510
00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.170
Which is the worst thing you can ask any historian.

511
00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:09.880
Cause the historian will then say,
oh,
historians never predict.

512
00:36:09.881 --> 00:36:11.370
And then they'll go on and do it.

513
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:16.230
<v 1>Do you know,
I don't,</v>

514
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:20.360
<v 0>no,
if I'm old enough to have any wisdom or conclusions about any of this yet,</v>

515
00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:22.551
but frankly,

516
00:36:22.551 --> 00:36:27.551
sometimes people simply react to events that you cannot predict.

517
00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:35.730
And there weren't events in the teens in 1920s and by the 1830s that did indeed

518
00:36:37.791 --> 00:36:42.791
have a direct impact on this growth of a more radical antislavery Denmark vases

519
00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:49.810
insurrection of boarded insurrection in Charleston 1922 and the 28 or 30 people

520
00:36:50.211 --> 00:36:54.080
who were executed in its wake made huge national news.

521
00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:59.620
The Negro Siemens Act passed in South Carolina in 1822 that said that any ship

522
00:36:59.961 --> 00:37:04.550
that came into Charleston Harbor and South Carolina,
if it had black sailors,

523
00:37:04.551 --> 00:37:05.384
those jails,

524
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:09.140
those black sailors would be jailed in Charleston while the ship was in harbor.

525
00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:11.510
No white sailors would be jailed.

526
00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:14.323
<v 1>MMM.</v>

527
00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:19.650
<v 0>There was a thing called the Ohio resolutions passed an 1824 imagine this,</v>

528
00:37:19.961 --> 00:37:22.540
the legislature of the state of Ohio

529
00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:30.020
pass the resolution suggesting that a gradual plan of emancipation be put in

530
00:37:30.571 --> 00:37:33.840
place over 25 years,
over two generations,

531
00:37:33.841 --> 00:37:38.380
whatever plan they might want to enact.
And they sent this suggestion,

532
00:37:38.381 --> 00:37:42.210
the so called Ohio resolution to all the southern state legislatures

533
00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.660
thinking they were going to open a dialogue.

534
00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:51.960
<v 1>There was no dialogue</v>

535
00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:58.050
<v 0>and in effect,
Ohio was told where they could put their resolution.</v>

536
00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:03.390
They got letters from a few southern governors that said,
in no uncertain terms,

537
00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:07.540
mind your own bloody business.
This is our society.

538
00:38:07.541 --> 00:38:09.720
This is our system will do with it as we please

539
00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:13.780
that massive growth of the domestic slave trade.

540
00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:19.960
And I already talked about a hundred nearly 150,000 slaves and moving from east

541
00:38:19.961 --> 00:38:24.520
to west and the decade of the 1820s alone and then it's going to double and

542
00:38:24.521 --> 00:38:28.510
triple in the next decades.
No one has to become aware of this

543
00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:36.160
and nat Turner insurrection in the fall of 1831 without a had a radicalizing

544
00:38:37.451 --> 00:38:40.000
effect on people like garrison.

545
00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:44.670
Now who was William Lloyd Garrison?

546
00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.630
I want to touch on him and just at least briefly,

547
00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:55.920
well,
I want to get us to this story of the underground railroad.

548
00:38:55.921 --> 00:38:59.470
Although if I save the underground railroad for Thursday,

549
00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:03.150
it still fits because it's right there with the fugitive slave act,

550
00:39:03.151 --> 00:39:05.280
so don't worry if I don't quite get there.

551
00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:09.810
Garrison was by no means the whole abolition movement

552
00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:12.780
by any means.

553
00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:18.210
He did phone and edited and published the longest lasting antislavery newspaper.

554
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:22.410
I'm all first published in January 1st,

555
00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:27.410
1831 in Boston called the liberator and he would publish it for the next 35

556
00:39:27.691 --> 00:39:28.524
years.

557
00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:34.070
He was cs publishing it in December,

558
00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:37.290
1865 about nine months after the end of the civil war,

559
00:39:37.291 --> 00:39:42.291
he sees publication of deliberate writer on the in the week after.

560
00:39:43.471 --> 00:39:45.330
The ratification of the 13th amendment

561
00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:51.750
is life is complicated,
complex.
He was one complex character,

562
00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:54.930
but he is the real thing.

563
00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:59.310
A professional radical reformer.

564
00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:05.400
He was born in utter poverty in Newburyport,
Massachusetts.

565
00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.550
It's father went to see an abandoned him as a child.

566
00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:12.030
His mother tried to raise hand is equally narrative,

567
00:40:12.031 --> 00:40:14.730
well older brother on next to nothing.

568
00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:20.190
At one point she apprenticed him out cause she couldn't feed him and he was

569
00:40:20.191 --> 00:40:25.191
apprenticed out at the age of 12 to a printer and he learned how to make a

570
00:40:26.341 --> 00:40:29.820
printing press work and for the rest of his life.

571
00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:34.850
He said his own print every week he could if he was in town in Boston on the

572
00:40:36.001 --> 00:40:39.060
liberated and he prided himself in being faster.

573
00:40:39.061 --> 00:40:41.820
It's setting print and anybody ever hired.

574
00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:48.860
He did start as a kind of a gradual list.
He went down to Baltimore,
Maryland.

575
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:52.820
Here I go.
I'm going to talk too much about garrison,
but that's the way it goes.

576
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:56.870
You went down to Baltimore and he worked with the UN antislavery paper.

577
00:40:56.871 --> 00:40:59.030
They're called the genius of Universal Liberty,

578
00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:03.440
published by a guy named Benjamin,
the Lundy in Baltimore,
a slave state.

579
00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:10.060
There was a young slave growing up there named Frederick Bailey,

580
00:41:10.061 --> 00:41:11.260
but they didn't meet.

581
00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:13.403
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

582
00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:19.030
<v 0>Harrison got thrown in jail,
which for him was his a Birmingham jail.</v>

583
00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:22.840
You remember Martin Luther King's letter from a Birmingham jail.

584
00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:26.050
He got thrown in jail for slandering a slave ship captain,

585
00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:31.450
whom he accused of murder
guy sued him.

586
00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:36.080
He was convicted and he about nine months in jail,
which for garrison was pride.

587
00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:42.110
It was also the first time he met and talked at great length with other blacks

588
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:43.670
who were in jail with him.

589
00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:48.260
The time he got out and came back north and finally got the chance after two

590
00:41:48.261 --> 00:41:52.130
other,
uh,
boarded or failed attempts to credit newspaper,

591
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:57.020
he finally got his chance and a little bit of money.
You found it,

592
00:41:57.021 --> 00:42:01.790
this paper called the liberator.
A paper.
He would,
uh,

593
00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:06.820
publish without missing an issue and write something for every issue for 35

594
00:42:07.611 --> 00:42:11.620
years.
No.

595
00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:14.110
If you want to understand what I'm Lloyd garrison,

596
00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:19.300
you have to understand them through his ideas and I'll just list them for you

597
00:42:19.301 --> 00:42:21.130
with the briefest explanations.

598
00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:26.820
But it is here where you see now the fruition by the 1830s oven.

599
00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:32.230
The media test abolitionism a radicalizing form of anti slavery,

600
00:42:32.231 --> 00:42:33.220
which by the way,

601
00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:38.490
we'll develop a following in various forms among free blacks in particular in

602
00:42:39.161 --> 00:42:39.994
the north,

603
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:44.230
but it will also of course began to garner widespread enemies,

604
00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:47.020
widespread enemies.

605
00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:52.810
Garrison and his ilk will come to be seen as very dangerous people,

606
00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:55.150
these reformers,

607
00:42:57.250 --> 00:43:02.070
but if you can remember these six ideas of William Lloyd Garrison owns or do I

608
00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.360
have seven,
it's seven.
Sorry.

609
00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:10.740
You can have a handle on what immediate TISM and radical antislavery became in

610
00:43:11.711 --> 00:43:14.170
garrisons hands.
Now,
as soon as,

611
00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:18.370
as soon as you get a leader who goes out and pushes an idea,
right,

612
00:43:18.371 --> 00:43:19.390
it pushes and agenda,

613
00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:23.320
pushes a set of moral principles by which this movement should be run.
Of course,

614
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:24.490
he's immediately,

615
00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:28.570
we're going to develop an opposition within his own movement and people will

616
00:43:28.571 --> 00:43:33.010
disagree with them,
but number one is first idea was moral perfectionism.

617
00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:39.850
A stern demanding call for abolition is to remove themselves personally from any

618
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:45.530
corrupting complicity with the American slave system.

619
00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:52.210
Be Perfect even as your heavenly father is perfect.

620
00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:55.370
Said,
garrison,
he was not a trained minister,

621
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:59.030
but he was a deeply old testament biblical Christian.

622
00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:02.420
His second principle with passivism,

623
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:08.470
what the 19th century called nonresistance garrison rejected all acts of

624
00:44:08.841 --> 00:44:10.910
violence in any form

625
00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:13.213
<v 1>well</v>

626
00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.680
<v 0>until the civil war broke out.</v>

627
00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:21.820
More on that later is third principle was anti clericalism or opposition to what

628
00:44:23.541 --> 00:44:28.190
he saw as the hypocrisy and corruption of the American churches.

629
00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:33.600
The Protestant clergy was one of his greatest and make no mistake folks.

630
00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:37.410
Frederick Douglass began his career as an intellectual,

631
00:44:37.411 --> 00:44:40.560
as an auditor and as a writer,
as a Garrisonians.

632
00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:45.870
It was William Lloyd garrison who impart discovered Frederick Douglass by going

633
00:44:45.871 --> 00:44:50.670
down to new Bedford,
Massachusetts and watching this brilliant young 21 year old,

634
00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:55.700
22 year old black guy get up and speak at the African Methodist Episcopal Zion

635
00:44:55.771 --> 00:44:59.760
church in new Bedford and said,
my God,
this kid can speak,

636
00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:04.530
and for the first five,
six years of Douglass,
his public life,

637
00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:06.720
garrison was like his mentor,

638
00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:09.990
a father figure and an intellectual teacher.

639
00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:15.180
Look for these Garrisonians tenants.
When you read the narrative,

640
00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.600
it's fourth principle was what he called dis unionism.

641
00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:23.040
No Union with the slave holders was his motto or on his air.

642
00:45:23.041 --> 00:45:26.820
His statement on the masthead of the liberator.

643
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:31.650
He actually advocated a kind of personal secession from the union.

644
00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.560
This was one of those ideas.

645
00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:37.950
He advocated that northern states not participate in the same constitution.

646
00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:39.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

647
00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:44.700
<v 0>More on that later when we get to 1854 and five he took it one step further.</v>

648
00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:50.170
He advocated not voting to vote in an American election.

649
00:45:50.171 --> 00:45:55.171
He believed was to be morally complicit with slavery until the U s constitution

650
00:45:55.271 --> 00:45:58.420
was ripped up and rewritten.

651
00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:03.960
He advocated political non participation with it and how that was supposed to

652
00:46:05.051 --> 00:46:06.190
change the world and save.

653
00:46:06.191 --> 00:46:11.191
It was always a bit of a problem if some of the garrison zone admirers sixth he

654
00:46:13.571 --> 00:46:18.310
was an early and often supporter of women's rights and women's equality which

655
00:46:18.311 --> 00:46:22.660
was another form of radicalism that would make you lots of enemies and the 1830s

656
00:46:22.661 --> 00:46:23.740
forties and 50s

657
00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:26.213
<v 1>and seventh</v>

658
00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:32.010
<v 0>he was a tremendous advocate of African American civil rights early</v>

659
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:33.703
<v 1>in a time</v>

660
00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:37.180
<v 0>where they are in effect weren't any.</v>

661
00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:39.993
<v 1>Now</v>

662
00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:45.950
<v 0>I'm going to leave you here thinking with me just for a moment.</v>

663
00:46:45.951 --> 00:46:49.660
I think I have two minutes about what's going to happen now.

664
00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:53.570
This antislavery impulse because in part what happened is the two kinds of

665
00:46:53.571 --> 00:46:58.280
abolitionism emerged,
one white and one black

666
00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:02.780
and there were hundreds and hundreds of white abolitionists,

667
00:47:02.781 --> 00:47:06.830
thousands eventually across the north who became deeply involved in organizing

668
00:47:06.831 --> 00:47:11.720
antislavery society is and creating newspapers and running petition campaigns by

669
00:47:11.721 --> 00:47:16.340
the 1830s and eventually even beginning to be involved in the first fledging

670
00:47:16.341 --> 00:47:19.610
antislavery political parties.
Although Gareth and wouldn't go there

671
00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:25.020
if there are also lots of black abolitionists and abolitionist in the north free

672
00:47:25.021 --> 00:47:25.590
blacks.

673
00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:30.590
Many of them though former fugitive slaves who the experience of slavery on

674
00:47:31.001 --> 00:47:36.001
their backs and in their souls and their psyches and often could not risk the

675
00:47:38.081 --> 00:47:39.550
kind of abstractions,

676
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:43.630
the kind of theoretical debates and arguments over tactics and strategy.

677
00:47:43.631 --> 00:47:48.340
The white abolitionists would spend hours on.
A lot of black abolitionists said,

678
00:47:48.341 --> 00:47:49.270
all right already,

679
00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:53.500
what are we doing for the slaves or what are we doing for my children that don't

680
00:47:53.501 --> 00:47:56.110
have a school?
What are we doing for that child who doesn't have parents?

681
00:47:56.111 --> 00:47:57.100
We need an orphanage.

682
00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:00.183
<v 1>Okay.</v>

683
00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:05.210
<v 0>A real division will evolve by the 1840 [inaudible] and into the 1850s between</v>

684
00:48:05.731 --> 00:48:10.731
the very real practical needs of northern free blacks and black abolitionists

685
00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:16.450
and white abolitionists,
but beneath all of this,
the fugitives kept coming.

686
00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:21.040
The fugitive slaves kept coming out of the south.
They never came in.

687
00:48:21.041 --> 00:48:25.600
The numbers that the myth and the legend of the underground railroad teaches us

688
00:48:25.601 --> 00:48:25.961
today,

689
00:48:25.961 --> 00:48:29.800
and I'm going to return to that and myth and legend problem when we begin on

690
00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:32.890
Thursday.
I don't want to leave you with,

691
00:48:32.891 --> 00:48:37.891
this is just a way of thinking your way to Thursday and as you read Douglas,

692
00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:40.120
as you already know,

693
00:48:40.121 --> 00:48:44.470
sometimes I think the poets tell us more than the historians.

694
00:48:44.471 --> 00:48:48.160
I hate to admit it.
Robert Hayden,

695
00:48:48.161 --> 00:48:52.000
the Great African American poet,
wrote mostly in the 1960s

696
00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:59.140
wrote a magnificent poem by runaway slaves who they were,

697
00:48:59.331 --> 00:49:03.770
what they represent,
the story they help us tell.
He called it renegade renegade,

698
00:49:04.310 --> 00:49:07.970
and he rooted it in the refrain of the Great Negro spiritual,

699
00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:12.410
many thousands gone.
Just a couple verses.

700
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:17.600
We'll return to it on Thursday.
It might be something TA's want to pick up,

701
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:21.910
runs,
falls,
rises,
stumbles.

702
00:49:21.911 --> 00:49:26.410
I'm on from darkness into darkness and the darkness thicker did with shapes of

703
00:49:26.411 --> 00:49:31.411
terror and the hunters pursuing in the hounds pursuing in the night cold and the

704
00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:34.960
night long and the river to cross in the Jack [inaudible] lanterns,
beckoning,

705
00:49:34.961 --> 00:49:37.270
beckoning,
beckoning,
and blackness ahead.

706
00:49:37.271 --> 00:49:42.070
And when shall I reached that somewhere morning and keep on going and never

707
00:49:42.071 --> 00:49:46.590
turned back and keep on going.
Renegade,
renegade,
run a gate.

708
00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:51.780
Many thousands,
rise and go.
Many thousands crossing over.

709
00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:56.550
Oh,
mythic North,
oh,
star shaped yonder.

710
00:49:56.551 --> 00:50:00.340
Bible city.
Some go weeping in some rejoicing.

711
00:50:00.341 --> 00:50:04.750
Summon coffins in some and carriage is some and silks and some in shackles.

712
00:50:04.751 --> 00:50:08.190
Goals rise and go very well.

713
00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:10.740
See you Thursday.
