1
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.560
And is a little novel.
The Hamlet,

2
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.850
William Faulkner has a line he puts in the mouth of one of his characters.

3
00:00:22.761 --> 00:00:27.530
It's one of the Snopes is there.
Lots of Snopes is and Faulkner's novels,

4
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.760
especially that novel.

5
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.260
It comes from the deep dark heart as only Faulkner really wrote it of the burden

6
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.190
of the past of memory,
of slavery,

7
00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:45.800
the civil war and reconstruction on the south,

8
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.450
but he's really referring to all of us.

9
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.520
He's referring to humanity.
It's one of the best single sentence,

10
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.720
descriptive explanations of what happened to the legacy and memory of all these

11
00:01:02.241 --> 00:01:05.810
events I've ever read.
He has his character say

12
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.230
only thank God,

13
00:01:09.231 --> 00:01:13.580
men have done learned how to forget quick what?

14
00:01:13.581 --> 00:01:16.760
They ain't brave enough to try to cure.

15
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.760
I'll do it once more.
Only thank God men have done.

16
00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:28.761
Learn how to forget quick what they ain't brave enough to cure.

17
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.760
Can't solve that problem

18
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.470
way down to heavily by that problem.

19
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.210
Don't have the solutions for the all the world's hills.

20
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.910
It's an ancient problem.
It's a natural problem.

21
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.433
<v 1>Forget it.</v>

22
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.690
<v 0>Try to forget it.
Structure ways</v>

23
00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.143
to forget it.

24
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.290
Americans weren't forgetting by 1876 at least in a host of ways.

25
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.410
They were about to have the magnificent centennial over their independent.

26
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.130
Now that year will bring as we'll see you in a moment,

27
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.010
a pivotal election to say the least.
It will end in a dispute it the first,

28
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.070
not the first really the second great disputed election in American history and

29
00:02:28.061 --> 00:02:33.061
a sorted political compromise that most of us in textbooks and in teaching still

30
00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:36.040
call the end of reconstruction.

31
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.730
But I'm gonna leave that question of when reconstruction ended tall,

32
00:02:39.731 --> 00:02:43.360
the great forthcoming books of my various graduate students who are going to

33
00:02:43.361 --> 00:02:44.290
solve that issue.

34
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.810
And I'm going to probably suggest before we finished that it's never quite
ended.

35
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.930
But listen to us just a couple of the public commentaries that year of America's

36
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.530
live independence and what they were thinking about.

37
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:07.531
The New York Evening Post announced the great work of the of the century it said

38
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:10.840
is finished and the year,

39
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:15.841
which is about to dawn will be the very first one holy free from the duty of

40
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:19.330
dealing with the old and dangerous subject.

41
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.980
Slavery died in this country 10 years ago,

42
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.430
but not until now have we finished the work of readjusting our national life to

43
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:31.180
the new order of things.

44
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.290
Not until now have the questions which grew out of slavery.

45
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.620
Ben Fully and finally settled not until now have the echos of the war died out

46
00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:45.890
of our politics and our lives.

47
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.780
Not just listen to how conclusive that is.

48
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.480
It's over folks
or the Springfield Republican,

49
00:03:55.481 --> 00:04:00.481
a Republican Party paper and old abolition is paper 1876 we must get rid of the

50
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:05.860
southern question.

51
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.160
There is no chance or hope of healthy politics until we do get rid of it.

52
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.360
So long as the war issues are capable of being warmed over from year to year,

53
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.020
an election to election,

54
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.170
so long as the large section of the country is disturbed by violence and

55
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:30.580
paralyzed by miss government.
So long as white is a raid against black.

56
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.710
So long will our politics be feverish with this disease?

57
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.660
Multiple choice question,
what's the disease?

58
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.770
You can make up the answers and you can pick

59
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.280
or the New York Times,
not a liberal paper.
In these years,

60
00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.890
10 years ago,

61
00:04:58.891 --> 00:05:03.891
the north was nearly United in a feeling of sympathy for the Friedman and in the

62
00:05:04.231 --> 00:05:07.770
determination to defend their rights.
Now,

63
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.220
not a few believe that the rights of the whites are those which have been

64
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.193
infringed upon.

65
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.320
Historical memory is always a contest.
It's always a struggle.

66
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.060
It's always a battle.
A debate over who gets to own it,

67
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.010
control it,
narrate it,
organize it,
declare it,

68
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.890
and everybody was trying.
But in Philadelphia,

69
00:05:41.891 --> 00:05:43.740
they put on the biggest show of the United States.

70
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.160
Ever put on the biggest show the United States had ever attempted.

71
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.080
The United States Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876 throughout that

72
00:05:55.151 --> 00:05:58.760
from spring all the way through the fall was attended by.

73
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:00.200
It's really almost hard to believe,

74
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.980
but it was attended by 10 million people.

75
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.800
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

76
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.800
<v 0>that was close to one fourth of the entire US population.</v>

77
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:17.710
Imagine today an exposition and event attended physically.

78
00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:18.910
Now not on,
you know,

79
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.050
the Internet and television attended by one quarter of us.

80
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.700
They had a wax replica of Cleopatra,
their huge thing.

81
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.260
What the hell that had to do with the U s centennial?
God only knows,
but,

82
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.140
but you know,
we're don't.
To be a great country,

83
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:40.220
you've got to reach over history and back to classical times.

84
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.840
The great theme of the exposition of course though,
was machines.

85
00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:49.220
It was the machine age.
It was the excitement of technology.

86
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.490
They had a telephone there,
a type writer

87
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.580
and electric light,

88
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.890
a new floor cloth called linoleum.

89
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.430
They celebrated packaged yeast and something called,

90
00:07:10.431 --> 00:07:13.760
are you ready?
The internal combustion engine,

91
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.930
the Corliss steam engine,
gigantic thing.
It's,

92
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.460
it's now today in the Smithsonian in Washington.
You can see this.

93
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.100
It's an amazing thing.
Uh,

94
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:30.490
was 700 tons and 40 feet high and people looked at it and all this thing was

95
00:07:31.431 --> 00:07:34.190
going to make energy for the future.

96
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.960
Machines and technology were,
it was said over and over and over and over.

97
00:07:38.961 --> 00:07:43.370
We're remaking American society and would remake its future and would make the

98
00:07:43.371 --> 00:07:48.140
United States the greatest manufacturing,
industrial producing nation on earth.

99
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.303
True.

100
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.980
All of this national self-congratulation ignored or masked some of the less

101
00:07:54.981 --> 00:07:57.770
admirable features of American life.
And of course it would.

102
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.510
You don't have a national centennial celebration and then say,
oh,

103
00:08:02.511 --> 00:08:03.290
by the way,

104
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:06.530
you can buy your ticket here to celebrate and you can buy your ticket here to

105
00:08:06.531 --> 00:08:09.890
look at all of our tragedies.
I mean,
we don't do that,
do we?

106
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:13.460
But that doesn't mean that history is not happening.

107
00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.830
The Pennsylvania and Massachusetts exhibitions,
every state had one,

108
00:08:19.831 --> 00:08:24.831
made no mention of the great labor strikes that adjust hit their states.

109
00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:30.600
Even though 27 of the very textile mills that had just been struck and fall

110
00:08:30.601 --> 00:08:34.170
river Massachusetts exhibited there,
wares at the exposition.

111
00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.210
There's no mention whatsoever of the enduring economic depression,

112
00:08:39.211 --> 00:08:41.670
which is still going on.
In 1876,

113
00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:47.610
there was a woman's pavilion added as an afterthought at the last minute.

114
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.060
It honored at,
at,
uh,

115
00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:55.080
housed collections of needlework and weaving and demonstrations of power

116
00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:01.580
or no mention whatsoever of women's political subordination or activism,

117
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.400
the crusade for women's suffrage,
which was going on everywhere.
Women's suffered,

118
00:09:06.401 --> 00:09:08.790
just tried to,
to,
um,

119
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.060
be recognized and to protest.
In fact,

120
00:09:12.061 --> 00:09:17.061
the exhibition weren't allowed to women's place in this was essentially a

121
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:21.750
political
for African Americans.

122
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:24.180
There were no exhibits at all about them.

123
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:29.610
They were even excluded from the construction crews that built all the halls.

124
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.030
There was something called a southern restaurant,

125
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.110
which according to the guidebook,
featured quote,

126
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.740
a band of old time plantation darkies performing songs.

127
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:46.130
There was a bail of Benjamin Montgomery's cotton from Davis,
Ben Mississippi,

128
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.760
which won an agricultural metal at the exposition,

129
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:54.170
beating out cotton from all over the south and from Brazil and from Egypt and

130
00:09:54.171 --> 00:09:55.760
the Fiji islands and other places,

131
00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:01.540
but no mention whatsoever made of the recent violent overthrow of

132
00:10:02.181 --> 00:10:04.430
reconstruction.
And Mississippi.

133
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.940
American Indians were represented at the exposition,

134
00:10:10.941 --> 00:10:15.941
but almost exclusively depicted as a people of the past or as harmless and

135
00:10:18.501 --> 00:10:22.880
primitive noble savages.
They were either a vanishing Indian

136
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.710
or a Indian of a kind of cultural mystique,

137
00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:30.650
a deeply American mystique.

138
00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:35.030
And then came the news right after the 4th of July

139
00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:41.240
or some real Indians rudely interrupted all the celebrations.

140
00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:46.310
The news arrived,
the General George Armstrong Custer had been defeated,

141
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.270
indeed wiped out all his men killed.
Well,

142
00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:55.390
almost all by the Sioux led by sitting bull and crazy horse at a place called

143
00:10:56.181 --> 00:11:01.181
little big horn Custer's last stand images of which would end up behind the bar

144
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:07.700
in every saloon west of the Mississippi and I a hell of a lot of them east of

145
00:11:07.701 --> 00:11:10.220
the Mississippi for the rest of that century.

146
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:13.760
That victory for the Indians.
Of course,

147
00:11:13.761 --> 00:11:18.761
it'd be a pyrrhic victory in their struggle to hold onto land culture place.

148
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:25.370
What was also occurring here by 1876 of course,

149
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.610
the subtext of this great national celebration,

150
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:31.310
if not its central theme,

151
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:37.990
was the sectional North South Reunion,

152
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:42.950
the great reconciliation from the civil war.

153
00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:49.090
Now one might say that's inevitable.
It had to happen.

154
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.830
I said,
this is beginning of our whole unit on reconstruction.

155
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.720
North south had to come back together.
Southwest,

156
00:11:55.721 --> 00:11:59.410
I'm gonna go somewhere good and exile them all that Brazil.

157
00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.103
<v 1>Okay.</v>

158
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.650
<v 0>But in that reconciliation,</v>

159
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.550
as Faulkner said in that passage,

160
00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:13.420
there is a tremendous amount of forgetting going on about what that which people

161
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:18.700
cannot or will not cure and what is going on in great part is that piece among

162
00:12:19.851 --> 00:12:24.851
the whites at Frederick Douglass had worried about the year before in 1875 back

163
00:12:26.481 --> 00:12:30.170
up with me now load 1874 at least quickly.

164
00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.320
We're going to look at two elections today,

165
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.400
which kind of move us toward what we can at least call some vestige of an n

166
00:12:39.501 --> 00:12:40.430
double reconstruction.

167
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:46.210
The 1874 congressional elections took on a significance that off your

168
00:12:47.391 --> 00:12:50.060
congressional elections don't always have,

169
00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.240
although we've had some of these kinds of off your congressional elections in

170
00:12:53.241 --> 00:12:55.060
our own lifetime.
In recent years,

171
00:12:56.090 --> 00:13:01.090
like 1994 which you may or may not remember when the Gingrich Republican

172
00:13:01.161 --> 00:13:05.810
movement too over the Congress and after 40 years of democratic rule,

173
00:13:05.811 --> 00:13:10.670
they were gone and then in those six the Democrats take back both houses of

174
00:13:10.671 --> 00:13:13.910
Congress,
et Cetera.

175
00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:17.053
In essence,

176
00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:21.950
the 74 congressional elections were a referendum on reconstruction.

177
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:24.381
You don't remember.

178
00:13:24.381 --> 00:13:28.490
The sauder house case had come out in [inaudible] 73 the depression had set in

179
00:13:28.491 --> 00:13:33.491
surely by 1874 deeply and certainly by the fall elections of 1874

180
00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:43.190
this became the great takeover of Congress by the Democratic Party,

181
00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.750
so under duress since the civil war,

182
00:13:48.751 --> 00:13:53.250
since they had been the party in many ways that had not favored the war for the

183
00:13:53.251 --> 00:13:55.650
union or the war to free the slaves

184
00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:02.270
and its coverage in the press after this tells it all the buffalo advertiser

185
00:14:03.541 --> 00:14:06.840
says in the wake of it,
the Republican,
it's headline,

186
00:14:06.841 --> 00:14:09.630
Republican parties struck by lightening,
it said,

187
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.030
or another newspaper,
the Louisville Courier Journal,

188
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.880
Democratic paper said headline,

189
00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:22.620
busted the radical machine gone to smash.

190
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:25.470
Well,
what happened was this

191
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:31.780
Democrats captured the House of Representatives.

192
00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:38.010
It went from a Republican majority of 110 that's how many more Republicans

193
00:14:40.391 --> 00:14:43.120
they're worth and Democrats on the eve of this election.

194
00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:48.290
This is the Republican Party now that has run Congress since Abraham Lincoln's

195
00:14:48.611 --> 00:14:53.060
election
for sixth the whole civil war and reconstruction.

196
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:54.440
It's been a Republican Congress.

197
00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:01.750
Anyone from a Republican majority of 110 overnight to a Democratic Party.

198
00:15:01.751 --> 00:15:03.040
Majority of 60

199
00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.490
in the wake of the election,

200
00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:12.330
there were 109 Republicans left and there were 169 democrats

201
00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.760
ended up set patterns.
The election did in state after state after state,

202
00:15:17.761 --> 00:15:21.360
there were two,
at least two decades old in American political culture,

203
00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:28.470
Republicans,
Democrats took back at a small majority of the Senate,

204
00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.640
but if the state and local level,
it was just as important,

205
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:37.350
Democrats won the governor's office in New York and Massachusetts.
In fact,

206
00:15:37.351 --> 00:15:41.190
they weren't in the governor's office in something like 23 states.

207
00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:43.430
<v 1>Okay?</v>

208
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.890
<v 0>Of 35 states holding elections,</v>

209
00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:50.000
23 state legislatures went to Democrats,

210
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.870
southerners.
Now with their party,
the Democratic Party,

211
00:15:56.871 --> 00:15:58.370
which was now National Party

212
00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:03.450
no longer have to feel like aliens in their native land,

213
00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:10.140
and this is what newspapers all over the place kept writing over and over in

214
00:16:10.361 --> 00:16:11.980
celebration.
Listen to this one.

215
00:16:11.981 --> 00:16:15.520
This was a Tennessee paper and Nashville paper,

216
00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.620
which said,
all right,
cool.

217
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.660
The recent election was not an election,
said the Tennessee paper.

218
00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:35.160
It was the country coming to a halt and changing front.

219
00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:39.270
The whole scheme of reconstruction stands before the country today.

220
00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:43.620
A naked confessed,
stupendous failure at once.

221
00:16:43.621 --> 00:16:48.390
The most remarkable and the most inexcusable failure in all of history.

222
00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:54.600
Little hyperbole,
but making their case the causes,
of course,

223
00:16:54.601 --> 00:16:58.980
relatively obvious,
but it was still a shock.
Certainly the republicans,

224
00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:03.210
there was tremendous fatigue with a reformist in the political culture,

225
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.880
including the north or especially the north.

226
00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:11.690
There's tremendous political fatigue with the reformist spirit of the Republican

227
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:12.833
Party.

228
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:18.270
The economic depression was absolutely central to this election.

229
00:17:18.721 --> 00:17:20.190
Why the dams came back.

230
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.553
<v 1>Okay.</v>

231
00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:26.300
<v 0>The scandals and Ms Management of the grant years already setting in was a big</v>

232
00:17:26.301 --> 00:17:28.520
deal.
By 74 it's going to be an even bigger deal.

233
00:17:28.521 --> 00:17:32.960
By 1876 democrats are going to portray themselves now as the reform party,

234
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:37.160
the party of civil service reform,
the party of clean government.

235
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:41.953
<v 1>Okay.</v>

236
00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:43.070
<v 0>Most of all,</v>

237
00:17:43.071 --> 00:17:47.030
I'd say the Republican Party by 1874 and how many times have you seen this in

238
00:17:47.031 --> 00:17:51.270
American political history,
the Republican Party of 1874 payday,

239
00:17:51.271 --> 00:17:55.230
high price for its recent history of support,

240
00:17:55.231 --> 00:18:00.231
a black rights and the idea of racial equality just exactly as the Democratic

241
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.720
Party would do in the wake of Lbj,
his great society,

242
00:18:06.721 --> 00:18:11.721
the 64 and 65 civil rights acts of the famous moment when Bill Moyers tells us,

243
00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:17.070
or was it bill Moyers who said to Lbj,

244
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:21.510
was it Lbj to send the bill Moyers after they passed the 65 civil rights act?

245
00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.480
Which one?
It was.
It good.

246
00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:29.670
It's Lbj to bill Moyers as only LBJ could probably said something.

247
00:18:29.881 --> 00:18:34.350
Well,
I'll clean it up.
Well,
Bill,

248
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:40.730
we're done lost the south for a generation because of what we just passed and

249
00:18:41.821 --> 00:18:42.211
I'll be doing.

250
00:18:42.211 --> 00:18:46.110
Only one only lived in 1971 of course you won't live to quite see it,

251
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:47.850
but he was absolutely right.

252
00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:50.723
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

253
00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.030
<v 0>Southern redemption kept happening.</v>

254
00:18:53.031 --> 00:18:58.031
Although seven of the 11 southern x confederate states were already back under

255
00:18:58.161 --> 00:19:00.590
the control of the southern Democratic Party.

256
00:19:00.591 --> 00:19:04.040
Even before this now in the wake of this election,

257
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:09.160
one more will come the next year and only three will be left by the 76

258
00:19:10.041 --> 00:19:14.060
presidential contest,
South Carolina,
Mississippi,

259
00:19:14.061 --> 00:19:18.380
and Louisiana unredeemed as the south put put it.

260
00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:28.810
This was an election also all about this emerging reunion or reconciliation of

261
00:19:31.431 --> 00:19:32.264
some kind.

262
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:39.570
Let me give you a couple illustrations.

263
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.880
I what happened in the wake of this election

264
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.201
in Vicksburg,

265
00:19:46.201 --> 00:19:51.010
Mississippi the following summer and it was actually a,
uh,

266
00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:55.290
there's a bit about this and Nick Lemons book,
which you're reading and I'm,
I'm,

267
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:59.580
I'm sparing you any lecturing about what happened in Mississippi in 1875 because

268
00:19:59.581 --> 00:20:03.770
that's what lemons book is all about.
The so called shotgun policy,
the,

269
00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:08.550
the violent overthrow of reconstruction by the White Democratic Party and

270
00:20:08.551 --> 00:20:11.340
Mississippi,
been in Vicksburg,
Vicksburg of all places.

271
00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:16.910
Blacks held a very public 4th of July celebration in 1875.

272
00:20:17.161 --> 00:20:20.340
And that was,
that took courage.
It was bold.

273
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.790
Their own politicians spoke,

274
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.630
a black Republican circuit judge gave a speech.

275
00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:29.490
<v 1>Okay.</v>

276
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.970
<v 0>The Black Secretary of state and Mississippi gave a remarkable speech is</v>

277
00:20:33.971 --> 00:20:36.480
somewhat challenging speech to the Democrats.

278
00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:40.650
And justice.
He was ending his speech,

279
00:20:40.651 --> 00:20:44.760
a mob of about 50 white people invaded the,
the,

280
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:49.840
the big hall.
They were having it in
a shot,

281
00:20:49.841 --> 00:20:54.841
was fired as a signal and they opened up and they just started firing.

282
00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:00.940
They killed two on the spot,
wounded about 10 died later.

283
00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:07.060
It was the 4th of July celebration stopped by cold blooded murder.

284
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:13.380
There was an observer at this event and African American who wrote an account of

285
00:21:14.861 --> 00:21:19.690
it under the pseudonym they need Iti,
which means I came,

286
00:21:19.691 --> 00:21:20.590
I saw,

287
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:26.380
and it was published in the New York Herald Tribune as well as the Christian

288
00:21:26.381 --> 00:21:31.000
recorder and some other places.
He laid the blame for this,

289
00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:35.500
not on that white mob.
I mean they're,
they're,

290
00:21:35.501 --> 00:21:39.130
they were tired of blaming the white rednecks in the south for,
for killing him.

291
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:43.810
They NAVD blamed it on national reconciliation.

292
00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.070
He said the killings on the 4th of July in Vicksburg where,

293
00:21:48.071 --> 00:21:51.610
because quote Boston and Ohio,

294
00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:57.150
we're holding the coats for Georgia and Mississippi while they slay the common

295
00:21:58.721 --> 00:22:03.160
victim of northern prejudice and southern hate.

296
00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:08.410
That's a very clear on the ground.

297
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:13.440
I witness description of where responsibility now for this may lie not just with

298
00:22:17.091 --> 00:22:22.091
the mob but with the folk who are allowing mob to do its business.

299
00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.433
<v 1>Alright,</v>

300
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:33.870
<v 0>between 80 and 74 and 1876 arguably what the country is assessing and you can</v>

301
00:22:35.951 --> 00:22:36.820
see who's winning,

302
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:42.510
what the country is assessing is the question which revolution is actually going

303
00:22:42.681 --> 00:22:47.290
to win
if this is a second American revolution,

304
00:22:47.291 --> 00:22:51.010
which is a construction historians have put onto this overtime with with

305
00:22:51.011 --> 00:22:51.844
different meanings.

306
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.560
Charles Beard had a different meaning than Eric Foner and others of us have used

307
00:22:56.561 --> 00:22:59.680
it,
but which revolution would prevail?

308
00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:05.610
Is that the revolution of 1863 to 65 is that the revolution that Abraham Lincoln

309
00:23:06.101 --> 00:23:11.101
finally named and then said would be enforced very bluntly and his second

310
00:23:13.271 --> 00:23:18.271
inaugural with every drop of blood shed by the and shall be paid in bloodshed by

311
00:23:19.991 --> 00:23:20.824
the sword

312
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.233
<v 1>or</v>

313
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:26.940
<v 0>is it the other revolution?
The counterrevolution,</v>

314
00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:31.230
the white southern democratic revolution against reconstruction.

315
00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:35.520
I against the changes of the civil war against the 13th 14th and 15th
Amendments,

316
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.620
which revolution?
The revolution of black freedom

317
00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:44.850
or the redemption of white.

318
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:47.240
<v 1>Okay.</v>

319
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:51.560
<v 0>Those are the stakes.
Those are very,
very high stakes.</v>

320
00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.880
In fact,
just let me use a picture to for the heck of it.

321
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:05.140
<v 1>Um,
you know,</v>

322
00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.940
<v 0>this may go without saying,
but not really.</v>

323
00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:13.020
Which image did Americans,
White Americans,

324
00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.100
which image in their minds,

325
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:21.390
in their brains when they went to the polls,
what image,

326
00:24:21.391 --> 00:24:22.950
when we go to the polls now,

327
00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.210
do most white Americans want of black people?

328
00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:30.493
<v 1>Is it him?</v>

329
00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:36.770
<v 0>Is it that genius in his perfect white shirts who could speak and write like</v>

330
00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.073
Gerta

331
00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:45.990
and would remind you of it and would explain things in language that might make

332
00:24:45.991 --> 00:24:47.430
you quiver in your seat?

333
00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.640
Is it black genius they wanted to see

334
00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:57.950
<v 1>or,
yeah,</v>

335
00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:02.420
<v 0>I don't know if you can see that.
Did they want to see Chloe and Sam?</v>

336
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:05.150
It's a painting by Thomas Hovenden.

337
00:25:05.151 --> 00:25:09.920
A wonderful painter is same paint or have painted that a colossal painting of

338
00:25:09.921 --> 00:25:14.840
John Brown and with a rifle in one hand and the Bible in the other and hair on

339
00:25:14.841 --> 00:25:19.130
fire and it's at the Metropolitan Museum in New York.
Go see you.
Anyway.

340
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:24.680
Hoven dins painting here a beautiful if sentimental.

341
00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:25.551
Sure.

342
00:25:25.551 --> 00:25:29.390
I'll carefully you can see this or how well you can see this with the lighting

343
00:25:29.391 --> 00:25:32.990
in here.
It's Chloe and Sam.
It's too old.
Freedom.

344
00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:34.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

345
00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:39.240
<v 0>Sam seems to be cooling down the teapot,</v>

346
00:25:39.241 --> 00:25:41.850
maybe clothes ironing.

347
00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:46.770
It got their own house.
He hunts.

348
00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:52.890
They're peaceful.
That's this settled.

349
00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:57.600
They're there.
They're the old,
they're the old slaves.

350
00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:03.500
Does aunt Chloe and Uncle Sam and they're not going to threaten anybody.

351
00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:13.750
Well,
I mean forgive this image.
Um,
and this is,

352
00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:17.320
whoops.
I don't know who drew this.

353
00:26:17.321 --> 00:26:19.120
It just comes from the library of Congress.

354
00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:25.470
Or is this an image now that a lot of Americans,

355
00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:30.600
they may not prefer it
borders.
Certainly willing to accept

356
00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:37.460
about the sons and daughters of Chloe and Sam who got really assertive,

357
00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:41.790
who wanted to vote,
who were holding office or walking in there,

358
00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:43.020
perfect white shirts,

359
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:48.170
their suits in the halls of congress and the halls of state legislatures who

360
00:26:48.751 --> 00:26:51.920
insisted on education and property ownership and

361
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:56.110
all those crazy rights of citizenship.

362
00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.350
Why should black people be and not imagination?

363
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:05.701
All right.

364
00:27:05.701 --> 00:27:10.701
The election of 1876 comes if the election of [inaudible] 74 was a referendum on

365
00:27:10.801 --> 00:27:11.670
reconstruction,

366
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:17.250
the election of 1876 was a referendum,
if you like on reunion.

367
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:22.470
How indeed would this reunion actually occurred or would there really truly be a

368
00:27:22.471 --> 00:27:25.680
reunion?
Now this was an election of course,

369
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:30.710
where both parties now for the first time since the civil wealth for the first

370
00:27:31.621 --> 00:27:36.350
time,
really since before the civil war.
In fact,
you certainly could argue this,

371
00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:41.390
it's the first time since really 1856 that two parties in an American

372
00:27:43.741 --> 00:27:48.741
presidential election have faced each other as truly national and virtually

373
00:27:50.671 --> 00:27:54.040
equal in power,
um,

374
00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:57.180
authority membership to some degree

375
00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:00.173
<v 1>and so on.</v>

376
00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.750
<v 0>It's the centennial year.</v>

377
00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:09.490
It comes in the wake of these tremendous scandals of the second grant

378
00:28:09.491 --> 00:28:14.220
administration.
Whisky ring wasn't blown open until the second term credit.

379
00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:17.590
Moby lay wasn't blown over until the second term,
the Belknap scandal,

380
00:28:17.591 --> 00:28:21.550
not till the second term,
the Democrats.
Now in 76,

381
00:28:21.551 --> 00:28:24.930
they're going to portray themselves again as they hadn't 74 but now it's a

382
00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:28.990
presidential election.
Is the party reform the party of clean government.

383
00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.480
And thank you very much.

384
00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:36.220
The party of white supremacy that we'll finally put in reconstruction to death

385
00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.930
in those three states in the south where it's still exist in some form.

386
00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:47.340
The election was a test of either reunion or redemption and on whose turn the

387
00:28:48.641 --> 00:28:53.530
Democrats ran for President Samuel j Tilden,
he was the governor of New York.

388
00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.580
Governors of New York have often good candidates for president for a whole

389
00:28:57.581 --> 00:28:58.720
variety of good reasons.

390
00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:02.790
He was one of the richest men in the United States.

391
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:07.650
It was a very wealthy trial lawyer.
Um,

392
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:13.940
he had a reputation for reform based largely on the fact that he had gone as the

393
00:29:15.571 --> 00:29:16.560
governor of New York.

394
00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:22.220
He had gone after boss tweed who ran the boss system of New York City.

395
00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:27.180
And as the press always put it,
he bagged him.
You got him.
He found him.

396
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:31.560
He got him on charges.
They were able to prosecute against boss tweed.

397
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.880
So Tilden cleaned up New York.
It said,

398
00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:38.370
they said to some degree,

399
00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:42.370
<v 1>yeah.
No.</v>

400
00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:46.130
<v 0>The Republicans in the other hand now needed</v>

401
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:48.950
a new face,

402
00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:54.230
somebody on tainted by the grant administration and somebody who had some

403
00:29:54.231 --> 00:29:55.940
distance from reconstruction,

404
00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:01.760
but it was still terribly important to run a veteran,

405
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:07.610
and this is going to be the case for years in American history in the south.

406
00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:10.880
You couldn't get elected a governor or senator from a southern state for the

407
00:30:10.881 --> 00:30:13.250
next 25 years if you weren't a confederate veteran

408
00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.840
and it surely helps you in the north viewer union veteran.

409
00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:22.880
So they went to Ohio,
that seed better presidents,

410
00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:24.740
no more jokes about Ohio,

411
00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:28.640
and they found Ruthford be Hayes

412
00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:32.480
now haze that many things going for him.

413
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:36.880
He had indeed been a civil war vet.
He was a civil war vet.

414
00:30:36.881 --> 00:30:39.170
He'd been wounded about six times in the war.

415
00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:42.740
He was a serious combat survivor.

416
00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.460
He'd also been elected governor of Ohio three times.

417
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:52.460
He was known to be a conservative,
not terribly engaged in reconstruction issues.

418
00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:57.350
Oh,
he supported black rights and some sort of general way.

419
00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:00.440
He will promise something for almost everyone,

420
00:31:00.441 --> 00:31:03.890
depending on where he went in the Vegas possible term.

421
00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:05.810
<v 1>Okay.</v>

422
00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:08.030
<v 0>And he will inspire a,
once again,</v>

423
00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:12.830
that's cynical sob Henry Adams for one of the best descriptions I've ever read,

424
00:31:12.831 --> 00:31:14.460
a bread of Rutherford Hayes.

425
00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:19.400
A little unfair that Adam's always was as a satirists.

426
00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:25.030
Henry Adam said Rutherford Hayes was a quote third rate nonentity who's only

427
00:31:26.031 --> 00:31:29.540
recommendation is that he is obnoxious to no one.

428
00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:33.603
<v 1>No.</v>

429
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.660
<v 0>Oh,
how many times have we done this in our politics though?</v>

430
00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:41.550
Find somebody that nobody quite knows,
don't have a lot of enemies,

431
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.330
got elected,
no strong views

432
00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:50.110
<v 1>and running
and</v>

433
00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:54.470
<v 0>providing,
you don't have a year and a half bloody primary to put him through.</v>

434
00:31:58.450 --> 00:31:59.283
<v 1>Now</v>

435
00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:05.330
<v 0>this would be a brutal,
brutal election in its rhetoric.</v>

436
00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:08.230
Uh,
just an example to

437
00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:15.220
Republicans now facing this frankly variantly openly white supremacist campaign

438
00:32:17.721 --> 00:32:18.920
and the part of the Democrats,

439
00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:23.300
but also facing the charges of scandal and corruption,
which are very real.

440
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:27.440
They want to misdirect peoples,
you know,
added,
uh,
their,
their attention.

441
00:32:27.441 --> 00:32:30.800
They don't want people to think about those scandals.
And if they can help with,

442
00:32:30.801 --> 00:32:33.410
they don't even want people to have to think about reconstruction for awhile.

443
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:35.330
So what do they do?

444
00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:39.380
They waived the bloody shirt when in doubt,

445
00:32:39.381 --> 00:32:40.970
in the 19th century for the Republican,

446
00:32:40.971 --> 00:32:45.200
they're going to keep doing it right on up through the 1896 selection against

447
00:32:45.201 --> 00:32:50.020
William William Jennings Bryan.
That's getting ahead of ourselves,
but man,

448
00:32:50.021 --> 00:32:55.021
they're going to trot out every living surviving sentience civil war general by

449
00:32:55.661 --> 00:32:59.110
even as late as 1896 put them on trains and barnstorm.

450
00:32:59.111 --> 00:33:03.080
I'm all over the country and paint William Jennings Bryan is a succession list

451
00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:08.150
because it was a populous.
At any rate,

452
00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:12.830
here's one example of the kind of bloody shirt rhetoric that the Republican

453
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:17.830
party tried out against the Democrats in 1876 this came from Colonel Robert

454
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:20.870
Ingersoll cool,
famous,
agnostic,

455
00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.390
a very popular order,

456
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:28.810
especially at Grand Army of the republic reunions and political gatherings.

457
00:33:28.971 --> 00:33:33.971
He said this in September of [inaudible] 76 quote classic bloody shirt every

458
00:33:34.691 --> 00:33:38.860
state did.
Seceded from the United States was a democratic state.

459
00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:43.840
Every man that tried to destroy this nation was a democrat.

460
00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:49.180
Every man that loves slavery better than liberty was a democrat.

461
00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:53.020
The man that assassinated Abraham Lincoln was a democrat.

462
00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:58.000
Every man that raised bloodhounds to pursue human beings was a democrat.

463
00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.080
Soldiers.

464
00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:04.320
Every scar you have got on your heroic bodies was given to you by a Democrat and

465
00:34:05.921 --> 00:34:10.720
the union veterans and get up and cheer.
Yay.
Scars,
Democrat scar.

466
00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:17.830
It worked.
It worked in a lot of places.

467
00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:19.810
War is only 10 years ago,

468
00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:23.770
and our hundreds of thousands of union veterans,

469
00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:29.350
they are the base of the Republican Party,
a deep,

470
00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:33.850
broad base,
especially across the Midwest,
which is where they're all moving.

471
00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:37.120
And in the far west.
So civil war veterans are moving west

472
00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.520
in the election.
Um,
again,

473
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:48.070
the rhetoric gut terrible.
And when the election was held,

474
00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:52.630
it was a very violent election.
Uh,
we'll never know.

475
00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:56.890
No one will ever know how many thousands of African American voters,

476
00:34:56.891 --> 00:35:00.610
especially in the three states of Mississippi,
Louisiana and South Carolina.

477
00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:03.520
Uh,
excuse me,
Mississippi,

478
00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:08.260
South Carolina and Louisiana as well.
But also Florida.

479
00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:12.430
We'll never know how many were intimidated and kept from the Poles.

480
00:35:12.431 --> 00:35:15.790
We know it was thousands,
hundreds of thousands in all likelihood.

481
00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:22.200
One Republican official in Mississippi observing the election said in his view

482
00:35:22.961 --> 00:35:27.310
of the white population was essentially one vast mob.

483
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:33.800
Now,
what happened,
of course,

484
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:38.910
is it Tilden and carried all of a map here may be useful

485
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:43.020
Tilden,
I don't know how well you can see that,

486
00:35:43.021 --> 00:35:45.780
but at least you can see the contours of it.

487
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:51.320
Tilled in the Democrat carried all of the solid south except now solid

488
00:35:51.811 --> 00:35:54.270
democratic south except three states.

489
00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:59.430
The three states remaining under republic teetering Republican regimes,

490
00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:00.511
Louisiana,

491
00:36:00.511 --> 00:36:05.220
South Carolina and Florida Tilden also carried for northern states,

492
00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:09.240
his own North New York,
New Jersey,
Connecticut,
and Indiana

493
00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:15.730
Hayes carried all the rest of the north and much of the west,

494
00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.980
but without the three southern states counted

495
00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:26.620
Mississippi,
excuse me,
Louisiana,

496
00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.200
Florida and South Carolina.

497
00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:36.190
The electoral count
and when the,

498
00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:39.280
when the returns came in that night and the next day,

499
00:36:39.281 --> 00:36:40.810
and it took longer in those years,

500
00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:46.050
it took at least a 24 hours after an election ended and sometimes 48 hours

501
00:36:46.061 --> 00:36:49.150
before they even had real official counts.

502
00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:51.210
<v 1>Okay.</v>

503
00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:54.060
<v 0>In the electoral college.
Now.
First of all,</v>

504
00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:58.380
there's no question that at least in the votes cast,

505
00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:03.990
Tilden won the popular vote,
if you like,
in the terms of numbers.

506
00:37:03.991 --> 00:37:08.880
He's the Al Gore of the 876 election.
He won the popular vote of the votes cast.

507
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:10.530
Nope.
How many hundreds of thousands,

508
00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:15.300
particularly black Republicans who didn't vote for fear for their lives.

509
00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:19.650
We don't know the electoral college before you count to three disputed states,

510
00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:24.000
the number was one 84 to one 66 Tilden to haze.

511
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:26.310
It took one 85 to be elected.

512
00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:29.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

513
00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:33.580
<v 0>Handwriting on the wall initially was that,
well,</v>

514
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:36.850
even in the official Republican party offices in Washington DC,

515
00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.740
as the returns were coming in the next day,

516
00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:44.020
they were about to hold news conferences,
send out messages and say,
well,
guys,

517
00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:47.740
guess we lost,
and then quickly,

518
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:53.550
quickly inside their offices they realized that there were 19 electoral votes in

519
00:37:55.751 --> 00:37:59.710
the three disputed states and they said,
no news conferences,

520
00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:00.730
we're going to win those three.

521
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:05.140
How raw it remains to be seen.

522
00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:10.870
The disputed election of 1876 and was disputed over the three states that still

523
00:38:10.871 --> 00:38:15.310
had republican regimes that had widespread fraud,
violence,

524
00:38:15.311 --> 00:38:17.950
and intimidation practice in their elections.

525
00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:22.030
No one will ever know as long as we live exactly who,
one where.

526
00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:27.030
Although we do have some good guesses now from scholarship.
Well,

527
00:38:27.031 --> 00:38:31.120
what ensued was the longest disputed election we've ever had.

528
00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:35.110
The Gore Bush affair of 2000 last,
what,

529
00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:38.500
35 days before the Supreme Court chose our president.

530
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:42.910
It isn't going to be a lot different here.
Oh,

531
00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:46.100
the supreme court will have only a very limited role.

532
00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:53.800
The official popular vote count in 1876 was 4,284,000 some odd votes for Tilden

533
00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:00.630
and 4,036,000 some odd,
36,000 some odd votes for haze.

534
00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:05.610
That was an official popular vote.
Well,

535
00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:09.250
one of the best ways to think about this election is that frankly,

536
00:39:09.251 --> 00:39:13.110
the Democrats stole it and then the Republicans stolen back.

537
00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:16.300
Hate to sound so cynical,
but frankly,
folks,

538
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:20.980
that's essentially what happened under the 12th amendment to the US
Constitution.

539
00:39:20.981 --> 00:39:24.370
Of course if there's a disputed election and no one gets a majority of the,

540
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:28.030
of the electoral college.
We ignored this one in 2000.

541
00:39:28.031 --> 00:39:29.290
I just thought I'd point that out.

542
00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:34.270
It is supposed to go to the House of Representatives and the House of

543
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:36.910
Representatives and it's a good councils shall choose.

544
00:39:36.911 --> 00:39:41.860
The president says to the u s constitution and they followed the constitution in

545
00:39:41.861 --> 00:39:46.860
1876 they actually did well too to a degree they did

546
00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:54.700
with the country waiting with all kinds of rumors flying and the press.

547
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:59.490
I went back and studied the present in this disputed,
these disputed months.
Uh,

548
00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:03.490
for this earlier book I did on memory.
And it's amazing the rumors.

549
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:07.030
I mean you've got southern papers like the Atlanta Constitution printing long

550
00:40:07.031 --> 00:40:11.470
stories about local militias and upstate New York that are drilling,

551
00:40:11.471 --> 00:40:15.100
calling themselves with the sons of liberty and readying themselves to march

552
00:40:15.101 --> 00:40:16.090
into the south.

553
00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:21.040
And you've got northern papers like Chicago Tribune printing article,

554
00:40:21.041 --> 00:40:24.400
article after article about confederate mobs and malicious.

555
00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:27.470
You're drilling all over this house and preparing themselves to merchant into

556
00:40:27.471 --> 00:40:31.210
the north,
most of which were completely false.

557
00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:37.620
But it became long tense winter months of fear,

558
00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:43.080
and now of course,
when fear sets in blood memory sets in

559
00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:49.580
the United States House of Representatives decided to establish an electoral

560
00:40:49.581 --> 00:40:52.700
commission.
It would have 15 members.

561
00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:55.370
There would be five Republicans,

562
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:59.810
five Democrats and five Supreme Court justices.

563
00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:04.610
15 people.
Sounds relatively fair.

564
00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:10.610
Not Quite.
Three of the Supreme Court justices were Republicans.

565
00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:13.700
Two of them were Democrats.
I mean is there were eight Republicans,

566
00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.610
seven Democrats on this electorial commission.

567
00:41:16.611 --> 00:41:21.560
The job of this electoral commission was to investigate the voting returns of

568
00:41:21.561 --> 00:41:26.480
the three disputed states of Louisiana,
Florida,
and South Carolina.

569
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:29.510
They would just study the return.

570
00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:30.493
<v 1>It's</v>

571
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:36.510
<v 0>the Democrats in Congress initiated a long filibuster and they held it.</v>

572
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:43.510
They started a filibuster in December of 60 of 76 and they're still doing it.

573
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:48.530
I mean,
they're,
they're reading city directories and whatever other garbage,

574
00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:49.910
they didn't have phone books yet.

575
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:55.270
They were just reading newspaper articles a day in and day out until the third

576
00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:01.430
week,
fourth week of February of 77

577
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:05.570
nothing went on in the u s congress.

578
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:12.370
There were threats of disunion hotheaded Democrats would a announce the slogan,

579
00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:14.960
Tilden or fight

580
00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:19.990
President Ulysses Grant,
lame duck,

581
00:42:19.991 --> 00:42:23.080
can't wait to get out of office already has his,

582
00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:26.950
his ship booked for his grand tour around the world,

583
00:42:26.951 --> 00:42:30.450
or he'll leave on May 17th,
uh,
for the,

584
00:42:30.451 --> 00:42:33.850
the greatest tour any American ever made of planet earth.
That's another story.

585
00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:35.553
Um,

586
00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:41.220
but grant quietly began to rebuild and re garrison some of the forts around

587
00:42:42.101 --> 00:42:46.810
Washington DC,
and Lo and behold,

588
00:42:46.811 --> 00:42:50.650
the commission,
Matt and Lo and behold,
they voted.

589
00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:52.413
Guess what?

590
00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:54.850
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

591
00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:58.360
<v 0>it's a suspense.
They voted eight to seven</v>

592
00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:02.100
that the Republicans tilled.

593
00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:07.150
Hayes had one in Louisiana,
Florida,

594
00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:11.740
and South Carolina based on the theory of widespread farden violence.
Now,

595
00:43:11.741 --> 00:43:12.790
there's a lot to that.

596
00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:19.380
They never really knew what those voting counts were,
to be honest.

597
00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:24.720
But the way in which the disputed election of 1876 was settled,
of course,

598
00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:28.380
was ultimately not even by that electorial commission.

599
00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:34.040
It was settled in the Wormley hotel on February 26th and 27th of 1877 and a 48

600
00:43:36.481 --> 00:43:41.350
hour meeting between five Ohio Republicans representing Hayes and forest

601
00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:43.350
southern Democrats representing Tilden.

602
00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:49.140
The compromise of 1877 as it is called,
was a deal.

603
00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:54.920
It was a deal based on interests not on votes.

604
00:43:57.050 --> 00:44:02.050
The Democrats were willing to give up the presidency if they could get in return

605
00:44:02.841 --> 00:44:04.040
what they most needed.

606
00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:10.670
They wanted federal subsidies for a Western Pacific Railroad,

607
00:44:10.671 --> 00:44:15.530
at least one with a southern terminus.
They wanted their harbors dredged.

608
00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:19.670
They wanted federal subsidies to rebuild the infrastructure of the south.

609
00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:24.020
Lo and behold,
they wanted federal money.
All these states rights.

610
00:44:24.021 --> 00:44:25.970
Southern Democrats,
thank you very much.

611
00:44:25.971 --> 00:44:30.800
They wanted federal money to rebuild their society.
Bring us your investments.

612
00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:34.410
They'd saying for a long time,
from carpet baggers to carpet baggers,

613
00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:36.600
just don't come here and try to get elected.

614
00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:46.580
Here was the deal,
and by the way,
one of the chief brokers,

615
00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:51.560
there were several chief brokers.
One was James Garfield of Ohio,

616
00:44:51.561 --> 00:44:55.160
close personal friend and associate of Rutherford.
B Hayes,

617
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:56.780
uh,

618
00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:01.550
later succeeded him as president United States and to be assassinated.

619
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.850
But the other great broker at the 77 compromise was Tom Scott,

620
00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:11.210
the president of the ticks,
the Texas Pacific Railroad.

621
00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:17.030
He'd been one of the great American railroad kings for years and he brokered

622
00:45:17.031 --> 00:45:17.864
really,

623
00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:22.340
especially the economic financial parts of this deal.

624
00:45:22.341 --> 00:45:25.970
Here was the deal
home rule.

625
00:45:25.971 --> 00:45:29.810
The Republican said would be returned to Louisiana,

626
00:45:29.811 --> 00:45:31.790
South Carolina and Florida.

627
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:37.030
The Republicans agreed to let the southern Democrats take over those three

628
00:45:37.401 --> 00:45:41.420
states,
abandoning their own party leaders,

629
00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:45.590
abandoning a lot of black elected officials who are still running those

630
00:45:45.591 --> 00:45:46.424
governments

631
00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:53.590
and the Republican's promise they would help get Democrats elected governors of

632
00:45:53.591 --> 00:45:54.424
those states.

633
00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:55.670
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

634
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:58.640
<v 0>they agreed to remove all final federal troops from the south and this has</v>

635
00:45:58.641 --> 00:46:03.560
always been a big symbolic thing as well,
which is exactly what it is.

636
00:46:03.561 --> 00:46:04.610
It's a big symbolic thing.

637
00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:08.770
There were very few troops left anywhere in the south and those,

638
00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:11.090
those few thousand that we're still there.

639
00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:16.660
We're located in forts along the coast and quietly Ulysses grant signed the bill

640
00:46:17.781 --> 00:46:19.100
and the third week of February,

641
00:46:19.101 --> 00:46:24.101
just before the deal at the Wormley hotel that repealed the law,

642
00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:27.920
placing those troops in the south.

643
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:30.440
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

644
00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:34.850
<v 0>One and possibly to cabinet positions in Hayes's cabinet were promised to</v>

645
00:46:34.851 --> 00:46:35.900
southern Democrats.

646
00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:39.770
They particularly promise the postmaster general ship because of its patronage

647
00:46:39.771 --> 00:46:40.604
powers.

648
00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:46.970
The Democrats agreed to help James Garfield become speaker of the house.

649
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:52.310
It's a deal folks.
Quid pro quo tit for tat.

650
00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:57.200
The Democrats agreed to enforce.
Well,

651
00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:01.550
I can almost not see this one at Democrats agreed to enforce the civil war

652
00:47:01.551 --> 00:47:03.560
amendments and black civil rights.

653
00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:05.663
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

654
00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:12.470
<v 0>And the Democrats agreed to stop their filibuster except the official count.</v>

655
00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:15.540
Wow.

656
00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:20.540
Hayes to be peacefully inaugurated three days later or four days later on March

657
00:47:23.911 --> 00:47:27.660
the third Rutherford B Hayes was privately inaugurated,

658
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:32.920
no outdoor inauguration on the steps of the Capitol is they are always done.

659
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:38.020
They feared a,
uh,
violence,
uh,
interruptions.

660
00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:39.520
They didn't know what was going to happen.

661
00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:45.670
He was privately inaugurated quietly in the east room of the White House.

662
00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:48.220
Catastrophe had been averted.

663
00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:49.520
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

664
00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:52.750
<v 0>But at what price?
See,</v>

665
00:47:52.751 --> 00:47:57.751
van Woodward once accurately called this compromise a treaty as much as a

666
00:48:00.491 --> 00:48:01.324
compromise

667
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:07.780
and it's a compromise of 1850 oh remember it so often referred to as an

668
00:48:07.781 --> 00:48:11.140
armistice rather than a current compromise.

669
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:15.370
This compromise of 1877 was in some ways a treaty

670
00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:17.830
and oh,
by the way,

671
00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:23.970
Hayes made it very clear in private communications what he'd been really saying

672
00:48:24.461 --> 00:48:29.461
publicly and that is that his southern policy would be essentially his own,

673
00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:34.090
his own phrase,
a let alone policy.

674
00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:39.940
The south would be allowed to control its own social institutions is political

675
00:48:39.941 --> 00:48:43.870
culture.
It's
wives.

676
00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.900
Even grant himself had said that,
you know,

677
00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:55.790
reconstruction was dead and maybe we made mistakes and shouldn't have even
tried.

678
00:48:55.791 --> 00:48:59.690
Grant himself said to his cabinet that the 15th amendment,

679
00:48:59.691 --> 00:49:02.690
he said had quote done,
the Negro,
no good.

680
00:49:04.310 --> 00:49:05.750
Oh Ulysses.

681
00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:11.190
And right after the inauguration and editorial in the nation magazine,

682
00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:15.780
now I a fuming reformist magazine,

683
00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:20.790
they wanted a clean up American corruption.
He,
God can,

684
00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:25.590
it's great editor at the nation said he would joist in fact at this compromise,

685
00:49:25.591 --> 00:49:30.270
this settling of this dispute.
And he announced his words,

686
00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:33.740
the Negro,
he said,

687
00:49:33.741 --> 00:49:37.910
will disappear now from the field of national politics.

688
00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:43.530
Henceforth the nation as a nation will have nothing more to do with him.

689
00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:51.050
No.
There are many meanings,
legacies,

690
00:49:51.051 --> 00:49:55.670
implications of this compromise.
There are many,

691
00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:56.240
uh,

692
00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:01.240
long lasting implications and legacies of this compromise and this particular

693
00:50:01.551 --> 00:50:02.840
end of reconstruction.

694
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:07.450
And it does seem like a sort of dead end.

695
00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:12.720
A light's going out kind of moment to all that idealism or whatever we wish to

696
00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:16.900
call it.
It emerged from the war.

697
00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:21.790
It would leave a person like Frederick Douglass in a certain degree of despair.

698
00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:27.110
He would begin to make speeches and he will the rest of his life about trying to

699
00:50:27.111 --> 00:50:29.270
hold onto.
And emancipation,

700
00:50:29.271 --> 00:50:34.250
just abolition is memory of the civil war and reconstruction.

701
00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:39.140
He makes a speech a few years later where he's lamenting what has now been

702
00:50:39.141 --> 00:50:43.850
betrayed and lost and is eroding out of their fingers.
He says,

703
00:50:43.851 --> 00:50:48.470
reconstruction is only was only perhaps a rope of sand,

704
00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:50.943
<v 1>but</v>

705
00:50:51.970 --> 00:50:54.730
<v 0>he drew upon at the end of that speech,</v>

706
00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:59.760
he drew upon one of those revolutionary moments in the Bible to try to keep a

707
00:51:00.011 --> 00:51:04.270
certain degree of hope alive about what had at least been started.

708
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:06.370
He went to the Lazarus story,

709
00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:11.560
the story of Jesus Raising Lazarus.
Literary literally from the dead.

710
00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:14.351
Douglas said,

711
00:51:14.351 --> 00:51:19.351
the assumption that the cause of the Negro is a dead issue now is delusion.

712
00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:22.270
Utter delusion for the moment,

713
00:51:22.271 --> 00:51:26.920
he may be buried under the dust and rubbish of endless discussion concerning

714
00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:31.390
civil service reform,
tariff and free trade labor and capital,

715
00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:36.220
but our Lazarus is not dead.
He only sleeps.

716
00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:39.850
<v 1>See you next week.</v>
