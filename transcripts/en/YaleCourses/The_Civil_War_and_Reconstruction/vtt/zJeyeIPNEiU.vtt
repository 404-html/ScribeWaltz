1
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.390
So what caused the civil war?

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.680
Somebody said slavery.

3
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.530
Can I hear a states rights?
Can I hear a conflicting civilizations?

4
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.030
Can I hear Onassis Fury?
Can I hear fanaticism?

5
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.950
Can I hear fear?
Can I hear stupidity?

6
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.270
Can I hear God?
Damn.
Yankees

7
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.670
or

8
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.070
Jefferson Davis may have captured the kind of toxin that was in the air around

9
00:00:45.371 --> 00:00:49.460
southern succession and late 1860 and into

10
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.740
this distracted,
sad years.

11
00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:58.741
Whitman called it of 1861 Jeffers and Dave as soon to be first president only

12
00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:04.900
president of the confederate states of America senator,

13
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.510
former senator from Mississippi,

14
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.940
former commandant of West Point,
former secretary of war.

15
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.950
He tried to capture what the south was doing with succession with a certain

16
00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:21.540
dignified reserve.
Here.

17
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:26.541
This is at the very end of 1860 before Mississippi had succeeded,

18
00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:28.440
but it's not far away.

19
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.970
He said the south now quote is confronted by a common foe.

20
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.230
The south should buy the instinct of self preservation.

21
00:01:40.231 --> 00:01:41.100
Be United.

22
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.850
The recent declarations of the candidate and leaders of the Black Republican

23
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.910
Party and southerners made no miss no opportunity to rename the Republican Party

24
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.930
a thousand times the Black Republican Party.

25
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.691
At any rate,

26
00:02:01.691 --> 00:02:04.030
the reason declaration of the candidate and leaders of the Republican,

27
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.090
the Black Republican Party must suffice to convince many who have formerly

28
00:02:10.031 --> 00:02:14.800
doubted the purpose to attack the institution of slavery in the states.

29
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.190
The undying opposition to slavery in the United States means war upon it,

30
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.550
where it is not where it is not.

31
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.270
That is the Republicans did not simply opposed slavery in the territories.

32
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.370
They opposed slavery and the slave states and they would not stop until they had

33
00:02:36.371 --> 00:02:39.760
obliterated it and the time is at hand.

34
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.410
One of the great battle is to be fought between the defenders of the

35
00:02:44.411 --> 00:02:49.270
constitutional government and the voters of mob rule,

36
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.640
fanaticism,
and anarchy.

37
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:54.703
<v 1>No.</v>

38
00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.450
<v 0>David seemed to think a little bit was at stake for the south in 1861 however,</v>

39
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.180
after the war,

40
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.150
Jefferson Davis rope what is probably the longest,

41
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.930
most Turgid belabored 1200 page defense of a failed political revolution in the

42
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:24.730
history of language.

43
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.800
1,279 pages is his memoir entitled the rise and fall of the confederate

44
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:34.564
government

45
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.070
and by the time he wrote that are published in 1882

46
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.200
he was arguing everywhere on storied famous legendary tours of the sound.

47
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.000
The war had absolutely nothing to do with slavery.

48
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.210
Listen to just one cast of that 1200 page defense of his constitutional

49
00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:00.424
movement.

50
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.780
Slavery said Jeff Davis by 1882 was the no wise the cause of the conflict but

51
00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:10.960
only an incident.

52
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.090
Generally African American,
excuse me.

53
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.630
Generally Africans were born the slaves of barbarian masters untaught in all the

54
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:29.731
useful arts and occupations reared and he even darkness and sold by he than

55
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.390
masters.

56
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.770
They were transferred to shores enlightened by the raise of Christianity.

57
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.320
Now he goes on.
All right,
quoting

58
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.860
black set.
Jeff Davis had been quote,
put to servitude,

59
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.790
trained in the gentle arcs,
the peace and order in civilization.

60
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.830
They increased from a few unprofitable savages to millions of efficient

61
00:04:56.831 --> 00:04:58.270
Christian labors.

62
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.810
Their survival instincts rendered them contented with their lot and their

63
00:05:04.451 --> 00:05:09.430
patient toilet.
Bless the land of their abode with unmeasured riches.

64
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.830
There strong local and personal attachment,
secured faithful service.

65
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.540
Never was there.

66
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.460
Happier dependence of labor and capital on each other.

67
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.330
The tempter came like the serpent of Eden and decoyed them with the magic word

68
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.963
freedom.

69
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.990
He put arms in their hands and train their humble but emotional natures to deeds

70
00:05:38.021 --> 00:05:43.021
of violence and bloodshed and sent them out to devastate their benefactors.

71
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.770
I could go on and on with this particular incredible passage.

72
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.640
What you have there in that 1882 passage is the core,

73
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.250
the lifeblood of the lost cause tradition.

74
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.473
<v 1>Okay?</v>

75
00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.610
<v 0>In 1861 and you've read Charles Duhigg's book on this in 1861 southern</v>

76
00:06:10.571 --> 00:06:13.870
leadership at least until after Fort Sumpter,

77
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.960
argued every day in every way that they were about the business of preserving a

78
00:06:20.051 --> 00:06:21.100
slave society,

79
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:27.210
civilization based on slave labor or racial system ordered by slavery now

80
00:06:29.411 --> 00:06:34.411
threatened by these antislavery black Republicans in the wake of the civil war.

81
00:06:36.311 --> 00:06:41.300
However,
so much energy will be exercise,

82
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.920
not only by southerners over time to try to convince the American people and the

83
00:06:48.131 --> 00:06:53.131
rest of the world that this event was not about slavery

84
00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.720
in a speech in 1878 like many other speeches he gave him the last third of his

85
00:07:01.091 --> 00:07:01.924
life.

86
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:07.380
Frederick Douglass was at that point 1878 already fed up with lost cars,

87
00:07:09.731 --> 00:07:12.310
arguments about what the war had been about.

88
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.360
He was also already early in the process fed up or the ways in which Americans

89
00:07:19.391 --> 00:07:24.391
were beginning to reconcile this bloody terrible conflict around the mutual

90
00:07:24.731 --> 00:07:28.300
valor of soldiers and in his view,

91
00:07:28.301 --> 00:07:33.301
forgetting what the whole terrible thing might have even been about.

92
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.980
And the end of a magnificent speech.
You gave it a veterans reunion.

93
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.430
He said this,
the civil war,

94
00:07:42.431 --> 00:07:47.431
this is Frederick Douglass was not a fight between rapacious birds and ferocious

95
00:07:47.591 --> 00:07:51.400
beast.
Amir display a brute courage and endurance.

96
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:57.540
It was a war between men of thought as well as the action and in dead earnest

97
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.180
for something beyond the battlefield.

98
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:05.440
He went on and on and on.

99
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:09.790
Then to declare that the war had been about ideas

100
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:16.150
and he described the difference and the difference between those ideas as he put

101
00:08:16.151 --> 00:08:19.510
it was the difference between quote,

102
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.840
barbarism and civilization.

103
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:29.970
Now I'm going to spend this lecture just reflecting with you on first succession

104
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:37.350
because I left you hanging in the air about the various explanations of

105
00:08:37.931 --> 00:08:40.870
succession interpretations over time.

106
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.160
I don't want to revisit that at least briefly and then I want to take you

107
00:08:45.161 --> 00:08:50.161
through a little quick survey of the interpretations of civil war causation over

108
00:08:51.371 --> 00:08:52.030
time.

109
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:57.030
It's fascinating to understand how in the past now nearly a century and a half

110
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.960
Americans have gone through this topsy turvy twisting inside out changing view

111
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.640
of what causes that war.
The backtest.

112
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:13.680
The session I left off with saying I was going to offer you five different

113
00:09:13.681 --> 00:09:17.670
explanations.
I don't think they're all equal,
um,

114
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.480
necessarily,
but they're there in some ways.

115
00:09:21.481 --> 00:09:26.481
They kind of fold into one another and I'd already talked about how the

116
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:30.210
preservation of slavery,
a slave society,

117
00:09:30.211 --> 00:09:34.200
a society ordered by slave labor and so forth,
um,

118
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.310
was a principal,
if not the principle,

119
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:40.950
purpose of this secession movement,

120
00:09:40.951 --> 00:09:43.560
at least in the deep south where it's succeeded.

121
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:49.460
Remember now there are still eight slave states that have not succeeded from the

122
00:09:51.061 --> 00:09:54.450
Union as of March,

123
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.370
1861 when Lincoln was to be inaugurated,

124
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:03.690
the majority of the slave states are still in the union,

125
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.530
not out only South Carolina,
over to Texas,

126
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.030
the whatever color that is of the deep south was the confederate states of

127
00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:16.320
America.
Had it remained only those seven states.

128
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:21.950
It's hard to imagine exactly how the confederacy would have mounted a war effort

129
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.920
conducted or and created a foreign policy and managed.

130
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.850
If the Lincoln government decides

131
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:38.310
on war or coercion as the south,
we'll call.

132
00:10:38.311 --> 00:10:43.311
It is hard to imagine how the confederacy would have survived as long as it did.

133
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.810
The four states that will join it,
we'll come to this on Thursday,
do not succeed.

134
00:10:48.811 --> 00:10:52.320
Of course,
until after Fort Sumpter,
Virginia,
North Carolina,

135
00:10:52.321 --> 00:10:57.321
Tennessee and Arkansas in their initial secession legislatures or conventions,

136
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.750
either did not chose not to vote or voted succession down,

137
00:11:03.751 --> 00:11:07.530
which Virginia decisively did before fort Sumpter.

138
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.170
And it's only after the firing.
Unfortunately,

139
00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:16.171
her in April of 61 Virginia will votes to session.

140
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.380
And it's crucial of course,
given that it's Virginia,

141
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:21.660
the size of Virginia,

142
00:11:21.661 --> 00:11:26.520
the significance and symbolism and power of Virginia Geogra geographical

143
00:11:26.521 --> 00:11:27.750
location of Virginia.

144
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:33.200
And so on a second explanation of succession though is what I would call the

145
00:11:33.631 --> 00:11:38.100
fear thesis,
fear of many kinds.

146
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.750
And now this is of course,

147
00:11:39.751 --> 00:11:43.590
deeply related to the first explanation of preserving a slave society.

148
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.680
But in some ways this was a racial fear as well.

149
00:11:46.681 --> 00:11:50.220
If you look into those slavery convention,
uh,
succession conventions,

150
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:54.890
and if you look deeply into ohs quotations and Charles Book and he loads of the

151
00:11:54.891 --> 00:11:57.640
mine,
you doesn't,
he,
there's an uneven,

152
00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:02.670
more immediate kind of racial fear among southern secessionists that they live

153
00:12:03.611 --> 00:12:08.230
on PR on the potential of a racial powder keg of the potential of slave

154
00:12:08.231 --> 00:12:09.640
insurrection over time,

155
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:14.850
especially if the south and the slavery continues to shrink within itself.

156
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:23.200
There's the phrase they kept returning to,

157
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.940
and Abraham Lincoln's house divided speech from 1858 they never let him forget

158
00:12:27.941 --> 00:12:30.890
it,
that,
that he and the Republican Party,
they said,
well,

159
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:35.080
we're going to put slavery on a quote course of ultimate extinction.

160
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.000
That's fairly clear,
isn't it?
We're going to make your system extinct.

161
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.380
I like that.
Oh,
not a problem.

162
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.983
Um,

163
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:51.190
fear of the radicalism now of a John Brown,

164
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:54.690
John Brown had sort of made a,

165
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:59.590
this equation that had always been there in the southern mine in vague ways.

166
00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:01.780
Um,
explicit.

167
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:07.560
If the Republican party in the North had succeeded in selling this slogan of a

168
00:13:08.591 --> 00:13:10.480
slave power conspiracy.

169
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:16.290
Well southerners now the planter class and the secessionist are very successful,

170
00:13:18.281 --> 00:13:23.281
especially in the wake of John Brown's raid of selling a mutual or a counter

171
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.470
conspiracy theory.
And that conspiracy simply is abolition emissaries.

172
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.270
There are lots of labels that goes by,

173
00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:36.610
but the idea that if the Republican politicians themselves aren't going to lead

174
00:13:36.611 --> 00:13:39.100
bands into the south to attack the south,

175
00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:44.940
they will end up nevertheless politically stimulating more and more.

176
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:49.420
John Brown's to make visitations on the sounds

177
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.700
all over the rhetoric of succession.

178
00:13:54.701 --> 00:13:57.070
You find the language of,

179
00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.660
or the word frankly of submission submission,

180
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:06.880
we will not submit and so on.
Let me give you just one example.

181
00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:12.610
Um,
in Charleston,
South Carolina,
the editor of its most radical newspaper,

182
00:14:12.611 --> 00:14:14.290
it's most succession as newspaper.

183
00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.470
It was a man named Robert ret and the Charleston courier,

184
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:20.471
I'm sorry,

185
00:14:20.471 --> 00:14:25.471
the Charleston Mercury is what he edited and he ran a series of articles under

186
00:14:25.991 --> 00:14:26.860
the heading,

187
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:32.560
the terrors of submission during the session,
winter.

188
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:37.450
And in one of those pieces,
Robert Rhett wrote,
and I quote,

189
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:42.910
if the south once submits to the rule of abolitionists by the general

190
00:14:42.911 --> 00:14:43.744
government,

191
00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:48.780
there is probably an end of all peaceful separation of the union.

192
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.380
We can only escape the ruin.

193
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:55.460
They meditate for the south by war.

194
00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:01.240
The ruin of the south by the emancipation of her slaves is not like the ruin of

195
00:15:02.181 --> 00:15:05.540
any other people.
It is not a mere loss of liberty,

196
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:10.310
but it is a loss of liberty property,
home country.

197
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.970
Everything that makes life worth living.

198
00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:22.750
Rent was full of some anxious fury.
Without a doubt,

199
00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:28.260
there were southern secessionists who absolutely believed that even any

200
00:15:28.661 --> 00:15:33.250
discussion of slavery's future in the u s congress,

201
00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:35.450
it should be suppressed.

202
00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:39.420
They would no longer live in a union.

203
00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:44.930
They even discussed what to do about the future of slavery.

204
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:48.263
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

205
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:52.220
<v 0>and I,
I would say there's not only a kind of racial fear,</v>

206
00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:56.540
fear of loss of,
of,
of slavery by the planter class,

207
00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.810
but there's a certain kind of political fear going on as well.

208
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:04.880
And that is the fear that southern Paul's now had.
They'd had this for years,

209
00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:05.714
hadn't they?

210
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:11.200
The fear was the growing or the growth now for them of a kind of minority status

211
00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:17.120
that that Republican Party in the north now I had the potential given the

212
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:21.050
population of the north,
this sectional and isolate every party.

213
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.100
I had the potential to really take over the House of Representatives in huge

214
00:16:25.101 --> 00:16:28.520
numbers.
Then you get Lincoln in the White House for four years.

215
00:16:28.521 --> 00:16:32.180
And what if you get him for eight?
And he points the next two,
three,
four,

216
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:36.980
five members of the Supreme Court and he can control the diplomatic corps around

217
00:16:36.981 --> 00:16:38.840
the world.
And even more importantly,

218
00:16:38.841 --> 00:16:41.930
he can control patronage of the post office system,
which in those years,

219
00:16:41.931 --> 00:16:43.640
believe it or not,
was a very powerful,

220
00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:49.280
nobody gives a hoot about who runs a toaster offices now.
But boy they did then.

221
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.440
And what was at stake,
and we can see this all over their letters,

222
00:16:55.441 --> 00:16:56.850
their diaries and their speeches,

223
00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:02.300
succession conventions was a loss ultimately for the slave holding class of what

224
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:08.100
uh,
James Roark and other scholars have called plantar control.

225
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.130
So to say,
you know,
succession is about slavery.
Is,
is accurate,

226
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.380
but there layers beneath it

227
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.040
and what I'd call a kind of fear thesis.

228
00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:25.330
A third explanation is what we might call or a motivation for southern

229
00:17:25.331 --> 00:17:25.921
succession.
Well,

230
00:17:25.921 --> 00:17:30.921
we might call southern nationalism a sense of southern unity,

231
00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:35.860
uh,
a dream for some southern secessionists.
They were a minority,

232
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:39.340
surely over time.
And they're even a minority,

233
00:17:39.341 --> 00:17:41.200
I think in the midst of the succession crisis,

234
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:46.590
but a dream over time of a southern nation and independence,

235
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.590
uh,
of,
of course,

236
00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:55.120
of developing their own boundaries and their own potential expansionist foreign

237
00:17:56.761 --> 00:17:57.594
policy

238
00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:03.650
where they would no longer ever be dependent on the United States federal

239
00:18:03.651 --> 00:18:08.651
government on one compromise after another with northerners and now to many

240
00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:11.270
southern secessionists,

241
00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:16.640
it would be compromises with people that couldn't even conceive of compromising

242
00:18:16.641 --> 00:18:18.470
with these free soil.

243
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:22.970
Antislavery they believed abolitionist Republicans,

244
00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.180
these southern nationalists.
We're led by people like,
I hadn't been Ruffin,

245
00:18:28.181 --> 00:18:31.780
a Virginia William Lounges,
UNC of Georgia,

246
00:18:31.781 --> 00:18:35.920
Robert Red of South Carolina,
uh,
James DB,
Dubbo,

247
00:18:35.921 --> 00:18:37.780
who published the dubose review,

248
00:18:37.781 --> 00:18:40.330
a very important southern magazine out of New Orleans.

249
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:45.820
It was a vision now of an independent southern nation.
In fact,

250
00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.410
Edmund Ruffin was so determined to try to,

251
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:53.750
to gather the spirit of an independent southern nation than in the wake of John

252
00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:56.321
Brown's raid.
He got,

253
00:18:56.321 --> 00:19:01.321
he got himself to Harper's ferry and managed to collect 15 or 20 of old John

254
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.100
Brown's pikes.
You know,

255
00:19:03.101 --> 00:19:07.270
these beer things the John Brown was going to give to slaves after his rebellion

256
00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:11.800
and Ruffin sent one of those pipes to the governor of every southern state.

257
00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:16.650
Well,
people were into symbolism.

258
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:24.330
No,
it's interesting that the sense of a southern ne nationalism,
if you like,

259
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.370
was born more,
I would argue,

260
00:19:26.371 --> 00:19:31.371
a fear of an enemy than it actually was at any kind of planned vision of an

261
00:19:32.701 --> 00:19:33.990
organized nation.

262
00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:35.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

263
00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:40.320
<v 0>As numerous brilliant scholars of southern nationalism from drew Faust,</v>

264
00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.760
the John mccartle and others have argued,

265
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:46.360
and I will come back to this in a couple of weeks,
uh,

266
00:19:46.361 --> 00:19:48.910
southern nation did come out of this confederacy,

267
00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:54.400
but it was born almost over night and not by a lot of longterm planning,

268
00:19:55.270 --> 00:20:00.010
it was born more and resentment and defensiveness of knowing what they were

269
00:20:00.011 --> 00:20:03.220
against and who their enemy might be.

270
00:20:03.221 --> 00:20:07.660
Then it was actually born of a thought out plan of what they were for.

271
00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.620
As also there was also a theory at root at the root of this kind of southern

272
00:20:18.621 --> 00:20:23.300
nationalist fledgling as it wasn't a succession crisis that it's right there in

273
00:20:23.301 --> 00:20:24.410
the succession debate.

274
00:20:24.411 --> 00:20:28.820
It's rooted in the shrinking south theory is rooted in the,
the,
the,

275
00:20:28.821 --> 00:20:30.830
the desire to preserve a slave society.

276
00:20:30.831 --> 00:20:35.831
But it's the idea that the south ultimate welfare wouldn't be better outside of

277
00:20:36.771 --> 00:20:37.970
the union than in

278
00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:44.640
requiring a certain thinking about how to create a new nation.

279
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:51.750
A possible explanation though I wouldn't hang too many hats on this one cause

280
00:20:52.091 --> 00:20:56.920
it's rather vague.
It used to have a lot of um,
um,

281
00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:00.070
purchase among historians.

282
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:06.130
There's what we might call agrarianism the agrarian thesis.
Uh,

283
00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:11.440
the idea of king cotton videology or king cotton diplomacy,

284
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:12.790
um,

285
00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:17.790
or put more deeply a kind of Jeffersonian yeoman idealism.

286
00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:25.170
This is the vague theory that succession was to protect and agrarian

287
00:21:25.271 --> 00:21:28.570
agricultural planter civilization

288
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:35.400
that the south was ultimately they like to think of themselves.

289
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:38.260
Even the leadership as,
um,

290
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:43.390
a people or a republic of farmers,
small farmers.

291
00:21:43.391 --> 00:21:48.280
Now,
the majority of them were small farmers.
The real south,
this argument was,

292
00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.680
was not in the slave owning masterclass,

293
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:58.440
but in the men of the soil protecting a way of life against all that ignoble go

294
00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:03.400
getter,
money grubbing,
Yankee individualism.

295
00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.980
There's something to this.

296
00:22:05.981 --> 00:22:10.390
You can find these arguments all over the succession debates as well.

297
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.220
Separate from those New Yorkers,
they're gonna take your wallet

298
00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:22.290
or is the same when you can hit a Yankee,

299
00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:25.860
you wouldn't hit you back,
but it would suit you.

300
00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:33.320
This kind of real vogue back in this interpretation back in the 1920s,
thirties,

301
00:22:33.321 --> 00:22:33.741
forties,

302
00:22:33.741 --> 00:22:38.510
even into the 1950s and beyond among the stories like frank [inaudible] and

303
00:22:38.511 --> 00:22:42.920
others.
Um,
and it,
and it's spirit,

304
00:22:42.921 --> 00:22:47.390
if you like,
is there in the confederate anthem,
not Dixie,

305
00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.020
but the other confederate anthem,
the Bonnie blue flag.

306
00:22:51.021 --> 00:22:53.720
You don't hear that as much,
but there's a,

307
00:22:53.721 --> 00:22:58.370
there's a verse in Bonnie Blue Flag that the soldier sang all the time.

308
00:22:58.371 --> 00:23:02.090
It goes like this and listen for its ironies.

309
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:06.560
We are a band of brothers native to the soil,

310
00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.680
fighting for the property.

311
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.590
We gained by honest toil

312
00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.410
who's honest,
toil,
property.

313
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:23.440
Well for a yeoman farmer,
that lyric

314
00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:28.780
make good sense.
And fifth,

315
00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:33.190
you can also argue this is the session is deeply rooted in some,

316
00:23:33.191 --> 00:23:38.020
some have argued this certainly Bertram Wyatt Brown has and others is rooted in

317
00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:42.910
um,
this notion of a tradition of southern honor.

318
00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:49.230
The thesis that at the heart of the southern planter class in particular,
uh,

319
00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.260
the,
at the heart of their cohesion,

320
00:23:51.261 --> 00:23:56.261
there's self understanding in their worldview was a set of values by which men,

321
00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:01.010
especially planters defined themselves and therefore their society.

322
00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.620
And once those values were threatened,

323
00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:07.340
they circled the wagons in defense.

324
00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.700
These were the manly virtues.
The argument went of honesty,

325
00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:17.360
trustworthiness and titled Social Rank,

326
00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:22.760
the willingness to defend one's honor,
blood lineage,

327
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:27.940
family and especially home or home land to defend one's community against not

328
00:24:31.731 --> 00:24:32.780
only invasion,

329
00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:36.830
but also insult or humiliation

330
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:43.930
to save face and the presence of one's critics,

331
00:24:44.541 --> 00:24:48.160
one's enemies,
nothing could be worse.

332
00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.020
They are said the honor code,

333
00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:56.740
then public humiliation disputes to the man of southern honor.

334
00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:02.150
We're personal,
not a matter of law.

335
00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:05.030
And there comes a time,
the argument went,

336
00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:10.070
what the hell were the supreme court to hell with compromises in Congress?

337
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.420
This is personal.
They said,

338
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:21.700
no,
this is,
this one's hard to throw darts at and make it stick.
A,

339
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:25.280
you can see the language in the succession movement.

340
00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:29.240
We must defend our honor.
We must defend our society.

341
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:34.750
When is the southern secessionists planter speaking from honor and when is he

342
00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:38.840
speaking from the preservation of the slave society and why is he speaking from

343
00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:43.620
his sense of agrarianism?
When is he speaking from a,
from a vision of a,
of a,

344
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:48.020
an independent southern national future is,
is never easy to know,

345
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:53.360
but you can hear it in a James Jones,
for example,

346
00:25:53.361 --> 00:25:57.290
a leading South Carolina secessionist in the South Carolina secession convention

347
00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:01.030
who got up at the end of the arguments and he said,
well folks,
quote,

348
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:06.590
if we fail,
we have saved our honor and lost nothing.

349
00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:13.980
I think of the logic there because he doesn't really know precisely at what

350
00:26:13.981 --> 00:26:14.621
they're going to fail.

351
00:26:14.621 --> 00:26:19.621
That if a whole civilization goes down and ashes,

352
00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:25.540
if a society will be
destroyed at its root,

353
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:30.583
you've lost nothing.

354
00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:37.720
Some of these same guys who were so caught up in defense of honor,

355
00:26:37.721 --> 00:26:39.550
of course loves Shakespeare.

356
00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.920
They especially love plays like the fourth

357
00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:52.410
on Prince Harry's watch during his soldiers to die with honor because if you die

358
00:26:54.281 --> 00:26:59.060
with honor,
you've lost nothing.
No.

359
00:26:59.061 --> 00:27:01.310
And your and more modern sensibilities.

360
00:27:01.311 --> 00:27:06.020
Life usually doesn't equate with nothing.

361
00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:08.863
<v 1>Okay.</v>

362
00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:13.890
<v 0>But Mix all those explanations up together and folding a little ambiguity and</v>

363
00:27:15.191 --> 00:27:16.920
you can begin to explain succession.

364
00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:22.250
A final parting word though.
Um,

365
00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:23.810
<v 1>yeah.</v>

366
00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:25.490
<v 0>Did the south of the right to secede.</v>

367
00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:32.710
That's just out of a show of hands that,
just to show it,
this is just a pole.

368
00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:37.960
Did the southern states have the right to succeed in 1861?

369
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:38.823
Yes.

370
00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:42.223
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

371
00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:45.130
<v 0>All right.
No</v>

372
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:48.390
bunch of Yankees.

373
00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:57.450
Not sure the people are honest because this is a constitutional theory that,

374
00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:01.720
uh,
is,
is very old and never ending.

375
00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:08.340
Not sure.
Down here on the front,
a teaching assistant is not sure.
So,

376
00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.370
and he's remaining not sure.

377
00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:14.810
David Houston is a prophet of ambiguity.

378
00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:16.693
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

379
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.720
<v 0>Got To watch him.
He Burns question marks on your front porch,
you know,</v>

380
00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:21.563
if you're not careful.

381
00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:26.923
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

382
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:32.030
<v 0>I usually save that Joe for Unitarians.
But anyway,
nevermind.</v>

383
00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:36.770
Okay.
Uh,
sorry.
Sorry.

384
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:37.733
<v 1>I know</v>

385
00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:46.570
<v 0>very quickly though,
in 1861,</v>

386
00:28:46.571 --> 00:28:48.820
of course people had to make huge decisions.

387
00:28:48.821 --> 00:28:53.821
You're not the least of which was Lincoln and his circle of Republican advisers.

388
00:28:55.511 --> 00:28:58.450
But Lincoln was very clear on this.

389
00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:02.800
We're going to come back on Thursday to this whole question of

390
00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.860
what Lincoln's policy was there.
An April,
1861,
and why he moved with,

391
00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:14.260
uh,
with some force against the south.
But first of all,

392
00:29:14.261 --> 00:29:16.770
Lincoln's view and the Nationalist Union,

393
00:29:16.771 --> 00:29:19.660
this view of succession was essentially this,

394
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:25.240
and you can read this closely and your Lincoln reader in many places,

395
00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:29.440
but it was basically that the union of the United States.

396
00:29:29.441 --> 00:29:33.500
So the argument was created by the people,
not the states.

397
00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:38.320
I know this gets a little bit like constitutional hair splitting,

398
00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.820
but a lot of hairs that were at stake.
So you had to split some of them.

399
00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:47.680
The union was created,
said this argument by the people,
not by the states.

400
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:52.420
The union was there for older than those states that agreed to join it

401
00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:58.630
in the American revolution and in the US Constitution,

402
00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.930
we the people in order to form a more perfect union,

403
00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:07.290
some union has argued meant succession really is not possible.

404
00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:13.440
There was the practical argument against the session or union cannot survive.

405
00:30:13.601 --> 00:30:16.780
The argument went,
if it can be broken,
it will.

406
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:22.420
Whenever someone gets upset,
I don't like this law and that law.

407
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:24.820
Oh,
I like these,
but I don't like those.

408
00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:27.460
I will know if I those and not participate.

409
00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:34.380
The argument is that's not a good practical way to run a republic.

410
00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:36.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

411
00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:41.040
<v 0>And some unionists in Lincoln was of course brilliant at this.
Eventually,</v>

412
00:30:41.041 --> 00:30:46.041
as you read his speeches would argue against the session from a position sort of

413
00:30:47.071 --> 00:30:50.760
of civil religion,
of almost mysticism.

414
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.150
What did Lincoln referred to at the end of that first inaugural?

415
00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:00.580
That magnificent phrase about the mystic chords of memory.

416
00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:06.370
I remember at battlefield and Patriot grave would yet swell the chorus of the

417
00:31:07.361 --> 00:31:12.310
union.
That's about music and memory.

418
00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:14.650
Not about the constitution.

419
00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:22.280
Unionists would invoke the fathers just like this.
The section as well of course,

420
00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:27.620
and those fathers of the Constitution and the American republic,
they would argue

421
00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:29.900
<v 1>were nationalist.</v>

422
00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:35.650
<v 0>They wanted a more perfect union out of a union that wasn't at all perfect</v>

423
00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:41.740
and sometimes they would even directly invoke chief justice John Marshall,

424
00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.230
the Virginians first,
Greg,

425
00:31:44.231 --> 00:31:49.231
Chief Justice Supreme Court for 25 30 years and the forging of that institution

426
00:31:49.631 --> 00:31:54.631
of the Supreme Court into a national institution of cohesion and a certain

427
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:57.543
power.

428
00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:06.440
No,
the state's riotous does.
The succession is to,
of course we'll argue.

429
00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:09.470
<v 1>No,
no.</v>

430
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:14.640
<v 0>They will say constitutionally the Union they will argue is a federal union</v>

431
00:32:15.581 --> 00:32:19.060
federal in the sense that it was a compact,

432
00:32:19.061 --> 00:32:23.740
a contract between its founders and the founders were the states.

433
00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:29.290
The chose to join it and they will argue that states voted

434
00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:35.530
in the continental congress.
States voted in an articles of confederation.

435
00:32:35.531 --> 00:32:40.390
States voted to approve the u s constitution or nuts.

436
00:32:40.391 --> 00:32:43.790
States voted to ratify the constitution and so on.

437
00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:49.040
Then they will do,
they will go to the reserve clause of the constitution.

438
00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:53.100
All powers,
not given to the federal government.
In,
in,
in the constitution,

439
00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:58.140
in Congress are quote reserved for the states,

440
00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:02.700
that beautiful,
wonderful,
tortured and

441
00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:05.760
ambiguous,

442
00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:10.560
but in some ways brilliant provision of the constitution.

443
00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:15.890
They will go to the language of experiment in republicanism.

444
00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.690
They will say the American republic has been an experiment.

445
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:23.850
It's been a fascinating,
wonderful,
you know,
world historical experiment.

446
00:33:23.851 --> 00:33:26.280
But you know what?
They'll say it's just failed.

447
00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:30.070
And let us show you the reasons why and the way,
and uh,

448
00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.810
let us go in peace.
It is our right,

449
00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:40.220
they will argue for the right of succession based on essentially the notion of a

450
00:33:42.781 --> 00:33:45.150
contractual theory of government

451
00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:51.240
and that a contract in this sense they will argue,
can

452
00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:55.860
<v 1>be broken.
Now</v>

453
00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.080
<v 0>as Alan Nevins once said,
succession though,</v>

454
00:33:59.081 --> 00:34:04.081
after all the constitutional historians and the lawyers have worked it through,

455
00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:07.733
<v 1>okay,</v>

456
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:13.410
<v 0>as a matter of power
and as Kevin said,</v>

457
00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:17.120
who has the most guns?

458
00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:18.163
<v 1>Okay,</v>

459
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:21.130
<v 0>I'll leave that hanging from mom.</v>

460
00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:24.260
We'll come back to succession and the wake Fort Sumpter and the beginning of the

461
00:34:24.261 --> 00:34:25.190
war on Thursday.

462
00:34:25.191 --> 00:34:29.870
But let me take you through a quick survey of what historians have done with

463
00:34:29.871 --> 00:34:31.550
this story over time.

464
00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:34.613
<v 1>Uh,</v>

465
00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:37.180
<v 0>I love this kind of stuff.</v>

466
00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:41.010
The historic graphical debates of his storage is probably why some of us become

467
00:34:41.011 --> 00:34:43.020
a storage.
We liked the arguments

468
00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:49.650
before at least states' rights though.
It's of course the theory.

469
00:34:49.651 --> 00:34:51.820
There's not going to at all die and the civil war,

470
00:34:51.821 --> 00:34:55.830
it's the session may have died.
Well maybe I'm never saying never.

471
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:58.740
Who knows Casa vote,

472
00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:03.750
just seceded from Serbia and Russia is making a big stink over it

473
00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.930
and on him.
And I was listening to a Canadian radio station last night.

474
00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:13.280
Don't ask me why,
but it's what comes on right after NPR goes off.

475
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.931
And the quarterback,

476
00:35:17.931 --> 00:35:22.931
coy and Quebec are using the cost of all model now to rev up once again the

477
00:35:23.931 --> 00:35:28.520
possibility of Quebec succession from Canada.
So watch out gotta follow this.

478
00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:33.113
<v 1>Okay.</v>

479
00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:37.210
<v 0>There's always threats after some of our elections,
somebody deciding sue,</v>

480
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.710
they want us to seed,
which usually means that it's want to move to New Zealand.

481
00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:44.370
But New Zealand has strong immigration laws,
so don't even think it

482
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:49.590
states rights is a theory.

483
00:35:49.591 --> 00:35:54.591
I'm going to argue a theory of the proper relations of the levels of government,

484
00:35:56.250 --> 00:36:00.750
how power is distributed between those levels of government.

485
00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.800
It is a theory of the nature of federalism,

486
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:11.060
but,
and I think this is the crucial point,
and you can argue this,

487
00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:15.110
we can argue this forever and we probably will if we're Americans,

488
00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:20.620
but I would argue that the significance of states' rights is always an

489
00:36:20.731 --> 00:36:24.470
everywhere in the cause to which it is employed.

490
00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:25.830
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

491
00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:26.930
<v 0>states' rights for what</v>

492
00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:33.820
a state's right to do what in the interest of what.

493
00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:35.810
<v 1>Okay.</v>

494
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:39.290
<v 0>Now throughout our history,
some things have happened first in steaks.</v>

495
00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:44.320
Women's suffrage happened in states first and then grew over time and to finally

496
00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:51.080
a federal right to vote for women.
There are many other cases.

497
00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:56.840
States' rights is not always the conservative or reactionary idea.

498
00:36:56.841 --> 00:37:01.841
It is sometimes a progressive idea when my believe in more local state control,

499
00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:07.410
but to what end?
For what purpose?
The advanced what issue cards,

500
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:11.090
what principle take.
Just make your list of issues.

501
00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:16.430
And where would you start first for stem cell research?

502
00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:23.420
For gay marriage,
for or against?

503
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.550
Where did the right begin

504
00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:30.620
school curriculums,

505
00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:38.680
right to vote,
women's economic rights,
reproductive freedom,

506
00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:42.340
collective bargaining for unions and on and on and on.

507
00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:48.540
Old Age pensions began in first in some states and the progressive here before

508
00:37:48.881 --> 00:37:51.790
we ever had a national social security,

509
00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:56.050
the civil war didn't eliminate the states' rights.

510
00:37:57.530 --> 00:38:00.580
It has this sloganeering power to,

511
00:38:00.581 --> 00:38:04.600
it never gets much analysis.
Well,
all right.

512
00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:10.120
Now somewhere on this outline,
I listed

513
00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:16.500
well in the wake of the civil war,

514
00:38:16.501 --> 00:38:21.501
of course in for that generation there were unionists and confederate blame

515
00:38:23.371 --> 00:38:25.410
laying interpretations of the war.

516
00:38:25.411 --> 00:38:29.430
It's a fascinating collection of writing and if a lot of it,

517
00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:34.050
many of it is score,
much of it is score settling.
Of course,

518
00:38:34.051 --> 00:38:36.490
it's vindication on the part of southerners.

519
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:39.190
It's the forging of this loss cause tradition.

520
00:38:39.191 --> 00:38:41.830
And I'll speak a lot more about that at the very end of the course.

521
00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:45.910
Cause the loss caused,
became an elaborate ideology over time,

522
00:38:45.911 --> 00:38:49.120
especially a racial ideology.
Um,

523
00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.340
a lot of the debate about among the generation that fought the war of,

524
00:38:53.341 --> 00:38:58.341
of what had caused it got all caught up in labeling was the war,

525
00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:59.980
the war of the rebellion,

526
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:05.400
which was the official northern federal definition and label of the war.

527
00:39:05.501 --> 00:39:08.740
This was not called the American civil war by the federal government.

528
00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.480
It was called the war of the rebellion.

529
00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:14.500
If you go out and look at civil war monuments on battlefields put up in the

530
00:39:14.501 --> 00:39:17.230
1880s and nineties it's called the war of the rebellion.

531
00:39:17.231 --> 00:39:21.810
If it's a union monument in the south,

532
00:39:21.811 --> 00:39:24.730
it was early called the war between the states.

533
00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.240
It was sometimes called the war for southern independence.

534
00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:33.780
It was sometimes called the war of northern aggression at sometimes is used now

535
00:39:33.971 --> 00:39:38.320
as a euphemism.
My favorite label,

536
00:39:38.321 --> 00:39:41.920
and it wasn't just southern,
but by the 1890s and turn of the 20th century,

537
00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:46.300
a label that got into the press and people love that as a throwaway joke line

538
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:49.870
was quote the late unpleasantness.

539
00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.130
You want to start dissolving conflict.

540
00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:58.510
We had some late unpleasantness here and slaughtered all these people,

541
00:39:58.511 --> 00:39:59.344
but nevermind.

542
00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:06.480
Now I'll pass on on examples of this union is in confederate tradition and

543
00:40:09.251 --> 00:40:12.490
perhaps we'll just revisit this at the end of the course cause that's perhaps

544
00:40:12.491 --> 00:40:17.140
where it belongs anyway.
But by the late 19th century,

545
00:40:17.141 --> 00:40:21.040
the 1890s to be exact in into the early 20th century,

546
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:24.670
one historian named James Ford Rhodes

547
00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:31.170
and it's kind of nationalist tradition in which he wrote had a tremendous impact

548
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:37.680
on the way the vast majority of Americans would come to understand civil war

549
00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:42.970
causation.
Rhodes was a gifted amateur.

550
00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:49.120
Um,
a gentleman scholar,
he was born in Cleveland,

551
00:40:49.121 --> 00:40:53.980
Ohio in 1848 so he was a boy and a teenager during the civil war,

552
00:40:53.981 --> 00:40:56.710
but too young do a fart.
But he grew up,

553
00:40:56.770 --> 00:41:01.770
helplessly fascinated with this event that forged his life,

554
00:41:02.621 --> 00:41:05.020
his world.
He's very wealthy.

555
00:41:05.021 --> 00:41:10.021
He retired to Beacon Hill in Boston in between 1893 in 1907,

556
00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:14.620
a 14 year period.
He published his seven volumes,

557
00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:20.170
a series called history of the United States from the compromise of 1850.

558
00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:23.230
They didn't worry about boring titles in the 19th century.

559
00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.200
That title would never fly through a publisher today.

560
00:41:26.201 --> 00:41:30.010
But that's what it was called,
seven volumes roads road.

561
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:35.860
Now on the one hand road said the civil war was caused,
he,
he,

562
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:38.330
he developed a sole cause theory and he said,
look,

563
00:41:38.331 --> 00:41:41.600
stole cars is slavery making a mistake.
It's slavery,

564
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:47.710
but it's what roads did with this that is really important and it is still alive

565
00:41:47.991 --> 00:41:50.090
and well in our culture and you can't kill it.

566
00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:56.600
He said the world was caused by slavery.
It was an irrepressible conflict,

567
00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:01.580
but he focused on slavery as a system.
I'm cotton and the cotton gin,

568
00:42:01.581 --> 00:42:06.581
not upon any moral element to the story of slavery and or abolition.

569
00:42:08.181 --> 00:42:12.950
Slavery was a national Kersey called it never a national crime.

570
00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:17.360
Slavery was a broad force,
almost like climate.

571
00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.150
It was almost like bad weather

572
00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:24.370
and no one is to blame for bad weather.

573
00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:26.010
<v 1>Okay.</v>

574
00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:31.010
<v 0>Southerners deserved and roads view sympathy and not censure slave holders,</v>

575
00:42:31.681 --> 00:42:35.550
he argues should be absolved because they were themselves,

576
00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:39.240
the victims of the system and therefore the victims of history.

577
00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:40.800
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

578
00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:41.980
<v 0>a tragic lot.</v>

579
00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:43.340
<v 1>Okay.</v>

580
00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:48.340
<v 0>Destined to try to preserve a civilization that the world was beginning to pass</v>

581
00:42:48.471 --> 00:42:49.304
by.

582
00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:55.730
He greatly admired antebellum southern society and civilization.

583
00:42:55.731 --> 00:42:59.850
And there's a certain,
a stallion roads as well.
Oh my God.

584
00:42:59.851 --> 00:43:04.020
What we lost in the great planters world.

585
00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:05.960
<v 1>Okay.</v>

586
00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:09.500
<v 0>He Rose Robert,
he lead or the status of national hero.</v>

587
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:10.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

588
00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:11.660
<v 0>He didn't do it alone.</v>

589
00:43:11.661 --> 00:43:14.750
There are a lot of people helping him and helping him with that by 1900.

590
00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:16.973
<v 1>Okay.</v>

591
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:21.200
<v 0>That's Robert E.
Lee who led the confederate armies to national hero.</v>

592
00:43:21.201 --> 00:43:22.460
I just thought I'd point that out.

593
00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:27.310
I was in Richmond two weeks ago giving a lecture.

594
00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:31.630
A woman came up afterward from New York or Boston,

595
00:43:31.631 --> 00:43:35.860
born and raised in the north and she has just moved to Richmond.

596
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:37.160
Uh,

597
00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:42.160
she's just full of enthusiasm and she's the cultural attache director or

598
00:43:43.501 --> 00:43:48.420
something for the city of Richmond now.
And I'm speaking about this new museum,

599
00:43:48.421 --> 00:43:50.790
about the civil war.
And she came up to me and she thought,

600
00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:53.460
I want to know what you think of my idea that I think the first thing we need to

601
00:43:53.461 --> 00:43:58.180
do in Richmond,
it's just turned on old confederate monument.
Yep.
That's it.

602
00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:03.970
Oh,
oh dear.
Oh dear.

603
00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:07.270
I,
I didn't even know what to tell her.
She just,
just,
just take,

604
00:44:07.271 --> 00:44:08.560
if you could just take down that Robert E.
Dot.

605
00:44:08.561 --> 00:44:11.560
Lee Statue and then that stonewall Jackson state.
Just take them down.

606
00:44:11.561 --> 00:44:15.330
Wouldn't everything be all right?
I went over in the bookstore,

607
00:44:15.331 --> 00:44:17.010
I got her a copy of race and reunion.

608
00:44:17.011 --> 00:44:20.970
This book I did on civil war memory and I said,
here,
here man,
just start here.

609
00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.640
According to James Ford Rhodes,
both sides at Fort ennobling,

610
00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:34.590
both sides at fort well,

611
00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:38.750
there was to be no blame.

612
00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:41.193
<v 1>Okay.</v>

613
00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:46.600
<v 0>In this historical verdict of seven volumes and something like 3000 and some</v>

614
00:44:46.641 --> 00:44:49.160
pages in roads is history.

615
00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:54.530
Now this put in place and I'll leave it there.

616
00:44:54.531 --> 00:44:57.000
A kind of nationalist reconciliation,

617
00:44:57.001 --> 00:45:02.001
just quasi scholarly popular historical tradition through which most other

618
00:45:05.871 --> 00:45:10.871
interpretations of the civil war causation would now have to pass or breathe or

619
00:45:13.971 --> 00:45:14.804
move.

620
00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:20.210
Then came Charles Beard and Mary Beard by the 1930s.
I'm early in the 20s.

621
00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:26.030
Uh,
how to sum up beard Charles Beard,

622
00:45:26.031 --> 00:45:29.010
the great progressive historian,
so called.

623
00:45:29.011 --> 00:45:33.680
And by that label we mean those historians who came of age around the turn of

624
00:45:33.681 --> 00:45:35.090
the 20th century,

625
00:45:35.091 --> 00:45:38.780
first decade or two of the 20th century,

626
00:45:38.781 --> 00:45:43.781
and we're still writing into the 1950s some of them even into the 60s they

627
00:45:44.211 --> 00:45:48.950
tended to see the world,
especially by the 1930s.

628
00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:50.923
Um,

629
00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:55.490
they tended to see the world through a frame of the Great Depression

630
00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:02.020
while the frame of World War One and then a frame of the crash of 29 and the

631
00:46:03.081 --> 00:46:05.100
worldwide Great Depression of the 30s.

632
00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:09.830
They tended to see history as essentially a story of economics,

633
00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:15.400
essentially a story of capital and labor of wealth as an engine or the pursuit

634
00:46:19.851 --> 00:46:22.850
of it as an engine of history.

635
00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:26.870
Charles Beard wrote a great book in many ways.

636
00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.440
We now can look at it and see all kinds of holes in it.

637
00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:34.040
A book call the economic interpretation of the American civil war.

638
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000
He saw the south and the north is essentially two economies to civilizations,

639
00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:43.320
to economies.

640
00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:47.580
There are rarely any people and I'll spirits work.

641
00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:52.920
There are economies does or other systems.
There are economic forces.

642
00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:56.670
There's cotton and free labor.

643
00:46:56.970 --> 00:47:00.420
There's shipping and merchants in the north and their planters in the south.

644
00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:03.840
There's the telegraph spreading across the north.

645
00:47:03.841 --> 00:47:06.870
There are canals and there were railroads

646
00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:12.240
and in his interpretation,

647
00:47:12.241 --> 00:47:17.241
the south rebelled to try to preserve its economic way of life

648
00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:25.500
and ultimately the civil war and beards view wasn't really about any particular

649
00:47:26.441 --> 00:47:29.860
ideology,
but that is any,

650
00:47:29.861 --> 00:47:34.150
any racial ideology or any pro slavery or antislavery ideology.

651
00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:38.920
It was two economic systems living together in the same society,

652
00:47:38.921 --> 00:47:43.921
the same nation and coming into conflict with one another in unsolvable ways.

653
00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:50.650
Forces meeting at a crossroads and they had the clash.

654
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:53.920
Beard is laden with inevitability

655
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:55.970
<v 1>as</v>

656
00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:58.010
<v 0>any great economic determinist</v>

657
00:47:58.350 --> 00:47:59.350
<v 1>usually is.</v>

658
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:02.940
<v 0>He called the American civil war,</v>

659
00:48:02.941 --> 00:48:07.050
famously the second American revolution,

660
00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:13.040
but by that he didn't mean what Bruce Levine and Eric Foner and other many other

661
00:48:14.101 --> 00:48:16.530
historians of,
well,

662
00:48:16.531 --> 00:48:20.970
my generation and the generation before have called it when we've called it a

663
00:48:20.971 --> 00:48:24.960
second American revolution would beard meant by that is the kind of great

664
00:48:24.961 --> 00:48:29.961
dividing line between an agricultural era and an industrial era.

665
00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:39.490
All right,
my clock says,
I'm running out of time.

666
00:48:39.491 --> 00:48:44.491
I'm going to leave you hanging on this limb of wondering what the needless wars

667
00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:45.700
school people arguing.

668
00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:50.710
<v 1>They thought it was needless actually,</v>

669
00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:59.430
<v 0>but I want to end with this as a lead into Thursday.</v>

670
00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.640
Walt Whitman wrote a poem about this year.

671
00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:09.810
He called at 1861 and here are just a few lines of it to give you a sense.

672
00:49:11.411 --> 00:49:16.180
I think Whitman has no one else could captured what was in the heads of

673
00:49:16.181 --> 00:49:17.740
northerners and southerners

674
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:23.960
armed year years,
the struggle,

675
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:28.580
no dainty rhymes or sentimental love versus for you.
Oh,

676
00:49:28.581 --> 00:49:31.110
terrible year,
not us,

677
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:34.490
some pale poet link seated at a desk.

678
00:49:34.491 --> 00:49:39.320
Lisping cadenzas piano,
but as a strong man,
erect,

679
00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:42.680
clothed in blue clothes,
advancing,

680
00:49:42.681 --> 00:49:47.681
carrying a rifle on your shoulder with weld gristle body and sunburnt face and

681
00:49:48.681 --> 00:49:52.070
hands with a knife in the belt that your side,

682
00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:54.590
as I heard you shouting loud,

683
00:49:54.591 --> 00:49:59.591
your son or his voice ringing across the continent year that suddenly saying,

684
00:50:02.001 --> 00:50:04.730
by the miles of the round lipped cannon,

685
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:10.100
I repeat you hurrying crashing.
Sad,

686
00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:12.530
distracted.
You

687
00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:16.730
<v 1>see you Thursday.</v>
