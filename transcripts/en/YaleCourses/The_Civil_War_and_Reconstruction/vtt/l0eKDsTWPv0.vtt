00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:04.840
Today,
we're going to take up a question and it has been for the past,

2
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.350
well nearly 20 years,

3
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.430
probably the most active

4
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.590
to many of the most stimulating aspect of civil war scholarship.

5
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.760
How did the civil war affects civilians?

6
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.430
What were the social impacts of such a massive experience?

7
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.060
How could you mobilize societies on this scale

8
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.200
without profoundly changing people?

9
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.960
What did it do to gender relation?
What did it do with the meaning of race?

10
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.300
We've already begun to deal with that question is some in some depth how this

11
00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:52.020
war would transform the constitution transform American political culture

12
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:56.250
transformed the lives of African Americans and more on that in time,

13
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.240
but of course social history one,
the revolution in American history,

14
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.581
oh,

15
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:07.530
somewhere back in the 70s and eighties everybody wanted to be a social

16
00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:08.364
historian.

17
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.790
When I arrived at Amherst college circa 1989 to teach,

18
00:01:13.791 --> 00:01:14.960
there was something in the,

19
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.980
what was known as the Pioneer Valley of the five college consortium,

20
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.340
a social history working group,

21
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.090
and I remember asking,
can you give a paper if it's not social history?

22
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.480
And the answer was sure.

23
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.200
Social History one sort of methodological struggle over how to do history.

24
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.400
What is the meaning of the past and you all know that by now whether you think

25
00:01:48.401 --> 00:01:50.230
about it that much or not.

26
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.520
Social history brought us the history of women.

27
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.680
It brought us a revolution in scholarship in the study of African Americans.

28
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.980
It brought us a revolution in the study of class.

29
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.730
It taught us how to study social groups in historical time.

30
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.930
It's taught us how to study ordinary people

31
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.570
and then I'll get off of this historic graphical high horse.

32
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.310
It's remarkable how much civil war historians focused as they were so much on an

33
00:02:23.951 --> 00:02:28.750
event focused so much as they were so often for generations.

34
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.870
As many put it on headquarters,

35
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.500
the headquarters of generals and a thousand's of dispatchers they wrote because

36
00:02:38.501 --> 00:02:42.990
those were the sources or the headquarters of the government.
The president

37
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.490
commander of the army's focus so much on an event from headquarters.

38
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.420
A social historian came along in 1989 he wrote a brow is relatively short little

39
00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:02.710
essay and the Journal of American history that became the title essay of a book

40
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:05.440
of essays.
It came out of your later,

41
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.700
it was by Maris vin off Skus,
a numbers crunching,

42
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:14.701
hard boiled social historian who use star og if you can't count it in history.

43
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.100
He wrote a little less,
they said,

44
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.470
have social historians lost the civil war is answering course was yes,

45
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.210
and he showed very carefully by looking at a few New England towns,

46
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.080
that old tradition of studying in Microcosm New England towns,

47
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:36.190
which colonial American here's had been doing for a generation or two.

48
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.600
He showed that there are all these towns all over New England,

49
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.390
small and relatively large.

50
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.890
There's a lost half of their men between the ages of 18 and 45 and four years of

51
00:03:52.071 --> 00:03:52.904
war

52
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.790
and went to some local records and he discovered some of those towns have lost

53
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.330
60% of their male population.

54
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:03.803
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

55
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.700
<v 0>He looked a little closer and he saw that the whole idea of occupations in those</v>

56
00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:11.470
towns get completely redefined,

57
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:14.350
at least during the war years because the men were all gone.

58
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.110
<v 1>Okay.</v>

59
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:21.110
<v 0>You started to count widow and count orphans and by God you could count these</v>

60
00:04:21.111 --> 00:04:24.200
things.
You could measure how many widows were there in Newburyport,

61
00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:28.880
Massachusetts,
how many widows were there in Bangor,

62
00:04:28.881 --> 00:04:31.890
Maine.
You could count it.

63
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.510
It stimulated a small revolution in scholarship and it runs on a Beta as we

64
00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:44.931
speak and in some ways the most important kind of history done on it.

65
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.060
There's two kinds.
It's the kind of new women's history.

66
00:04:49.061 --> 00:04:53.890
You're reading a drew Faust book,
mothers of Invention,
wonderful title.

67
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.000
I don't know if any of you remember the old song by that title.

68
00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:02.960
The fourth thing and about,
there's an irony in there somewhere.
At any rate,

69
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.490
you get a book like drew foes,

70
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.860
which stands on the shoulders of other books like it,

71
00:05:06.861 --> 00:05:10.250
but a book that went and read thousands of women,

72
00:05:10.251 --> 00:05:15.251
southern women's letters and diaries to try to understand how did this war

73
00:05:15.951 --> 00:05:17.540
affects southern white women

74
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.220
and she has many answers to that,

75
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:26.670
including the somewhat bold argument at the end of that book that it was women

76
00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:28.384
in part,

77
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.880
an argument has been tested by other scholars and and even backed off from a bit

78
00:05:33.881 --> 00:05:37.570
by drew herself.
But she ends the book,

79
00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:42.571
at least with this suggestion that the sheer weight of the burdens of the war on

80
00:05:43.271 --> 00:05:47.620
southern white women and the thousands upon thousands of letters were in which

81
00:05:47.621 --> 00:05:50.980
they express that to their mates,
their husbands,
their brothers,

82
00:05:50.981 --> 00:05:52.120
their sons at the front,

83
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.870
<v 1>okay.</v>

84
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.870
<v 0>That it was in part southern white women that made south give up the war.</v>

85
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.970
Any other part of that social ministry revolution has been,

86
00:06:05.971 --> 00:06:10.650
of course among military historians themselves who discovered ways,

87
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.450
the ways it always been there.

88
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.790
And there were pioneering works on this as early as the 1950s by a scholar
named,

89
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.990
um,
Bell Wiley who wrote two thick volumes,

90
00:06:21.991 --> 00:06:24.300
one in 1954 or 55,

91
00:06:24.301 --> 00:06:28.800
one entitled Billy Yank and the other entitled Johnny Reb.
And Lo and behold,

92
00:06:28.801 --> 00:06:32.550
what that was,
is the beginning of a tradition of studying the common soldier,

93
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.160
his experiences,
his terrors,
his horrors,

94
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.950
his stomach problems is dysentery.

95
00:06:40.951 --> 00:06:45.951
His disease is death and above all influenced greatly by the field of psychology

96
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.200
and influenced greatly by the rise of gender history.

97
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.620
<v 1>Okay.</v>

98
00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.030
<v 0>Male military historians went to those common soldiers and began to study their</v>

99
00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:05.440
values,
their idea,
their sense of manhood,

100
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.910
their sense of the idea of courage and what that meant.

101
00:07:09.911 --> 00:07:14.911
And the 1860s and a mid Victorian society like the United States and one nuts

102
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:21.400
set of values by which men,
young and old,
defined themselves as men,

103
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.460
collided with modern total war.
What did it do to them?

104
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.080
And of course they being the male military historians of the 1980s nineties were

105
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:37.530
themselves greatly affected by the experience of the Vietnam War.

106
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.790
Now would that little bit in mind,

107
00:07:42.791 --> 00:07:47.791
let me suggest something that is timeless about this question of the social

108
00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:50.170
impact of war.

109
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.930
And then I'll get on to the substance of how the war affected southern society,

110
00:07:55.931 --> 00:07:56.970
northern society.

111
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.473
The like

112
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:09.020
is there excerpts from letters from a soldier in Iraq?

113
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.460
His name is Juan Campos.
They're actually emails.

114
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.640
One was 27 years old.

115
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:22.130
He wrote this to his wife on December 12th,
2006.
Hey,

116
00:08:22.131 --> 00:08:25.850
beautiful.
While we were on blackout again,

117
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.430
we lost yet some more soldiers.
Uh,

118
00:08:28.431 --> 00:08:32.840
can't wait to get out of this place and returned to you where I belong.

119
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:36.260
I don't know how much more of this place I can take.

120
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.590
I try to be hard and brave for my guys,

121
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:44.150
but I don't know how long I can keep up.
Excuse me.

122
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.510
You know,
it's like every time we go out,

123
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.830
anytime bump or sounds freak me out.

124
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:57.420
Maybe I'm just stressing.
Oh,
hopefully it'll get over.

125
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:02.970
You know,
you never think that anything is or can happen to you.

126
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:08.360
At first you feel invincible and then a little by little things start to wear on

127
00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:09.774
you.

128
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:15.710
That letter goes on and on ends of course would tell his eight year old son,

129
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:21.930
hello,
Tuesday,
October three,
2006 mood gloomy.

130
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.500
The life of an intern tree men is never safe.

131
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.500
How do I know I live in every day?

132
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:33.030
I lost a good friend of mine just two days ago to an enemy sniper.

133
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:38.490
The worst feeling in the world is having lost one of your own and not being able

134
00:09:38.491 --> 00:09:42.390
to fight back.
The more I go on patrol or more alert,

135
00:09:42.391 --> 00:09:46.500
I tend to be a,
regardless of the situation here in Iraq,

136
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.170
is that we are never safe.

137
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:53.900
No matter the counter measures we take to prevent any attacks,

138
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:59.270
they seem to seep through the crimes every day of soldiers lost or wounded by

139
00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:01.830
enemy attacks.
I for one,

140
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.610
would like to make it home to my family one day.

141
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.530
Pray for us,

142
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:13.100
keep us in your thoughts for an infantry man's life is never safe.

143
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:20.960
December 15 2006 my only goals are to make it out of this place alive and return

144
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.530
to you guys and make you as happy as I can.

145
00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:35.800
Sergeant compost was killed in the spring of 2007 by an eye.

146
00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:37.360
You d.

147
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:45.270
This is a letter from the front.
Uh,

148
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:50.260
Charles Heard Charles Brewster dated May 15th,
1864.

149
00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:55.660
There's a timelessness to what soldiers right from war and there's a

150
00:10:55.661 --> 00:10:58.540
timelessness to its social impact.

151
00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:04.330
Brewster's you may remember me telling you,
was that soldier from Massachusetts,

152
00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.290
lonely and confused,
feeling worthless.

153
00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:13.840
Join the Union army and the 10th of Massachusetts in April of 1861 and served

154
00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:16.810
out the entire war,
managed to survive.

155
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.620
I wrote 260 quite incredible letters.

156
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.220
This is the middle of the Spotsylvania campaign,

157
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:29.640
arguably the worst constant daily trench warfare of the civil war.

158
00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.840
He's the adjutant of his regimen and therefore he has to record all of the

159
00:11:34.841 --> 00:11:35.830
casualties

160
00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.440
sergeant compos describing in his war,

161
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.030
sort of worn a day.

162
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.880
But this was war that was killing people by the dozens.

163
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.880
He sends his latest report.
Uh,

164
00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.840
our regimen suffered terribly in the fight the other day,

165
00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.600
losing six officers wounded in eight men killed,

166
00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:05.430
but 34 wounded that we know of besides probably a good many that we do not know

167
00:12:05.431 --> 00:12:08.880
of.
And from 12 to 20 taken prisoners,

168
00:12:08.881 --> 00:12:13.881
this makes a grand total of 13 officers killed and wounded and 24 men killed 135

169
00:12:15.211 --> 00:12:16.680
146 missing,

170
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.520
making 218 officers and men in 12 days.

171
00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:25.830
The regimen is reduced to 150 muskets.
At this rate.

172
00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:31.430
There will be none of us left to ever see Richmond.
Their regimen would,

173
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:31.951
by the way,

174
00:12:31.951 --> 00:12:36.951
within about a week and a half of that be mustered out cause they had

175
00:12:37.111 --> 00:12:39.750
insufficient men to serve.

176
00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:45.450
But he ends this letter with what he describes as the most terrible side he ever

177
00:12:45.451 --> 00:12:50.451
saw were encamped on a splendid plantation and the corn and the wheat is growing

178
00:12:50.611 --> 00:12:53.160
finally or rather was before we came,

179
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:58.940
but I am afraid the crops will be very small this year down here we have not

180
00:12:59.191 --> 00:13:03.930
seen our wagons since we started and I'm getting sadly dilapidated.

181
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.200
My rears entirely unprotected.

182
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:12.120
I have worn the seat of my pants and drawers entirely off.

183
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:18.510
Most terrible side I ever saw was the rebel side of the breast work we fought

184
00:13:18.511 --> 00:13:19.980
over the other day.

185
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:25.850
There was one point on the ridge where the storm of bullets never seized for 24

186
00:13:26.071 --> 00:13:31.071
hours and the dead were piled and heaps upon heaps and the wounded men were

187
00:13:31.531 --> 00:13:36.531
intermixed with the dead held fast by their dead companions who fell upon them

188
00:13:38.131 --> 00:13:41.910
continually adding to the ghastly pile of men.

189
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.250
The breast works.

190
00:13:44.251 --> 00:13:48.360
We're on the edge of a heavy oak woods and large trees,

191
00:13:48.361 --> 00:13:53.361
18 inches or more in diameter were worn and cut completely off by the storm of

192
00:13:53.821 --> 00:13:57.570
bullets and fell upon the dead and wounded rebels.

193
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:03.440
Those that lay upon our side in the night when the trees fell said that they're

194
00:14:03.691 --> 00:14:08.280
howling were awful when these trees came down upon them.

195
00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.860
When I looked over in the morning,

196
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:16.640
there was one rebel sat up praying at the top of his lungs and others were

197
00:14:17.701 --> 00:14:19.350
jibberish and insanity.

198
00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:24.900
Others were groaning and whining at the greatest rate all during the whole of
it.

199
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:31.190
I did not hear one of our wounded men make any fuss other than once in a while.

200
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.530
One would sing out,

201
00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.790
<v 1>oh when he was hit,</v>

202
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:41.710
<v 0>but it is a terrible,
terrible,</v>

203
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:46.800
terrible three terribles business to make the best of this.

204
00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:52.493
Oh,

205
00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.420
it doesn't really matter what war you're talking about.

206
00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:05.320
Charlie Brewster's descriptions could have been along the psalm and World War

207
00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:05.681
One.

208
00:15:05.681 --> 00:15:09.820
They could have been somewhere in the battle of the bulge of the Second World

209
00:15:09.821 --> 00:15:10.654
War.

210
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:15.710
They could have come from donning and he could have come from the north of

211
00:15:15.761 --> 00:15:17.650
Baghdad,
as it always says,

212
00:15:17.651 --> 00:15:21.640
or near by zero or outside.
Mozel.

213
00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.240
So what is tragedy?

214
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.410
What is tragedy in relation to war?

215
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:35.380
How do we understand tragedy through this prism of the social impact of war?

216
00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:40.990
I think you only ultimately really do understand it by leaving headquarters,

217
00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:43.210
by leaving the generals dispatches,

218
00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:48.480
by leaving even Abraham Lincoln's magnificent pros and turn to see it through

219
00:15:48.581 --> 00:15:53.200
ordinary I ordinary women,
ordinary men,

220
00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.121
tragedies.

221
00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:59.800
One of those words that we especially Americans tend to use haphazardly.

222
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:04.660
It's a pet peeve of mine,
but it's probably just my problem.

223
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:10.570
Um,
every plane crash is a tragedy.
A car accident is a tragedy.

224
00:16:10.571 --> 00:16:13.150
We stub our toes and we call it tragic.

225
00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:18.340
A tragedy is something we ought to see through the book of job.

226
00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:23.620
We ought to see it through Shakespeare's character.
We ought to see it.

227
00:16:23.621 --> 00:16:27.670
We ought to go back at least as far as your [inaudible] and the Trojan women.

228
00:16:27.671 --> 00:16:30.730
What does Hecuba doing in the Trojan women,

229
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
but sit in a ghastly scene of an utterly destroyed city.

230
00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:41.410
All of her men are dead and she sits whaling to the sky on a stone crying.

231
00:16:41.411 --> 00:16:44.530
How can this be?
That's tragedy.

232
00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:52.780
We should see tragedy through Hecuba are all those women and drew Faust book.

233
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:55.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

234
00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.620
<v 0>Tragedy can be raw.
It can be pointless.</v>

235
00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.900
It can be utterly unbearable.

236
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.830
It can be a dead end with no exit.

237
00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:12.490
Sometimes it is just seemingly faded horror,

238
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:19.590
but sometimes tragedy throughout its literary history and therefore how we tend

239
00:17:21.581 --> 00:17:25.750
to use it.
Tragedy can also be affirmative.

240
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:32.100
It can even be Cathartic and we sometimes can find ways to make it redemptive.

241
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:37.380
<v 1>Okay?</v>

242
00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.920
<v 0>It should never be treated with triumphalism.</v>

243
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.450
It requires certain mood.

244
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.900
Rebecca Harding Davis,

245
00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.590
a wonderful American writer who experienced the war,

246
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.310
left us this coin,

247
00:17:56.311 --> 00:18:01.311
amazing little description of what I would call a a simple picture

248
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:06.510
of tragedy.

249
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.420
She was in a tiny Pennsylvania town,

250
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.811
doesn't have a name.

251
00:18:14.811 --> 00:18:19.811
It is 1864 and she describes a scene she witnessed at a train station.

252
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:24.583
I quote her,

253
00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:30.860
nobody was insight but a poor thin country girl and a faded Calico gown and

254
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.990
sunbonnet.
She's still alone on the platform waiting.

255
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:41.820
The child was playing beside her.
When we stopped,

256
00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:44.850
the men took out from a freight car.

257
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:49.860
Davis was on the train for give me
the men,

258
00:18:49.861 --> 00:18:52.020
took out from a freight car,

259
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.340
are rough on plain pine box and laid it down,

260
00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.430
burying their heads for a moment.

261
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.820
Then the train steamed away.

262
00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:09.050
She sat down on the ground and put her arms around the box and leaned her head

263
00:19:10.381 --> 00:19:14.580
on it.
The child,
when I'm playing,

264
00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:25.480
we don't know her name.
We don't even know what town.

265
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:43.150
Between 1862 and 1863 life insurance policies in America doubled,

266
00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:50.540
or the purchase of life insurance policies doubled

267
00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:57.550
between 1861 in 1865 only two books were published in the United States on

268
00:20:00.021 --> 00:20:05.021
anything resembling the idea of the afterlife during the war as utterly consumed

269
00:20:07.671 --> 00:20:09.710
as Americans became with death.

270
00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.300
They weren't writing yet about heaven.

271
00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:20.790
Between 1865 and 1876 no less than 80 books were published on the idea of

272
00:20:23.461 --> 00:20:25.980
afterlife of a heaven.

273
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:31.290
Americans as never before.
We're trying to invent a heaven

274
00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:39.020
and the best selling book in the United States in 1868 and it was for a few

275
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.810
years after.
It was a book by Elizabeth Phelps called the gates of jar.

276
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.600
It's bizarre,

277
00:20:48.601 --> 00:20:53.601
but fascinating book about what heaven actually is and what it looks like and

278
00:20:53.701 --> 00:20:56.890
what you do when you get there and the compartments it has and the rooms that

279
00:20:56.891 --> 00:21:00.420
has and who you'll see,
especially all those dead soldiers.

280
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.460
Gates a jar was a massive bestseller,
rival uncle Tom's cabin,

281
00:21:05.461 --> 00:21:06.420
at least for the first time.

282
00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:07.383
<v 1>You</v>

283
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.890
<v 0>all right,
I'm gonna leave you there for the moment.</v>

284
00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:18.900
And one should never use the New York Times.

285
00:21:18.901 --> 00:21:22.380
The first draft of history is historical source,
but I just did it.

286
00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.250
So anyway,
um,
gosh,

287
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:33.063
<v 1>yeah,</v>

288
00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.780
<v 0>the civil war as social history,
while the people who really,</v>

289
00:21:37.781 --> 00:21:41.650
really started this of course were Charles and Mary Beard,

290
00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:44.740
uh,
writing back in the 1920s.

291
00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.490
It was Charles and Mary Beard and their economic interpretation of this,

292
00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.010
or in their famous book,
their big book,

293
00:21:51.011 --> 00:21:55.480
the rise of American civilization who said this,
and this is the challenge.

294
00:21:55.481 --> 00:22:00.481
In some ways to all those who would refocus from the event itself onto the

295
00:22:00.851 --> 00:22:05.290
social process or under ordinary people experiencing the event.
The civil war,

296
00:22:05.291 --> 00:22:09.010
the beards road I quote,
was a social war.

297
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:10.660
<v 1>Okay.</v>

298
00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:15.160
<v 0>Ending in the unquestioned establishment of a new power in the government,</v>

299
00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:20.710
making vast changes in the arrangement of classes and the accumulation and

300
00:22:20.711 --> 00:22:24.190
distribution of wealth.
In the course of industrial development,

301
00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:29.820
the war was a social cataclysm in which the capitalist laborers and farmers of

302
00:22:32.831 --> 00:22:37.180
the north and west drove from power in the national government,

303
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.300
the planting aristocracy of the south.

304
00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:46.000
That's a fairly clear interpretation or judgment

305
00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:48.880
the beards went on.

306
00:22:48.881 --> 00:22:53.881
Then in the next paragraph actually to call it the second American revolution,

307
00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.630
and I quote,
beard in a strict sense,
he,

308
00:22:58.631 --> 00:23:02.020
they said the first American revolution,

309
00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:08.850
the beards revolution and the civil war was a social economic revolution

310
00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:16.050
and they made an elaborate argument for how this war transformed the economy,

311
00:23:16.691 --> 00:23:21.010
transformed the nature of the government and transformed forever the

312
00:23:21.011 --> 00:23:24.010
relationship of labor and capital,

313
00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:29.700
but was the civil war ultimately a victory for big business over the agrarian

314
00:23:31.001 --> 00:23:35.620
south?
It's been a question we've debated over and over and over and over.

315
00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.920
We stopped debating it for quite a while.
Frankly,

316
00:23:38.921 --> 00:23:43.090
that debate seemed like an old fossil when I was in graduate school.

317
00:23:43.091 --> 00:23:45.320
Nobody wanted to be a beardie in anymore.

318
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.600
We were all going to be cultural social historian,

319
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.590
but it's very interesting how the debate has come back.

320
00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:55.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

321
00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:59.480
<v 0>Was the civil war largely a clash of economic forces?</v>

322
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.110
Dustin Dover with one four so either you know,

323
00:24:03.111 --> 00:24:06.170
free labor or slave labor going to overwhelm the other,

324
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:11.080
the beards and the rise of American civilization and it's 500 odd pages.

325
00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.670
Almost never mentioned the word slavery.

326
00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:15.120
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

327
00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:20.120
<v 0>to the beards economic forces where these inanimate forces in the world,</v>

328
00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.250
they kind of operated on their own.

329
00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:26.850
It wasn't that much human agency.

330
00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:29.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

331
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:33.720
<v 0>Did the civil war explode industrial growth or did it actually slow it?</v>

332
00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:36.500
You can get arguments on both sides.

333
00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:42.880
The best research now shows us that the war itself was not necessarily the

334
00:24:44.301 --> 00:24:49.301
single most important engine of America's great industrial expansion or the

335
00:24:49.731 --> 00:24:54.110
birth of the American industrial revolution.
Well,
plenty of scholarship.

336
00:24:54.111 --> 00:24:58.850
Now that shows us that that revolution is much older than the civil war,

337
00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:04.190
that the real launching pad of American industrialization or the launching

338
00:25:04.191 --> 00:25:06.620
period,
if you want to find it,

339
00:25:06.621 --> 00:25:10.820
you got to go back at least to the 1830s and probably the 1820s

340
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:15.080
you can begin to measure this

341
00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:20.690
GNP in the United States,
which I guess we called GDP now,
don't wait.

342
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:24.500
Is that right?
And it used to be g n is GDP.

343
00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:30.970
Gross Domestic Product was about 1.6 2 billion in 1840 it was about 2.4 billion

344
00:25:34.341 --> 00:25:39.341
in 1850 and the eve of the civil war in 1860 it was about 4.1 billion.

345
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:47.110
So GDP had more than tripled from 1840 1860 that shows us that there's an

346
00:25:49.671 --> 00:25:51.290
industrial revolution already happening.

347
00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:56.360
There were 9,000 railroad miles in 1850 in the United States.

348
00:25:56.361 --> 00:26:01.361
There were 20 1018 60 the 1850s it was a great launching decade of

349
00:26:01.821 --> 00:26:06.000
industrialization.
Now,

350
00:26:06.001 --> 00:26:08.080
I'm going to give you a counter argument to that in just a minute,

351
00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:13.360
but there are two economists named Claudia Golden and Frank Lewis who have

352
00:26:14.741 --> 00:26:19.741
estimated estimated the actual price of the American civil war.

353
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:21.820
They put a price tag on it.

354
00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:28.920
The cost of lives lost and have wounds that reduced productivity.

355
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:31.570
These are there variables in their factors.

356
00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:36.930
Cost of lives lost in wounds that reduced productivity as well as property

357
00:26:37.121 --> 00:26:42.070
destroyed and factoring in government expenditures to fight the war,

358
00:26:42.071 --> 00:26:45.210
which were humongous state.
Some of them in a moment,

359
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:50.930
golden and Louis concluded that the overall cost of war was about six and a half

360
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.960
billion dollars to fight it and today's dollars,

361
00:26:57.961 --> 00:27:02.961
that would be about 145 to $150 billion today to fight the four years of the

362
00:27:06.781 --> 00:27:07.614
civil war.

363
00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:14.910
This amount would have allowed the Fed.
This is,
this is golden and Lewis.

364
00:27:14.911 --> 00:27:15.800
His argument,
by the way,

365
00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:20.260
it's what economists can do with history if they so wish this amount would have

366
00:27:20.261 --> 00:27:23.500
allowed the federal government that 145 250 billion,

367
00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:29.320
it would have allowed the federal government to purchase and free all 4 million

368
00:27:29.321 --> 00:27:31.750
slaves in 1860 at market prices,

369
00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:36.450
give each family 40 acres and a mule and still laid ahead,

370
00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:41.410
three and a half billion dollars leftover for reparations for former slaves.

371
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:47.380
That's golden and Lewis,
his argument I noticed,

372
00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:50.200
I noticed it didn't get much of a rise out of you,

373
00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:52.893
<v 1>but</v>

374
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:54.270
<v 0>it's an interesting set of numbers.</v>

375
00:27:56.070 --> 00:28:00.540
History of course intruded during the war years,
the war,

376
00:28:00.541 --> 00:28:04.290
retarded economic growth in some sectors,

377
00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:06.120
but in the long run,

378
00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:11.550
especially in northern cities and towns and especially with the mass

379
00:28:11.551 --> 00:28:14.520
mobilization now stimulated by the federal government

380
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:20.370
or expand the economy like nothing ever had before so fast.

381
00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:25.410
It just depended on where you lived.
But stop for just a moment.

382
00:28:25.411 --> 00:28:30.090
Now with all these measures are numbers in your head.

383
00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:33.300
If you can and just ask for a moment,

384
00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:39.120
what can social history measure and what can it not measure?

385
00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:43.590
It can measure very important things and I'm going to give you some more numbers

386
00:28:43.591 --> 00:28:44.410
in a minute.

387
00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:45.243
<v 1>Okay.</v>

388
00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:51.850
<v 0>Social history can measure demographic change.
It can measure death,</v>

389
00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.990
disease and casualty rates.
It can measure industrial production,

390
00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:59.860
it can measure lots of civilian pursuits.

391
00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.900
It can measure the number of women who enter the workforce.

392
00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:10.390
It can measure government expenditures that can measure budgets.

393
00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:18.600
It can even measure the basic social impact on a town I locality a community

394
00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:25.930
and we now have a number of these wonderful micro histories of southern towns in

395
00:29:25.931 --> 00:29:28.960
northern towns,
Midwest and so on during the war.

396
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:33.100
But how do you measure other social factors?

397
00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:37.450
And this is one of those questions that makes history endlessly

398
00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:43.420
necessary,
useful,
interesting tracks,

399
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:46.840
some of us fools to live with it forever.

400
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:51.850
How do you measure despair?
How do you measure loneliness?

401
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.720
How do you measure the dislocation and fear of widows?

402
00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:00.460
How do you measure the suffering of soldiers from wounds and disease?

403
00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:04.120
How do you measure the loss of a sense of home,

404
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:09.880
of dislocated worlds?
How do you measure nationalism?

405
00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:12.640
Patriotism.

406
00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:18.580
Sometimes we can find some measures of that in morale studies.

407
00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:23.620
How do you measure the psychological damage of combat on the human psyche?

408
00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:28.750
How do you measure the fracturing of marriages and relationships by war?

409
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:32.650
How do you measure homefront worry?

410
00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:38.110
How do you measure the ways war test and changes,
values,

411
00:30:38.111 --> 00:30:40.570
sentiments and morality itself?

412
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:45.820
How do you measure the social and moral consequences of killing people?

413
00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:51.850
How do you measure femininity,
manhood,

414
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:57.850
patriarchy?
How do you measure what it meant to become free?

415
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.630
You don't,
but you do study it.

416
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:10.220
Now,
let me give you one other example or maybe to

417
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:17.550
social impact.
Let's go to one of those southern women.

418
00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:22.340
She gets some mentions in foss book cause she wrote one of the great uh,

419
00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:27.530
diaries and later memoirs that she then revise is not Mary chestnut and then the

420
00:31:27.541 --> 00:31:32.130
ones so often quoted in the burns film series.
This one's name was Kate stone.

421
00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.200
She wrote a great,

422
00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:39.680
well she kept a diary that eventually was published as a book entitled Broken

423
00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:45.750
Burn,
which was the name of her Louisiana,
uh,
cotton and sugar plantation.

424
00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:52.460
It's an amazing book cause you can sort of follow the impact of this war on her

425
00:31:52.461 --> 00:31:57.380
psyche by following her through the years and then after the war as well.

426
00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:02.360
I'll pick her up right at the end.
The wars all but over.

427
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:08.230
And she records this in April,

428
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:13.070
1865 she has now moved over to Tyler,
Texas.
She has a refugee,

429
00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.050
her slaves as the phrase went,

430
00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.710
she's abandoned her plantation because the union armies took it in the red river

431
00:32:18.711 --> 00:32:22.010
campaign.
She's lost half of her slaves.

432
00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:28.060
She's lost two brothers in the war and a third one is come home stoned style.

433
00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.120
He never speaks battle fatigue.

434
00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:36.080
Shellshock posttraumatic stress.
Who knows?

435
00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:38.870
They didn't have a name for it then,
but he never,

436
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:43.730
or silent brother was around.
Two of them are dead,

437
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:47.180
all are fearfully depressed.
She writes,

438
00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:51.560
this is April 65 I cannot bear to hear them talk of defeat.

439
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:54.980
It seems a reproach to our gallon dead.

440
00:32:56.530 --> 00:33:01.220
And then there's some sort of last gasp bravado and she hoped that she said the

441
00:33:01.221 --> 00:33:06.200
thousands of grass grown mounds he'd done mountain side and in every valley of

442
00:33:06.201 --> 00:33:10.700
our country would still rally the south to be free or die.

443
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.600
What bravado in a diary.

444
00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.990
Then month later,
mid May,

445
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:24.990
1865 she opened the journal entry with a definition and then get any better than

446
00:33:25.961 --> 00:33:30.961
this of the south immediate fate and especially the fate of women living in this

447
00:33:33.161 --> 00:33:37.660
kind of now physical hardship in personal isolation.

448
00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:39.680
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

449
00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:42.410
<v 0>She opened the entry with three underline words,</v>

450
00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.290
conquered submission.

451
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:50.590
Subjugation are the words that burn into my heart and yet I feel that we are

452
00:33:52.221 --> 00:33:55.670
doomed to know them and all their bitterness.

453
00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:58.190
She looked ahead,

454
00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:02.660
should we and reflect about her class and her race

455
00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:06.520
and then she said they,

456
00:34:06.521 --> 00:34:11.521
the white planter class of the south would now become what she called slaves

457
00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.860
quote.
Yes.
Slaves of the Yankee government.

458
00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:21.210
She feared the quite specific what she called unendurable,

459
00:34:22.571 --> 00:34:27.571
fate of blacks ruling over her submission to the union.

460
00:34:28.781 --> 00:34:33.340
She went on how we hate that word,
confiscation,

461
00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:38.460
Negro equality or a bloody on equal struggle last we know not how long.

462
00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:42.260
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

463
00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:47.260
<v 0>And then in July of 65 rocking a baby in a chair in her arms and singing all the</v>

464
00:34:49.241 --> 00:34:53.140
songs she could remember,
she found,
she said,

465
00:34:53.141 --> 00:34:56.590
quote the war song.
Second meeting.

466
00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:59.710
The sound is like touching a new wound.

467
00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:02.620
I cannot bear to think of it all.

468
00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.380
I forget whenever I can.

469
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:06.703
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

470
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:12.080
<v 0>Well it's,
it's fascinating to follow Kate stone through time though.</v>

471
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:14.240
She did all right

472
00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:19.460
and weren't many men around which you finally met one.

473
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:24.940
This is incredible entry where she says she started going to social events and

474
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:28.040
one of them people were dancing and she couldn't bear to dance.

475
00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.550
It just didn't seem right.
When she finally did,

476
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:34.580
she met a surviving confederate officer,

477
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.640
merit him and 1869 lived out of life,

478
00:35:38.641 --> 00:35:43.641
had four kids and became the local head of the United daughters of the

479
00:35:44.641 --> 00:35:46.650
confederacy in her town in Texas,

480
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.010
and lived until 1907

481
00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:53.750
<v 1>okay.</v>

482
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:55.940
<v 0>Kate stone did better than most,</v>

483
00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:01.930
but southern society went to war and paid an enormous price.

484
00:36:01.931 --> 00:36:05.950
Of course.
Um,
civilians,

485
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:11.590
civilians were ultimately in some ways the strength behind the army's,

486
00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:12.810
uh,

487
00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:17.810
this war was to some extent lost on the home front for the south in particular.

488
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:20.880
Having said that,
you can say on the other side,

489
00:36:20.881 --> 00:36:24.750
in some ways it was one on the home front in the north because of industrial

490
00:36:24.751 --> 00:36:28.650
production,
because of sheer numbers and resources.

491
00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:34.620
But it's worth from my memory here that the civil war happened to southerners

492
00:36:34.621 --> 00:36:37.050
more than it happened to northerners.

493
00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:42.060
Only a small portion of this war was actually fought on northern soil.

494
00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:48.260
The confederacy failed ultimately to solve the problems of the home front.

495
00:36:48.271 --> 00:36:52.770
Just think of a list and,
and,
and this is not to condemn them.

496
00:36:52.771 --> 00:36:56.010
This was their challenge.
This is,
this is the risk they took.

497
00:36:56.310 --> 00:37:00.870
This is what they risked was the session in 1861.
The problems of the home front,

498
00:37:00.871 --> 00:37:05.871
they could not ultimately Soule in the midst of this massive enveloping thousand

499
00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:09.330
mile front war surrounded button,

500
00:37:09.331 --> 00:37:12.900
naval blockade money supply,

501
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:14.880
transportation.

502
00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:16.440
<v 1>Okay.</v>

503
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:21.240
<v 0>Agriculture,
agricultural production,
developing small industry,</v>

504
00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:26.340
creating a national bureaucracy that could be efficient,

505
00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:31.380
maddening shortages of food stuffs,
clothing,

506
00:37:31.381 --> 00:37:35.850
and about everything else it takes to keep armies in the field,
class,

507
00:37:35.851 --> 00:37:38.940
frictions,
social disintegration.

508
00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:42.550
And last but not least,
slavery,

509
00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:46.060
what to do about slavery,

510
00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:49.510
particularly once it comes under pressure in 1862 and then after the

511
00:37:49.511 --> 00:37:50.620
emancipation proclamation,

512
00:37:50.621 --> 00:37:54.160
which announces the purpose of the war now is to destroy slavery.

513
00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:58.470
What does the confederacy do?
We will come back to that,
uh,

514
00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:03.660
directly in terms of the confederate government policy on a kind of emancipation

515
00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:11.070
late in the war in [inaudible] 64 and 65 the south did undergo some rapid

516
00:38:12.151 --> 00:38:17.010
economic expansion,
remarkable economic expansion.

517
00:38:17.011 --> 00:38:17.520
In fact,

518
00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:21.030
if you read the sections on this and Jim Macpherson's battle cry of freedom,

519
00:38:21.031 --> 00:38:22.860
his background,
he has some,

520
00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:27.480
some glowing things to say about just how effective the south was in producing

521
00:38:27.481 --> 00:38:30.840
cannon.
For example,
at the tredegar ironworks in Richmond,

522
00:38:30.841 --> 00:38:35.200
they had 3000 slaves working in the largest industrial plant anywhere in the

523
00:38:35.201 --> 00:38:37.240
southern states by 1863

524
00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:38.650
<v 1>okay.</v>

525
00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:42.400
<v 0>Producing by and large their own weapons.</v>

526
00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:43.960
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

527
00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:46.210
<v 0>The naval blockade of the union.</v>

528
00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:49.360
A navy was not very effective at first,

529
00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:54.610
but it was ultimately crippling by the latter part of the war.

530
00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:59.200
The estimate is that about five out of six blockade runners,

531
00:38:59.201 --> 00:39:02.110
these ships running the blockade got through,

532
00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:04.690
um,

533
00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:09.160
between 1861 and 62

534
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:13.420
but by 1864 and 65,

535
00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:18.490
only about one of every two attempted blockade runners ever got through.

536
00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.000
<v 1>Okay.</v>

537
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.530
<v 0>There was widespread devastation of staple crop agriculture and those parts of</v>

538
00:39:25.531 --> 00:39:27.690
the south where the union armies moved in.

539
00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:31.740
Charley Brewster just described those corn fields of central Virginia.

540
00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:36.630
A union army near southern crops meant the crops were gone in 24 hours.

541
00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:39.200
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

542
00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.010
<v 0>One of the world's greatest agricultural economies.</v>

543
00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:45.520
People began to go hungry by 1860,

544
00:39:45.521 --> 00:39:50.521
late 63 and into 60 for bringing about major bread riots in cities like

545
00:39:50.831 --> 00:39:52.840
Richmond,
Charleston,
South Carolina,

546
00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:57.960
and other places with more than a half a million white men leaving agriculture

547
00:39:59.771 --> 00:40:01.090
across the south.

548
00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:05.590
It's seriously reduced productivity.

549
00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

550
00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:11.010
<v 0>And then a slavery began to dissolve.
Slowly but surely.</v>

551
00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:17.310
This of course disrupted production at least in about a third of the south

552
00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:21.460
agricultural land.

553
00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:24.303
<v 1>Okay.</v>

554
00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:28.220
<v 0>The occupation of the Louisiana,
for example,
early in the wars,</v>

555
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:33.230
they're at least 62 brought the sugar industry to the edge of extinction and by

556
00:40:33.411 --> 00:40:38.010
the wars in only about 15% of Louisiana,

557
00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:40.730
1,300 sugars states.

558
00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:45.140
We're operating at all the great sugar plantations of Louisiana.

559
00:40:45.141 --> 00:40:48.230
We're in almost utter room by the end of the war,

560
00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:53.770
especially after the Red River campaign of 1864 tobacco was in shambles is the

561
00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:59.830
union armies move through Kentucky and Tennessee quite early in the war and rice

562
00:41:00.141 --> 00:41:05.141
along the coast of South Carolina was devastated by union occupation as early as

563
00:41:05.391 --> 00:41:10.391
62 and 63 and then there was the south decision,

564
00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:15.640
Jefferson Davis's decision to engage in a cotton embargo that is,

565
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:19.620
they took cotton off the world market on the same,

566
00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:24.290
more about this when we deal with questions of confederate defeat in terms of

567
00:41:24.291 --> 00:41:25.280
their foreign policy,

568
00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:30.640
but the policy by 1863 of the confederate government was to take cotton off the

569
00:41:31.281 --> 00:41:32.360
world market,

570
00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:37.600
trying to pull an OPEC trying to do with cotton with the OPEC countries in our

571
00:41:39.141 --> 00:41:42.320
lifetime.
We've tried to do with oil,
pull it back,

572
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:47.360
make the world demanded and maybe make the Brits come in on your side.

573
00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:52.840
It totally backfired and it was a total economic disaster for the south.

574
00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:57.770
The production of cotton and the America and the confederate states went from

575
00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:02.920
about 5 million bales in 1862 about one quarter million in 1865

576
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.570
no confederate fiscal policy was also a disaster,

577
00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:18.710
not until 1863 did the Richmond government enact any kind of comprehensive tax

578
00:42:19.381 --> 00:42:20.214
law.

579
00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:25.200
Taxing was not very consistent from the federal level.

580
00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:27.810
Well,
the way the confederacy was itself born.

581
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:33.170
Even then when they tried to pass a comprehensive tax law,

582
00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:38.590
the confederacy derived in the in only about 7% of its revenues from actual

583
00:42:39.891 --> 00:42:40.724
taxation.

584
00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:46.190
The rest came from borrowing money from a bar abroad sale of bonds,

585
00:42:46.191 --> 00:42:48.350
which is about 25% of their budgets.

586
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:53.710
Impressment of provisions from southerners themselves about 17% and in the end

587
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:59.890
about 50% of all money in the confederacy and its four years of existence was

588
00:43:00.441 --> 00:43:01.940
printed paper money,

589
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:07.700
which it became inflated at ridiculous rates rapidly.

590
00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:11.923
<v 1>No,</v>

591
00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:16.390
<v 0>so much more could be said here,</v>

592
00:43:16.391 --> 00:43:21.391
especially about this dissolving institution of slavery and how it affected the

593
00:43:23.381 --> 00:43:27.610
south.
But let me spend the last five minutes on the north,

594
00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:32.020
which is a very different story.
It's a more successful story.

595
00:43:32.021 --> 00:43:35.410
It's a more progressive story in the literal sense,

596
00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:40.710
and it is rooted in a particular kind of political vision that that Republican

597
00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:46.270
Party brought to the federal government
before the civil war.

598
00:43:46.271 --> 00:43:50.230
The federal government did little more than deliver the mail.

599
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:53.260
<v 1>By and large.
Yes,</v>

600
00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:54.600
<v 0>it's about all it did.</v>

601
00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:58.830
It collected modest tariffs and a conducted foreign powers,

602
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:04.950
but by the surrender at Appomattox,
a great deal had changed in four years.

603
00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:07.440
Thousands.

604
00:44:07.441 --> 00:44:12.240
We're poised to spread across the continent with the transcontinental railroad

605
00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:13.260
businesses,

606
00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:18.260
a big gun to operate on a national scale with massive new marketing plans and

607
00:44:19.141 --> 00:44:21.240
full time marketing people.

608
00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:27.380
Higher tariffs would bolster domestic manufacturing individuals experience the

609
00:44:29.191 --> 00:44:33.510
nation state and it their allegiance as never before.

610
00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.540
And array of new national taxes.

611
00:44:36.541 --> 00:44:41.400
We're past the currency was nationalized.
The federal government,

612
00:44:41.401 --> 00:44:46.200
distributed public lands,
chartered corporations,
and when in fourth,

613
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:51.230
black freedom with state or National Authority.

614
00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:53.140
<v 1>Okay.</v>

615
00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:57.310
<v 0>And state's rights at least for the time being was Dell.</v>

616
00:44:58.210 --> 00:44:58.610
<v 1>Okay.</v>

617
00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:03.610
<v 0>Nearly a death blow temporarily war enabled the Republicans to pass sweeping</v>

618
00:45:06.021 --> 00:45:09.620
visionary legislation born of a certain worldview.

619
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:12.260
And that worldview basically is captured.

620
00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:17.420
And what the economist of the time,
political economists of the time,

621
00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:22.550
like Matthew Kerry and others called harmony of interest.

622
00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:28.180
This is the idea that in a capitalist economy you could bring labor and capital

623
00:45:29.571 --> 00:45:34.571
into harmony if you kept labor free and the economy free all at the same time.

624
00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:38.210
It was the belief that Labor and capital could be friends.

625
00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:45.880
It also depended on an activist,
interventionists,
federal government,

626
00:45:45.881 --> 00:45:49.660
and that is exactly what the Republican's created in part out of necessity of

627
00:45:49.661 --> 00:45:54.010
the war and in part out of the fact that they actually believed in it and it's

628
00:45:54.011 --> 00:45:58.570
going to bring about a great deal of the constitutional innovation and economic

629
00:45:58.571 --> 00:46:02.950
experimentation.
Here's what they did

630
00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:09.160
in finance,
in agriculture,
in taxes,

631
00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:11.920
and building railroads,

632
00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:16.390
and in emancipation at least those five major categories,

633
00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:21.340
the Republican Party transformed the United States federal government.

634
00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.030
They began by first selling war bonds.

635
00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:28.840
The treasury needed money to fight the war,

636
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:35.150
the cost of the American civil war to fight it just for the union government by

637
00:46:37.001 --> 00:46:42.001
1863 was approximately two and a half million dollars per day.

638
00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:49.660
That's more than the federal government had spent in some decades before the

639
00:46:52.011 --> 00:46:55.710
civil war.
Oh,

640
00:46:55.711 --> 00:46:58.500
that's a financial revolution.
How are you going to do it?

641
00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:00.540
How you're going to produce all this money?

642
00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:06.920
They began selling bonds to banks and finance ears in 1862 about $500 million in

643
00:47:08.671 --> 00:47:12.810
bonds were sold at 6% payable in five years.

644
00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:14.820
Buy a bond,
support the war.

645
00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:17.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

646
00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:21.500
<v 0>The government then chose,
hired,</v>

647
00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:23.900
invited from the private sector,

648
00:47:23.901 --> 00:47:28.901
the Philadelphia banker j Cook and listed him lead this federal bonds financing

649
00:47:32.411 --> 00:47:37.411
program and he did lead it aggressively.

650
00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:43.540
The whole idea here was economic nationalism to invest the citizen in the fate

651
00:47:43.541 --> 00:47:46.300
of the union by making them pay for it.

652
00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:52.450
And it was an 1862 that the federal government for the first time created the

653
00:47:52.451 --> 00:47:55.330
greenback dollar,
the paper dollar,

654
00:47:56.050 --> 00:47:58.720
which actually revolutionized American currency.

655
00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:03.930
Financial markets went up and down during the war,
depending on battlefields,

656
00:48:03.931 --> 00:48:05.380
success or failure.

657
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:11.330
But by 1863 they were financing a war.

658
00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:16.220
Companies were making profits and the federal government could pay its bills.

659
00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:17.563
It worked.

660
00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:23.290
The total national debt of an annual two and a half billion was absorbed by the

661
00:48:25.641 --> 00:48:30.641
general population and it was celebrated as what the Republican Party called a

662
00:48:33.111 --> 00:48:34.340
people's triumph.

663
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.680
<v 1>Okay,</v>

664
00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:38.270
<v 0>now I'm</v>

665
00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:43.220
running into that wall of time.
God help me.

666
00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:45.500
Let me leave you here with this.

667
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:48.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

668
00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:51.010
<v 0>Now the north has enormous advantages of course,</v>

669
00:48:51.011 --> 00:48:55.390
in resources in population and industry and transportation and on and on and on,

670
00:48:56.350 --> 00:49:01.270
and it had those New York bankers once they could convince them to stop being

671
00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:04.750
anti union and pro-union.

672
00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:10.810
But what came out of this was a revolutionary set of legislation that only

673
00:49:10.811 --> 00:49:15.730
wartime could probably have produced.
The homestead act in the west,

674
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:17.950
the transcontinental railroad,

675
00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:22.840
the moral act of 1862 which was the Land Grant College Act.

676
00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:27.520
It's created agricultural colleges across the country by federal money.

677
00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:28.601
In fact,

678
00:49:28.601 --> 00:49:32.470
last week I gave a lecture at my Alma Mater and Michigan State and just outside

679
00:49:32.471 --> 00:49:37.180
the lecture hall where I lectured was a copy of the original handwritten moral

680
00:49:37.181 --> 00:49:41.020
act.
I know you don't care,
but I did

681
00:49:42.850 --> 00:49:47.350
because Michigan Agricultural College was the first Land Grant College,

682
00:49:47.351 --> 00:49:51.550
and they always reminded us of that every time,
every year,
freshman orientation,

683
00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:57.460
and really frankly to understand,

684
00:49:57.461 --> 00:50:02.461
and I'll leave you here to understand how northerners the Republican Party

685
00:50:02.831 --> 00:50:03.880
Lincoln himself,

686
00:50:03.881 --> 00:50:08.530
and at least the majority of those union troops came to support emancipation,

687
00:50:08.531 --> 00:50:11.530
the freeing of black people by Federal Authority.

688
00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:16.710
You need to see it in the context of all else that this Republican party was

689
00:50:16.961 --> 00:50:18.460
doing through the federal government.

690
00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:24.870
They were using government now as the engine of great social experimentation and

691
00:50:27.771 --> 00:50:31.850
change.
Granted so much of it out of necessity,

692
00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:34.580
some of it out of will.

693
00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:41.390
I'm going to return to this story a little bit on Thursday as we move toward the

694
00:50:41.391 --> 00:50:44.870
question of why the north winds this war.
