1
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.450
So what is the engine of history?
I beg your attention.

2
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.600
There's a simple question for you.

3
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:11.500
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.030
<v 0>What is the engine of history,</v>

5
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.780
which I like on answerable questions
is the engine of history.

6
00:00:19.781 --> 00:00:20.650
Politics.

7
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.413
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.160
<v 0>The inherent natural,</v>

9
00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:29.660
eternal quest of people.
The bend,

10
00:00:29.661 --> 00:00:32.720
other people's wills and take power

11
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.260
or is the engine of history.
Economics.

12
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.770
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.770
<v 0>The grinding on the ground process by which people carve out livelihoods over</v>

14
00:00:45.221 --> 00:00:48.970
against other people's competition for the same livelihoods.

15
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.190
It doesn't seem to matter what history you study.

16
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.620
Oh,
where are you?
Look,

17
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.710
history always some somehow comes around to this nexus,

18
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.300
this collision

19
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.180
between forces of political power and forces of economics,

20
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.600
and our job is always somehow to discern between them and how they mix.

21
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.073
<v 1>Now</v>

22
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.050
<v 0>often of course the answer is that it's all one in the same thing.</v>

23
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.380
Listen to this passage by a Friedman and the south named Bailey Wyatt.

24
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.820
He got up and made a speech at a Freeman's political meeting.

25
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.470
This was actually an early union lead meeting in 1866 it was about political

26
00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:48.180
organizing in the south.

27
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.540
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

28
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.950
<v 0>but no,
what Bailey gets up and says as it was recorded,</v>

29
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.870
it was a meeting in New York town,
Virginia Bailey Wyatt,
former slave.

30
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.360
He sort of announcing the freed people's grievances at a political gathering.

31
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:07.663
He says,

32
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.720
we now as a people desires to be elevated and we desires to do all we can to be

33
00:02:14.661 --> 00:02:18.830
educated and we hope our friends will aid us all they can.

34
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.910
I may stay to all our friends into all our enemies.

35
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.130
We has a right to the land where we are located.

36
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.440
Why?
I'll tell you our wives,
our children,

37
00:02:33.441 --> 00:02:38.441
our husbands has been sold over and over again to purchase the lands.

38
00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:42.170
We now locates upon for that reason.

39
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.740
We have a divine right to the land and then didn't we clear the lands and raise

40
00:02:49.161 --> 00:02:53.060
the crops of corn and cotton and tobacco and a rice and there's sugar and have

41
00:02:53.061 --> 00:02:55.340
everything and then didn't them.

42
00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:59.000
Large cities in the north grow up on the cotton and the sugars,

43
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.830
the rice that we made.
Yes,

44
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.370
I appealed to the south and to the north.

45
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.980
If I hasn't spoken the words of the truth.

46
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

47
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.130
<v 0>I say they have grown rich and my people are poor.</v>

48
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.830
<v 1>Okay.</v>

49
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:17.940
<v 0>At a political rally</v>

50
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.220
it makes an aggressive economic speech

51
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.570
about the labor theory of value.

52
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.990
He didn't read need to read John Locke,

53
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.930
he'd never read second treatise on government.

54
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.450
He hadn't had a political philosophy course but he absolutely understood.

55
00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.010
He called it the divine right,

56
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.350
the labor theory of value if I Labor to improve that land,

57
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.483
it's mine.

58
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.930
In that in the simplicity and the agony and the beauty of Bailey,

59
00:03:57.361 --> 00:03:58.590
why it's statement,

60
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.330
you have a lot of what was at stake in reconstruction and you have a lot about

61
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.080
what the political dilemma was and delivering on Bailey why its claim to a

62
00:04:14.881 --> 00:04:16.350
divine right to the land.

63
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.250
All right back to Washington and back to the politics at least for a few minutes

64
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.270
and then I want to shift a south to this story of the on the ground economics of

65
00:04:33.141 --> 00:04:33.861
reconstruction,

66
00:04:33.861 --> 00:04:38.861
especially this massive transformation of a slave labor economy into some kind

67
00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:45.680
of free labor economy.
That quickly evolves of course,
and you know this,

68
00:04:45.681 --> 00:04:48.050
at least the contours over from reading phoner.

69
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.500
It evolves eventually rather quickly into a system of tenant farming in a system

70
00:04:54.981 --> 00:04:59.150
of sharecropping and assist them ultimately have a kind of debt peonage.

71
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.790
But in Washington,

72
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.910
the political triumph of the radical Republicans comes in that veto proof

73
00:05:07.761 --> 00:05:08.331
congress.

74
00:05:08.331 --> 00:05:13.331
They produced in the fall elections of 1866 and in 1867,

75
00:05:13.821 --> 00:05:18.821
they pass the first reconstruction act followed after that,

76
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.710
uh,

77
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.710
in 67 in early 68 by three more reconstruction acts simply called the second,

78
00:05:27.681 --> 00:05:32.360
third and fourth reconstruction acts and it wasn't this system by which the

79
00:05:32.361 --> 00:05:37.220
southern states,
the x confederate states,
we're actually readmitted to the union.

80
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.850
The great possibilities phoner addresses over and over in this experiment in

81
00:05:46.551 --> 00:05:47.690
racial democracy,

82
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.700
this experiment in increasing democratic forms of government and institutions in

83
00:05:52.911 --> 00:05:57.470
the south through the transplanting of the Republican party into those x

84
00:05:57.471 --> 00:06:02.090
confederate states is rooted in this document.
Those are the five,

85
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:06.340
I don't know if you can read it in the back.
Can you read that in the back?
Yeah.

86
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.130
All right.
I love this machine.
It makes me look good,

87
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.260
but those are the five part I'm not going to,
well,
maybe I will.

88
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.820
The first part of the first reconstruction act divided the south into five

89
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:24.800
military district.
The second set,
these district would be commanded by a general,

90
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.020
not below the rank of brigadier general and inadequate and military force.

91
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.150
That part wouldn't ever really come off and the,
and then it wasn't even big gun.

92
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.330
Third commanding general,

93
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.980
what supervised a general would supervise the election of delegates to state

94
00:06:42.981 --> 00:06:47.480
conventions and those new state conventions would write these new state

95
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:50.570
constitutions for the southern states.
Note the process.

96
00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:54.530
Now this is not Lincoln's 10% plan and it sure as hell isn't.

97
00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:57.530
Andrew Johnson's that portion who are loyal plan.

98
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:05.950
All adult males regardless of color who were not disfranchised for participation

99
00:07:05.951 --> 00:07:10.951
in the war were eligible to vote and the constitutions had to provide for male

100
00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:14.650
negro suffrage in the south.

101
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.700
You'll note the Republicans,
as I've said before,

102
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.870
are stepping clear of black suffrage in the north

103
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.620
and they're going to do it again and the 15th amendment.

104
00:07:26.621 --> 00:07:30.130
We'll come back to that Thursday.
And finally,

105
00:07:30.131 --> 00:07:35.080
when a majority of the voters ratified a constitution,

106
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.850
and when Congress approved it,
president has virtually no role in this.

107
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.950
This is congressional reconstruction.

108
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.690
Want to stated ratified the 14th amendment,
no choice,

109
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.390
the equal protection clause,

110
00:07:49.391 --> 00:07:54.391
the citizenship amendment you must accept then and only then the state would be

111
00:07:57.701 --> 00:07:59.050
readmitted to the union.

112
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.960
If you put it all in one large pill,

113
00:08:02.961 --> 00:08:07.520
it's a very big pill for the x confederate states to swallow,

114
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.240
and at least politically on the surface,

115
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.920
it is exactly what they had to swallow in order to be readmitted to the union.

116
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:19.400
In between 1866 actually,

117
00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:24.401
Tennessee was readmitted before this act even past in a shifty,

118
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.650
strange manner.
It had to be readmitted again after that.

119
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:33.040
But between 66 and 1870 the 11 former confederate states were readmitted to the

120
00:08:35.061 --> 00:08:40.061
union under the radical reconstruction plan of the congressional Republicans.

121
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.250
Now,
those three subsequent reconstruction acts are very important.

122
00:08:46.251 --> 00:08:49.040
And by the way,
every one of these acts,

123
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:53.480
including the renewal each year of the Freedmen's bureau,
the renewal,
I mean the,

124
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:58.050
the first civil rights acts,
15 different bills

125
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:04.790
developing a reconstruction plan passed by Congress were all vetoed between 1866

126
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:09.450
and 68 by Andrew Johnson.
I may have said this before,

127
00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:13.140
more vetoes by a president of United States than all previous American

128
00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:18.120
presidents put together.
You could call this a constitutional crisis.

129
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:21.030
It was,
you could call it a breakdown and federalism.

130
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:22.440
You could call it whatever you want,

131
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:27.620
but it's government by veto and override a veto every time.

132
00:09:27.691 --> 00:09:31.800
Hey,
Jay vetoed a reconstruction act.
Congress in its two thirds,

133
00:09:31.801 --> 00:09:35.610
majority Republicans in both houses overrode his veto.

134
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:41.460
We've never had a government operate like this with this many vetoes and

135
00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:44.280
override vetoes in such a concentrated period of time.

136
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:48.330
That's how reconstruction was actually put in place.
Politically.

137
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.130
Second Reconstruction Act gave details for how those military commanders were

138
00:09:53.131 --> 00:09:54.660
supposed to conduct their districts.

139
00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:00.200
The third reconstruction act passed summer of 67 set up what were called

140
00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:02.190
registration boards,

141
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:07.340
which were empowered to deny voting rights to anyone they felt were not taking

142
00:10:07.921 --> 00:10:12.921
loyalty oaths in good faith is still trying to enforce this loyalty oath and the

143
00:10:13.591 --> 00:10:18.591
fourth reconstruction act not cast until spring of 68 simply said that a

144
00:10:19.471 --> 00:10:24.471
majority of votes cast would be sufficient to put a new constitution into

145
00:10:27.091 --> 00:10:27.924
effect.

146
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:34.070
Not a majority of those southerners who had voted in 1860

147
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:40.810
you'll note some erosion there and the radicalism of the radical plan.

148
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:43.100
There are a lot of reasons for that,

149
00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:47.180
not the least of which is they were in the midst at that point of trying to

150
00:10:47.181 --> 00:10:49.910
impeach Andrew Johnson.
Now,

151
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.850
I wish I had an entire lecture all,

152
00:10:52.851 --> 00:10:57.851
I do have an entire lecture to give you on the impeachment of Andrew Johnson,

153
00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:04.520
but I'm going to do it quickly and I'd be more than happy in our review session

154
00:11:04.521 --> 00:11:07.040
in a couple of weeks or any other time

155
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:09.800
to come back to it.

156
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:12.120
<v 1>Okay.</v>

157
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.940
<v 0>It's the first great model we have of the impeachment of a president.</v>

158
00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:16.020
Of course in our history,

159
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.700
we've had another one since we used to think it would never,
ever,

160
00:11:20.701 --> 00:11:22.980
ever happen again after the Nixon debacle.

161
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.590
Here I go.
I'm straying into my tangent.

162
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:30.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

163
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.950
<v 0>Believe it or not,
I was,
I'm giving away my age here,</v>

164
00:11:32.951 --> 00:11:37.720
but I was a high school teacher.
The Richard Nixon was almost impeached,

165
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:39.703
uh,

166
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:45.600
and I had prepared for months to teach my students about impeachment and in the

167
00:11:47.351 --> 00:11:48.580
sob resigned.

168
00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:53.350
It just took all the fun out of the early 1970s,

169
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.540
but it was a great civics lesson.

170
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:03.280
We got that civics lesson over again because of Bill Clinton's affair with a

171
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:04.690
White House intern

172
00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.510
and because of what is or was or whatever the hell it was.

173
00:12:09.511 --> 00:12:10.740
He said to the grand jury,

174
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.700
you need to know a couple of things though about the constitution.

175
00:12:14.701 --> 00:12:18.600
If you don't already know it,
they're actually,
there are four,
well,

176
00:12:18.601 --> 00:12:21.630
five provisions about impeachment in the constitution.

177
00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:26.130
It's the most awesome power in the constitution in some ways and it isn't wheel.

178
00:12:26.131 --> 00:12:27.000
The Very Austin

179
00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:33.560
he authority or to impeach of course rest with the House of Representatives is

180
00:12:34.231 --> 00:12:38.040
the House of Representatives through the Judiciary Committee that investigates

181
00:12:38.041 --> 00:12:42.030
grounds for impeachment of a president or a cabinet official or a Supreme Court

182
00:12:42.031 --> 00:12:42.864
justice.

183
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.720
It is the House of Representatives and that then brings articles of impeachment

184
00:12:48.721 --> 00:12:51.180
which in effect are like an indictment,

185
00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:55.890
although they are a political indictment and never intended to be a legal

186
00:12:55.891 --> 00:12:56.724
indictment.

187
00:12:57.890 --> 00:12:58.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

188
00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.960
<v 0>The third part of the constitution,</v>

189
00:12:59.961 --> 00:13:04.670
Article One section three clause six gives the u s senate the power to sit as

190
00:13:04.671 --> 00:13:05.600
the jury,

191
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:11.230
the judicial function of trying a person under impeachment charges.

192
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.350
The house charges the Senate judges

193
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:22.350
only the Senate and it's collective vote can determine guilt or innocence and it

194
00:13:23.051 --> 00:13:27.010
takes they,
they kept this an awesome power and difficult to use.

195
00:13:27.011 --> 00:13:31.810
It takes a two thirds vote of the U S Senate to impeach and remove a president

196
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:36.670
or other official and then comes to the punishment clause.
Article One,

197
00:13:36.671 --> 00:13:40.900
section three clause seven of the constitution judgment in cases of impeachment

198
00:13:40.901 --> 00:13:45.901
shall not extend further than to removal from office and does qualification to

199
00:13:45.971 --> 00:13:48.700
hold and enjoy any other office of honor,

200
00:13:48.701 --> 00:13:50.740
trust or profit under the United States.

201
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:55.360
But the party convicted chill nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment.

202
00:13:55.361 --> 00:13:57.400
Trial judgment of punishment according to law.

203
00:13:59.310 --> 00:13:59.770
<v 1>Okay.</v>

204
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:03.940
<v 0>You could still be tried in a criminal court after your impeached,</v>

205
00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.940
although we've never gotten that far.

206
00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:15.210
But the only power the Senate has his removal and that is exactly what the

207
00:14:15.381 --> 00:14:20.150
radical Republicans are trying to do to Andrew Johnson and that he provokes them

208
00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:25.151
to do over and over in 1867 and early 1868

209
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:31.800
there is one other feature in the constitution and that is of course the

210
00:14:31.801 --> 00:14:36.801
president's pardon power president shall have the power to pardon in all cases

211
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:42.170
except impeachment.
No,
I don't.

212
00:14:42.171 --> 00:14:45.500
You don't remember Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon?

213
00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:51.070
<v 1>I do.
Probably</v>

214
00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:56.580
<v 0>probably cost Gerald Ford election in brief what happened in the Johnson</v>

215
00:14:58.331 --> 00:15:01.810
impeachment
and he was impeached.

216
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.970
He simply wasn't removed from office

217
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:10.590
is what you had is a process through four and five different,

218
00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:16.411
depends on how you count them stages and the political development of this

219
00:15:17.261 --> 00:15:21.760
crisis of authority and power over who's gonna run reconstruction.

220
00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.480
Now there are numerous theories,

221
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:30.600
historical interpretations about why Johnson was finally impeached by the

222
00:15:30.641 --> 00:15:31.474
Republicans.

223
00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.730
It never would have happened if,

224
00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:41.840
if Andrew Johnson would have in any way just backed off and admitted that he was

225
00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:44.880
probably going to be a lame duck president.

226
00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:50.610
One theory is Johnson's personal behavior as an explanation for his impeachment

227
00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:56.060
is personal habits were hardly fetching is a swing around the circle and the

228
00:15:57.001 --> 00:16:01.470
fall of 1866 was an utter embarrassment to the presidency.

229
00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:06.950
Is likening same self to Jesus is constant ranting on the radical Republicans as

230
00:16:07.651 --> 00:16:11.190
traders calling them Judas.

231
00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:18.290
He is called in the press a presidential ass at various times during that tour.

232
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.560
That's one part of it,

233
00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:26.970
the sort of personal provocations of his style,

234
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:32.040
but a second explanation that I think holds much more weight is the Johnson and

235
00:16:32.041 --> 00:16:36.270
the radical Republicans simply had fundamentally different constitutional

236
00:16:36.271 --> 00:16:41.271
conceptions of the meaning of the war and the meaning and the nature of

237
00:16:42.421 --> 00:16:46.590
reconstruction.
Policy Johnson,

238
00:16:46.591 --> 00:16:51.591
you'll remember one at a rapid quick presidential executive reconstruction with

239
00:16:51.631 --> 00:16:56.460
virtually no alteration of the constitution and utterly no changes in black

240
00:16:56.461 --> 00:17:01.461
civil and political rights is 15 vetoes and the overrides of those vetoes in

241
00:17:03.661 --> 00:17:05.940
that process of veto and override,

242
00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:09.000
you really have the origins of the roots,

243
00:17:09.001 --> 00:17:14.001
the essence of why the radicals finally decided the best thing to in their

244
00:17:14.491 --> 00:17:17.760
political interest to do with Andrew Johnson was to remove him.

245
00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.090
A third theory is,
and there's something to this,

246
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:26.430
although I don't think it explains it all by any means,

247
00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.520
is what one historian has called the radical plot thesis.

248
00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:33.990
Just sheer partisan politics to sheer partisan hatreds.

249
00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.530
This guy was an old Jacksonian Democrat.

250
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:42.590
He was a southern Democrat as the president and the Republicans not only wanted

251
00:17:42.811 --> 00:17:44.970
him out of the way of their reconstruction plans,

252
00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:48.480
they wanted the democratic party ruined if they could do it.

253
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.310
Some of them did want that.

254
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:55.590
Some of the leaders of the impeachment movement in the house,
James Ashley,

255
00:17:55.591 --> 00:17:56.460
Benjamin Butler,

256
00:17:56.461 --> 00:18:01.020
George Boutwell and others where sometimes referred to even in their friendly

257
00:18:01.021 --> 00:18:02.070
press as,

258
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:07.910
as one Republican paper put it as bail full of trio of buzzards has ever perched

259
00:18:08.311 --> 00:18:09.630
in the House of Representatives.

260
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.340
And they were accused as sometimes politicians are accused today have a witch

261
00:18:14.341 --> 00:18:19.260
hunt.
They investigated everything about Johnson,
his bank accounts,

262
00:18:19.261 --> 00:18:22.740
allegations that he had tried to betray Tennessee during the civil war,

263
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.240
which were nonsense.

264
00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:28.080
And even that he had somehow participated in the booth conspiracy to kill

265
00:18:28.081 --> 00:18:32.160
Lincoln auto nonsense.
Um,

266
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:38.010
the real explanation here of the,
if there's,
if there's smoke,

267
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:42.150
I mean if there's fire where the smoke comes from on this radical plot thesis

268
00:18:42.151 --> 00:18:47.151
against Johnson is this idea that there were some radical Republicans who,

269
00:18:47.261 --> 00:18:50.100
who saw a big opening not only to,

270
00:18:50.101 --> 00:18:54.240
to remake the south to Yankee eyes of the south and they aren't interested in

271
00:18:54.241 --> 00:18:57.660
doing that and not always a bad motives.

272
00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.510
South needed schools desperately.

273
00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:05.070
It needed some kind of economic revival,
desperately needed.

274
00:19:05.071 --> 00:19:08.640
It's Harvard's dredge desperately needed active as government to do all this.

275
00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:12.690
But there was some radical republicans who saw a chance here to rearrange

276
00:19:12.691 --> 00:19:17.691
constitutional powers to use the feeling at a broad against Andrew Johnson to

277
00:19:20.851 --> 00:19:25.800
tip the balance of power toward the congress as never before in the nature of

278
00:19:25.801 --> 00:19:26.730
the federal government.

279
00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:33.340
Removing Johnson would be removing an obstacle to congressional hegemony over

280
00:19:33.341 --> 00:19:34.300
the federal government.

281
00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:42.970
And now there's some element here too that the fact that you need to remember

282
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.170
who actually would've replaced Andrew Johnson if he had been removed from
office.

283
00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.470
There is no vice president.
He had been Lincoln's vice president.

284
00:19:50.471 --> 00:19:52.810
There is no vice president.
We didn't have the amendment,

285
00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.460
which comes later in the 20th century,
which allows a new president,

286
00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.640
takes over to a point.

287
00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:02.080
His vice president signed the absence of any vice president.

288
00:20:02.081 --> 00:20:03.070
Who would it become president.

289
00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:05.070
<v 1>Okay,</v>

290
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.810
<v 0>come on.
Has a great trivia question.
You use this one out at the bar.</v>

291
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:13.110
No one will know it
louder.

292
00:20:13.111 --> 00:20:16.350
I can't hear.
You
know,

293
00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:23.010
president pro tem of the Senate Bingo,

294
00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:29.880
who was Benjamin Wei to radical Republican from Ohio and one of the leaders of

295
00:20:29.881 --> 00:20:33.150
the impeachment movement.
A little unsavory.

296
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:36.420
You're organizing to impeach the president by the way.

297
00:20:36.421 --> 00:20:37.410
I'll be the next president.

298
00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:40.180
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

299
00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.520
<v 0>And fourth,
and last but not least,</v>

300
00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.300
what's at stake in the impeachment of Andrew Johnson?

301
00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:49.750
I'm going to spare you all the sordid.
Did wonderful,
tasty,

302
00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:55.170
lovely details of the corruption and skullduggery and scandal and payments that

303
00:20:56.471 --> 00:21:01.471
went on in the final vote in the Senate that moves seven Republicans over to

304
00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:06.580
acquittal and saved ajs hide.
I'm going to spare you all that wonderful,

305
00:21:06.581 --> 00:21:08.650
lovely collection.

306
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:14.140
It's really beautiful,
awful ugly stuff.

307
00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:17.020
Money offices.

308
00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:22.450
If you read John Kennedy's profiles in courage.
I mean,

309
00:21:22.451 --> 00:21:26.140
we all love to love Jack Kennedy and Ted Sorensen,
who was the speech writer,

310
00:21:26.141 --> 00:21:27.640
was one of the greatest speech writers.
Everyone,

311
00:21:27.641 --> 00:21:31.540
Ted Sorenson wrote that book profiles in courage than they put Jack Kennedy's

312
00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:32.260
name on it.

313
00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:37.260
And one of his chapters is of course about Andrew Johnson being persecuted by

314
00:21:37.331 --> 00:21:42.160
the radical Republicans in reconstruction.
God,

315
00:21:42.161 --> 00:21:46.330
they got that wrong.
But last but not least,

316
00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:52.410
Andrew Johnson was impeached and the radicals kept going after him because Aja

317
00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.300
wouldn't quit.
He kept provoking them,
provoking them,

318
00:21:55.301 --> 00:21:58.780
provoking them and provoking and not just with words.

319
00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:02.110
They would appointed general and one of the five districts in the south heat

320
00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:02.963
firearm

321
00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:08.290
congress would appoint a whole new series of Freedmen's bureau agents for Texas.

322
00:22:08.291 --> 00:22:12.430
He'd fire them.
You can't run a government like that.

323
00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.370
He would veto the Freedmen's bureau.

324
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.550
They override the Freedmen's bureau and they put the budget in place.
He'd say,

325
00:22:18.551 --> 00:22:22.370
just go and try to enforce it.
Now,

326
00:22:22.371 --> 00:22:26.360
what do you do with a president if you're drowning the congress and you're

327
00:22:26.361 --> 00:22:28.310
trying to put a policy in place,

328
00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:35.220
but at the heart hero was a struggle between a group of politicians capable of,

329
00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:38.260
of serious corruption in their own way,

330
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:42.280
but nevertheless who are actually trying to defeat white supremacy.

331
00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.350
They we're actually really trying to create some kind of black civil and

332
00:22:47.351 --> 00:22:48.820
political rights in the south.

333
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:54.520
Surely wanted the those blacks to be Republican voters.
What else is new?

334
00:22:56.230 --> 00:23:01.230
But Andrew Johnson's stood fast against them at every turn to try to preserve

335
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:07.120
his own particular vision of white supremacy.

336
00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:11.560
No,
just one passage in his state of the union message,

337
00:23:11.561 --> 00:23:13.480
December,

338
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:18.100
1867 this is after three attempts to three investigations of him.

339
00:23:18.101 --> 00:23:22.300
They've already been done by the House Judiciary Committee and the House

340
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:25.930
Judiciary Committee has brought possible impeachment articles to a vote and yet

341
00:23:25.931 --> 00:23:29.410
voted it down because it didn't quite have any smoking guns yet.

342
00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.820
And what does he do in his State of the union?

343
00:23:33.821 --> 00:23:38.821
December 80 and 67 among other things he says in the progress of nations,

344
00:23:39.011 --> 00:23:39.844
I quote,

345
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.740
Negroes have shown less capacity for government than any other race of people

346
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:49.820
know,
independent government of any form has ever been successful in their hands,

347
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:53.540
wherever they have been left to their own devices.

348
00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:58.460
They have shown a constant tendency to relapse into barbarism

349
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:01.670
and it got worse from there.

350
00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:08.390
Steven's Sumner Wade and the host of the Republicans in Congress kept hearing

351
00:24:10.981 --> 00:24:15.981
this over and over and over and finally they went after him.

352
00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:23.240
The house finally voted in February,
1868 uh,

353
00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:28.270
by a vote of about 140 to 50.
Something to impeach him.

354
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:33.700
Trouble was they actually,
I wrote 11 articles of impeachment,

355
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:35.561
but in essence,

356
00:24:35.561 --> 00:24:40.561
the first nine were all about the technical violation of two laws.

357
00:24:41.051 --> 00:24:46.051
The congress had passed that ultimately will be and should have been declared

358
00:24:46.091 --> 00:24:47.290
unconstitutional.

359
00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:52.270
They are called the tenure of office act and the command of the Army Act Tenure

360
00:24:52.271 --> 00:24:57.070
of office act was a law passed in essence saying the president of the United

361
00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:59.260
States could not fire members of his own cabinet.

362
00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.920
The commander of the Army Act said the president of the United States as

363
00:25:05.921 --> 00:25:10.420
commander and chief cannot issue orders to the army's without passing those

364
00:25:10.421 --> 00:25:12.340
orders through the general of the army,

365
00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.610
which was the 19th century version of the joint chiefs of Staff.

366
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:17.830
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

367
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:22.270
<v 0>They were literally trying to strip constitutional powers away from the</v>

368
00:25:22.271 --> 00:25:24.610
presidency,
but from Andrew Johnson,

369
00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:29.830
he violated the tenure of office that he violated the commander of the army and

370
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:34.080
he willfully did it.
And that's the grounds on which they actually impeached him

371
00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:39.570
and put him on trial.
In the end,

372
00:25:39.571 --> 00:25:43.740
he was acquitted not just because of skullduggery corruption and payments.

373
00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:46.003
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

374
00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:49.220
<v 0>not entirely because of that at all.</v>

375
00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:53.570
He was acquitted in part because it was the spring of 1868

376
00:25:55.240 --> 00:26:00.240
the Republican party was about to hold its nominating convention for the 1868

377
00:26:00.261 --> 00:26:01.094
election.

378
00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:02.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

379
00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:05.250
<v 0>And they were about to nominate.
Everybody knew it.
You listen.</v>

380
00:26:05.251 --> 00:26:08.160
If they could just convince him to do it.
Ulysses grant,

381
00:26:08.161 --> 00:26:13.161
as the next presidential candidate grant had been Johnson's general of the army

382
00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:17.970
and Johnson kept embarrassing grant over and over and over until grant resign.

383
00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:19.620
<v 1>Okay.</v>

384
00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:24.270
<v 0>And Republicans were suddenly frightened politically in the spring of 1868 if</v>

385
00:26:24.271 --> 00:26:28.800
they were really removed Johnson and put Ben Wade and the presidency and just

386
00:26:28.801 --> 00:26:33.801
literally took over the government and it might really hurt them at the polls in

387
00:26:34.291 --> 00:26:39.180
the fall and that Democratic Party was,
was doing everything under the sun,

388
00:26:39.181 --> 00:26:44.181
including including using the Ku Klux Klan to a extent as we'll see in the next

389
00:26:44.791 --> 00:26:49.791
two weeks to revive itself and oppose the Republicans in election after

390
00:26:50.821 --> 00:26:51.420
election.

391
00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:56.420
And will they ever in that 68 election in the spring of 68 oh good old age,

392
00:26:57.441 --> 00:27:01.710
a promised better behavior too.
He said he'd,
he'd cool it,

393
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.220
he'd back off,
he'd get out of the way and he would never run again,

394
00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:12.710
which wasn't quite true.
He was acquitted.
He served out his term.

395
00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:18.470
He went home to East Tennessee and dead is all day.
Andy,
Andy Johnson always had,

396
00:27:18.471 --> 00:27:21.740
he got back on the stump and he got himself reelected to the u s senate.

397
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:27.110
It will die in 1875 he's bearing Greenville,

398
00:27:27.111 --> 00:27:30.590
Tennessee to this day and we're told he was buried with a copy of the

399
00:27:30.591 --> 00:27:34.010
constitution on his chest,
held down by his hands.

400
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:38.180
He used to say he stood on the constitution and he's buried with the

401
00:27:38.181 --> 00:27:40.490
constitution,
I guess standing on him.

402
00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:44.840
Goodbye,
Andrew Johnson.

403
00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:51.320
It's been so good to know you
now.

404
00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:57.200
That fall,
the American people had a pivotal presidential election.

405
00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:00.260
I know we say that about all great elections,

406
00:28:00.261 --> 00:28:05.000
but let me give you the quick and dirty on 1868 phone or covers this nicely.

407
00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:12.440
Grant was a war hero.
Of course,
he was going to be now the candidate of harmony.

408
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.600
We've had a lot of generals in our history run for president as candidates of

409
00:28:17.601 --> 00:28:21.500
harmony.
When informed of his nomination,

410
00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:28.300
which was only a few weeks after the acquittal trial in the Senate of Andrew

411
00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:35.210
Johnson,
uninformed on May,
2018 68 of his,

412
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:36.770
uh,
excuse me.

413
00:28:36.771 --> 00:28:41.450
In early June 80 68 of his nomination,

414
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:44.810
he issued a public statement,

415
00:28:44.811 --> 00:28:49.811
which red eyes shall have no policy of my own to interfere against the will of

416
00:28:51.381 --> 00:28:55.210
the people.
I'm going to repeat that.

417
00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:57.430
You tell me what it means.

418
00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:02.110
I still have no policy of my own to interfere against the will of the people.

419
00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:05.803
<v 1>Okay?</v>

420
00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.950
<v 0>I will not take a stand.</v>

421
00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:12.180
He said in effect it exactly mean that.

422
00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:17.030
But the slogan of it,
in the end of that statement,
uh,
with the,

423
00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.760
the famous slogan that we become,
the slogan of his election campaign,

424
00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:26.010
let us have peace.
This splendidly ambiguous slogan,

425
00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:30.870
let us have peace and God knows the whole country's yearning for peace.

426
00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.200
But what they would have in 1868 is by far the most,

427
00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:37.980
the most racist white supremacist election in American history.

428
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.800
And by far to that date,
the most violent

429
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.600
granted committed to congressional control of reconstruction and to the

430
00:29:46.601 --> 00:29:47.830
reconstruction acts.

431
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:53.640
But the party platform in 68 now retrenched into being a political persuasion of

432
00:29:56.111 --> 00:30:00.730
order and stability and no longer have revolution and experiment.

433
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.450
They would now be protectors of the status quo.

434
00:30:04.451 --> 00:30:08.530
They had created rather than the innovators in the experimenters.

435
00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.610
They were now pillory by their opponents,

436
00:30:12.611 --> 00:30:16.540
the Democrats as radicals as amalgamation,

437
00:30:16.541 --> 00:30:21.130
just as miscegenation,
just
black suffrage.

438
00:30:21.131 --> 00:30:25.840
The right to vote for black men became the issue of the 1868 election.

439
00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:31.360
If you think the Democratic Party in the 1960s under Lbj,

440
00:30:31.361 --> 00:30:36.361
which passes the 64 and 65 civil rights act put itself on a course of near

441
00:30:37.301 --> 00:30:41.590
destruction in the south because of its liberal racial views,

442
00:30:41.591 --> 00:30:45.080
which it did,
they'll,

443
00:30:45.081 --> 00:30:50.081
Republicans of 1868 are now running on as the party of the black man's right to

444
00:30:50.821 --> 00:30:51.654
vote.

445
00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:01.723
<v 1>No,</v>

446
00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:06.850
<v 0>they did say that they were going to leave the right to vote to the whims of the</v>

447
00:31:06.851 --> 00:31:09.280
states in the north,

448
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:15.950
but in the south and that reconstruction act and by swallowing the 14th

449
00:31:16.561 --> 00:31:20.790
amendment,
the Black Man's right to vote was supposed to be sacrosanct.

450
00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:22.173
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

451
00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:26.780
<v 0>The Democratic Party at his convention in July of 68 and nominated Horatio</v>

452
00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:31.100
Seymour of New York.
It's former governor now Seymour had old,

453
00:31:31.101 --> 00:31:34.640
among other things,
the Democrats,
Canada for president,

454
00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:37.250
the vice president presidents of candidate gets worse,

455
00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.020
but the Democratics Democrats,

456
00:31:39.021 --> 00:31:43.820
presidential candidate and 68 Seymour had openly supported the draft rioters in

457
00:31:43.821 --> 00:31:48.320
1863 in New York city or out slaughtering people in the streets.

458
00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.090
He was on record for having a pose,

459
00:31:53.091 --> 00:31:57.350
the civil war for having been a piece of Democrat in McAllen support or a man

460
00:31:57.351 --> 00:32:00.470
who would've sued for peace with the south end.

461
00:32:00.471 --> 00:32:05.471
He chose as his running mate Francis Frank Blair for vice president from

462
00:32:05.571 --> 00:32:09.140
Missouri who was not only on open white supremacist,

463
00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:12.590
but he declared that the Democrats would,

464
00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:17.180
if elected announced the reconstruction acts,
Nolan void,

465
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:23.330
they would repeal them and they would return the south as immediately as

466
00:32:23.331 --> 00:32:27.400
possible to home rule.
In other words,

467
00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:31.810
if the Democrats were elected in [inaudible] 68 they would crush the

468
00:32:31.811 --> 00:32:36.760
reconstruction plans
and Blair and his

469
00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.100
blustery ways

470
00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:44.000
even threatened a second civil war.

471
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:46.920
A little stupid there.

472
00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:54.480
There were rhetoric and reality in 68 but what was the steak and 68 where the

473
00:32:54.481 --> 00:32:55.830
results of the civil war?

474
00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.790
It was a memory laden piece that was at stake.

475
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:02.370
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

476
00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:06.930
<v 0>The Democrats wanted to take the constitution backward.
The New York Herald,</v>

477
00:33:06.931 --> 00:33:09.240
the democratic paper asked quote,

478
00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:13.170
was it the constitution as it was or the constitution as it is.

479
00:33:13.171 --> 00:33:14.460
That's Andrew Johnson slogan.

480
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:18.330
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

481
00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:23.330
<v 0>Now I want to just give you an example or two of just how racist this campaign</v>

482
00:33:24.211 --> 00:33:27.150
was.
In 1868

483
00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:33.300
there were bloody shirts waving everywhere.
Your people killed my people.

484
00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.450
Blue blood on your hands is the blood of my son.

485
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:40.680
There were southern bloody shirts,
northern bloody shirts,
Democratic Party,

486
00:33:40.681 --> 00:33:42.600
bloody shirts,
Republican party bloody shirts,

487
00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:47.430
and African American bloody shirts symbolically,
and in some cases,

488
00:33:47.431 --> 00:33:52.290
literally people would hold them up.
Here's Blair,
the vice president,

489
00:33:52.291 --> 00:33:55.290
the attack dog on the campaign trail.

490
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:58.830
Republicans had a press,
the south claim,

491
00:33:58.831 --> 00:34:03.831
Blair and one speech by subjecting it to the rule of a quote semi Barbour's race

492
00:34:04.321 --> 00:34:09.321
of blacks who are polygamist and destined to subject white women to their

493
00:34:10.171 --> 00:34:14.730
unbridled lust.
Let white men rule America,

494
00:34:14.731 --> 00:34:17.040
screamed the headline and the Louisville newspaper

495
00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:23.310
arguing the Republicans preferred quote,
native Negroes to native whites

496
00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:30.080
in everywhere Democrats labeled the Republican Party as the party of quote,

497
00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:33.990
the amalgamation of the races,

498
00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:37.980
the monstrous Negro equality doctrine.

499
00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:43.200
And on and on it went,
excuse me.

500
00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:45.930
Uh,
Georgia Democrat

501
00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:51.750
who got himself elected to the u s senate named Benjamin Hill,

502
00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:56.190
said the south was now under the rule of a foreign power,

503
00:34:56.310 --> 00:35:01.050
driven by hate and determined to dishonor an unarmed people.

504
00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:03.083
<v 1>Okay.</v>

505
00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.270
<v 0>And in language understood across,</v>

506
00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:11.160
you might say all the white class lines in the south,

507
00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:15.990
he announced that if the radicals controlled reconstruction,

508
00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:19.980
southern whites would become America's new slaves.

509
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:22.830
They were said Benjamin Hill,
quote,

510
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:25.710
becoming the new Negros.

511
00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:30.570
And on and on it went.

512
00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:36.670
No Republicans gave it back.
Not Quite unkind,

513
00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:40.710
but they certainly waved their bloody shirts.
Here's Wendell Phillips,

514
00:35:40.711 --> 00:35:44.850
the old abolitionist in Boston who said,
quote,
in this election,

515
00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:48.240
we have just finished the war between two ideas.

516
00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:52.110
We send armies into South Carolina to carry our ideas.

517
00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:57.240
If we had no right to carry our ideas,
we had no right to send our armies.

518
00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:01.470
If the Democrats,
you know,
he said,
if Seymour wins this election,

519
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:05.040
it is as if Lee triumphs at Appomattox.

520
00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:06.990
<v 1>Okay.</v>

521
00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:08.050
<v 0>That makes it pretty clear.</v>

522
00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:14.150
Or take this example of a kind of a black bloody shirt.

523
00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:16.070
This is Benjamin Tanner,

524
00:36:16.071 --> 00:36:19.520
the editor of the Christian record are the largest circulation black newspaper

525
00:36:19.521 --> 00:36:23.480
in the United States.
It was the weekly newspaper of the African method,

526
00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.490
African Methodist Episcopal church,

527
00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:30.660
and he put it into a kind of little parable.
He says,

528
00:36:30.661 --> 00:36:34.620
what's at stake in the 68 election?
This is a very gendered.
Of course,

529
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:38.490
when you think about the power and significance and blacks,
male suffrage,

530
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:42.620
you know exactly what he's aiming at.
Yeah.
He says,

531
00:36:42.621 --> 00:36:47.621
Negro manhood is what is at stake in 68 here's the way he put it.

532
00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.500
Negro manhood says,
I am an American citizen.

533
00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.240
Modern democracy,

534
00:36:54.241 --> 00:36:58.210
meaning the Democratic Party says you are not Negro man,

535
00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.470
says Ida,
man,
all my rights,
civil and political.

536
00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:06.210
Modern democracy says you have no rights except what I choose to give you.

537
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.010
Negro manhood says,

538
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:12.090
I must build churches from myself in school houses for my children.

539
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:16.440
Modern democracy says,
if you do,
I will burn them down.

540
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:21.930
Negro manhood says,
I will exercise the rights.
Vouchsafed okay.

541
00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:26.910
Modern democracy says,
if you do,
I will mob and murder you.

542
00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:34.310
Are you saying how are political campaigns get ugly?
God,

543
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:37.070
we are so tame

544
00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:43.910
compared to this.
As someone once said,

545
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:49.630
politics is just war by other means and there's never a time when that is more

546
00:37:50.721 --> 00:37:53.030
true than 1868

547
00:37:55.400 --> 00:38:00.400
the Ku Klux Klan came into its own in 1868 I'm going to lecture in full about

548
00:38:01.821 --> 00:38:06.200
violence in the clan.
Come next Thursday,
next week,

549
00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:10.520
but 1868 was their first real coming out.

550
00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:16.360
There was a reign of terror in five or six southern states in this election,

551
00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:20.570
especially in Louisiana,
Georgia,
Arkansas and Tennessee

552
00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:26.980
all across the south in [inaudible] 67 especially that election year 68 as well

553
00:38:28.321 --> 00:38:32.980
and blacks are beginning to vow than to this process of tenant farming and

554
00:38:32.981 --> 00:38:37.150
sharecropping and trying to eco livings.

555
00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:42.310
They went to the polls and extraordinary numbers and risk their lives and many

556
00:38:42.311 --> 00:38:43.360
of them died doing it.

557
00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:50.060
There are all kinds of auxiliaries of the Democratic Party that really were the

558
00:38:50.081 --> 00:38:52.870
Ku Klux Klan or its imitators.

559
00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:59.010
There were more than 200 political murders in the state of Arkansas alone in

560
00:38:59.201 --> 00:39:02.650
this election.
The death toll and Georgia was lower,

561
00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:06.070
but intimidation at the polls was very effective.

562
00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:11.760
In 22 Georgia counties with a total of 9,300 black men listed on the voting

563
00:39:13.961 --> 00:39:17.410
rolls.
Grant tallied only 87 votes.

564
00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:27.830
<v 1>Oh,</v>

565
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.983
Yep.

566
00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:34.160
<v 0>You're free to leave.</v>

567
00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:36.043
<v 1>Okay.</v>

568
00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:37.080
<v 0>Nice hair.</v>

569
00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:39.013
<v 1>Okay.</v>

570
00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.430
<v 0>I hope he doesn't have a gun.</v>

571
00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:51.163
<v 1>Okay.</v>

572
00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.420
<v 0>At least he could have sung the lyric.</v>

573
00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:15.053
<v 1>Okay.</v>

574
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:17.700
<v 0>Seriously is that,
has that guy left</v>

575
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:27.910
and the suffering continues

576
00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:35.390
in Louisiana.

577
00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:41.090
More than 1000 people died and political violence in this one election year,

578
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:43.010
almost all of them black,

579
00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:47.720
all between April and November,

580
00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.790
1868 in Louisiana,

581
00:40:49.791 --> 00:40:54.791
21 parishes that had previously had a republican vote in 1867 totaling some

582
00:40:57.111 --> 00:40:59.360
28,000 black voters.

583
00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.780
Only 501 black votes got cast.

584
00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:08.380
And these are just some examples of how intimidation worked.

585
00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:12.770
Grand carried all of the north and 68 except three states.

586
00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:16.460
If you count Oregon as a northern state,

587
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:19.970
the only northern states or the Seymour and the Democrats,

588
00:41:19.971 --> 00:41:21.890
Carey were New Jersey and New York.

589
00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:26.720
Seymour won three border states,
Delaware,
Maryland,
and Kentucky.

590
00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:29.120
<v 1>Okay.</v>

591
00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:29.620
<v 0>Anyone?</v>

592
00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:34.620
Only two of the nine reconstructed x confederate states,

593
00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:37.400
eight excuse me,

594
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:42.790
that were already re-admitted by 1868 grant won in the electoral college 214 to

595
00:41:44.571 --> 00:41:48.140
80 the important thing is two things.

596
00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:53.860
The Republican's sustained in the fall elections of 1868 a clear veto proof

597
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:55.371
congress,

598
00:41:55.371 --> 00:42:00.371
two thirds in the house and four fifths in the Senate and without the

599
00:42:02.241 --> 00:42:07.241
approximately half million African American men who voted for grant in those x

600
00:42:08.451 --> 00:42:12.260
confederate states,
grant would never have been elected.

601
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:17.120
It was the first time in American history on the black vote mattered.

602
00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:18.613
It counted

603
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:24.470
and so many of them voted in the face of threats to their lives.

604
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:30.910
Now on the ground in the south in the midst of all this politics and violence,

605
00:42:33.621 --> 00:42:35.180
which we'll hear more about

606
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:36.103
<v 1>in time,</v>

607
00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:43.360
<v 0>a new level of did he say suffering?</v>

608
00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.420
One in place.

609
00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:53.190
There was a speech made by a former confederate general at the American cotton

610
00:42:54.791 --> 00:42:59.791
planters association meeting in late 1865 December [inaudible] 65 to be exact.

611
00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:04.540
And at that meeting,
ironically,
it isn't exactly clear what he intended,

612
00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:06.490
but at this meeting,

613
00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:12.250
the former confederate general's name was Robert Richardson said,
quote,

614
00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:18.120
the emancipated slaves own nothing because nothing but freedom has been given to

615
00:43:19.601 --> 00:43:22.030
them.
They own nothing

616
00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:28.680
because nothing but freedom was given to them in the absence of slavery.

617
00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:35.020
What did the Friedman,
now think with me,
what did the Friedman actually own?

618
00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:39.580
They own their bodies and they own their labor.

619
00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:45.430
The freed people as a massive people at the end of the civil war.
Now,

620
00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:48.760
I mean the jubilee has come,
but what are they actually have?

621
00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:55.330
They lacked physical capital,
money,

622
00:43:55.780 --> 00:44:00.780
land to some extent tools and they lacked to a certain degree,

623
00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:06.850
human capital,
which means education,
literacy in certain kinds of skills.

624
00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:10.480
A lot of slaves came out of slavery.
Of course with enormous skills,

625
00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:13.161
blacks,

626
00:44:13.161 --> 00:44:18.161
economic freedom though like their political freedom was largely at the mercy

627
00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:26.450
of the regime of white society or of white supremacy itself.

628
00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:31.480
However it would survive and the primary goal of white southerners from day one

629
00:44:32.971 --> 00:44:37.971
of reconstruction all the way through was to try to sustain what they most

630
00:44:38.281 --> 00:44:39.750
needed,
what whites most needed,

631
00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:45.740
which was a landless dependent agricultural labor force that would stay put.

632
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:54.510
They wanted black people to remain,
if not slaves in status,

633
00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:59.660
landless dependent and stationary as agricultural workers.

634
00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:03.660
Put another way,

635
00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:08.910
American freedom for American slaves brought no freedom.

636
00:45:08.911 --> 00:45:13.770
Dude's if you've learned about indentured servitude in the past and the 18th

637
00:45:13.771 --> 00:45:16.380
century in all the colonies,

638
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:18.800
there were always something called freedom dues.

639
00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:23.670
When an indenture ended or former indentured servant got up suit of clothing,

640
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:27.090
a piece of cash and usually a piece of land

641
00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:32.460
didn't happen.
There were attempts at this,

642
00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:36.270
we'll see more about this in the coming two weeks

643
00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:42.600
there was the Freedmen's bureau efforts to redistribute land to some extent.

644
00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:47.670
There was.
That is Stevens is bill in 1867 which would have,
it didn't pass,

645
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:52.590
but it would have called for 40 acres and $50 there was no mention of a mule,

646
00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:57.860
40 acres and $50 be given to each Friedman family by the federal government

647
00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:02.310
across the south 40 acres.

648
00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:09.490
It actually is sometimes referred to as the first reparations bill didn't pass.

649
00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:11.460
There was Frederick Douglass,

650
00:46:11.461 --> 00:46:15.620
his idea a little bit later of a national Friedman's loan agency,

651
00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:21.070
a federal loan agency subsidized by the federal government by taxpayer money to

652
00:46:22.581 --> 00:46:27.140
which Friedman would apply for loans,
perhaps three year loans,
five year loans,

653
00:46:27.141 --> 00:46:31.970
low interest loans to buy land.
It's us.
It's the simplest idea in banking.

654
00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:34.363
Didn't happen.

655
00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:39.950
What did happen was a forth effort that became known as the Freedman's bank.

656
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:46.390
The Freedman's bank was chartered in late 1865 it lasted eight,

657
00:46:46.971 --> 00:46:48.020
nine years.

658
00:46:48.021 --> 00:46:53.021
It died in 1874 with obligations to approximately 61,000 depositers.

659
00:46:55.671 --> 00:46:58.880
All former slaves are virtually all former slaves

660
00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:02.610
and the bank died on Frederick Douglass,

661
00:47:02.611 --> 00:47:07.611
his watch as its president because it could not make good on its payments.

662
00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:10.430
It was a good idea

663
00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:18.860
that really wasn't tried at the Freedman's bank,
by the way,

664
00:47:18.861 --> 00:47:23.540
did have some congressional support.
It did have some federal subsidies,

665
00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:27.230
but never enough to make it go or make it work.

666
00:47:27.231 --> 00:47:32.231
Today we bail out bear Stearns in 1874 the federal government in the politics of

667
00:47:33.761 --> 00:47:35.530
1874 is we'll see.

668
00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:38.920
Just let the Freedman's bank die.

669
00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:42.880
Now,
let me leave you with this.

670
00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:47.530
I have I think a minute or so we've learned a great deal,

671
00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:53.190
I think from the first and the second reconstructions in American history.

672
00:47:53.621 --> 00:47:56.170
If we can refer to the civil rights movement as a second reconstruction.

673
00:47:56.410 --> 00:48:00.100
We learned a great deal about how political liberty can be achieved.

674
00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:02.920
The right to vote right the whole office,
serve on a jury,

675
00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:08.140
engage in the political culture in spite of the hostility and the violence and

676
00:48:08.291 --> 00:48:09.124
intimidation.

677
00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:13.030
We've learned a great deal about how what can be achieved with political
liberty,

678
00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:18.240
but we've also learned a lot about what is often not achieved in any kind of

679
00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:23.020
concomitant economic power.

680
00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:29.610
What happens now in the south is a rapid process from slave labor to a whole new

681
00:48:31.091 --> 00:48:35.260
set of economic arrangements in the contract realm.

682
00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:42.060
What blacks most wanted to get away from to kill off as they could was any old

683
00:48:43.961 --> 00:48:45.520
system of gang labor.

684
00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:49.300
They wanted control over the labor in lives of their women.

685
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:54.550
They wanted out of gang labor.
They want to plots of land of their own,

686
00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:59.800
but they faced essentially these three great obstacles and I'll leave you with

687
00:48:59.801 --> 00:49:00.634
this.

688
00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:01.690
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

689
00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:05.560
<v 0>One is that they had inherited almost nothing from slavery with which to buy</v>

690
00:49:05.561 --> 00:49:07.870
land too.

691
00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:12.700
They lived in a non almost nonexistent credit market.

692
00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:18.410
Long term loans were simply not available anywhere and show me a farmer anywhere

693
00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:24.220
in a capitalist economy who can survive without his bank loans

694
00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:27.273
and three,

695
00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:32.940
they face an enormously hostile regime of white supremacy that does not believe

696
00:49:32.981 --> 00:49:35.680
black people should have economic independence.

697
00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:42.610
And eventually what we see happening is the tenant farming and then working on

698
00:49:42.691 --> 00:49:47.691
halves or thirds and then halves and working in a share cropping system becomes

699
00:49:48.721 --> 00:49:49.554
a compromise.

700
00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:55.290
It becomes a compromise because w paying wages to former slaves doesn't work in

701
00:49:55.291 --> 00:49:59.850
an economy that is still cash poor.
There's no cash to pay anybody with,

702
00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:07.190
so blacks actually begin to embrace this idea of being a tenant farmer because

703
00:50:07.321 --> 00:50:11.010
you get your own plot of land,
you have some control over your own labor,

704
00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:14.970
you plant your own seeds,
you own your own tools or you think you do.

705
00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:17.250
At the end of the crop season,
you're going to,

706
00:50:17.251 --> 00:50:19.620
you're going to share half of that crop.

707
00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:23.460
We're the owner of the land and then with the furnishing merchant,

708
00:50:23.461 --> 00:50:25.260
this new institution that evolves,

709
00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:29.780
but you get to keep half and you can at least hope they didn't.

710
00:50:29.781 --> 00:50:34.781
That half comes something like cash that you can keep

711
00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.800
what it really is going to become.
However,

712
00:50:39.801 --> 00:50:44.801
for most not all is a dead end to some extent a dead end kind of debt.

713
00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:48.673
Peonage.

714
00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:53.510
What we do know is this over the next 25 to 30 years,

715
00:50:53.511 --> 00:50:58.511
by about 1890 and certainly by 1900 about 15 to 20% of American Friedman and

716
00:51:02.061 --> 00:51:05.000
their sons and daughters will own their own land.

717
00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:07.590
<v 1>It means about</v>

718
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:12.340
<v 0>80% to 85% did not.</v>

719
00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:19.010
I'll leave you there and suffer on.
