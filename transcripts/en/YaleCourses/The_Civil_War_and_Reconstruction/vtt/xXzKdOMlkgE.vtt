00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.600
The person who's writing drew me into the civil war and I confess

2
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.600
was Bruce Catton.
If any of you ever read any of Bruce Catton?

3
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.343
<v 1>Ah,</v>

4
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.010
<v 0>it's a dwindling number in the 21st century,</v>

5
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.920
but when I was growing up,
Bruce Catton was the great narrative,

6
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.940
popular historian or popular narrative historian of the civil war.

7
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.110
He wrote some seven books or so from the late 1950 [inaudible] through the 1960s

8
00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:53.261
into the 70s he wrote them around the time of the civil war centennial.

9
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.420
He was not an academic historian.

10
00:00:56.421 --> 00:01:01.220
He was a journalist and a former war correspondent and the Second World War,

11
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.760
and the man had a beautiful sense of narrative.
This is,

12
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.560
and from his book,
Terrible Swift Sword,

13
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.050
which is 1862 the year of 1862 of the civil war.

14
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.660
He is trying by,

15
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.560
he's trying to capture the situation,

16
00:01:26.561 --> 00:01:29.910
the strategic situation,
the emotional,
centrum,

17
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.500
sentimental situation,

18
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.840
the mood of already war,
weary America.

19
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.050
A little more than a year into this thing,

20
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.130
which is where we're going to go a little bit further in a moment.

21
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.010
He's talking though essentially about the most important argument I think we can

22
00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:54.380
make about that first year,

23
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.140
year and a half into the second year of the war.

24
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.840
Both sides wanted a limited war.

25
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.140
Remember that and the confederate side,

26
00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:11.141
they just wanted to fight long enough to make the north or the federal

27
00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:14.240
government acknowledged their independence.

28
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.140
The longer the thing went on,
the more dangerous it was.
Of course,

29
00:02:20.141 --> 00:02:24.130
for the confederacy.
They were outmanned outnumbered

30
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.640
lesser resources,
et Cetera.
On the northern side,

31
00:02:30.641 --> 00:02:34.330
it was the state of policy of the Lincoln administration to keep this a limited

32
00:02:34.331 --> 00:02:38.530
war and a great deal more on this next week when we deal with the emancipation

33
00:02:38.531 --> 00:02:39.364
story,

34
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.900
the whole idea again for Lincoln was to keep this from becoming as he put it,

35
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.720
a remorseless revolutionary struggle.

36
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.190
That is exactly what it had become by the summer of 1862 and here is catton's

37
00:02:55.481 --> 00:02:59.650
description.
I can't do it better.

38
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.910
There was no ability in the idea that there ought to be a peace without victory.

39
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.780
You had an August,
or excuse me,

40
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:15.781
by August of 1862 America's tragedy was that it was caught between the madness

41
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:22.621
of going on with the war and the human impossibility of stopping it.

42
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.020
Succession had been a direct result of the outcome of the election of 1860 to

43
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:35.011
restore the status quo would be to assume that either the north or the south had

44
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:37.570
had a great change of heart,

45
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.260
that the north would not again go republican or that the South would quietly

46
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:44.650
acquiesce if it did.

47
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.740
Neither Mr Lincoln nor Mr. Davis was going to assume anything of the kind.

48
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.110
Each man was fighting for a dreadful simplicity.

49
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.490
Neither one could describe a solution acceptable to him without describing

50
00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:05.620
something wholly unacceptable to the other.

51
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.540
Neither man could accept anything less than complete victory without admitting

52
00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:13.990
complete defeat.

53
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.240
Both sides that heard the trumpet that could never call retreat.

54
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.500
The peacemakers could not be heard until the terrible swift sword had been.

55
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:27.334
She used,

56
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.060
but the scabbard had been thrown away and now the confederacy was carrying the

57
00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:36.790
war into the enemy's country.

58
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.993
Well,

59
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.390
never call retreat is of course a very war like language.
But,
uh,

60
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.280
this was an awful and horrible war.

61
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.140
<v 1>Okay.</v>

62
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.130
<v 0>Now Lincoln of course,</v>

63
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:58.630
and you've read now some documents on this and if you started to watch the Ken

64
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.310
Burns film series,
which by the way is now up on the classes server,
excuse me,

65
00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:07.240
it is up on the classes server and if,
well,
no,

66
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:12.160
it's up on syndics,
but as Sam Shaffer,
just inform me,

67
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.780
if you go to the classes server,

68
00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:18.781
there is a message and what's a carbon or information and under announcements

69
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:21.700
that tells you exactly again how to use the URL.

70
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.260
If any of you are already tapped in and uh huh.
Okay.

71
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.540
Make sure your watch episodes two and three through the one entitled for ever

72
00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:35.140
free,
you know,
maybe bar this weekend,

73
00:05:35.141 --> 00:05:38.270
certainly by the beginning of next week.
Uh,

74
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.050
at any rate in that film series,

75
00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:45.070
you'll see that Burns chose to make George being McClellan,

76
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.390
a kind of comic relief.
His vanity,

77
00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:54.190
his arrogance is subordination is almost incredible.

78
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.510
Uh,
if complex hatred of Abraham Lincoln,

79
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.250
Edwin Stanton,

80
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.300
and all the leadership for the federal government that he was commanding the

81
00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:06.134
army for.

82
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.790
Lincoln wanted a strategy in the wake of Bull,

83
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:13.760
run the disaster at bull run that summer in July,

84
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.590
he puts Mcclellan in charge of the army of the Potomac,
as I said the other day,

85
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:19.240
Carl,

86
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.170
and takes them into huge encampments all around Washington DC and began in

87
00:06:24.171 --> 00:06:29.090
August,
September,
October and through the fall to drill this army,
train it,

88
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:35.020
and they came to loving that is all these green young soldier boys from all over

89
00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:37.814
the north.

90
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.110
And then we're arriving now and a whole new regiments week after week after
week,

91
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.920
all formed and local communities across the north.

92
00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:48.610
<v 1>Okay.</v>

93
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:49.720
<v 0>The vast,
vast,</v>

94
00:06:49.721 --> 00:06:54.400
vast majority of them had never showed her in any kind of musket in their lives

95
00:06:54.401 --> 00:06:56.560
except possibly in a local militia.

96
00:06:56.561 --> 00:06:59.170
And only a tiny percentage of them had ever been in a militia.

97
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.850
They actually grew to kind of love McMullen at first because he helped great

98
00:07:03.851 --> 00:07:04.684
parades.

99
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:05.820
<v 1>Okay,</v>

100
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:06.601
<v 0>great parades.</v>

101
00:07:06.601 --> 00:07:10.140
You made a marsh like hell and train like hell and learn how to march sideways

102
00:07:10.141 --> 00:07:14.190
and forward and backward in retreat and do all that stuff.
The man,

103
00:07:14.191 --> 00:07:15.990
when he held a parade,
it was cool.

104
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.470
They also hadn't seen any war yet.

105
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.850
He didn't move the army like I want them to move at that fall,

106
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.930
go back into Virginia,
go find that confederate army again,

107
00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:31.770
find it on the right ground somewhere,
attack it in the war.

108
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:39.120
Uh,
not going to happen.
This young,
35 year old,

109
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.220
uh,
general,
um,

110
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:46.370
was a very cautious soul who would've thought that I would be called up to save

111
00:07:48.181 --> 00:07:52.830
my country,
seven McLeod.
And we have those amazing letters.

112
00:07:52.831 --> 00:07:55.350
He kept writing to his wife over and over and over.

113
00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.690
I am called to save my country is buffoons in Washington.

114
00:08:00.691 --> 00:08:03.390
Don't know what they're doing.
Stanton is an idiot.

115
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.490
And at one point he called Lincoln a baboo.

116
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.113
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

117
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.390
<v 0>No,
it actually got into the public.</v>

118
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:13.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

119
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.770
<v 0>He was also make no mistake and it's very important,</v>

120
00:08:15.771 --> 00:08:18.200
especially when we get into 62,

121
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.020
he was a pro slavery Democrat.

122
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.820
He was the farthest thing you could imagine in the union army from an

123
00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:30.620
abolitionist McClellan wanted nothing to do with a remorseless revolutionary

124
00:08:30.621 --> 00:08:31.454
struggle.

125
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:36.440
He did not want to move huge armies into the Virginia or into the south,

126
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:42.160
into densely populated slave areas because he did not want to destroy slavery.

127
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.660
He saw that as a revolution.
No Army could somehow control.

128
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.180
He even wrote that fall to a democratic congressman and said,

129
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.300
you must help me help me dodge the nigger,

130
00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.610
which the way he put it,

131
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.830
by January Lincoln was impatient to say the least.

132
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:10.700
Mcclellan caught typhoid fever and was really quite sick for most of a month and

133
00:09:12.031 --> 00:09:16.380
refuse to even answer Lincoln's messages at times.

134
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.140
This is the president of United States is commander in chief is sending him

135
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:22.830
messages,
couriers and for days McAllen wouldn't have an answer him.

136
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.810
And then there's the famous message that Lincoln sends in February I believe,

137
00:09:30.091 --> 00:09:35.020
of 62 sends a message to Cologne and says,
uh,
uh,

138
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.460
general,
if you're not going to use your army,

139
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.290
my Thai borrow it.

140
00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:47.860
Let's move out West.

141
00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:56.000
It was the war is going to break out all over the west whether anybody wanted it

142
00:09:56.001 --> 00:09:59.240
to or not,
whether anybody planned it or

143
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.060
<v 1>I'll get the outline back up there in case you didn't.</v>

144
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.860
Sorry.
Good to see it.

145
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.270
Uh Huh.

146
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.220
<v 0>I don't know if you can see all of this in the back row,</v>

147
00:10:29.221 --> 00:10:34.221
but I hope you can see enough to understand that what we have here is the region

148
00:10:34.291 --> 00:10:37.380
of Alabama,
Mississippi,
Tennessee,
Kentucky,

149
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.110
and over into Missouri,

150
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.900
Arkansas and so on.

151
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.250
The war broke out in the West is essentially a river war,

152
00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:50.710
a river war for the

153
00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:56.050
the Tennessee in the Cumberland rivers in Tennessee.

154
00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.010
Now you only need to look at a map and with one eye open to understand how

155
00:11:00.011 --> 00:11:05.011
important Tennessee would be in this war if Kentucky has still not seceded from

156
00:11:05.411 --> 00:11:07.300
the union and officially will not,

157
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.340
and if Kentucky remains any kind of buffer for the union,

158
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:19.100
Tennessee is where the war is going to be fought in the west.
Certainly at first,

159
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:20.510
and it surely was

160
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:22.993
<v 1>now</v>

161
00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:25.391
<v 0>at first,</v>

162
00:11:25.391 --> 00:11:29.500
the war in the West was essentially fought with gunboats little iron clad

163
00:11:29.501 --> 00:11:33.610
gunboats and armies on the land.

164
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:39.900
But the first major conflicts in the west were to try to hold on the side of the

165
00:11:41.381 --> 00:11:44.440
confederacy and to take on the,
um,

166
00:11:44.441 --> 00:11:47.890
the northern side to Ford's one called Fort Donaldson,

167
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:54.310
I want to call Ford Henry one on the Cumberland one,
the Tennessee river.

168
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.030
These rivers were terribly important for transportation.
Now,

169
00:11:58.031 --> 00:11:59.980
especially military transportation.

170
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.270
They flowed down to Nashville,
one of them,

171
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.290
the other flowed southward and then into northern Georgia.

172
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:14.040
These rivers would be invasion corridors that feel like invasion paths for the

173
00:12:14.111 --> 00:12:15.040
northern armies.

174
00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:19.900
They were extremely important for supply and transportation for the south,

175
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:22.780
and hence these relatively small forts.

176
00:12:22.781 --> 00:12:27.430
That guard of these two rivers suddenly became the focal point in February,

177
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.730
uh,
by,
uh,
by February,
1862,

178
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.950
the union forces that would attack Fort Henry first and then Fort Donaldson were

179
00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:40.951
commanded by a young only in his early forties,

180
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:47.250
a general who had been promoted rapidly from colonel named Ulysses s grant.

181
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:56.170
Now grant,
as many of you may know,
uh,
well,

182
00:12:56.171 --> 00:13:01.171
grant has had a huge revival in scholarship in the last oh two decades.

183
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:05.620
He was for a long time,
all but forgotten in American history,

184
00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.170
partly because his presidency was so awful,

185
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:13.590
and we'll deal with that later on in the course or in some ways so awful.

186
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.960
He got miserably depressed and took to drinking.
That part's true.

187
00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:24.780
When he was stationed way out in California in the late 1850s,
uh,

188
00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:30.130
he was a bit of a drunk in those years and he resigned from the army.

189
00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:34.330
He had been a veteran of the Mexican war decorated.

190
00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:40.180
We quit the army,
bored,
depressed,
and he went back to Illinois.

191
00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.040
Is Home,
well,
born in Ohio,

192
00:13:42.041 --> 00:13:46.990
but he went back to Illinois and he was working as the story goes,

193
00:13:46.991 --> 00:13:51.580
it's not a legend in his brother's leather shop and Galena,
Illinois.

194
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.350
When the civil war broke out,

195
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.690
and because he was a west point graduate and the only one around,

196
00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:01.710
they named him colonel and he led the regiment that was formed from that area of

197
00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:06.820
North West Illinois and off to war.

198
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:08.800
Wouldn't.
Ulysses grant.

199
00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:14.500
Ulysses grant is a classic example and I want to,

200
00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:19.740
I want to give you an illustration of this is a classic example of an American,

201
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.520
an American male for whom most of the rest of life business profession except

202
00:14:31.541 --> 00:14:34.960
for horseback riding,
and he was a hell of a horseman.

203
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.750
Almost everything else in his life had been a failure or near failure or simply

204
00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:45.610
boring.
He'd grown up on farms,
but he hated farming.

205
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:53.670
He's a classic example of how sometimes war,

206
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:58.670
tragically or unfortunately can make a person.

207
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:04.220
We're not for the American civil war.
You'd have never heard of Ulysses s grant.

208
00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:06.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

209
00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.720
<v 0>This is bill McPhee,
Lee's description,
William McFeely,</v>

210
00:15:08.721 --> 00:15:12.350
who was written the finest biography of grant,
I think still ever done,

211
00:15:12.351 --> 00:15:16.880
although there've been many since
he's describing grants,

212
00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:21.881
a situation and Galena and how bored he was depressed he was and so on.

213
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.410
And then McFeely rights
war,

214
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:32.240
the ordinary man's escape from the ordinary.

215
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:38.560
It was a way out of a leather store and for some men it is much more than that.

216
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.800
It is the fulfillment that the world will yield and no other manner.

217
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.970
For these men wore appears as a refutation of evil,

218
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.760
whether it be the evil of Hitler's threat to mark blocks France or the slave

219
00:15:51.761 --> 00:15:56.300
holders,
threat to throws America or less exalted,
but no less real.

220
00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:01.450
The evil of personal hollowness war for a man like Ulysses grant was the only

221
00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:09.161
situation in which he could truly connect to his country and countrymen and be

222
00:16:10.461 --> 00:16:14.270
at one with them and his self himself.

223
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:19.760
Grant did not like the vain glory of victory or the drama of high strategy or

224
00:16:19.761 --> 00:16:23.900
the blood of battle,
and he did not think of all wars worth fighting,

225
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.060
that all was worth fighting.

226
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:31.720
Yet some essential part of his being was broadened to play only in War II.

227
00:16:33.051 --> 00:16:36.350
Never celebrated this fact,
but neither did he deny it.

228
00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:41.980
He knew it was true only in war and possibly at the end of his life in writing

229
00:16:43.161 --> 00:16:47.150
about the war and what would be the greatest memoir of this war.

230
00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:52.630
Did he find the completeness of experience that when engaged in it so intensely

231
00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.453
moved in?

232
00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.080
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

233
00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:02.100
<v 0>Well,
grandma was a soldier</v>

234
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.820
and not unlike Robert E.
Lee.

235
00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:10.290
He did enjoy the spirit of battle.

236
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.430
I don't know if there's any doubt about that.
And he moved down these forts.

237
00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:19.460
First Fort Henry [inaudible] February six with about 15,000 men on land and a

238
00:17:19.651 --> 00:17:22.530
bunch of slow,
cumbersome gunboats.

239
00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:28.370
Fort Henry was not well defended and basically just surrendered a week later on

240
00:17:29.851 --> 00:17:31.530
the other river,
the Cumberland,

241
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:33.260
<v 1>okay.</v>

242
00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.620
<v 0>Fort Donaldson was shelled into submission by artillery.</v>

243
00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.550
This was the second week of February,

244
00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:45.550
1862 and grant famously demanded and unconditional surrender from generals,

245
00:17:46.111 --> 00:17:48.200
Simon Boulevard Buckner,

246
00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.250
who had been grants roommate at West Point.

247
00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:56.060
There's a wonderful exchange of their dispatches that you can read if you want

248
00:17:56.061 --> 00:18:00.780
to look it up,
easy to find grant rights to,
to uh,

249
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:05.130
Buckner and says,
hello friend,
I,

250
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:09.300
you will surrender all of your forces and all of your guns or I will move on.

251
00:18:09.301 --> 00:18:14.210
You immediately.
And Buckner writes back and says,
well,
now,
wow,
now Ulysses can't.

252
00:18:14.211 --> 00:18:18.270
Can we talk?
Grant writes back and says,
no.

253
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.960
And of course the press will pick this up.
You ask,

254
00:18:24.961 --> 00:18:28.110
grant will become unconditional surrender grant.

255
00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:33.250
The significance of Ford's Donaldson and Henry were not only symbolic because

256
00:18:33.251 --> 00:18:36.540
the northern press pick this up waiting for war.
I mean,
got it.

257
00:18:36.541 --> 00:18:39.180
Months and months and months had gone by since bull run,

258
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:42.750
there've been very few engagements.
The armies were growing all over the country.

259
00:18:42.751 --> 00:18:46.350
Men were going off to war and writing letters home to their mothers,

260
00:18:46.351 --> 00:18:51.300
sweethearts and families.
Here was some real war and some union victory.

261
00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:55.590
Now hero,
most importantly,

262
00:18:55.591 --> 00:18:59.730
strategically though the city of Nashville,

263
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:01.380
capital of Tennessee,

264
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:02.730
<v 1>yeah.</v>

265
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.040
<v 0>Had to be abandoned by the confederates.</v>

266
00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.870
They could no longer defend it and they did abandoned.

267
00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:15.880
It was partly a strategic retreat and partly out of the reality.

268
00:19:15.881 --> 00:19:17.410
Then I'm the people to defend it.

269
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:19.410
<v 1>Okay.</v>

270
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.480
<v 0>And a confederate army beginning to grow.</v>

271
00:19:21.481 --> 00:19:26.481
Now this into the spring of 1862 as thousands more southern boys and men with

272
00:19:27.661 --> 00:19:32.661
leave those farms and hundreds of regiments from Mississippi,

273
00:19:33.301 --> 00:19:36.390
Alabama,
Louisiana,
and Texas in particular.

274
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.500
They will come to join the army of Albert Sidney Johnston,

275
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:44.760
who led the confederate small confederate army out of Nashville,

276
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.910
down south,

277
00:19:47.911 --> 00:19:51.180
westward into southwest Tennessee.

278
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.170
Just across the border to the town of Corinth,
Mississippi,

279
00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:58.080
and it was around Corinth,

280
00:19:58.081 --> 00:20:03.081
Mississippi in the North East tip corner of myth of the state of Mississippi

281
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.330
that a huge confederate army was assembled.

282
00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:08.783
<v 1>Now,</v>

283
00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:14.120
<v 0>grant was now put in command of all union forces all over Tennessee.</v>

284
00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.090
Grant though,

285
00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:22.730
had no idea really what the confederates were going to do and what happened at

286
00:20:22.731 --> 00:20:25.430
the battle of Shiloh was not only the first major,

287
00:20:25.431 --> 00:20:29.330
horrible bloody battle of the war and was shocked the country,

288
00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:34.520
but it was a total surprise to the union forces.
Put simply,

289
00:20:34.521 --> 00:20:37.370
here's what happened.
Albert,

290
00:20:37.371 --> 00:20:40.160
Sidney Johnston had about 40,000 troops at Corinth.

291
00:20:40.161 --> 00:20:45.161
Mississippi grant had at his disposal about 60,000 troops.

292
00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:51.460
He's just still the size of the army that will begin to unfold in eastern

293
00:20:52.331 --> 00:20:56.920
Virginia.
The grant had his army split in two

294
00:20:57.930 --> 00:20:58.500
<v 1>okay.</v>

295
00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:03.500
<v 0>And and widely apart about one third of it was under the command of a general</v>

296
00:21:03.631 --> 00:21:07.170
named Don Carlos Buell,
and he was in central Tennessee.

297
00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:12.680
Grants forces were sort of more western Tennessee and both were slowly trying to

298
00:21:13.681 --> 00:21:18.681
move down toward south western Tennessee and maybe even into Mississippi.

299
00:21:18.931 --> 00:21:23.931
To find this confederate army in March and early April of 62

300
00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:32.640
what happened was it Albert Sidney Johnston attempted a surprise attack,

301
00:21:32.641 --> 00:21:36.770
and it was one of the most successful surprise attacks by these large unwieldy

302
00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.000
army is that ever happened in this war.

303
00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:44.130
He marched his men 20,000 excuse me,
20 miles,

304
00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:49.340
most of it in darkness with all kinds of clothing and burlap used as muffling on

305
00:21:51.721 --> 00:21:54.060
the wheels of caissons and wagons.

306
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:59.300
Even men were told to put muffling on their boots and they marched through the

307
00:22:00.271 --> 00:22:01.470
night in the dark,

308
00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:06.650
April 5th to sixth 1862 north from Corinth cross the border into Tennessee and

309
00:22:10.471 --> 00:22:15.471
they attacked our remnant sizable remnant of grants forces that had just reached

310
00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:21.660
a place called Pittsburgh landing or Shiloh church,
as it's known,

311
00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.340
it's a tiny little village.

312
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

313
00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:29.180
<v 0>And what happened on the first day at Shiloh was the bloodiest day of the war</v>

314
00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:30.710
until that point in time,

315
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:36.590
grants troops were literally caught with their pants down.

316
00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:41.000
They had no pickets out.
They had no idea where the confederate army really was,

317
00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.190
nor specialist that they were that close.

318
00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:47.900
There are many famous descriptions of this and soldiers letters and diaries and

319
00:22:47.901 --> 00:22:52.901
afterward by Ambrose Bierce especially of how this sneak attack had caught them

320
00:22:54.111 --> 00:22:57.230
literally around their tents in the morning making coffee,

321
00:22:57.231 --> 00:22:59.210
some of them without their pants.
On.

322
00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:04.900
The first day at Shiloh was a complete confederate victory.

323
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:09.640
It drove the union forces right back to the river,
the Tennessee river,

324
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:14.080
and by the time grant and one of his other generals,

325
00:23:14.081 --> 00:23:16.510
William Tecumseh Sherman arrived that night.

326
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:22.560
They found remnants of this completely defeated union fourth hiding on the banks

327
00:23:23.831 --> 00:23:28.270
of the Tennessee river.
Many of them having lost their regimens,

328
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:32.050
lost their command,
lost their officers,
didn't know where they were.

329
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.540
Through the dark of night,

330
00:23:34.541 --> 00:23:39.541
April 6th to seventh it was a specialty Sherman and other officers as Don Carlos

331
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.700
Bules,
20,000 men arrived at in the middle of that night,

332
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:52.750
Sherman and other officers literally at times whipped union soldiers into order,

333
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.220
tried to help men find their units.

334
00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.030
And when dawn came the next day,

335
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:07.570
they counter attacked across the same fields and savage hand to hand combat

336
00:24:09.021 --> 00:24:12.710
that.
And all of these soldiers had never experienced and never seen.

337
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:20.870
And by the end of it,
they completely reversed the first day's action.

338
00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:27.110
Battle of Shiloh took place in an area about a mile to a mile and a half in

339
00:24:27.811 --> 00:24:31.920
diameter.
And by the end of the second day,

340
00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:37.790
as grant famously put it in one of the very few moments in his two volume memoir

341
00:24:37.861 --> 00:24:42.210
where he ever kind of really broke down and describe the current edge.
He said,

342
00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:46.740
I could have walked across that field as far as the eye could see and never

343
00:24:46.741 --> 00:24:49.440
touch the ground by walking on the bodies

344
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:54.380
for the two armies.
In 48 hours,

345
00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:57.830
there were 23,841 casualties,

346
00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:02.690
23,841 casualty.

347
00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:08.853
<v 1>No,</v>

348
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:14.010
<v 0>Shiloh strategically was,</v>

349
00:25:14.011 --> 00:25:18.000
this was a union success in the simple fact that,

350
00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:21.390
you know,
the confederate army had to retreat

351
00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:28.160
back into Mississippi and did not succeed in reentering Tennessee and opening up

352
00:25:29.071 --> 00:25:33.450
a new front in Tennessee or taking control of the Tennessee river in that
region.

353
00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:39.660
But it was truly a shock to the country when these casual dealers came back and

354
00:25:39.661 --> 00:25:42.800
were published in newspapers and when they adjutants of regiments,

355
00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.460
which was the job of an origin and a regimen was to record the casualties and

356
00:25:47.461 --> 00:25:48.300
send them home.

357
00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:51.293
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

358
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:56.500
<v 0>And it was of course that site where grant remembered realizing for the first</v>

359
00:25:57.621 --> 00:25:58.280
time,

360
00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:03.280
and I had that quote up here the other day and you can read it in gap where he

361
00:26:04.131 --> 00:26:07.340
said it was at that moment I realized that this work could never be,

362
00:26:07.341 --> 00:26:12.341
that the union could never be preserved without what he called complete conquest

363
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:14.060
of the south.

364
00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:17.643
<v 1>Okay.</v>

365
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:22.850
<v 0>That's what Bruce Catton men.
Wow.
The scabbard was being thrown away.</v>

366
00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.920
It was now a war where no one would ever call retreat.

367
00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:34.180
Now back east,
back to the melodrama between um,

368
00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:40.040
McClellan
and Lincoln.

369
00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.770
Nope.
That's not the one,
excuse me.

370
00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.080
I think you can see enough of this

371
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.580
now.
Mclellan throughout that winter kept training,

372
00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:02.550
training and training the army of the Potomac,

373
00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:09.290
and he did train them in to what any military store and still say it was one of

374
00:27:10.561 --> 00:27:14.220
the most efficient and certainly the best supplied armies the world had ever

375
00:27:14.221 --> 00:27:15.054
seen.

376
00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:20.300
He would have almost a hundred thousand troops.

377
00:27:20.301 --> 00:27:25.080
She'd have 90,000 in the field,
100,000 troops under his command,

378
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:31.430
and he came up with a plan that Lincoln hated Edmunds stand secretary of war.

379
00:27:31.731 --> 00:27:36.120
It didn't like it.
Officers around him didn't particularly like it,

380
00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.190
but it was Mcclellan's idea.

381
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:42.570
Mcallen did not want to invade Virginia from the north.

382
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:47.940
He thought it would be a better idea to sale the entire army of the Potomac,

383
00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:50.370
down the Potomac river,

384
00:27:50.371 --> 00:27:55.371
out into Chesapeake Bay and land on the peninsula between the York and the James

385
00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.560
Rivers in Virginia

386
00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:02.560
and invade Virginia toward Richmond.

387
00:28:02.561 --> 00:28:06.850
The capitol of the confederacy take the enemy's capital,
was his aim here.

388
00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:12.480
A strategy eventually that you to this grant is going to tear it to shreds and

389
00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:16.990
quickly realized as he was realizing out in the West that the confederacy was

390
00:28:16.991 --> 00:28:19.450
its armies,
not it's capital,

391
00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:24.760
not a city here at town there the idea was to land,

392
00:28:24.761 --> 00:28:25.810
this is huge,

393
00:28:25.811 --> 00:28:30.811
full till of an army on the coast and March at 60 70 miles inland and attack

394
00:28:32.921 --> 00:28:34.000
Richmond from the east.

395
00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:37.960
Now part of the theory here it was that the confederacy had been fortifying the

396
00:28:37.961 --> 00:28:41.080
north side of Richmond but maybe not the east side.

397
00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:44.110
Now it's no surprise folks,

398
00:28:44.111 --> 00:28:48.390
if you float 90,000 people down the river and land them on the coast and you,

399
00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.110
you might be coming from the east,

400
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:52.860
<v 1>what wouldn't be whole,</v>

401
00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:55.910
<v 0>but this is where,</v>

402
00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:59.560
I mean I don't want to make Mcclellan into just comic relief like Burns does.

403
00:28:59.561 --> 00:29:01.930
I think he overdoes it,
but here it is.

404
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:06.110
It is important to understand the generals did have impact on this war.

405
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:13.090
It was not that McClellan had a personal distaste for battle necessarily.

406
00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.450
Those charges that he was somehow a coward and all that.

407
00:29:17.451 --> 00:29:19.130
I don't think that holds up at all,

408
00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:24.970
but he did not like huge general engagements and he did not want to sacrifice

409
00:29:27.171 --> 00:29:30.350
any more men than he had to.
And remember,

410
00:29:30.351 --> 00:29:34.070
he doesn't want the war to become remorseless.

411
00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:36.923
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

412
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.930
<v 0>he put the town of York town on the coast.</v>

413
00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:44.610
The same Yorktown were Cornwallis and surrender to George Washington,

414
00:29:44.611 --> 00:29:45.600
the American revolution.

415
00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:50.840
He Put York town under siege when he landed for an entire month from April 5th

416
00:29:52.921 --> 00:29:57.921
to May 4th because McClellan was convinced that he was confronted with far more

417
00:29:58.141 --> 00:30:01.950
men than he really was.
At one point,

418
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:05.610
Mcclellan actually wrote a dispatch,
the secretary of war Stanton,

419
00:30:05.611 --> 00:30:10.611
claiming that he was facing on the peninsula at least 200,000 confederates.

420
00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.580
There weren't 200,000 confederates,
underarms,

421
00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:19.670
anywhere in the south in 1862 when McClellan was always overestimating his

422
00:30:20.761 --> 00:30:24.980
enemy.
He hired the Pinkerton detectives.

423
00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:27.770
He hired this guy named low with his balloons.

424
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:30.650
This was the first use of balloons and warfare.

425
00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:34.730
They float these things up in the air and the gold and they'd float over the

426
00:30:34.731 --> 00:30:37.880
enemy and they try to count the forces and they'd hope the wind was right,

427
00:30:37.881 --> 00:30:41.990
the float them back and land them.
They were pretty cumbersome,
lawful thing.
Well,

428
00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:42.231
you know,

429
00:30:42.231 --> 00:30:45.830
one time the thing floated and it crashed and the other side of the confederate

430
00:30:45.831 --> 00:30:46.664
troops,

431
00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:50.780
he was getting his intelligence from all these new modern ways and every time he

432
00:30:50.781 --> 00:30:51.710
got intelligence,

433
00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:55.960
it's apparent that McAllen would just start doing some multiplication.

434
00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:01.950
Oh,
there's so many stories about this.
I'll spare you.

435
00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:06.220
He didn't need to put a dark,
dark town under siege for a month.

436
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:09.840
He could have taken it in 48 hours.
Kind of.

437
00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:13.190
Confederates had built a lot of fortifications,
huge fortifications,

438
00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.200
but didn't have very many men behind it,

439
00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:22.770
and we're one officer might see one confederate and field glass.

440
00:31:22.791 --> 00:31:25.100
Mcallen would see five or 10

441
00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:30.690
given this caution,
given this slowness,

442
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:36.040
the confederate command in Richmond sent the young generals,

443
00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.390
stonewall Jackson.

444
00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:39.430
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

445
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:43.060
<v 0>With about 20,000 men over to the Shenandoah valley here.</v>

446
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:44.583
<v 1>Okay.</v>

447
00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:48.180
<v 0>Wow.
Mcclellan Atlanta,</v>

448
00:31:48.181 --> 00:31:52.080
this massive army on the peninsula was slowly beginning to move.

449
00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:56.460
They sent stonewall Jackson with an Army of about 20,000 under the Shenandoah

450
00:31:56.461 --> 00:31:59.670
valley where stonewall Jackson conducted one of the most famous military

451
00:31:59.671 --> 00:32:03.570
campaigns in history,
and they still teach this and my new detail at West Point,

452
00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.073
<v 1>okay.</v>

453
00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:07.600
<v 0>Actually only had about 17,000 men.</v>

454
00:32:07.601 --> 00:32:12.220
The purpose of this was to throw fear into northern Virginia,

455
00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:17.910
fear into the Capitol in Washington and to keep about 30,000 union troops in

456
00:32:18.851 --> 00:32:21.370
northern Virginia.
The McClellan had left behind.

457
00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:26.470
The idea here was that McClellan would move from the East 30,000 roughly union

458
00:32:26.471 --> 00:32:30.310
troops and moved from the north and they would crush rich Richmond from two

459
00:32:30.311 --> 00:32:32.650
sides and the war would be over by July.

460
00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:37.090
Confederates saw this and they said,
all right,

461
00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:43.900
Jackson spent the period April 29 to June five five weeks roughly marching all

462
00:32:46.731 --> 00:32:51.200
up and down the Shenandoah valley,
driving his men to utter exhaustion.

463
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:53.210
20 and 25 miles a day.

464
00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:58.420
He fought five major battles march 400 miles in those five weeks for lots of

465
00:33:00.051 --> 00:33:02.690
kind of contact rear guard actions.

466
00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:08.940
It alluded three different union armies or parts of union armies at various

467
00:33:09.951 --> 00:33:12.590
times through fear into Washington,

468
00:33:12.591 --> 00:33:16.550
kept the 30,000 union troops all occupied in northern Virginia and western

469
00:33:16.551 --> 00:33:21.551
Virginia and then escaped back down the valley and back to Richmond.

470
00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:25.910
By the time McClellan attacked,

471
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:31.280
it wasn't extraordinary campaign.
It made stonewall Jackson's fame.

472
00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:35.443
<v 1>Now</v>

473
00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:40.850
<v 0>the first major contact finally between the Union forces and confederate forces</v>

474
00:33:40.851 --> 00:33:45.851
on the peninsula came at a place called seven pines or five oaks.

475
00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:53.690
It's a place about some six seven miles is the Richmond.

476
00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:58.930
It would be the first major bloody affair for this army of the Potomac and I

477
00:34:01.971 --> 00:34:06.971
want to describe it for you by simply reading excerpts from a few letters of a

478
00:34:07.281 --> 00:34:12.281
union soldier leading up to the moment of his first major battle.

479
00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:17.090
I want to do this in part because we need to understand,

480
00:34:17.091 --> 00:34:20.820
and we'll come back to this question a bit later there.

481
00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:24.440
What a common soldier out there in the field understands about what is happening

482
00:34:24.441 --> 00:34:26.690
is of course almost always a blur.

483
00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.720
It's the fog of war that he sees.

484
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.850
I had the opportunity about,
Oh God,

485
00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.500
15 years ago now to edit a collection of civil war letters that were locked in

486
00:34:39.501 --> 00:34:40.400
my lap.

487
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.840
A young soldier from Massachusetts and I'm Charles Brewster.

488
00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.940
Charley Brewster was a store clerk in North Hampton,
Massachusetts.

489
00:34:49.941 --> 00:34:54.590
One of the civil war broke out and they,
April of 61 he was 27 years old.

490
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:58.640
He felt like a total failure in life.
He was not yet married.

491
00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:04.210
He had nothing going on and he enlisted as fast as he could and the 10th

492
00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:09.260
Massachusetts and he spent that whole fall and winter of 61 62 in camp and I'm

493
00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:14.180
will mentioned Charlie again next week because Charlie was,

494
00:35:14.181 --> 00:35:15.650
no abolition is trust me,

495
00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:21.520
but he comes to realize through this experience that the war has to destroy

496
00:35:21.831 --> 00:35:22.664
slavery.

497
00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:28.670
Interesting model of the average Yankee,

498
00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:34.120
but he wrote incredible letters always to his mother or his sister.

499
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:42.350
He writes this on May 20th Battle Fair oaks or seven pines occurred on May 31st

500
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:47.490
of 1862 he knows a big battles coming.

501
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:51.900
They don't know exactly where or when it is raining like hell.

502
00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:55.650
He's sleeping in the mud on what he calls a rubber blanket.

503
00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:00.330
He gets diarrhea that nearly as killing him and he will almost die of diarrhea

504
00:36:00.331 --> 00:36:01.500
twice in this war,

505
00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:06.890
but he keeps writing to his mother and one morning the rain has stopped and he's

506
00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:11.430
tells her what a beautiful morning it is.
Mother,

507
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.150
I wish you could see what a splendid morning this is.

508
00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:20.970
The trees are in full foliage and the birds are singing in the trees and the

509
00:36:20.971 --> 00:36:25.971
water ripples and sparks at my feet with the sun shining gloriously overall and

510
00:36:27.331 --> 00:36:32.280
if were not for the regimen I see before me each with his deadly Enfield rifle

511
00:36:32.281 --> 00:36:33.150
on his shoulder.

512
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:38.970
I could hardly imagine that there was a war anywhere in the land.

513
00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:44.440
<v 1>Now Day</v>

514
00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:49.090
<v 0>by day he writes every day to his mother.
Long Letters.</v>

515
00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:54.360
I mean some of these letters hand written were 15 to 20 page letter and he wrote

516
00:36:54.881 --> 00:36:58.090
about 240 of them in the course of the war.

517
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:04.890
May 22nd in a Cloverfield.
He says,

518
00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:06.173
dear mother,

519
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:12.190
it is just sunset and most beautiful day though it has been dreadful hot.

520
00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:17.490
How's relieved this morning from my grand do guard duty at general keys

521
00:37:17.491 --> 00:37:21.480
headquarters joined the regimen and immediately took up my line of March with

522
00:37:21.481 --> 00:37:22.314
them.

523
00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:27.450
We came on about two miles or perhaps not quite as far as that and bivouacked in

524
00:37:27.451 --> 00:37:31.170
this field,
which is the best place we have had since we left.

525
00:37:31.171 --> 00:37:36.171
Warrick are small brigade is in the advance and we go out on picket frequently.

526
00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:39.050
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

527
00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:43.010
<v 0>we do not know anything of what is going on in the world outside of our camp.</v>

528
00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:46.010
How I wish I could see a late paper.

529
00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:49.910
We've got a rumor that there's been a battle out in Corinth,

530
00:37:49.911 --> 00:37:54.200
Mississippi and at Bora garden.
23,000 men are prisoners,

531
00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.630
but I presume there is no truth in it.

532
00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:01.550
Artillery Tillery had a skirmish last night in a swamp and the front.

533
00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.480
We're expecting a great battle mom,

534
00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:11.830
but I reckon that little Mac will make his dispositions for it and the cavalry I

535
00:38:13.311 --> 00:38:15.830
sorry,
and the chivalry,
which means to the south.

536
00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:20.900
We'll take a distant view of his preparations and then skedaddle his usual.

537
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:25.190
If they don't,
they won't get a terrible looking though.

538
00:38:25.191 --> 00:38:28.700
It is reported that they are concentrating everything there.

539
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.650
And I've got 140,000 troops
are contraband,

540
00:38:33.651 --> 00:38:36.340
meaning an escaped slave that came in yesterday,

541
00:38:36.341 --> 00:38:40.420
says that they are talking terrible,
fierce about burning Richmond,

542
00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:44.740
fighting over the ashes.
But I think that's all Bosh

543
00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:52.350
Thursday morning,
may 23
on picket,

544
00:38:52.351 --> 00:38:54.060
he says,
dear mother,

545
00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:58.950
captain and myself slept under the same blanket last night and on the ground in

546
00:38:58.951 --> 00:39:03.930
front of the muskets and it was a harder and it was harder than Pharaoh's heart,

547
00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.720
but it promotes early rising

548
00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:12.030
for it's now 7:00 AM and I'd been up for three hours

549
00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:19.840
in an old field Saturday may 24

550
00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:21.860
<v 1>okay.</v>

551
00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:26.860
<v 0>I had the best view of the army in motion there that I ever had as they came</v>

552
00:39:27.021 --> 00:39:31.040
down a long slope of low hills to the creek and then up the other side.

553
00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:33.980
And as we arrived at the top of the ladder slope,

554
00:39:33.981 --> 00:39:38.810
I turned and took a look back and could see the long line looking like an

555
00:39:38.811 --> 00:39:43.811
enormous snake winding back for two and three miles and bristling with bayonets

556
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:49.610
and at a short distance the stars and Stripes and the flags at different states

557
00:39:49.611 --> 00:39:53.480
and the Guido's presenting a scene that occurs.

558
00:39:53.481 --> 00:39:58.481
But once in a great while it is raining like great guns again and the order has

559
00:40:00.231 --> 00:40:04.100
come to pack up and move on.

560
00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:06.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

561
00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:07.610
<v 0>Oh dear mother,</v>

562
00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:12.940
this is the next day a large male has come and everybody has got something but

563
00:40:13.421 --> 00:40:17.240
me,
I cannot write anymore under such circumstances.

564
00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:19.940
So goodbye my love to all.

565
00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:26.120
And if you can any of you spare time,
please write me a letter.

566
00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:32.450
Love Charlie Wednesday,

567
00:40:32.451 --> 00:40:34.100
May 28th dear mother,

568
00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:38.990
today the sun shines brightly and it is brazen hot,

569
00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:44.750
but at half past two this company has got to go out and digging the trenches for

570
00:40:44.751 --> 00:40:47.390
two hours.
One thing is very certain,

571
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:50.540
if they do not take Richmond soon,

572
00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:56.530
it will kill the whole army by this ceaseless exposure and toil.

573
00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:02.150
May 31st the day of the battle of seven pines

574
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:07.730
mother.
And now in relation to the coming battle,

575
00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:10.580
if anything should happen and I should get killed,

576
00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:15.850
you will be entitled to my pay.
There is three months,
do me

577
00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:17.300
<v 1>okay,</v>

578
00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:21.620
<v 0>but if I should get not get paid off before anything should happen,</v>

579
00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:26.660
my pay will be in two places.
That is from the march,

580
00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:28.430
from the march,

581
00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:33.050
meaning the month there will be $50 per month in the state treasury,

582
00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:37.520
Massachusetts,
which I have a lot of their subject to my own order.

583
00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:41.570
The rest of my pay is drawn from the u s paymaster as usual.

584
00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:43.700
Imagine being his mother.

585
00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:47.663
<v 1>Okay.</v>

586
00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.130
<v 0>And then this is letter after the battle.</v>

587
00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:55.910
June two 1862 six miles from Richmond.
Dear mother,

588
00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:01.610
I presume this letter will find you most anxious expecting a letter from me.

589
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:06.200
I'm sitting in the hot sun and can write you but a few lines.

590
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:07.783
Oh mother,

591
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:13.150
I cannot begin to give you any idea of the terrific storm of bullets shot and

592
00:42:13.611 --> 00:42:17.300
show that poured over us as we lay behind those pits.

593
00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:21.440
We could not get into them for,
they were full of brime of water,

594
00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:25.790
but we lay right behind them in the mud.
After half an hour of this,

595
00:42:25.791 --> 00:42:29.180
the firing ceased and we were ordering forward behind some fallen woods.

596
00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:33.650
And then he goes on to describe how they were attack from the rear

597
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:40.150
and how he heard the bullets flying by him constantly and how he considers it a

598
00:42:40.371 --> 00:42:43.190
miracle that he is alive.

599
00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:47.150
And then at the very end of this letter,

600
00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:52.440
I cannot succeed in giving you any idea of battle,

601
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:58.190
but I know this much that I had no possible hope of coming out alive and I

602
00:42:59.011 --> 00:43:04.011
thought it all over how terribly you would feel and all that.

603
00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:06.750
But it came out without a scratch.

604
00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:10.200
I look back upon it and I cannot think how it can be.

605
00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:15.920
It does not seem as though any man that had been there could come out unhurt

606
00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:21.540
then he begins to describe his friends and buddies who were killed by name,

607
00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:25.110
how they were killed,
where they were shot.

608
00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:30.750
And Yens,
there are so many incidents crowding my head mother,

609
00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:35.310
I cannot write clearly at all.
And even when I sleep,

610
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:38.220
the minute I get into a dose,

611
00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:42.720
I hear the whistling of the shows and the shouts and the groans,

612
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:46.020
and to sum it up in two words,

613
00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.570
it is

614
00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:49.883
<v 1>horrible.</v>

615
00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:56.300
<v 0>Charlie will survive the war.</v>

616
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:03.740
He nearly died of dysentery twice.
He had two horses shut out from under him.

617
00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:09.340
He was deeply proud of his commission as a second lieutenant is an adjutant of

618
00:44:09.681 --> 00:44:10.514
his regimen,

619
00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:15.840
his regimen with a devastated.

620
00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:22.100
There were so few men left by July of 1864 they were disbanded.

621
00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.180
He went home to Massachusetts.

622
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:32.040
He couldn't imagine a civilian.
He

623
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.270
<v 1>hated the civilians.</v>

624
00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:38.550
He reenlisted to be a recruiter of black soldiers.

625
00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:45.200
This racist young man from western Massachusetts who freely use the word nigger,

626
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:52.280
<v 0>was employed from August of 1864 through the end of the war recruiting black men</v>

627
00:44:52.441 --> 00:44:53.610
in Norfolk,
Virginia,

628
00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:58.980
and his principle job was sitting in an office writing love letters for

629
00:44:58.981 --> 00:45:02.580
illiterate black women to their husbands at the front

630
00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:05.101
whom he,

631
00:45:05.101 --> 00:45:09.900
thanks for teaching him the art of love letter writing.

632
00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:14.180
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

633
00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:18.620
<v 0>well the battle of the peninsula ended up in what's called the seven days.</v>

634
00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:22.080
The Battle of the seven days,
uh,

635
00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:28.170
or the battles fought all around Richmond from June 25th through July 1st six

636
00:45:31.461 --> 00:45:33.860
consecutive seven consecutive days,

637
00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:39.200
places called Mechanicsville gains mills savage station,
Frazier's farm,

638
00:45:39.201 --> 00:45:43.340
Malverne Hill.
They're all little crossroads.

639
00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:48.400
They're not even really villages anymore that are just east of Richmond.

640
00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:51.773
<v 1>Okay.</v>

641
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:55.530
<v 0>It was sustained day to day fighting.</v>

642
00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:59.280
Both sides suffered horrible casualties.

643
00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:04.950
The result was essentially the fact that Mcclellan did not succeed in taking

644
00:46:04.951 --> 00:46:07.590
Richmond.
In fact,
on the contrary,

645
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:12.950
McCallen's forces were forced down south of Richmond to the edge of the James

646
00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.270
River to a place called Malverne hill

647
00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:24.920
where McClellan put his wounded damaged army into camp for too long.

648
00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:30.323
<v 1>Okay?</v>

649
00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:34.170
<v 0>The Battle of the seven days saved Richmond.
It's saved the confederacy.</v>

650
00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.560
It also brought Robert E.

651
00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:40.860
Lee into the command of the Union of all confederate forces in the eastern

652
00:46:40.861 --> 00:46:44.940
theater of the war because,
uh,
Joseph [inaudible] Johnston,

653
00:46:44.941 --> 00:46:47.010
who had been in command of the confederate forces,

654
00:46:47.011 --> 00:46:49.470
was wounded on the first day of the seven days.

655
00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:52.590
And Jefferson Davis put Leonne Command.

656
00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:56.910
And it was in some ways Lee's aggressiveness and the seven days that actually

657
00:46:56.911 --> 00:46:58.740
one that a fair

658
00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:03.810
and now lean made the first fateful decision of the war for him.

659
00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:09.830
After many consultations with Jefferson Davis and his other commanders,

660
00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:14.610
he made the decision to invade the North

661
00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:19.980
and this was faithful to say the least and it will bring us to the first major

662
00:47:19.981 --> 00:47:21.510
turning point of the civil war.

663
00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:29.060
I've just run the clock out.
I fear,
oh,

664
00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:33.460
I have two minutes.
Let me leave you here.

665
00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:47.350
The idea Lee had,
and it's not that complicated,

666
00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:49.780
is that the war was not devastating.

667
00:47:49.781 --> 00:47:53.740
Virginia Richmond was all but under siege.

668
00:47:55.210 --> 00:48:00.190
The theory here was take the war to the north,
take the war out of Virginia,

669
00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:05.770
take the war to northern soil,
hopefully get into Maryland,

670
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:10.150
and he believed there were thousands of Maryland men who would come to the

671
00:48:10.151 --> 00:48:15.151
confederate standard if they saw the confederate army threaten the capitol.

672
00:48:15.821 --> 00:48:19.600
Washington d C threatened Philadelphia in Pennsylvania,

673
00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:21.970
threatened the north,

674
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:26.530
take the word of their soil to their farms or their homes,

675
00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:29.200
and strategically,

676
00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:32.590
and this was the word Jefferson Davis agreed with him all that he was a very

677
00:48:32.591 --> 00:48:33.580
leery about this,

678
00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:38.890
a strike into the north that could win a major victory on northern soil and

679
00:48:38.891 --> 00:48:42.000
threatened the union capital,
possibly even threatened.

680
00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:47.280
Even fourth and evacuation of the federal capitol might bring the most important

681
00:48:47.501 --> 00:48:51.910
thing the confederacy needed,
and they were on the verge of it,

682
00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:55.780
and that was British intervention,

683
00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:00.700
British recognition and intervention on the side of the confederacy.

684
00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:06.810
I'll discuss that possible intervention more as a piece of how emancipation

685
00:49:08.111 --> 00:49:12.790
becomes the result of this Antietam campaign next week.

686
00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:16.090
But let me leave you here.

687
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:17.023
<v 1>Okay.</v>

688
00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:25.670
<v 0>Lead decides in the face of a kind of queen essence McClellan</v>

689
00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:29.850
to leave only a small force in Richmond

690
00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:36.170
and move north into Virginia and invade the North Mcclellan's army.

691
00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:41.860
Having suffered 20,000 casualties in the seven days is not going to move

692
00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:49.500
and he's not going to move until he absolutely has to.

693
00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:55.500
It is the first great daring move of the war.
It will fail,

694
00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:57.720
but it nearly succeeded.

695
00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:02.880
And the reason to Antidem is the first major turning point of this war is not

696
00:50:02.881 --> 00:50:07.140
just because of the decisive battle they fought on the Maryland side of the

697
00:50:07.141 --> 00:50:07.974
Potomac,

698
00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:13.640
but because it will be the occasion to all our Abraham Lincoln to do what he'd

699
00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:16.440
been planning to do through much of that summer.

700
00:50:16.441 --> 00:50:18.870
And Congress had been prodding him to do,

701
00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:23.130
which was to announce to the world that this was a war to free the slaves.

702
00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:26.140
<v 1>See you next week.</v>
