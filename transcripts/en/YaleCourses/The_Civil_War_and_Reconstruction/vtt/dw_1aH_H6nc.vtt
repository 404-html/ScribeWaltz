00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.790
Reconstruction is that period of American history that I think still,

2
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.350
I know still is short shrifted in the ways people tend to learn American history

3
00:00:15.491 --> 00:00:17.830
in this society for whatever the reason.

4
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.140
Part of the reason may be that it's messy and complicated and part of the reason

5
00:00:23.141 --> 00:00:27.670
may be that it's full of violence and part of the reason may be that it's just

6
00:00:27.671 --> 00:00:30.790
not as easy to find good heroes.

7
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.540
And part of the reason may be that it comes after such a total all out and some

8
00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:40.480
may say in so many ways,

9
00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:45.481
glorious war or as Kenneth stamp a greatest story in once put it until 1865

10
00:00:46.661 --> 00:00:48.520
there was Gloria enough to go around,

11
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.410
but after 1865 where it was the glory,

12
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.880
it's also been a period in which we've almost insisted,

13
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.110
and I wonder just how you have learned about this before,

14
00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:07.160
if this were a smaller class,
I would ask you,
but it's,

15
00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:12.161
it's as though our culture still insist from this period of our history that

16
00:01:12.741 --> 00:01:13.850
it'd be a mellow drama,

17
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.890
some kind of melodrama with a sufficient number of heroes in a sufficient number

18
00:01:22.221 --> 00:01:23.180
of villains.

19
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.150
And a melodrama that usually ends up with a story of an oppressed south

20
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.660
much in need of our sympathy.

21
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.503
<v 0>Okay.</v>

22
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.820
<v 1>No,
I've,
I've put a piece of words up here in front of you.</v>

23
00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:45.650
I walked back to see if he could read it.

24
00:01:45.651 --> 00:01:50.510
I do think most of you in the room can read it and just hold onto the papers

25
00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:53.010
until the end please.
Um,

26
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.490
this is the 13th amendment.
We're going to look at the 13th and the 14th today,

27
00:01:58.491 --> 00:02:00.770
or at least I'll get you up to the 14th amendment.

28
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.120
If the civil war and reconstruction where a second founding,

29
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.420
I'll put the ephod on that.
Although for the next three weeks,

30
00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:15.740
I'm going to argue that if it was a second founding,

31
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.260
a second revolution of some kind.

32
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.330
<v 0>Okay,</v>

33
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.800
<v 1>that's second founding is in the 13th the 14th the 15th amendments to the</v>

34
00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:27.260
Constitution.
Read the 13th with me.

35
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.150
It's the simplest shortest other than the actual parts of the bill of rights,

36
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.630
it's the simplest shortest amendment in the u s constitution.

37
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.120
It outlaws slavery and involuntary servitude except for imprisonment,
for crime.

38
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.370
And then it has that very,
very simple section too.

39
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.670
Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation

40
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.010
that is almost

41
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.710
<v 0>in some ways,
um,</v>

42
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.820
a precis for what reconstruction will become,

43
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:11.530
what will constitute appropriate reconstruction.
I excuse me,

44
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:12.311
legislation.

45
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:17.311
What will constitute appropriate legislation to enforce black freedom?

46
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.140
I put it up today in part two because just this weekend I was out of lecturing

47
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:29.110
in Springfield,
Illinois at the new Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library

48
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.830
and it's a magnificent place if you haven't been there.
Uh,

49
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.200
it's a museum full of lots of wax figures that Liz is at least one life size wax

50
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:43.930
of Lincoln and every bloody room,
sometimes two of them.

51
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:46.510
And then they use holograms and he appears all over the place.

52
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.790
It's a little weird and scary,

53
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.160
but at the end of the whole day,
in the evening,

54
00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:59.140
they took me down on the vault and asked me if I wanted to see some special

55
00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:02.740
documents and special possessions

56
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.360
and showed me one of Lincoln's three existing top hats.

57
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.680
They showed me the cast of his hand.
I got to touch,

58
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.990
they showed me personal notes.
He wrote to pardon,

59
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.850
um,
deserters from the union army.

60
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.150
They showed me all kinds of things,

61
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.890
but one of the things they showed me was the original draft,

62
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.340
the hand written draft by the clerk of the House of Representatives of the 13th

63
00:04:36.671 --> 00:04:41.671
amendment and then signed by a Lincoln and most of the members of the house,

64
00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:45.460
at least those who chose to sign it.

65
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.230
<v 1>And I realized,
damn,
that thing is real</v>

66
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.990
and maybe someday I can live to see the 14th amendment

67
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.270
back to the 14th animal.

68
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.263
<v 0>MMM,</v>

69
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.670
<v 1>sorry about that.
That's not the 14th.
That's just the outline</v>

70
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:12.813
<v 0>now.</v>

71
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.940
<v 1>Um,</v>

72
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.940
a few overall thoughts on reconstruction to just give you some hooks to hang

73
00:05:20.731 --> 00:05:25.731
your hat on before we look back again at this question of reconstruction during

74
00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:29.910
the war and then after Lincoln's death,

75
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.740
the fight that ensues quickly between the new president,

76
00:05:34.741 --> 00:05:38.490
Andrew Johnson and the congressional leadership,

77
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.540
the Republican Party soon now to be known as the radical Republicans and what

78
00:05:43.711 --> 00:05:44.160
would be,

79
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.160
will become a great constitutional crisis over who will control reconstruction

80
00:05:50.401 --> 00:05:54.450
and what reconstruction will be reconstruction.

81
00:05:54.451 --> 00:05:59.451
No is often seen it indeed and your of um,

82
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.510
almost gargantuan aspirations if you think about what they were trying to

83
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:08.300
achieve and tragic failures

84
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.250
it,
but it's also an air of sudden and unprecedented legal,

85
00:06:14.251 --> 00:06:17.910
political and constitutional change.

86
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.560
It's also a period of tremendous social and political violence.

87
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.300
And we've never experienced anything in America other than sanction war,

88
00:06:29.301 --> 00:06:30.980
which the civil war of course it's been,

89
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.960
we've never ever experienced social and political violence on the scale that

90
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:38.150
you'll see in reconstruction.
In fact,

91
00:06:38.151 --> 00:06:42.530
there's a whole batch of books coming out now on reconstruction violence.

92
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:46.400
And I suspect this has a lot to do with living in the age of terrorism.

93
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.110
Publishers are really promoting the subject you're reading one of them that's

94
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:56.290
just been out a year or two by Nicholas Lemann called redemption or not.

95
00:06:57.831 --> 00:06:58.664
And a week or two

96
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.390
and another way reconstruction was one long,

97
00:07:03.391 --> 00:07:08.391
10 11 year agonizing referendum on the meaning of the war.

98
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.010
One of the war meant that's what reconstruction was trying to explain,

99
00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:19.290
trying to saddle,
trying to codify

100
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:27.990
what had actually been the verdict at Appomattox when Lee surrendered and then

101
00:07:28.931 --> 00:07:32.290
Johnson surrendered.
And then in the confederate army surrendered.

102
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:37.210
What was the verdict?
Who got to determine it?

103
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.560
Who would really won the war
and what have they won?

104
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.850
What cause had lost?

105
00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.680
Now someone really won this war and someone really lost this war.

106
00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:56.170
This is not one of those wars.
Where are you going to say,
you know,

107
00:07:56.171 --> 00:07:58.600
nobody ever wins a war?
Nonsense

108
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.930
Union victory is real.
Confederate defeat was virtually total

109
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:07.750
in a military sense,

110
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:11.760
but what was the south to lose?

111
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:19.390
One of the greatest challenges of reconstruction was to determine how you take

112
00:08:19.671 --> 00:08:24.671
this massive national blood feud of unimaginable scale.

113
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.360
You know it's beginning

114
00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.250
and then reconcile it into a new nation.

115
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:45.090
The problem in part is that the survivors on both sides in this war would still

116
00:08:45.941 --> 00:08:49.450
have to inhabit the same land in the same country.

117
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:54.900
It wasn't as though an actual foreign country had been conquered and defeated it

118
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.760
part of North America.

119
00:08:56.761 --> 00:09:01.761
It was part of the u s or as soon to be new US s of some kind

120
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:08.990
and the side the last is going to have to in time and habit,
the same government.

121
00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.430
How,
where do you go and precedent?

122
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.390
Where do you go in history?
Where do you go in the constitution?

123
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:22.100
Where do you look this up to put Humpty dumpty back together again.

124
00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.050
Put another way.

125
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:35.890
The task was how to make the eventual logic of sectional reconciliation knitting

126
00:09:37.761 --> 00:09:39.290
north and South back together.

127
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:45.160
How to make the eventual logic of sectional reconciliation somehow compatible

128
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:52.480
with the logic of that revolution that was put in place in 1863

129
00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.180
or in other words,

130
00:09:56.181 --> 00:10:01.181
emancipation and by logic I mean you have to put north and south back together,

131
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.870
but you also now have to deal with the fact the slaves had been free to some new

132
00:10:08.871 --> 00:10:11.390
status.
Got To do both.

133
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:16.151
Put another way.

134
00:10:16.151 --> 00:10:21.151
How do you square black freedom and all the stirrings of the possibility at

135
00:10:21.911 --> 00:10:25.240
least of racial equality.
Now with that,

136
00:10:25.241 --> 00:10:30.241
because in the south that had lost everything except it's faith in white

137
00:10:33.371 --> 00:10:34.204
supremacy.

138
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.110
<v 0>Okay,</v>

139
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:40.040
<v 1>how do you fold black freedom into white supremacy?</v>

140
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.880
How do you wore white Ho for white supremacy in the black freedom?

141
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.090
Can they ever be?
Could those ever be reconciled and what if they can't?

142
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.820
Lincoln spoke of a testing and the Gettysburg address.

143
00:10:55.821 --> 00:11:00.440
If you remember the famous speech testing,

144
00:11:00.441 --> 00:11:03.290
whether that nation or any nation so conceived can long endure

145
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.410
the testing of the war

146
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:12.800
in some ways would become easier than the testing the country would know face

147
00:11:12.801 --> 00:11:16.640
with reconstruction or finally put yet another way,

148
00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:18.710
and I wrote about this

149
00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.660
too much length and book called race and Reunion.

150
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:28.700
The challenge of reconstruction,
and it's the challenge we've had ever since,

151
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:34.730
is how do you do two profound things at the same time?

152
00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:41.150
One was healing
and the other was justice.

153
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.120
How do you have them both?

154
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:50.080
What truly constitutes healing of a people of a nation that's suffered this

155
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.700
scale of violence and destruction

156
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.970
and how do you have justice and justice for whom?

157
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:06.340
Here's what Lincoln said next to the last day of his life,

158
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.680
three days before he was shot,

159
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.710
it was his last public utterance from a balcony at the White House.

160
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:20.790
He was discussing reconstruction is audience that day one and to just hear about

161
00:12:21.101 --> 00:12:25.450
the glories of the ending of the war and he gave him a little mini lecture on

162
00:12:25.451 --> 00:12:29.620
reconstruction because that's precisely what he was dealing with.
He said,
this

163
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:35.680
reconstruction is pressed much more close to the upon our attention.

164
00:12:35.681 --> 00:12:38.500
Now it is fraught with great difficulty.

165
00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:42.430
Unlike the case of a war between independent nations,

166
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:47.760
there is no authorized Oregon for us to treat with no one may and has authority

167
00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:51.370
to give up the rebellion for any other man.

168
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:57.120
We simply must begin with and mold from disorganized in discordant elements with

169
00:12:59.891 --> 00:13:04.891
all so new and unprecedented is the whole case that no exclusive and in flexible

170
00:13:07.481 --> 00:13:11.530
plan can safely be prescribed as to detail,

171
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:17.080
but important principles must be in flexible.

172
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.330
That's classic Lincoln.

173
00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.740
No one plan must we necessarily commit to,

174
00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.170
but we must stick to some principles.

175
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:32.200
It's linked in the pragmatist trying to figure it out and then he's dead.

176
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.170
The back to war time at least for a few minutes.

177
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:46.200
The debate over reconstruction as it will play out through the next three years,

178
00:13:46.201 --> 00:13:47.034
four years,

179
00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:53.420
really five years up to 1870 71 is the debate that ensued between Lincoln and

180
00:13:54.301 --> 00:13:59.301
his own party leadership and congress as early as late 1863 here's the Lincolns

181
00:14:00.301 --> 00:14:02.070
plan again and you can read.

182
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.940
You can read all of this and phone is short history of reconstruction,

183
00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:08.580
but let me give it to you at least in brief terms.

184
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.410
You'll remember I said the other day that Lincoln wanted reconstruction to be

185
00:14:13.411 --> 00:14:18.090
presidential lenient and quick.

186
00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:24.560
He was openly friendly to southerners.
His whole life is,

187
00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:29.830
I suppose everybody knows for brother-in-law's and fought for the confederacy

188
00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.460
and Cetera,
et cetera.
He's born in Kentucky.

189
00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:40.480
He did not really have any kind of personal vindictiveness toward southerners

190
00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:45.730
the way many others on the Republican Party will have and they'll have reasons

191
00:14:45.801 --> 00:14:50.600
to have that.
Some have argued is kind of stamp.

192
00:14:50.601 --> 00:14:55.601
Once that Lincoln actually had a deep personal need for personal app solution,

193
00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:03.070
that he carried this horrifying burden of all that death and that he did.

194
00:15:03.171 --> 00:15:06.880
He took it as his personal responsibility and that this charity for all and

195
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:11.890
malice toward none and the leniency in Lincoln's a reconstruction ideas is

196
00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:17.050
somehow rooted and that sense of personal responsibility for all of the

197
00:15:17.051 --> 00:15:19.010
suffering.
Maybe something to that.

198
00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:21.923
<v 0>Okay,</v>

199
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:26.780
<v 1>but he's reconstruction policies such as he put it in place,
at least for awhile,</v>

200
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.690
was rooted in his constitutional philosophy.

201
00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.280
Lincoln number one beliefs.
The session had never happened.

202
00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:39.290
That's the session was essentially impossible.

203
00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.720
A state could not secede from the union.

204
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:45.350
He chose language carefully as a good lawyer.

205
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:50.180
He said as states,
the southern states,
the confederate states,

206
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:55.340
we're still in the union.
Technically during the war,
even though they succeeded,

207
00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.380
they were simply in his language,

208
00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.860
out of their normal relationship to the union,

209
00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:03.230
wherever the hell that supposed to mean

210
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.840
on the fourth is total war against the United States,

211
00:16:08.841 --> 00:16:12.710
but they were not really out of the union.
Now that's a legal position.

212
00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:14.490
<v 0>Rest assured,</v>

213
00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.690
<v 1>he made a distinction between states and governments.</v>

214
00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.560
He said their governments may have,
you know,
uh,

215
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:28.240
failed and committed.
He never used the word treason,
you know,

216
00:16:28.241 --> 00:16:32.140
made rebellion against the United States.
But as states in Alabama,

217
00:16:32.141 --> 00:16:33.280
never cease to exist.

218
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.033
<v 0>Okay?</v>

219
00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:40.610
<v 1>He's famous for saying things like physically we cannot separate.</v>

220
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:45.350
His idea was to squash the rebellion.

221
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:51.250
Let a number of loyal citizens in one of those seceded states create a new loyal

222
00:16:55.011 --> 00:16:59.450
government,
restore that state to the Union as quickly as possible,

223
00:16:59.451 --> 00:17:04.451
even before the war ends by presidential authority under presidential war powers

224
00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:11.060
and begin a process before you'd ever have a surrender of what he was already

225
00:17:11.061 --> 00:17:15.440
calling restoration or reunification.

226
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:18.610
<v 0>Okay.</v>

227
00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:21.280
<v 1>He wanted it done by executive authority.</v>

228
00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:26.170
That wasn't necessarily a personal power grab by any means,

229
00:17:26.171 --> 00:17:31.150
but he wanted to do it under presidential war powers because he did understand,

230
00:17:31.151 --> 00:17:33.220
to the extent anybody could predict the future.

231
00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:37.420
And once the war did in Congress's powers would rise.

232
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:42.010
A president has never so powerful as in time of war.

233
00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:45.743
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

234
00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:53.720
<v 1>Pause for a moment.
What they're all thinking about now.
Lincoln,</v>

235
00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:56.480
the Republican leadership of Congress.

236
00:17:56.481 --> 00:18:00.230
Anybody thinking about reconstruction during the war or even in immediate

237
00:18:00.231 --> 00:18:04.790
aftermath is really thinking about a set of questions that are somewhat like

238
00:18:04.791 --> 00:18:08.030
those big questions I started with,
but more specifically,

239
00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.130
this is what they have to think about now.

240
00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:14.090
And if you think American statesman have been challenged at other times in our

241
00:18:14.091 --> 00:18:18.950
history,
how would you like to have this Jones?
One,
three,

242
00:18:18.951 --> 00:18:20.360
three main questions.
One,

243
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:25.580
who would rule in the south

244
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.673
<v 0>who,</v>

245
00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:34.610
<v 1>who gets to vote because the whole office x,
confederates,</v>

246
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:39.920
black people,
whites had been loyal.
How do you determine this

247
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:46.080
to who will rule in the federal government,

248
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.900
Congress or the president in this unprecedented blank slate set of issues?

249
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.760
Country had never faced this before.
How do you reconstruct a union?

250
00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:59.940
How do you readmit states into the union?

251
00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:03.330
There's no blueprint and the constitution,

252
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:08.100
there are hints depending on how you interpret it.
And three,

253
00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:14.660
what will the dimensions of black freedom be in law and in practice and in

254
00:19:20.761 --> 00:19:25.230
social life on the ground in south.

255
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:33.920
All the while remembering that this all must occur now in these desperate

256
00:19:34.351 --> 00:19:39.090
conditions of poverty,
destruction,
starvation,

257
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:44.720
and tremendous untold as yet not even fully fathom.

258
00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.190
Bitterness and hatred

259
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:55.410
are,
let me give you one last little question.
I love asking questions.

260
00:19:55.411 --> 00:19:57.120
I don't have to stand up right now and answer

261
00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:03.040
would reconstruction via preservation of something old

262
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.120
or the creation of something truly new

263
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:13.220
and if it's going to be new,
how new.

264
00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:20.610
Back to the war warriors

265
00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:27.010
Lincoln issued on December eight,
1863,
the,
his,
uh,

266
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:30.750
state of the union or annual message,
part of his annual message,

267
00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:34.200
what he called the proclamation of amnesty and reconstruction.

268
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:37.970
It was issued December 63 dimensional thinking.

269
00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:42.210
Remember the dates here because all this first major debate on reconstruction is

270
00:20:42.211 --> 00:20:47.211
going to occur and some of the most terrible months of the war and yet in

271
00:20:47.581 --> 00:20:49.590
Washington,
and they're also having this debate.

272
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:54.810
There were several parts to this,
but three main ones.

273
00:20:55.620 --> 00:21:00.000
It's clay as Lincoln's classic,
lenient,
rapid,
moderate,

274
00:21:00.001 --> 00:21:03.870
and presidential reconstruction.
It's called the 10% plan.

275
00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:05.131
He,

276
00:21:05.131 --> 00:21:10.131
number one would pardon all x confederates with a certain list of exceptions,

277
00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.880
high ranking confederate officials.

278
00:21:14.881 --> 00:21:19.530
Although he didn't entirely clarify how high ranking,
they wouldn't be pardoned.

279
00:21:19.531 --> 00:21:20.460
He at least yet,

280
00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:27.330
he would not pardon those who had resigned commissions in the judiciary or in

281
00:21:27.341 --> 00:21:31.150
Congress to support the confederacy.

282
00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:34.493
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

283
00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.740
<v 1>And he put in a clause that said he would not pardon those who could be</v>

284
00:21:40.261 --> 00:21:42.630
convicted of mistreating black soldiers,

285
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:44.970
of which there have been a great deal of,

286
00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:49.410
and he was under some pressure to do something about that by late 63

287
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:56.830
and then he said when 10% of the voting population of a given southern state and

288
00:22:00.351 --> 00:22:05.351
the voting population was determined by how many voted in 1860 when 10% of the

289
00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.310
male voting population,
cause that's the only people who could vote,

290
00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.860
would take an oath to the union

291
00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:19.220
and establish a new government than he is president under presidential war

292
00:22:19.221 --> 00:22:24.221
powers would recognize them and readmit them to the union

293
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:27.090
just like that.

294
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:33.260
Blacks were excluded from the entire process.
There was a,

295
00:22:33.261 --> 00:22:37.120
there was no mention at that point of any black suffrage.

296
00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:42.570
He wants 10%
now right away,

297
00:22:42.571 --> 00:22:46.560
members of his own party in Congress are saying,
wait a second,
Mr President,

298
00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:51.470
what about the other 90%
well,

299
00:22:51.471 --> 00:22:56.471
Lincoln's idea was if you can establish a pocket of people in Lower Louisiana or

300
00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:03.640
upland Alabama or part of Virginia that the union troops occupied and you get,

301
00:23:06.861 --> 00:23:10.360
if you can get 10% of that state there,

302
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:12.700
take a loyalty oath and Alexa,

303
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:16.820
I'm kind of a little rump legislature that can meet somewhere like wheeling West

304
00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:17.870
Virginia,
where they did for awhile.

305
00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:24.340
Then he would call that the Real Virginia or the real Louisiana and they'd be

306
00:23:25.311 --> 00:23:27.530
back in the union and he,

307
00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:32.150
his idea was that you would begin that a political process of reunification,

308
00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:37.730
a political process would already be in place,
as messy as it might be,

309
00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:43.040
as seemingly undemocratic as it might be before the war would end.

310
00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.550
This actually happened.
Well,
he didn't,
they didn't get admitted to the union,

311
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:55.220
but so called Lincoln governments were established in three states.
Again,

312
00:23:55.221 --> 00:23:59.750
we're union armies had significant occupation of the soil of that state.

313
00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:01.490
Louisiana,
Tennessee,

314
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.180
and Arkansas and so called Lincoln.

315
00:24:05.181 --> 00:24:10.181
Governments were created there in 1864 and early 1865 they were pitifully weak

316
00:24:13.101 --> 00:24:13.970
governments.

317
00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:18.050
They would have collapsed entirely without federal troops to protect them.

318
00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:23.980
And Lincoln did this utterly without consulting with Congress and we like to

319
00:24:24.861 --> 00:24:28.460
make a great deal of Abraham Lincoln is the greatest president and he was

320
00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:33.610
political genius and he was magical with the music of words and he was,

321
00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:35.480
et Cetera,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

322
00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:41.000
And I was just out at the Lincoln Library where you can be sure Lincoln has god,

323
00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:45.260
but not consulting with Congress on this one.

324
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:47.210
Wasn't the wisest thing he ever did.

325
00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:49.573
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

326
00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:53.600
<v 1>Congress began to react with great hostility in 1864</v>

327
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:59.300
some radical republicans sincerely believed that these new Lincoln governments

328
00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:03.440
were not only wrong and undemocratic,
the dangerous,

329
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.140
and they wanted much,

330
00:25:08.141 --> 00:25:13.141
much more to even consider the reconstruction of a southern state on any basis

331
00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:19.900
they were led.
They being the

332
00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:23.240
Republicans in Congress

333
00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:27.680
by the two men on your right.

334
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.050
Oh,
oops,
sorry.

335
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:38.350
Thaddeus Stevens on the top and Charles Sumner on the bottom.

336
00:25:38.351 --> 00:25:43.351
Steven's a congressman from Pennsylvania who grew up and live near Gettysburg.

337
00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:50.860
Fascinating,
interesting,
driven,
passionate,

338
00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:55.240
complicated club footed man.

339
00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:57.520
<v 0>Okay,</v>

340
00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.810
<v 1>brilliant lawyer</v>

341
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.550
and a radical and then old abolitionists.

342
00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.070
And although he had some complications along the way,

343
00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:11.560
Stephen's in some nurse Sumner,
the great senator from Massachusetts to Sumner,

344
00:26:11.561 --> 00:26:16.561
who had had the brains nearly beaten out of them by Preston Brooks in the

345
00:26:16.991 --> 00:26:21.991
congress in 1856 and Senate in 1856 and left the Senate for nearly three and a

346
00:26:22.361 --> 00:26:25.330
half years.
And when all over the world to spas to try to put his,

347
00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.430
his head back together and coding,

348
00:26:27.431 --> 00:26:30.850
spending most of a year in Switzerland was very,

349
00:26:30.851 --> 00:26:34.030
very much back in the game during the war.

350
00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:37.450
And he rose in power of course,

351
00:26:37.451 --> 00:26:42.451
as the emancipation issue rose to the fore as did Stevens.

352
00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:47.980
And the two of them led the response,

353
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:52.630
the Lincolns ideas on reconstruction from the two different houses of Congress.

354
00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.710
They had different names for their proposals,

355
00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.290
but they're essentially argued the same thing.

356
00:26:59.291 --> 00:27:01.900
Although Sumner's that you could argue was even more radical.

357
00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:05.980
Stevens called his approach or his constitutional approach,

358
00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.750
conquered provinces.
He said,

359
00:27:10.751 --> 00:27:13.570
not only do the southern states secede from the union,

360
00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:19.860
they should be reverted to the status Ivonne organized,

361
00:27:20.441 --> 00:27:25.040
territory's,
or even further,
he went.

362
00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:26.540
He said,
no,

363
00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:30.800
they're not only going to have to be put under territorial status,

364
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:35.180
but they should be treated like a foreign nation that the United States has

365
00:27:35.181 --> 00:27:39.380
conquered a conquered province of a foreign land.

366
00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.430
They had been reduced by force of arms.

367
00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:48.460
They had made war upon the United States and under international law.

368
00:27:48.561 --> 00:27:52.550
Steven's argued they should be treated as quote,
his words,

369
00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:54.410
conquered foreign land,

370
00:27:57.190 --> 00:28:00.790
subject to whatever the United States shall choose to do with it.

371
00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.050
Sumner for his part called this theory,

372
00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:08.140
it was even more direct state suicide.

373
00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:11.620
I was pretty clear.
He said,

374
00:28:11.621 --> 00:28:13.840
not only of the southern states secede from the union,

375
00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:17.620
they committed political suicide.
They do not exist.

376
00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.880
They experienced what he called,
in his words,

377
00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:25.570
instant forfeiture of their status as states.

378
00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:31.900
They therefore must be reverted to what he called the status of on organized.

379
00:28:31.901 --> 00:28:35.260
Territory's as though Alabama was back in 1820

380
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:41.180
Virginia was back in 1787 or you know,

381
00:28:41.181 --> 00:28:45.510
whatever year they became officially became a state.
I'm sorry,
before that,

382
00:28:45.511 --> 00:28:47.040
even during the revolution.

383
00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:50.760
And therefore in both cases,

384
00:28:50.761 --> 00:28:55.761
Stevens or Sumner's plan all authority to readmit any southern state or

385
00:28:56.641 --> 00:28:57.900
determine the process.

386
00:28:57.901 --> 00:29:02.901
The means by which the laws by which a state would be re instituted into the

387
00:29:03.481 --> 00:29:08.481
union came under Congressional Authority because only Congress has the power to

388
00:29:10.081 --> 00:29:12.270
readmit new states.

389
00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:15.180
Take that Abraham Lincoln,

390
00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:24.130
they issued this theory to Lincoln in what was known as the Wade Davis Bill in

391
00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:32.050
July 4th of July to be exact 1864 note the date this is,

392
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.810
this is in the midst of the stalemate

393
00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:41.680
in Virginia.
It's just after coal harbor.
Uh,

394
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:45.730
grant has just begun to put Petersburg under siege.

395
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:51.160
The terrible blood letting in Virginia is coming in the thousands and thousands

396
00:29:51.161 --> 00:29:55.150
of names and casualty list and congress issues.
No.

397
00:29:55.151 --> 00:30:00.151
It's known as the Wade Davis bill named for Senator Benjamin Weight of Ohio,

398
00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:05.640
a strong slavery radical Republican and Henry Henry Winter Davis of congressman

399
00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:11.440
from Maryland also have at least moderate antislavery cadet credentials.

400
00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:17.020
What you have here is the blueprint of radical reconstruction,

401
00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.730
at least the beginning blueprint,

402
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:22.930
the way Davis Bill said they took,

403
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:26.380
the first part of it was they took Lincoln's 10% idea,

404
00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:29.380
10% of the voting population of southern state,

405
00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:35.130
and they required a majority of white male citizens of a southern state

406
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:42.930
who must secondly take what the radicals called an iron clad oath,

407
00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.330
and that all said that they had no,

408
00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:50.410
they had to get up and swear they had never participated in the confederate war

409
00:30:50.411 --> 00:30:52.120
effort or aided and abetted it.

410
00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.700
Now immediately you're wondering,
how in hell are you going to find them white?

411
00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:03.030
A majority of the white males of Georgia or Alabama or Mississippi or any other

412
00:31:04.871 --> 00:31:09.820
confederate state,
they can get up and take that oath.
The answer is you couldn't.

413
00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:14.250
To the congressional leadership,
that was just fine.
For now,

414
00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:18.980
the iron clad oath was a political message.
It was a symbolic coasts.

415
00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:24.500
They knew you'd never get a majority of whites who could take this third part.

416
00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:30.560
They said all officer's above the rank of lieutenant and all civil officers of

417
00:31:31.891 --> 00:31:36.240
all kinds in the confederacy would not only be not pardoned,

418
00:31:36.241 --> 00:31:40.290
they would be disfranchised forever declared,

419
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:45.350
not the actual language in the bill was not a citizen of the United States.

420
00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:49.560
It was almost as though they were giving every office holder,

421
00:31:49.561 --> 00:31:54.561
every officer lieutenant above who was still alive in the south and invitation

422
00:31:54.931 --> 00:31:58.350
to leave the country because if they stayed in America,

423
00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:00.060
they would be men without a country.

424
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:05.990
They did not set up in spite of the Lord.

425
00:32:05.991 --> 00:32:10.991
That said in over the years a plan of arrest indictments and executions.

426
00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.230
They didn't do that at all.

427
00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:17.640
<v 0>Okay,</v>

428
00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.290
<v 1>but they did decide they were going to treat.</v>

429
00:32:19.291 --> 00:32:22.860
The southern states has conquered enemies.

430
00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:29.490
They sent the bill to Lincoln
and Lincoln did.

431
00:32:29.491 --> 00:32:33.480
What many presidents have done.
He gave it a pocket veto.

432
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:35.490
You know what that is.

433
00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:41.120
He simply let the bill die without either signing it or vetoing it,

434
00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:45.050
or to some extent even answering it.

435
00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:49.370
Although he did finally answer it,
answered it.

436
00:32:49.371 --> 00:32:53.780
Actually four days after the bill was delivered to him and what he titled The

437
00:32:53.781 --> 00:32:57.770
proclamation on the way Davisville,
and this was,

438
00:32:57.771 --> 00:33:01.610
this was a classic Lincoln ESC statement as well.

439
00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:03.110
It was conciliatory.

440
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:08.350
He thanked them profusely for their work on the sensitive and terrible issue,

441
00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:14.510
and he didn't completely reject it.
He refused.
He said to be,

442
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:17.630
quote,
inflexibly committed to anyone.
Plan.

443
00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.570
Okay,
but what are you committed to?

444
00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.440
Is what Congress began to say.

445
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:30.200
He was verbally willing to listen,

446
00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:36.960
but he really did not play Kate the radicals.
They had an impasse here,

447
00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:42.210
big impasse,
and known how deep the impasse is,
its constitutional.

448
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:44.610
Who's gonna run reconstruction?

449
00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:48.240
Me The president or you the congress.

450
00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:54.000
Well,
the congressional leadership followed Lincoln's little,

451
00:33:54.001 --> 00:33:59.001
a proclamation on the Wade Davis bill with what they called the way Davis

452
00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:03.000
Manifesto,
and they published it in national newspapers.

453
00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:06.180
It was published in August 5th,

454
00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:11.180
1864 it was an unprecedented vehement attack on a sitting president by the

455
00:34:12.661 --> 00:34:15.090
leadership in Congress of his own party.

456
00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:18.360
They lamb basted Lincoln.

457
00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.640
They attacked him on two grounds.

458
00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:26.540
They said his approach to reconstruction was simply way too lenient,

459
00:34:26.541 --> 00:34:31.541
and they're arguing this now in August of 1864 with these thousands upon

460
00:34:31.910 --> 00:34:33.140
thousands of casualties flowing in.

461
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.580
This is a very time Lincoln comes to believe he's not a bug,

462
00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.030
not likely to be reelected,

463
00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:42.140
and there was some members in particularly the radical wing of the Republican

464
00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:46.590
Party who had been laboring to dump Lincoln from the ticket all summer and

465
00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:51.660
probably could have succeeded in doing it if there wasn't so much at stake

466
00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.190
and they want a second step.

467
00:34:56.220 --> 00:35:00.410
They actually accused him of usurpation of presidential powers,

468
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:06.450
an impeachable offense if anyone ever cared to take it any further step.

469
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:13.850
Here's the key.
As the dispute emerge that summer,

470
00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:20.860
Lincoln viewed reconstruction as a means to weakening the confederacy and

471
00:35:21.591 --> 00:35:26.270
winning the war.
Think of it as a political strategy.

472
00:35:26.271 --> 00:35:27.740
That 10% idea,

473
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:32.420
trying to get some fledgling little state legislature and government somehow get

474
00:35:32.421 --> 00:35:37.040
two or three of them into the union.
It was a strategy.

475
00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.830
None,
no,
not a blueprint.

476
00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:43.470
A written in stone for the way we construct and would always be,

477
00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.320
but to the radical Republicans,

478
00:35:46.321 --> 00:35:51.321
they viewed this as a much more far reaching trans formation and a building

479
00:35:52.981 --> 00:35:57.981
really of a new nation when and if they can win the war.

480
00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:04.940
They really were at an impasse.
Now,

481
00:36:04.941 --> 00:36:09.941
you know from our previous lectures and you're reading that that the fall of

482
00:36:10.641 --> 00:36:15.200
mobile bay on August 5th the same day as a,
as a way,
Dave,
his manifesto,

483
00:36:15.201 --> 00:36:19.340
admiral Farragut took mobile bay.
That had a tremendous impact on public opinion.

484
00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:23.840
Then on September three or four the Lana fell and I didn't even greater impact

485
00:36:23.841 --> 00:36:27.800
on public opinion and of course you got the presidential race now happening in

486
00:36:27.801 --> 00:36:30.080
the fall and Lincoln is reelected,

487
00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:35.680
this impasse on reconstruction.
They'll basically just sat there

488
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:41.860
until Lincoln's death.
In the meantime,

489
00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:47.850
he cooperated and so did they on two tremendous pieces of legislation,

490
00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:54.970
uh,
to great enactments.
One is the 13th amendment,
which we just discussed.

491
00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:59.800
And I want to come back to that in a moment.
Um,

492
00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:03.520
well actually I'll mention it now.

493
00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:09.610
The fact that it got passed is fairly remarkable that it got passed.

494
00:37:09.611 --> 00:37:12.610
It all is fairly remarkable.
It is

495
00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.640
first of all,

496
00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:20.230
an amendment that Lincoln himself by late 64 began to advocate,

497
00:37:20.231 --> 00:37:23.530
especially after his reelection vehemently advocate.

498
00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:26.540
And it's something exactly what the radical Republicans won it.

499
00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:31.810
They were absolutely on the same page on this.
And the reason Lincoln was,

500
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.070
well,
he had moral reasons to believe slayer.

501
00:37:35.071 --> 00:37:39.310
You should now be eradicated in the constitution.
Um,

502
00:37:39.311 --> 00:37:40.330
make no mistake.

503
00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:46.110
But he also had reason to want this in a constitutional amendment because he

504
00:37:46.391 --> 00:37:48.610
feared,
and rightly so,

505
00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:54.420
that if the war ended with only the emancipation proclamation as the legal

506
00:37:57.371 --> 00:38:01.390
sanction for all those freed slaves,

507
00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:07.110
that there would be nothing to stop southerners from thousands upon thousands of

508
00:38:07.241 --> 00:38:12.241
lawsuits in federal courts suing under Fifth Amendment for their property.

509
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.730
And it would have,
ha it did happen to some extent anyway,

510
00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:22.870
but if you can get it in the constitution as a constitutional amendment,

511
00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:26.470
then they would have no right to sue for property that is no longer property.

512
00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:31.580
So a lot was at stake.

513
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:36.910
They wanted a 13th amendment because of the potential invalidity of the

514
00:38:38.171 --> 00:38:39.910
emancipation proclamation.
Legally,

515
00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:46.080
they wanted to remove legal doubt and you'll remember that the proclamation only

516
00:38:46.361 --> 00:38:48.580
freed slaves in the states and rebellion.

517
00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:54.370
Technically slaves and Kentucky,
Missouri,

518
00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:59.710
Delaware,
Maryland.
We're still in a kind of limbo.

519
00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:10.660
It passed the House of Representatives on January 31st,

520
00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:12.610
1865 but it was not easy.

521
00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:16.390
You might think you live in the United States of America and of course there'd

522
00:39:16.391 --> 00:39:19.030
be a 13th amendment.
Finally,
of course,

523
00:39:19.031 --> 00:39:21.400
we would outlaw slavery in the constitution.

524
00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:27.040
The vote was one 19 to 56 it passed by two votes,

525
00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:32.740
takes two thirds,
majority for constitutional amendment.
It passed by two votes.

526
00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:38.310
Lincoln began to twist arms and being in a personal meetings with a select

527
00:39:38.351 --> 00:39:40.270
little list of Democrats.

528
00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.360
They didn't have a two thirds majority of Republican.

529
00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:50.040
They needed some Democrats to vote for this and by far the majority of Democrats

530
00:39:50.861 --> 00:39:53.500
with nothing to do with our long slavery in the constitution,

531
00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:56.800
but about eight of them came over

532
00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:01.390
and on the day that it was passed,

533
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:05.740
there was unprecedented rejoicing in the House of Representatives.

534
00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:10.930
The whole hall was full.
Congressmen were told,

535
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:14.980
started yelling,
crying,
hugging each other,

536
00:40:14.981 --> 00:40:17.260
dancing on the tops of their desks.

537
00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:23.910
God knows why in part because of the importance and the gravity of the issue.

538
00:40:25.721 --> 00:40:29.620
In part perhaps because they've lived through so much agony in the war,

539
00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:33.670
they truly had something to celebrate.
Yeah,

540
00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:37.630
you have to go to individual diaries and letters to really see it.

541
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:43.870
There was a republican who recorded in his diary that day,
quote,
memories,

542
00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:48.940
excuse me,
members joined in the shouting and kept it up for some minutes.

543
00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.780
Some embraced one another.
Others,
a wet black children.

544
00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:57.850
I have felt ever since the vote as though I live in a new country.

545
00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:00.550
Frederick Douglass,
his son,

546
00:41:00.551 --> 00:41:05.551
Louis veteran to the 54th Massachusetts in his uniform was sitting in the

547
00:41:06.071 --> 00:41:09.880
balcony on the afternoon of the 13th amendment was passed.

548
00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:12.400
His father was back home in Rochester.

549
00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:17.470
He immediately wrote his father and note that I've read and said,
father,

550
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:21.490
you should've been here today.
Today was your day.

551
00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:30.960
And then at the same time that Congress with Lincoln's strong approval worked on

552
00:41:32.681 --> 00:41:34.610
a bill to create the Freedmen's bureau

553
00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:40.090
and unprecedented agency in American history.
Certainly to that time,

554
00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:46.600
formerly called the Bureau of Refugees freedmen and abandoned lands.

555
00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:51.620
It passed Congress on the 3rd of March,

556
00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:54.200
1865 just a day before Lincoln's second inaugural.

557
00:41:56.350 --> 00:42:00.490
It was social reform by military force.

558
00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:02.890
Americans had never done this before.

559
00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:07.360
A national federal social welfare agency.

560
00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:08.420
<v 0>Okay.</v>

561
00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:12.440
<v 1>In a land that had lived in breathe,
laissez faire government,</v>

562
00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:18.500
it'll land that have lived and breathed this idea that governments don't provide

563
00:42:18.501 --> 00:42:22.490
food for people.
People provide food for people,

564
00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:28.500
health care schools.
Well,
the war of course,

565
00:42:28.501 --> 00:42:31.200
it forced a new kind of history.

566
00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:37.820
The basic purposes of the Freedmen's bureau when it was set up was to aid

567
00:42:37.921 --> 00:42:42.770
refugees and displaced people,
black or white,
and the estimate,

568
00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:44.110
I may have used this before,

569
00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:49.320
the estimate on the ground in the south by late winter 1865 was that there were

570
00:42:51.191 --> 00:42:54.700
at least a quarter million,
totally displaced,
starving white people,

571
00:42:55.830 --> 00:43:00.830
much less the 4 million soon to be liberated slaves.

572
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:06.290
Premus bird was proposed to provide all kinds of physical supplies,

573
00:43:06.291 --> 00:43:09.020
medical services,
schools where it could,

574
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:14.270
it's purpose was also legal to supervise contracts between freedmen and

575
00:43:14.271 --> 00:43:16.850
employees.
More on that later

576
00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:21.500
and it's job and this was an impossible task,

577
00:43:21.501 --> 00:43:26.501
but it's job in its title was to manage confiscated and abandoned land.

578
00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:33.740
Yeah,
property,

579
00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:40.360
but who really owns it now if the union army took your plantation,

580
00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:41.253
who owns that?

581
00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:42.940
<v 0>No,</v>

582
00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:45.940
<v 1>and there is nothing more primal,
of course,</v>

583
00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:49.330
especially to Americans and property

584
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:55.380
now more on the Freedmen's bureau later.
But it was,

585
00:43:55.381 --> 00:43:58.530
it was a terribly important piece of legislation.

586
00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:02.190
It passed with majorities in both houses of course,

587
00:44:02.191 --> 00:44:07.191
because the Republicans had those majorities in Lincoln gladly signed it and it

588
00:44:07.711 --> 00:44:12.711
established at least an agency to be put in place once the war was over.

589
00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:17.643
<v 0>No.</v>

590
00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:22.880
<v 1>Let me take the last few minutes</v>

591
00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:26.183
<v 0>and</v>

592
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:31.790
<v 1>set up what is now to happen between old Johnson</v>

593
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:37.560
and this same leadership of the radical Republicans ones.
Lincoln was gone.

594
00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:39.630
<v 0>Okay.</v>

595
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:44.430
<v 1>This is the classic struggle of Reconstruction Johnson and the radicals.</v>

596
00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:49.980
Now,
first of all,
how did Andrew Johnson get on Lincoln's ticket?

597
00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:54.850
Why did Abraham Lincoln choose Andrew Johnson as his running mate?

598
00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:59.410
I've often put this two major Lincoln scholars,
look,

599
00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:03.670
I confess,
I'm a great admirer of Lincoln's like most people,

600
00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:09.550
but he couldn't do everything perfectly and he gave us Andrew Johnson

601
00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:13.790
and we've never held him responsible for that

602
00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:19.970
and I'm not willing to give them a total pass on that one because Andrew Johnson

603
00:45:19.971 --> 00:45:24.971
ranks down there just about minus two on the list of presidents I think of all

604
00:45:25.521 --> 00:45:30.280
time.
Well,
how's that for directness?

605
00:45:30.281 --> 00:45:34.300
Sorry about that.
If you're an Andrew Johnson fan,
you're lonely.

606
00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:43.730
He's on the ticket and 64 because you know this,

607
00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:48.970
he's the only senator from a succeeded confederate state who didn't succeed with

608
00:45:49.701 --> 00:45:51.710
the state state.

609
00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:56.960
He stayed in the Union from Tennessee.

610
00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:02.590
He's a complicated guy.
God,
he could have been.
Interesting.

611
00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:04.643
<v 0>Okay.</v>

612
00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.660
<v 1>He had some big flaws.</v>

613
00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:10.320
I'm going to leave you with a little background on Andrew Johnson.

614
00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.540
As you can tell from the syllabus,

615
00:46:12.541 --> 00:46:15.990
I've put myself nearly a full lecture behind in the course,

616
00:46:15.991 --> 00:46:20.610
but don't you worry because we're planning for reading week a special review

617
00:46:20.611 --> 00:46:23.460
session one.
I can give another lecture.

618
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:27.720
Aren't you happy?

619
00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:34.620
There's an old saying about Andrew Johnson that quote old and he never went back

620
00:46:34.621 --> 00:46:38.400
on,
is raising his,
raising up.

621
00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:43.530
He's from East Tennessee.
I was born in North Carolina.

622
00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:50.390
He grew up illiterate,
had once owned 11 slaves.
Although he did freedom.

623
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.050
He moved to East Tennessee with his wife Paula,
who taught him his literacy.

624
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:04.170
He grew up a Jacksonian Democrat.
His God was Andrew Jackson.

625
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:09.750
If lovers of the new deal belief FDR was somehow the son of God is my

626
00:47:09.751 --> 00:47:10.590
grandparents.
Did

627
00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:15.930
Andrew Johnson thought Andrew Andrew Johnson throat.

628
00:47:15.931 --> 00:47:18.060
Andrew Jackson was the son of God

629
00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:24.880
in 1861 he was the only southern senator who did not succeed with his state.

630
00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:29.830
In 1862 Lincoln appointed him the war governor of Tennessee,
uh,

631
00:47:29.831 --> 00:47:32.860
in the occupied parts of Tennessee out of woods,
Lincoln.

632
00:47:32.861 --> 00:47:37.840
Eventually it was going to,
he did try to create a new government.

633
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:40.240
Andrew Johnson was his governor.

634
00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:46.920
It took tremendous courage to be a unionist in Tennessee during the civil war,

635
00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.830
but there was a lot of unionism in east Tennessee

636
00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:57.000
and in 64 Lincoln needed a border state running me after a,

637
00:47:57.001 --> 00:47:59.970
who had been his running mate before.
Totally forgettable.

638
00:47:59.971 --> 00:48:02.880
I realize no one ever remembers the vice presidents.

639
00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:04.270
It's from the 19 what's the same?

640
00:48:04.271 --> 00:48:07.350
But I remember Vice Presidents from the 20th century only.

641
00:48:07.351 --> 00:48:10.380
Those would be good getting Nobel prizes to do.
We really remember,
I guess,

642
00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:15.180
but Hannibal Hamlin of New Hampshire had been Lincoln's running me.

643
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:19.560
Now what good is the New Hampshire right on the ticket and 64 I New Hampshire.

644
00:48:19.561 --> 00:48:24.210
I was useful in 60 but not in 64 so he dumps Hannibal Hamlin,

645
00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.210
Sparta,
the alliteration of his name

646
00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:32.970
and goes for a political choice.

647
00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:35.530
What could I,

648
00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:40.360
what can send a better unionists message to the border states than Andrew

649
00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:43.030
Johnson?
Only southern senator doesn't see it from his seat.

650
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:50.630
Well,
all was pretty well at least until the inauguration.

651
00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:57.310
Andrew Johnson unfortunately was drunk at his inauguration as vice president of

652
00:48:57.311 --> 00:48:58.500
the United States.
Now,

653
00:48:58.501 --> 00:49:02.910
his explanation for that is that he had a terrible tooth infection and he'd been

654
00:49:02.911 --> 00:49:07.740
sloshing down whiskey all morning,
but they literally had to stand him up,

655
00:49:07.741 --> 00:49:08.401
prop him up,

656
00:49:08.401 --> 00:49:11.940
and point them in the right direction and raise it practically raised his hand

657
00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:16.740
on the day he was inaugurated when Lincoln delivered the second inaugural,

658
00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:19.440
a Jay had to be removed to a back room.

659
00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:22.860
Not An auspicious beginning

660
00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:28.900
last thought,
but the fire by far.

661
00:49:28.901 --> 00:49:31.240
The most important thing about Andrew Johnson though,

662
00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:36.100
in spite of his early comments when he said treason must be made odious,

663
00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:39.430
and Charles Sumner said,
Ooh,
he's speaking my language.

664
00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:45.190
The thing we must know about Andrew Johnson is number one,

665
00:49:45.191 --> 00:49:47.650
he was a very little white supremacist.

666
00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:52.330
He was an art and states rightest.
Yes,

667
00:49:52.331 --> 00:49:55.750
he was a state's right as and the unionist.

668
00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:01.800
It's entirely possible to be that he also hated the southern planter class.

669
00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:09.850
He was never anti slavery.
He was not only not antislavery,

670
00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:14.290
he was an open racist.
He believed the United States should remain,

671
00:50:14.291 --> 00:50:17.740
in his own words,
a white man's country for forever,

672
00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:24.330
and he had a disposition that could best charitably be described as

673
00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:27.740
hypersensitive and obstinate.

674
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:31.100
He was not a flexible politician.

675
00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:34.250
Well,

676
00:50:34.251 --> 00:50:39.251
I'll leave you with old Andrew Johnson now into the story and messing things up

677
00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:42.440
and I'll see you Thursday.
