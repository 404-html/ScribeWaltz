1
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:06.540
I'm going to talk for a few minutes about this memory question.

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:07.403
There's a

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.580
article assigned to the very end of the reading packet that you perhaps read by

4
00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:18.060
now,
I hope piece I wrote some years ago,

5
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.540
which gives you a kind of a breezy take on some of the complexities of how the

6
00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:29.670
civil war and reconstruction have been remembered in the United States.

7
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.830
It is arguably the most vexing piece of our pass for our larger political public

8
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.400
culture to process.

9
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.450
You can simply do it this way though.

10
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.670
This is one of the people that Tony Horowitz interviewed in his wonderful book,

11
00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:55.020
confederates in the attic with some of you may have read quite popular book that

12
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:59.100
came out about five years ago,
Horwitz,
a great journalist,

13
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.600
did a travel book all over the South and tried to come to some grips and

14
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:06.930
understanding
of many things,

15
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:11.931
but particularly of civil war buffs and civil war enthusiasm of why this event

16
00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:16.770
in doors so much in our popular culture.

17
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.850
Among the people he interviewed was this guy who said,
quote,

18
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.590
I think there's a lot of people like me.

19
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.450
I want to get back to a simpler time.
Sandlot,

20
00:01:30.451 --> 00:01:34.110
baseball cowboys and Indians and the civil war.

21
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.000
Just take me away wherever my president is,

22
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.490
whatever my life is,

23
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.120
just transform port me till the morning of July 3rd at Gettysburg or some other

24
00:01:50.691 --> 00:01:51.524
place

25
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.880
that was a musician and interviewed on NPR yesterday morning who's been through

26
00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:02.240
a horrible life of drugs and alcohol addiction.

27
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.550
<v 1>The end of it,</v>

28
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.780
<v 0>he was asked to give the biggest influences on his recovery and his survival and</v>

29
00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:16.550
he said,
well,
certain artists,

30
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.150
certain people,
but mostly the civil war.

31
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.583
<v 1>Great,</v>

32
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.890
<v 0>and that's where the interview ended.</v>

33
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:27.950
I was dying to find out what the hell did that mean?

34
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.680
Good God Almighty,
but God blessing.

35
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.090
All right legacies,
everything in history has a legacy.

36
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.750
We'll use the term all the time.
Oh,
legacies of this and the legacies of that,

37
00:02:41.751 --> 00:02:45.160
the legacies of that event.
What are the legacies of World War Two?

38
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.180
What are the legacies of the civil rights movement?

39
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.500
But what is the legacy stop for just a second with me?

40
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.980
How many attempt definition?
Some Tim,

41
00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.900
it can be simply another word for historical of how we remember things and then

42
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:02.770
how we using them.

43
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.120
It always carries some current present and often political meaning if you use

44
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:12.310
the term legacy for something,

45
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.130
it probably has a current political stake.

46
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.450
Reconstruction in our history wasn't ongoing referendum on the meaning and

47
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:30.331
legacies of slavery and the civil war and so much of our racial history,

48
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:35.551
our constitutional history or political history ever since reconstruction has

49
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:38.440
been a referendum on the meaning and memory of reconstruction.

50
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.100
Was there a reconciliation in the wake of these events have sections of states

51
00:03:47.191 --> 00:03:52.191
of soldiers of the political class or have masters and slaves,

52
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.140
blacks and whites who got reconcile

53
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.633
<v 1>and who didn't.</v>

54
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.200
<v 0>Legacies I'd suggest can be emotional.</v>

55
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.940
Test this with your parents
are your grandparents.

56
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.690
Legacies can be emotional,
they can be intellectual,

57
00:04:15.691 --> 00:04:19.380
they can be physical,
it can be financial.

58
00:04:19.381 --> 00:04:21.210
They can be about habits.

59
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.660
They surely can be political and they can be sacred or secular and my parents

60
00:04:26.911 --> 00:04:30.750
were the great depression and then World War II generation and it was all over

61
00:04:30.751 --> 00:04:31.584
them.

62
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.850
My father always feared insurance.
You always want to know exact.

63
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:43.210
He had no money,
but he always wanna know exactly where is his money was.

64
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.810
He almost kept it under a pillow and it was stupid.
It was crazy,

65
00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:51.100
but after the depression and five farm foreclosures that his family had,

66
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.450
he couldn't stand.
Letting anyone else have is a couple thousand dollars.

67
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.300
That's a legacy of the Great Depression.
It's a habit.

68
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.510
It's a point of view and it's a set of assumptions.

69
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.010
<v 1>This event</v>

70
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.260
<v 0>had so many legacies that frankly we just keep adding to them with the time.</v>

71
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.330
They just don't really go away.

72
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.280
Sometimes a legacy is perhaps what is simply leftover out in public memory and

73
00:05:23.361 --> 00:05:26.150
our behavior and our policies.

74
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.090
After historians have written all their books,

75
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.910
museums have mounted all their exhibitions.

76
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.430
Teachers have taught their classes.

77
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.880
Elders have tried to instruct the young at the grassroots level and in families.

78
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.920
A legacy is that which endures all of our filterings,

79
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.440
all of our debates,

80
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.690
all of our struggles over controlling the story we say we live in.

81
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.980
It is where

82
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.730
<v 1>the past and the present meet,</v>

83
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.530
and there's no event in American history that's caused more of these struggles.

84
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.510
There are others that compare.
There's no event.

85
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:16.511
It's caused more struggles over just how the past and present meat than our

86
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:18.740
civil war.

87
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.520
<v 0>Just take some of these ideas is physical legacies,
emotional legacies.</v>

88
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.910
If you took the number of dead in the American civil war,

89
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:34.670
<v 1>yeah.</v>

90
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.490
<v 0>And you moved it to the present per capita,</v>

91
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.160
13 million Americans would die in a war.
Today.

92
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.020
Slavery was gone.

93
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.740
Anger at its loss had no end

94
00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.850
in the south.
The economy and the physical landscape was in collapse.

95
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:06.780
Two thirds of southern wealth of the x confederate states was destroyed in four

96
00:07:08.681 --> 00:07:12.940
years.
And a lot of that wealth,
of course,
was slaves.

97
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.020
Three and a half billion dollars worth

98
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.700
40% of all sudden livestock were dead.
At the end of the war,

99
00:07:20.701 --> 00:07:23.250
50% of all farm machinery destroyed.

100
00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.070
It was an enormous refugee problem.

101
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.470
Mobilization had occurred,
unmatched.

102
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.260
It will be unmatched until World War II.

103
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:39.263
<v 1>Okay.</v>

104
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.800
<v 0>And in the south in particular,
the war had killed approximately,</v>

105
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.740
uh,
killed or incapacitated,
excuse me,

106
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:53.130
one of every four males from the age of 16 to 45.

107
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:59.940
How do you process that kind of loss and destruction and violence and a society

108
00:08:02.891 --> 00:08:06.490
that must find a way to reconcile it?

109
00:08:06.491 --> 00:08:11.491
Can't send the defeated part somewhere else or could have tried but Brazil and

110
00:08:14.081 --> 00:08:14.914
take them all.

111
00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:16.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

112
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.950
<v 0>Certainly Britain wouldn't take him all Mexico couldn't,
wouldn't.</v>

113
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.280
How would this reconciliation actually come?

114
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:30.670
I was doing research

115
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.050
at the Huntington Library a couple of years ago

116
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.970
and I was actually there to give a lecture and I was,
I had two days to kill.

117
00:08:39.971 --> 00:08:42.220
I was just playing around on the Ellen Nevins papers.

118
00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:45.370
Ellen Evans was a great civil wars storing back in the fifties and sixties I

119
00:08:45.371 --> 00:08:50.230
grew up reading his works and I was actually giving a lecture name for Alan

120
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.231
Nevin,

121
00:08:50.231 --> 00:08:53.350
so I thought it's got a couple of days in the Nevins papers and just just lose

122
00:08:53.351 --> 00:08:58.351
myself and nothing better in the world other than teaching this class and losing

123
00:08:58.441 --> 00:09:02.580
yourself in a great library for two days with no agenda.

124
00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:09.510
I'm following through the Nevins papers of huge collection and I just bumped

125
00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:13.710
into an essay in manuscript form by my hero,

126
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:18.750
Bruce Catton.
I've mentioned him before,
grew up reading his books,

127
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.150
still on it happened Maddix and so many others.

128
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:26.450
The great popular historian of the civil war in the 50 60 seventies and here was

129
00:09:27.781 --> 00:09:32.781
this little essay by Catton entitled the end of the Centennial,

130
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.940
1965 not the day centennial

131
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.230
of the US civil war.

132
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.540
Captain Nevins had been themselves directors,
executive directors,

133
00:09:44.541 --> 00:09:46.070
presidents and vice presidents,

134
00:09:46.071 --> 00:09:50.480
whatever they were called of the u s centennial commission for the civil war,

135
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.820
a commission.
That was in many ways a debacle because it was all occurring.

136
00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:01.250
Again.
Think of the dates at the time of the civil rights movement.
Anyway,

137
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:05.690
I had just published a book on civil war memory this long tome,

138
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:09.320
and here comes this the last day,
and I was thinking,
Oh,
Bruce Catton,

139
00:10:09.321 --> 00:10:10.880
I'm sure he'll agree with me

140
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.910
now,
and this essay,
which was later published,

141
00:10:16.911 --> 00:10:21.911
I discovered and cat and wrote it in 1965 he muses about memory and you use the

142
00:10:24.351 --> 00:10:25.350
actual word memory,

143
00:10:25.351 --> 00:10:29.150
and that that was reassuring because I was writing about memory in a world and a

144
00:10:29.151 --> 00:10:31.460
world of academics who were over there.
I was,

145
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.460
were very suspicious about what the hell this idea of memory was supposed to

146
00:10:34.461 --> 00:10:35.294
mean.

147
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:40.880
He marveled in this piece and how Americans had healed.

148
00:10:40.881 --> 00:10:45.260
That was his word from their civil war,
from this kind of bloodletting,

149
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.740
how a nation of or a hundred years had healed,
he said,

150
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:54.500
and that a nation could actually commemorate us,
civil war so openly,

151
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:59.000
all over the landscape.
He said,
was truly remarkable,

152
00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:03.830
if not unprecedented in modern history.
The war,

153
00:11:03.831 --> 00:11:07.130
he said was his word,
a source of unity.

154
00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.740
The memory of our civil war,
and I'm quoting Bruce Catton,

155
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:18.910
1965 has not been a divisive force in this country.

156
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.570
I had one of those moments where I said,
Oh God,

157
00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:30.190
Bruce say it ain't so,
you didn't say that

158
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:36.950
reminded me of the time I ran into my greatest baseball hero ever on airport.

159
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.550
Probably don't even know him.
Al Kayline,

160
00:11:40.551 --> 00:11:44.090
the right fielder for the Detroit Tigers,
the one and only LK line,

161
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:48.710
only Roberto Clemente could even come close to Caitlin is a right to run into an

162
00:11:48.711 --> 00:11:53.711
airport once end of his career and I was about 28 and he was smoking

163
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.060
<v 1>a cigarette.
Damn,</v>

164
00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.590
don't meet your heroes.

165
00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.600
<v 0>How could Bruce have written that sentence?</v>

166
00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:07.290
And I just written a 500 page book that argued exactly the opposite

167
00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:14.520
for forging all this unit I read on in the essay for forging all of this unity.

168
00:12:14.521 --> 00:12:19.410
He gave most of the credit to grant and Lee at Appa Maddix and the nature of the

169
00:12:19.411 --> 00:12:24.030
surrender,
the compassionate character of that surrender at Appomattox.

170
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:26.740
<v 1>Okay.</v>

171
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.000
<v 0>But then he went on.</v>

172
00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:33.001
He said primarily he gave credit to what he called the confederate legend,

173
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.700
which he described as,
I'm quoting him,

174
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:40.660
a mighty omnipresent force in the land.

175
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.690
In all seriousness,
it's all quoting captain.

176
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:49.020
The legend of the loss cause has been an asset to the entire country

177
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:52.830
and that just blew me away.

178
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:54.260
<v 1>Okay.</v>

179
00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:58.250
<v 0>Oh Bruce,
please tell me you didn't write that</v>

180
00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:04.900
captains portrayal of the law causing this essay was that of a benign innocent

181
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:10.870
romantic cluster of legends about the old south driven by the assumption as he

182
00:13:12.231 --> 00:13:13.970
put it,
that quote,

183
00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:17.750
no hint of enmities should ever be kept

184
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.713
<v 1>alive.</v>

185
00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:26.260
<v 0>His laws cause in the brevity of one essay was a story of noble sacrifice by the</v>

186
00:13:27.711 --> 00:13:32.711
south and heroism of an astrologer for an older civilization that had been some

187
00:13:33.801 --> 00:13:38.801
kind of bull work against modernism and Indian as cat and put it the confederate

188
00:13:42.051 --> 00:13:46.220
legend,
the loss,
cause he said,
quote saved us.

189
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:52.840
I couldn't really take it anymore.
At the very end of the essay,

190
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:53.703
Caton

191
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.900
<v 1>redeemed himself a bit.</v>

192
00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:02.440
<v 0>He acknowledged that in 1965 the war had left.</v>

193
00:14:02.691 --> 00:14:07.691
He said the unfinished business of black equality as its deepest legacy.

194
00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:11.810
And that quote,

195
00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:17.170
the Negro was what the war was about somehow.

196
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:25.580
Now that was probably a ribbon given how closely Caton new Lincoln loved

197
00:14:25.831 --> 00:14:30.300
Lincoln.
I was probably a riff on Lincoln's use of the word.

198
00:14:30.301 --> 00:14:35.301
Somehow in the second inaugural or Lincoln says somehow all knew the war was

199
00:14:37.741 --> 00:14:38.574
about slavery.

200
00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:43.610
And we've been trying to explain that somehow in our 65 to 70,000 books on the

201
00:14:43.711 --> 00:14:45.390
civil well at some of them have

202
00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:48.910
<v 1>ever since.
Now</v>

203
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:53.360
<v 0>I remember rising from that thinking,
well I just lost another hero.</v>

204
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.350
How could Bruce Catton of settle all of this?
Well,
for one thing,

205
00:14:57.351 --> 00:14:59.420
he never did any research on the lost cause.

206
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:03.470
He didn't know the laws cause they didn't know that the lost cause became

207
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.020
essentially a racial ideology,

208
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.860
that it became a cluster of legends as he put it.

209
00:15:09.861 --> 00:15:13.220
But a cluster of legends in the service of white supremacy.

210
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.890
A few assumptions in search of a history

211
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:22.230
and any ideology that came to be the buttressing,

212
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.350
the base of Jim Crow America.

213
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.990
But then I started thinking more and more and I began to realize,

214
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.440
don't be emotional about this.

215
00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:35.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

216
00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:40.630
<v 0>Bruce Catton was actually in 1965 capturing absolutely capturing the mainstream</v>

217
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:48.910
American conception of the lost cause and a civil war memory

218
00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:56.020
that the south heroism that the confederacy's effort to stake all on the line

219
00:15:58.401 --> 00:15:59.900
for its independence,

220
00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.900
that the glorious figure of a Robert E.
Lee,

221
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:09.790
the steadfastness of a Jefferson Davis had indeed become national phenomenon.

222
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:18.870
Captain was just summing up the mainstream of American thought by the 1960s

223
00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:27.020
and that old cliche that you've heard perhaps before many times at the south

224
00:16:27.991 --> 00:16:31.170
lost the war,
but one of the piece or the south lost the war,

225
00:16:31.171 --> 00:16:32.850
but one of the debate over the memory,

226
00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.510
what's basically what captain was summing up.

227
00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:41.430
I think captain believed this too,
but I let him off the hook

228
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.980
because by circa 1965 the understanding of the American civil war and the broad

229
00:16:49.981 --> 00:16:51.090
mainstream culture,

230
00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:57.240
not among most African Americans and now a new young generation of historians

231
00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.920
who came of age in the wake of World War Two and we're deeply interested in the

232
00:17:01.921 --> 00:17:06.921
problem of race in American history as never before and deeply inspired by an

233
00:17:07.111 --> 00:17:09.060
anthropological,
sociological,

234
00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:12.570
psychological revolution and the study of race.

235
00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.210
We're beginning to write about it differently.

236
00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:21.740
The great southern poet who lives much of his life,

237
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:26.770
much of the second half of his life right here and whose papers are right there,

238
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:33.520
the [inaudible] Robert Penn Warren wrote brilliantly about this and a little

239
00:17:33.771 --> 00:17:34.490
book,

240
00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:39.490
a little less say action big essay in a little book that he wrote in 1961 called

241
00:17:40.251 --> 00:17:41.990
the legacy of the civil war.

242
00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:47.990
You wrote it for life magazine and was later published as a book in that book,

243
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.360
trying to capture what the meaning of the civil war wasn't American culture a

244
00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:56.361
Hundred Years After Ken Warren said that somewhere in their bones,

245
00:17:56.821 --> 00:17:57.750
and I quote him,

246
00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:03.560
most Americans have a storehouse of lessons drawn from the civil war.

247
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.530
<v 1>Okay.</v>

248
00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:09.300
<v 0>Oh,
exactly what those lessons should be.
Has it been,</v>

249
00:18:09.301 --> 00:18:14.301
I think the most contested question in America's historical memory over and over

250
00:18:15.361 --> 00:18:16.194
again,

251
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:21.230
at least since 1865 and probably even since 1863 when the warrant or went or

252
00:18:24.211 --> 00:18:29.180
revolution
among all the possible lessons of our civil war road,

253
00:18:29.181 --> 00:18:31.790
Robert Penn Warren is the realization,

254
00:18:31.791 --> 00:18:36.791
his words that slavery looms up mountainous Lee in the story and cannot be

255
00:18:37.761 --> 00:18:38.750
talked away.

256
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:40.240
<v 1>Okay.</v>

257
00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:45.240
<v 0>Our culture has spent nearly now a century and a half and it is still at it of</v>

258
00:18:45.611 --> 00:18:50.611
talking away the place of slavery and this event and its place in the aftermath.

259
00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:55.750
When one is happy and forgetfulness said,

260
00:18:55.751 --> 00:18:58.390
Penn Warren facts get forgotten.

261
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:04.000
Or as William Dean Howells put it in 1900 and I think I quote this in the essay

262
00:19:04.001 --> 00:19:09.001
you've read with the American people always like is a tragedy as long as they

263
00:19:09.491 --> 00:19:10.570
can give it a happy ending.

264
00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:15.600
<v 1>Okay.</v>

265
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.080
<v 0>We have a tragic sensibility as a culture,
as long as we can,</v>

266
00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.190
I can see an exit from it.
All right.

267
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:27.020
Let me just give you three hooks to hang your hat on in terms of how Americans

268
00:19:27.021 --> 00:19:29.660
have processed this memory.
Um,

269
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:34.990
I've labeled them reconciliation as white supremacist and emancipation is,

270
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:37.010
and they simply mean this.

271
00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:42.460
There are some other ways of thinking about how civil war memory was processed,

272
00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:47.500
but most of them can come under these categories.
A reconciliation,

273
00:19:47.501 --> 00:19:52.501
his vision of this war took root in the midst of the war.

274
00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:57.550
It took root,
especially in dealing with all the dead

275
00:19:59.210 --> 00:19:59.891
and files.

276
00:19:59.891 --> 00:20:04.400
A new book on this called Republican suffering is a must read if you stay

277
00:20:04.401 --> 00:20:05.780
interested in this subject.

278
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:11.000
I'm conducting an interview with her tomorrow night in New York about that book.

279
00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:15.320
I've talked to so many people keep telling me they can't read past page 50

280
00:20:15.321 --> 00:20:16.850
because it's so depressing

281
00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:24.500
and I usually say something stupid like it's good for you.
Take your pill.

282
00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:30.930
The reconciliation is vision of this war.

283
00:20:30.931 --> 00:20:35.520
I mean somehow putting ourselves back together is rooted right there and putting

284
00:20:35.521 --> 00:20:39.180
bodies back together and then putting hundreds of thousands of bodies in the

285
00:20:39.181 --> 00:20:43.450
ground
and files the book as never before.

286
00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:46.180
We are taken literally into those graves.

287
00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:51.780
She found tremendous evidence of what soldiers themselves did on battlefields to

288
00:20:53.171 --> 00:20:58.171
bury their own dead and sometimes even bury the enemy to give people decent

289
00:20:58.361 --> 00:21:01.420
human burials after they'd been half eaten by dogs.

290
00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:08.690
Nothing like burying a dead man without a coffin on a battlefield that you've

291
00:21:09.331 --> 00:21:10.164
known.

292
00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:14.700
We'll make you pray and beg to be reconciled with something

293
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:21.790
but a second kind of civil war memory
if we can call it.

294
00:21:21.791 --> 00:21:24.370
That was the white supremacists memory,

295
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.490
which took many forms early,

296
00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:32.590
including of course the terror and violence of the Klan and its many imitators

297
00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:38.170
in reconstruction and then locked arms eventually in the later 19th century and

298
00:21:38.171 --> 00:21:42.850
into the 20th century with reconciliation is the of all kinds and our culture

299
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:48.600
and delivered the country a racially segregated memory,

300
00:21:48.791 --> 00:21:53.791
a racially segregated story of this experience at least by 1900 and really even

301
00:21:56.231 --> 00:22:00.590
before
a third kind of memory,

302
00:22:00.591 --> 00:22:04.790
always competing with these,
we might call an emancipation,

303
00:22:04.791 --> 00:22:09.791
this memory embodied in African Americans complex and they have no single memory

304
00:22:12.411 --> 00:22:13.071
of slavery.

305
00:22:13.071 --> 00:22:18.071
The warm emancipation and reconstruction and Nero complex remembrance of what

306
00:22:21.051 --> 00:22:25.610
slavery and their freedom had meant to them,
but an emancipation,

307
00:22:25.611 --> 00:22:28.610
his vision of the civil war was also rooted in the politics of radical

308
00:22:28.611 --> 00:22:29.480
reconstruction.

309
00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:34.640
Also rooted in the three constitutional amendments and conceptions of the war as

310
00:22:34.641 --> 00:22:39.440
a reinvention of the republic and the liberation of blacks to citizenship,

311
00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:43.970
blacks,
and eventually others to constitutional quality.

312
00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:51.270
In the end once you have here is a story eventually of how the forces of

313
00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:54.250
reconciliation overwhelmed

314
00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:57.190
that emancipation,

315
00:22:57.191 --> 00:23:02.191
his vision in the national culture and how an inexorable drive for reunion of

316
00:23:03.881 --> 00:23:08.710
north and south both used race and then trumped it,

317
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.390
but the story doesn't just dead end.

318
00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

319
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:17.350
<v 0>And this white supremacy victory,</v>

320
00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:24.240
this lost cause victory because eventually the loss cause wasn't about causes.

321
00:23:25.301 --> 00:23:27.750
Lost it all.
The lost causes.

322
00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:32.780
He ology of the south became a victory narrative and the victory they argued was

323
00:23:33.191 --> 00:23:35.620
a national victory over reconstruction.

324
00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.470
If you want to say,
if you want to ask,

325
00:23:40.471 --> 00:23:44.310
what was the biggest success in the long struggle over civil war memory?

326
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:49.430
It was the of the loss caused ideology in selling themselves to northerners who

327
00:23:50.901 --> 00:23:53.510
bought in and said,
yes,

328
00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:57.050
the nation has finally triumphed over the mistake of reconstruction.

329
00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:04.980
But there was a fledgling neo abolitionists tradition that emancipation,

330
00:24:04.981 --> 00:24:06.780
his vision of the civil war and never died.

331
00:24:06.781 --> 00:24:11.340
A permanent death in American culture by any means kept alive by blacks,

332
00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:14.460
black leadership and white allies.

333
00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:15.950
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

334
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:20.950
<v 0>There is a persistence of that memory that frankly folks made possible the civil</v>

335
00:24:21.081 --> 00:24:25.580
rights revolution of the fifties and sixties and it was happening even before

336
00:24:25.581 --> 00:24:26.414
the 50s

337
00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:32.283
<v 1>okay.</v>

338
00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:36.690
<v 0>But if one thing in particular happen to the memory of the civil war,</v>

339
00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:42.240
it found its way eventually into a broad consensus.

340
00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:47.640
In the broader national culture,
there was never an animus of course,

341
00:24:47.641 --> 00:24:52.641
but in a broader national culture that somehow in this war and this Armageddon

342
00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:58.140
in this blood letting everybody had been right,

343
00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:00.780
nobody had been wrong.

344
00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:05.280
You want to reconcile a country that's had a horrifying civil war.

345
00:25:05.281 --> 00:25:06.114
How do you do it?

346
00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:09.290
<v 1>Okay,</v>

347
00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.870
<v 0>well,
you start building thousands upon thousands of monument.</v>

348
00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:15.810
You started having soldier reunions.

349
00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:18.900
You've read about the Gettysburg reunion in this essay of mine.

350
00:25:18.901 --> 00:25:22.110
I won't even go into that.
The biggest of all the blue gray reunions,

351
00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:27.150
which became a Jim crow reunion by 1913 and Ken Burns did not tell you that in

352
00:25:27.151 --> 00:25:32.100
his film and played a very interesting trick on you without editing button by

353
00:25:32.101 --> 00:25:37.000
showing you black and white veterans at the 1913 reunion,
shaking hands and,
and,

354
00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:41.070
and an irresistible beautiful emotional moment.

355
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:46.400
The trouble is those veterans were shaking hands 25 years later in 1938 at the,

356
00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:50.310
at the uh,
new deal reunion at Gettysburg.

357
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:54.930
They weren't there in 1913 but in the film,
that's certainly what it looks like.

358
00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:57.850
<v 1>Okay.</v>

359
00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:58.870
<v 0>Power of filmmaking.</v>

360
00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:06.090
It was a popular novel published in 1912 Zulian popular novels published about

361
00:26:07.001 --> 00:26:10.960
the civil war,
but this one was by a southern woman writer,

362
00:26:10.961 --> 00:26:15.550
a very interesting writer.
We don't read much today if anybody reads her,

363
00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.330
although she was important in her time.
Her name was Mary Johnston.

364
00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:21.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

365
00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:26.670
<v 0>She was a Virginian born to the upper crust of Virginia planter life born just</v>

366
00:26:28.901 --> 00:26:33.280
after the war.
She was imbued with the loss cause tradition,

367
00:26:33.281 --> 00:26:36.310
but grew up wanting to interrogate it a little bit.

368
00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:41.110
She was a lost cause her but,
but she asks questions about it.

369
00:26:41.111 --> 00:26:45.900
She became a suffragist,
a real progressive woman in so many ways.

370
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:50.250
She wrote a trilogy of civil war books,
her most famous book,

371
00:26:50.251 --> 00:26:51.360
and it was a huge best seller,

372
00:26:51.361 --> 00:26:56.361
was called to have and to hold one of her trilogy is a novel called cease

373
00:26:56.791 --> 00:26:59.220
firing,
which also was a near best seller.

374
00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.190
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

375
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:03.710
<v 0>And cease firing on the last page of the book.</v>

376
00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:09.680
She has Lee's army retreating from Richmond out toward their surrender.

377
00:27:09.681 --> 00:27:12.460
It happen Maddix and she's a good writer.

378
00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:19.590
And literally on the last two pages she has two confederate soldiers in their

379
00:27:19.591 --> 00:27:22.620
rags,
half starved in conversation

380
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:29.930
and one of these old veterans as to the other.
What do you thinks it all means?

381
00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.360
What?
What's it all about brother

382
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:35.720
and the other answers and says,

383
00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.560
I think that we were both right and both wrong.

384
00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:44.930
And then in the beginning each side might've been more patient and much wiser

385
00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:48.950
life and history and right and wrong in the minds of men.

386
00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.800
Look out of more windows than we used to think.

387
00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:56.870
Did you never hear of the shield that had two sides and both were made of

388
00:27:56.871 --> 00:27:57.860
precious metal?

389
00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.093
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

390
00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:05.240
<v 0>Why didn't we just get along?
We were both right.</v>

391
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:07.703
<v 1>No,</v>

392
00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.490
<v 0>that's an honest sentiment.</v>

393
00:28:09.491 --> 00:28:13.870
She puts in the mouths of a of a half star of confederate veteran who the lucky

394
00:28:13.871 --> 00:28:18.790
to be alive and is now either about to dessert or surrender to the union army.

395
00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.720
Neither option of which he ever hope to live to have to face.

396
00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:29.370
And she also captures in that moment a very honest sentiment that it's city and

397
00:28:29.711 --> 00:28:31.060
all over American culture,

398
00:28:31.061 --> 00:28:35.200
especially in veterans culture and all those blue gray reunions and the Getty's

399
00:28:35.201 --> 00:28:38.830
were blue,
gray reunion was about to occur the following year after this book was

400
00:28:38.831 --> 00:28:43.690
published.
And that is the sense of the mutuality of sacrifice among soldiers

401
00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:51.210
cure
the hatreds of war

402
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.460
by bringing the warriors together

403
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:59.920
cause they have a mutuality of experience.

404
00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.233
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

405
00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:04.750
<v 0>But there was a,
and there was of course,</v>

406
00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:08.980
no lack of honor at Appa Maddix on either side.

407
00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:10.973
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

408
00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.560
<v 0>But outside of all that Paso's that,
that understanding,</v>

409
00:29:15.561 --> 00:29:19.520
that sentiment that Americans in born in Dubai,
the millions,

410
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:25.750
there was of course another whole story going on out in them in American culture

411
00:29:25.791 --> 00:29:27.020
and in national memory.

412
00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:34.100
In 1912 the NAACP counted 72 lynchings in America and about 90% of whom are

413
00:29:36.481 --> 00:29:39.960
African Americans.
By 1912 when that book was published,

414
00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:45.170
the entire Jim crow legal system in all of its absurdities was fully in place

415
00:29:45.551 --> 00:29:50.551
roughly by about 1910 across the south and in some of the border states and to

416
00:29:50.711 --> 00:29:52.390
some extent even in the north.

417
00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:57.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

418
00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:01.260
<v 0>Any ratio,
a cultural,</v>

419
00:30:01.261 --> 00:30:06.261
historical mnemonic e ratio had been going on for three,

420
00:30:09.571 --> 00:30:14.480
four and five decades
of emancipation.

421
00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:15.620
<v 1>Okay.</v>

422
00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:20.420
<v 0>From the national narrative of what this war had even ever been about.</v>

423
00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:26.620
That process led the great black scholar Wb Dubois the same year in 1912 and the

424
00:30:27.831 --> 00:30:28.940
crisis magazine,

425
00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:33.680
the Journal of Naacp to conclude as he put it,

426
00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:36.050
this country

427
00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:42.550
has had its appetite for facts on the civil war and the Negro problem spoiled by

428
00:30:45.081 --> 00:30:49.310
sweets.
They eating too much candy.

429
00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:55.930
We give you one other example from one of these other blue gray reunion by the

430
00:30:56.151 --> 00:30:59.410
1890s these weren't easy to do.
These,

431
00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:03.480
these blue gray reunion is bringing back and federal union veterans to all

432
00:31:03.481 --> 00:31:07.100
battlefields or sites and cities and so forth.
These weren't easy to do.

433
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:11.450
They first attempted doing it in the 1870s confederates didn't want to come to

434
00:31:11.451 --> 00:31:15.320
these things.
1880s even.
It wasn't easy to do.

435
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:19.490
They had won at Gettysburg on the 20th anniversary and on the 25th anniversary.

436
00:31:19.491 --> 00:31:22.370
But it's hard,
especially to get a confederates to go to Gettysburg,

437
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:25.520
the scene of their worst defeat.

438
00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:31.660
But by the 1890s 25 years out now and 30 years out from the war with the

439
00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:36.441
transmission,

440
00:31:36.441 --> 00:31:40.790
and we know this about so many events in the way generations learn from one

441
00:31:40.791 --> 00:31:44.120
another and the way memory gets passed on as soon as there is truly a

442
00:31:44.121 --> 00:31:45.920
generational transition,

443
00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:51.110
the old veterans as they get older,
are willing to come.

444
00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:57.840
The 1900 blue gray reunion was held in Atlanta and by the way,

445
00:31:57.841 --> 00:31:59.780
southern cities started to compete for these things.

446
00:31:59.781 --> 00:32:01.590
It's like northern cities because they were huge.

447
00:32:01.591 --> 00:32:05.280
Moneymakers thousands and thousands of veterans would come with their families

448
00:32:05.281 --> 00:32:07.260
and spend thousands and thousands of dollars.
Anyway,

449
00:32:07.261 --> 00:32:09.900
in 1900 the blue gray was in Atlanta

450
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.340
and during the major speeches at that reunion,

451
00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:18.930
the commander of the GAA are the grand army of the republic.

452
00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:23.280
The big northern a veteran's organization was a guy named Sean from

453
00:32:23.281 --> 00:32:25.320
Massachusetts,
no relation to Robert Gould,

454
00:32:25.321 --> 00:32:30.321
Shaw of the famous 54th mass and in his speech he lectured the confederate

455
00:32:32.911 --> 00:32:35.370
veterans is sky,
had a lot of New England Chutzpah.

456
00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:40.790
He lectured them about their efforts to school textbooks,

457
00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:44.210
which by the way,
all veterans organizations were absolutely doing.

458
00:32:44.211 --> 00:32:49.211
Every confederate Veterans Organization had its textbook committee and many

459
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:53.480
union veterans post and organizations had their textbook committee.

460
00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:57.890
They were competing with one another to control the story in American textbooks

461
00:32:57.891 --> 00:33:01.730
and trying to lobby and control publishers.
Anyway,

462
00:33:01.731 --> 00:33:06.170
commanders show was a little exercised about this and he said among other
things,

463
00:33:06.171 --> 00:33:06.440
quote,

464
00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:10.880
and you can almost see a sort of school in Garmisch finger wagging and what he

465
00:33:10.881 --> 00:33:13.670
says,
he said,
quote,

466
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:18.700
keeping alive sectional teachings as to the Justice and rights of the cause of

467
00:33:19.791 --> 00:33:24.670
the south in the hearts of your children is all out of order.

468
00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.640
It is unwise and unjust.

469
00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:29.893
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

470
00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:35.810
<v 0>The commander of the United confederate veterans was none other than John Be</v>

471
00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:39.320
Gordon [inaudible].
Gordon had been a confederate general.
John B.

472
00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:43.310
Gordon was the confederate general in charge of the stacking of the arms and the

473
00:33:43.311 --> 00:33:44.750
surrender at Appomattox.

474
00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:47.900
John [inaudible] Gordon and went on to get elected senator governor and then

475
00:33:47.901 --> 00:33:50.000
senator from Georgia during reconstruction.

476
00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:53.330
He was also one of the founders of the Ku Klux Klan in Georgia all the way.

477
00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:56.990
Lied through his teeth and the KKK hearings of 1871 about it,

478
00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:01.310
but John Be Gordon by the 1890s became one of the most ubiquitous and popular

479
00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:04.820
confederate memorial day speakers and he was good at it.

480
00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.700
He got up to respond to commanders Shaw,

481
00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:12.890
and this is a final passage in what he said,

482
00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:14.870
John,

483
00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:19.870
be Gordon 1900 head of the UCV United confederate veterans when he tells me in

484
00:34:20.571 --> 00:34:23.330
my southern comrades are the teaching our children,

485
00:34:23.331 --> 00:34:27.980
that the cause for which we fought and our comrades died is all wrong.

486
00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:32.690
I must earnestly protest in the name of the future man hood of the south.

487
00:34:32.691 --> 00:34:33.590
I protest.

488
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:37.550
What are we to teach to them if we cannot teach them that their fathers were

489
00:34:37.551 --> 00:34:37.911
right?

490
00:34:37.911 --> 00:34:41.360
It follows that these southern children must be taught that they were wrong.

491
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:46.930
I never will be ready to have my children taught that I was ever wrong or that

492
00:34:47.751 --> 00:34:52.280
the cause of my people was unjust,
an unholy.
All my friends,

493
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:54.890
you were right,
but we were right to

494
00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:02.290
<v 1>everybody was right.
Nobody was wrong</v>

495
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:08.630
<v 0>in a war that killed 620,000 people and maimed about 1.2 million and transform</v>

496
00:35:09.091 --> 00:35:10.710
the society,
but no one was wrong.

497
00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:17.513
<v 1>Okay?</v>

498
00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:23.830
<v 0>In fact,
by the 18 nine is a big as it is still today became very popular</v>

499
00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:27.000
to be a confederate veteran.

500
00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:30.420
If you've read Tony Horowitz's confederates in the attic,

501
00:35:30.421 --> 00:35:35.100
he showed how so many civil war reenactors,
it appears still today,

502
00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:39.970
prefer to reenact then the reenact unionists,

503
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:44.040
although the lots of union reenactors and I know lots of black reenactors,

504
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:49.050
which raises a fascinating,
uh,
intellectual question,

505
00:35:49.051 --> 00:35:50.730
which we don't have to dwell on now.

506
00:35:50.731 --> 00:35:53.880
And that is why his defeat sometimes more interesting than victory.

507
00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:55.920
Ask yourselves that.

508
00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:01.830
Why do those Nazis never disappear from the bookstore shelves?

509
00:36:01.831 --> 00:36:05.160
Often right up front
Nazis,

510
00:36:05.161 --> 00:36:09.000
dogs in the civil war is the publisher sometimes tell you if you're right about

511
00:36:09.001 --> 00:36:13.200
those,
we'll buy it.
We'll sell it.
Hate being in that category.

512
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:15.083
<v 1>Okay.</v>

513
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:21.050
<v 0>And then there are those who will say things like Nazis,
Holocaust memoirs,</v>

514
00:36:21.051 --> 00:36:25.370
dogs on the civil war,
horses too.
Big Deal here in the horses.

515
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:28.640
Anyway,
the confederate veteran magazine,

516
00:36:28.641 --> 00:36:33.641
which become a very popular magazine in the 1890s and lasting like 35 years into

517
00:36:33.711 --> 00:36:37.280
the 20th century,
ran this little story in 1894

518
00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:42.870
it reported a story of a southern woman,
a white woman,

519
00:36:42.871 --> 00:36:46.140
and her son attending a production of theater production in Brooklyn,

520
00:36:46.141 --> 00:36:51.141
New York of the play called Hell by the enemy and theater productions plays

521
00:36:52.201 --> 00:36:53.640
about the civil war,

522
00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:59.210
especially with some kind of reconciliation is theme became wildly popular by

523
00:36:59.341 --> 00:37:04.080
the 1890s the boy sitting there with his mother,

524
00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:07.950
according to the anonymous author,
ask his mother,

525
00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.620
what did the Yankees fight for mother,

526
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:15.810
and as the orchestra strikes up marching through Georgia,

527
00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:20.310
the woman answers for the union darling.

528
00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.920
Painful memories were told,

529
00:37:24.921 --> 00:37:29.921
bring sadness to the mother's face as she hears the Yankee Victory Song and then

530
00:37:31.521 --> 00:37:33.200
earnestly the boy asks,

531
00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:36.680
what did the confederates fight for mother

532
00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:43.350
and before the mother can answer the music changes to home sweet home,

533
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:45.930
which fills the theater,

534
00:37:45.931 --> 00:37:50.931
says the author with its depth of untold melody and Patheos.

535
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:57.270
The mother whispers are answered to her son.
Do you hear what they are playing?

536
00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:00.240
That is what confederates fought for,

537
00:38:00.241 --> 00:38:03.750
darling and the boy counters.

538
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.090
Did they fight for their homes?

539
00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:07.520
<v 1>Okay.</v>

540
00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.080
<v 0>And with the parents assurance,</v>

541
00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:14.680
the boy burst into tears and with what the author calls the intuition of,

542
00:38:14.841 --> 00:38:18.800
right,
he hugs his mother and announces,

543
00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:23.380
Oh mother,
I will be a confederate.

544
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:31.670
No,
just fought for their homes.
That's all you needed to know.

545
00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:36.160
No,
maybe all a mother would want a little boy to know.

546
00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:43.370
But all over American culture
there were millions

547
00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:46.310
who didn't really want to know anymore.

548
00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:54.130
Everybody was right.
Nobody was wrong.

549
00:38:55.510 --> 00:39:00.510
There are a hundred ways to plant this story or examples through which to tell

550
00:39:00.731 --> 00:39:05.410
this story and I don't want to take really any more time on it.

551
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:09.610
Uh,
you can read a book called race and reunion if it ever,
so moves you.

552
00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:13.660
I want to get to our review.
Yes,
I am getting to our review,

553
00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:18.730
but I do want to leave you with this thought.
The two images,

554
00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.970
if I can,
uh,

555
00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:25.810
three images actually.

556
00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:29.923
<v 1>Okay.</v>

557
00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:33.270
<v 0>Or two metaphors.
One,
I guess isn't quite a metaphor.</v>

558
00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:39.780
In the second chapter of Dubois is the souls of black folk.
Okay,

559
00:39:39.781 --> 00:39:42.180
I'm going to test how many of you've read souls of black folk.

560
00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:45.680
I know we got work to do it.
Yale,

561
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:49.880
no one should have a degree from Yale without reading souls of black folk.

562
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:53.090
No one should have US citizenship without reading folds the black book,

563
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:54.860
but since I don't rule the world,
who cares?

564
00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:58.870
Chapter two of Dubois,

565
00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:03.380
his masterpiece is an essay he called the dawn of freedom.

566
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:07.430
He starts out extensively as an essay on a kind of a little history of the

567
00:40:07.431 --> 00:40:11.960
Freedman's bureau and a little take on reconstruction,
but he turns it into much,

568
00:40:11.961 --> 00:40:15.920
much more.
It turns it into a meditation,

569
00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:17.960
Not Unlike Penn Warren,

570
00:40:17.961 --> 00:40:22.910
we'll do an 90 61 but a meditation on the meaning and memory of slavery,

571
00:40:22.911 --> 00:40:24.560
the civil war and reconstruction,

572
00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:30.780
and he goes into a discussion is only do boys could cause.

573
00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:34.150
Dubois was really a poet,
historian or historian has poet.

574
00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:40.320
He begins to discuss how bleak life actually is on the ground and the south,

575
00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:46.840
not just for the Friedman as sharecroppers,
but for whites as well.

576
00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:50.580
That poverty is a black and white thing.

577
00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:55.820
He says he's got another chapter to come in the book called the black belt where

578
00:40:56.460 --> 00:41:01.230
he shows that poverty is something southern is share if they would.

579
00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:04.120
<v 1>Okay.</v>

580
00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.880
<v 0>And then he stops and he says in effect,</v>

581
00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:12.130
see this picture with me through what he calls two figures.

582
00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:20.770
He says there are two figures in his view that typified the postwar era

583
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:27.370
and the power of its legacies.
Here's the passage.

584
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:30.930
Two figures as Dubois is quote the One uh,

585
00:41:30.931 --> 00:41:35.931
Gray hair gentlemen whose had quit themselves like men whose son's laying

586
00:41:36.441 --> 00:41:40.670
nameless graves who bowed to the evil of slavery because its abolition

587
00:41:40.671 --> 00:41:45.290
threatened untold ill to all who stood at last in the evening of life.

588
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:48.810
A ruin form with Hayden is on

589
00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.680
your first figure is an old white man,

590
00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:58.140
probably a former planter who's lost everything.

591
00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:02.080
He's bitter.
I mean he's,
he's really bitter,

592
00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:03.003
<v 1>okay.</v>

593
00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:06.380
<v 0>He feels a burden of southern history,</v>

594
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:10.940
none.
Dubois says,

595
00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:16.240
and the other form hovering dark and mother like her awful face,

596
00:42:16.881 --> 00:42:21.881
black with the myths of centuries had a four time quail that that White Masters

597
00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:26.810
Command had been in love over the cradles of his sons and daughters and closed

598
00:42:26.811 --> 00:42:27.261
in death.

599
00:42:27.261 --> 00:42:32.261
The sunken eyes of his wife and I to at his behest had laid herself low to his

600
00:42:32.931 --> 00:42:37.931
lust and born atony man child to the world only to see her dark boys limbs

601
00:42:39.651 --> 00:42:44.651
scattered to the winds by midnight marauders riding after damn niggers.

602
00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:50.470
Second image,
an old black woman,

603
00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:52.870
former slave

604
00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:55.613
<v 1>mami,</v>

605
00:42:56.970 --> 00:43:00.300
<v 0>but also broken.
No future.</v>

606
00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:05.050
It doesn't even know where that sun might be in the sun is probably dead,

607
00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:09.880
but do boys presses the issue?
The boys?

608
00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.950
Is that a genuine sense of tragedy?

609
00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:15.310
And he didn't care sometimes whether we gave you a happy ending,

610
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.740
he pressed the issue.
He says,
then these were the saddest sites.

611
00:43:20.741 --> 00:43:25.741
I'm quoting of that Woelfel day and no man clasp the hands of these passing

612
00:43:28.181 --> 00:43:31.990
figures of the present past legacy.
We're past and present.

613
00:43:31.991 --> 00:43:34.240
Meet no man.

614
00:43:34.241 --> 00:43:38.110
Clasp the hands of these passing figures of the present past.

615
00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:39.250
But hating,

616
00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:44.640
they went to their long home and hating their children's children live today.

617
00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:47.860
Now,

618
00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:52.860
unmistakably Dubois is using that language of clasping hands for a purpose

619
00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:57.580
because it's by far the most ubiquitous image used and all the blue gray

620
00:43:57.581 --> 00:44:02.500
reunions by the 90s he first wrote this essay in 1897 and revise it,

621
00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:06.340
the souls of black folk in 1903 but the most ubiquitous image and all the blue

622
00:44:06.341 --> 00:44:09.160
gray reunions was then,
in fact,

623
00:44:09.161 --> 00:44:13.180
the slogan was clasping hands across the bloody chasm

624
00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:18.650
and the shaking of hands of the blue and the gray,
the old confederate Yvette's,

625
00:44:18.651 --> 00:44:21.200
the old union vets was always the the,
you know the,

626
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:26.240
the photo op and it's all over the ending of burns.
This film.
How can it,

627
00:44:26.241 --> 00:44:29.120
how could you and how can you resist it in some ways,

628
00:44:29.121 --> 00:44:31.440
what can be more beautiful than old,

629
00:44:31.441 --> 00:44:34.530
old men chest full of medals,

630
00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:38.520
shaking hands across the walls.
They tried to kill each other over.

631
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:43.830
There's something human about that that we can't quite resist.
But Dubois says,

632
00:44:43.831 --> 00:44:44.341
you know what?

633
00:44:44.341 --> 00:44:47.910
There are two other kinds of veterans of the civil war and no one's ever class

634
00:44:47.911 --> 00:44:48.744
with their hands

635
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:59.590
and that will just ask you to think.

636
00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:02.770
I don't not doing this for any political partisan reason.

637
00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:06.580
I don't know if you've read it,

638
00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:09.700
but at the very end of Barack Obama's race speech,

639
00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:13.180
I'm talking about Obama now was a historian not as a candidate.

640
00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.160
He's got enough problems with it.

641
00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:21.760
Reverend Wright right now,

642
00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:27.010
this is Obama,
the writer,

643
00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:32.610
and I don't know if he read chapter two of souls before he wrote that speech in

644
00:45:33.551 --> 00:45:36.730
Philadelphia month ago.
Doesn't really matter if he did.

645
00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:39.130
I don't remember if you're read to the end of it,

646
00:45:39.131 --> 00:45:41.830
if you've read it or if you heard it.
I know I've actually never heard it.

647
00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:42.673
I've only read it,

648
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:48.510
but the way he ended that speech is the way a lot of politicians get up on the

649
00:45:48.521 --> 00:45:51.250
stump and talk and at first you're ready to dismiss it.

650
00:45:51.251 --> 00:45:54.420
It's another one of those stories of,
I met somebody on the campaign trail.

651
00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.940
Here's what she said to me,
and she had this terrible story to tell.

652
00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:01.260
Let me tell you her terrible story
and you start tuning out.

653
00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:02.051
Oh God,

654
00:46:02.051 --> 00:46:06.760
here comes another story of old aunt something or other and on welfare or

655
00:46:06.761 --> 00:46:09.370
whatever,
but no,

656
00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:14.400
it's a story of a young 23 year old white woman named Ashley by year who is his

657
00:46:15.701 --> 00:46:18.700
campaign manager in Florence,
South Carolina,

658
00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:23.590
and he remembered the story of when he,
during the South Carolina primary,

659
00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:26.920
it was doing an event in Florence,
South Carolina.

660
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:31.950
He meets Ashley and Ashley tells him her story and that story is and brief that

661
00:46:32.471 --> 00:46:36.130
she grew up with a single mother,
poor,

662
00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:41.740
poor white girl in the south at age about town.
Her mother got cancer,
lost a job,

663
00:46:41.741 --> 00:46:44.470
family went bankrupt,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

664
00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:48.220
In order to help out her mother's told the story of eating nothing but mustard

665
00:46:48.221 --> 00:46:50.920
and relish sandwiches for a year,
a year and a half.

666
00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:54.520
Apparently her mother survive,

667
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:56.830
but they never really don't survive with the bankruptcy,

668
00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:02.860
but somehow as she got older,
she got interested in politics.

669
00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:06.880
Now that's a white working lower working class,

670
00:47:06.881 --> 00:47:11.530
poor southern girl who had every right to be in that group do.

671
00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:15.610
Obama had described earlier who are the whites in America with a lot of

672
00:47:15.611 --> 00:47:18.190
resentment of all the racial changes in America.

673
00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:23.190
Instead she becomes his campaign manager and she put together this whole

674
00:47:23.191 --> 00:47:24.800
gathering in Florence and some,
I don't,

675
00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:28.950
church hall or wherever they were meeting mostly black folk and then Obama.

676
00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:34.350
How everybody in the room had to go around and say why they were there or what

677
00:47:34.631 --> 00:47:35.890
issue they were there for,

678
00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:41.230
and he says with quite some directness that most people did,

679
00:47:41.231 --> 00:47:46.150
what most people do,
they name a single issue.
It's about them.
It's about us,

680
00:47:46.151 --> 00:47:49.300
right?
Not about the common good.
It's about us.

681
00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:54.760
I want a better job.
I want health care.
I want that.
I want that.
I want,
I want,

682
00:47:54.761 --> 00:47:56.690
I want.
Okay,
fair enough.

683
00:47:57.770 --> 00:48:01.430
And finally come around to an old black man is sitting there kind of at the end

684
00:48:01.431 --> 00:48:05.480
of the isles and he's asked to,
why are you here?

685
00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:09.570
Obama doesn't even name him.
He says,

686
00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:13.860
I'm just here because Ashley brought me here.
I'm only here because of Ashley.

687
00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:17.603
<v 1>No,</v>

688
00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.580
<v 0>Obama says in effect,
she develops it.</v>

689
00:48:21.581 --> 00:48:25.660
The end of the speech or refrain about not this time.
He says,

690
00:48:25.661 --> 00:48:30.610
not this time.
We're not going to let race divide us this time.

691
00:48:30.611 --> 00:48:35.611
Like Dubois has two figures hating to their death and hating their children's

692
00:48:35.951 --> 00:48:40.450
children lived today.
Well,
here are our two children,

693
00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:42.370
but not what he's reversed.

694
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:47.350
We've got a young white woman who should have been in the resentful white

695
00:48:47.351 --> 00:48:52.351
working class and an old black man who no doubt grew up in Jim Crow and probably

696
00:48:53.381 --> 00:48:58.381
have told story after story of the denigration or destruction of his dignity for

697
00:48:59.231 --> 00:49:01.000
the first 45 years of his life.

698
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:05.590
But he's there because of Ashlyn.

699
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.790
<v 1>Thank you.</v>
