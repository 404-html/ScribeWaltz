1
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.260
On the 4th of July,
1854.

2
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.903
<v 1>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.920
<v 0>And an outdoor park in Framingham,
Massachusetts,</v>

4
00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:28.150
which is 1520 miles west of Boston,

5
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.010
William Lloyd Garrison and the Massachusetts,
the Massachusetts,

6
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.860
the antislavery society built a stage.

7
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.190
They had a huge turnout

8
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.270
and garrison and his group performed an active abolitionist theater.

9
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.310
Anthony Burns had just been returned to slavery in Virginia,
Kansas.

10
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.490
Nebraska Act had just been passed and the month of May,

11
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.130
<v 1>yeah.</v>

12
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.180
<v 0>Behind him on the stage,
huge,
uh,</v>

13
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.130
array was first the insignia of the state of Virginia,

14
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.290
then an insignia of the state of Massachusetts,

15
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.570
a banner on one side.

16
00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:30.050
That Red Redeem Massachusetts

17
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.390
hanging from that sign was something labeled the Crape of servitude.

18
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.780
Nothing very subtle about this.

19
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.580
And two flags were on either side of the rostrum,

20
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.550
one labeled Kansas and the other label Nebraska.

21
00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.510
And behind garrison was a very large United States flag upside down.

22
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.140
Oh,
this was political theater

23
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.150
directed by a man who,
uh,
as you remember,

24
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.110
denounce political parties,
uh,
said that,
uh,

25
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.380
participation in political parties was complicit,
was complicity with slavery.

26
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.680
Garrison first read from scripture,

27
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.070
Old Testament Deuteronomy.

28
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.690
Then he proceeded to in three segments to burn documents.

29
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.343
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

30
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.860
<v 0>He first held up and his hand,</v>

31
00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:49.500
what he said was the copy of the fugitive slave act,

32
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.850
which he burned in his hand with a lighted match through the ashes on the floor.

33
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.900
Stomped on the,
and the crowd shouted.
Amen.

34
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.670
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

35
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.750
<v 0>Then he held in his hands the documents for the rendition.</v>

36
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.890
You said it was a copy of the document for the rendition of Anthony Burns

37
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:16.750
returning burns as a fugitive slave to Virginia.
He burned that.

38
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.780
The ashes on the floor stomped on them and the crowd shouted.

39
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:23.614
Amen.

40
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.750
Then he pulled out a copy of the United States constitution,

41
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.500
which he announced as he had announced many times over.
And His newspaper,

42
00:03:36.501 --> 00:03:40.310
the liberal writer,
he called it a quote,

43
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.760
covenant with death and agreement with hell.

44
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.600
So parish all compromisers with tyranny.

45
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.710
He burned it famously or infamously stomped on the ashes all over the stage and

46
00:03:56.961 --> 00:03:59.630
the crowd shouted.
Amen.

47
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.380
The Kansas Nebraska Act had fueled

48
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.190
a political fervor that now could never be,

49
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.650
um,
bottled up again.

50
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.990
It could never be put back in its show.
Why?

51
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.290
Why was that future?
This Emma,
excuse me,
that Kansas Nebraska Act so troublesome.

52
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.550
Let me pick that up where I left you off the other day.

53
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.470
Now remember the Kansas Nebraska Act huts to simple resolutions,

54
00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:49.390
although it came about through a heightening process.

55
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.830
The first was that it explicitly repealed the 36 30 parallel or Missouri

56
00:04:56.291 --> 00:04:57.610
compromise line.

57
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.280
What northerners antislavery abolition this story,

58
00:05:02.281 --> 00:05:06.310
even in some cases hardly aware of slavery.

59
00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:10.540
Northerners had always referred to as the quote sacred pledge.

60
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.590
That sacred pledge was now 34 years old.

61
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.530
Everybody in the United States Congress,
I grown up with it.

62
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.040
It was a template.
It was an assumption,

63
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
not unlike you could name certain great resolutions or assumptions that became

64
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.700
almost standard parts of American political culture,
perhaps in your lifetime.

65
00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:37.900
Certainly in my lifetime,

66
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.160
certain aspects of the new deal we thought

67
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.560
were basic American political assumptions like social security,

68
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.420
but recently that one got challenged.

69
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.791
You can think of others,

70
00:05:55.791 --> 00:05:59.750
the right to collective bargaining of the Wagner act in the 1930 [inaudible].

71
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.820
You can think of other,
some would say Roe v Wade.

72
00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.640
Some would say affirmative action,

73
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.320
so I'm going to say other aspects of our political culture born of the 1960s

74
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.120
some would say the 64 civil rights act,
et cetera.

75
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:18.773
I can't,

76
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.860
the Missouri compromise line as people imagine the slavery question in the West

77
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:29.450
had been seen by northerners as quote a sacred pledge that was not repealed

78
00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:34.601
explicitly in this very sectionalized divided vote in the Kansas Nebraska Act to

79
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:37.400
set up the Kansas Nebraska territory.

80
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.570
The second part was of course a declaration that any state produced,

81
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.750
created from Kansas and Nebraska would be created on a principle of popular

82
00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:53.114
sovereignty.

83
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.400
There would be a popular referendum at some stage and the territorial process to

84
00:06:58.401 --> 00:06:59.420
be worked out later.

85
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:06.550
It past the U S Senate 37 to 14 that's in great part because the Kansas Nebraska

86
00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:12.320
act became an absolute test of Democratic Party loyalty,

87
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.580
which Stephen Douglas demanded.
He didn't get all democrats just support it,

88
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.830
but he got most of them and the Whig party by 1864 and what was still a

89
00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:26.831
fledgling two party system now greatly challenged by third party called the

90
00:07:27.291 --> 00:07:31.970
American party or known more euphemistically as the know.

91
00:07:31.971 --> 00:07:36.470
Nothing party or known more directly as the nativist party.

92
00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:41.471
More on that in a moment is really challenging that third party system in a two

93
00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:42.344
party system,

94
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.600
but it was that vote in the House that I showed you on a graphic the other day

95
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.160
that tells you the story.

96
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:55.220
It passed the House of Representatives one 13 to one 10 and a highly

97
00:07:55.221 --> 00:07:59.840
sectionalized vote.
90% of all southerners on Kansas,

98
00:07:59.841 --> 00:08:02.840
Nebraska voted for it.

99
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:08.740
64% of all northern people from free states voted against it.

100
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:12.790
The American,

101
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.790
the second American party system born out of the struggle over Jacksonian so

102
00:08:19.321 --> 00:08:24.321
called Jacksonian democracy from the 1820s and the 30s into the forties and

103
00:08:24.551 --> 00:08:29.551
early fifties was now disintegrated faster than most people even really realized

104
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.210
the effects of this.
We're quickly this,

105
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:45.110
the Kansas Nebraska Act now through open the vast expanse of what was left of

106
00:08:46.111 --> 00:08:50.070
the Louisiana purchase to the possible expansion of slavery

107
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.370
<v 1>second lane.</v>

108
00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.310
<v 0>It will destroy the party forever</v>

109
00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:02.350
<v 1>and and open a huge vacuum in American political culture for some kind of new</v>

110
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:04.031
coalition,

111
00:09:04.031 --> 00:09:09.031
some kind of new persuasion that would fill it about this great question of its

112
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:09.924
time,

113
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.090
the expansion of slavery and then more directly third,

114
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.660
it brought overnight the birth of the Republican Party,

115
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.450
the original Republican Party,

116
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:27.170
I hasten to a party form literally overnight in reaction to the Kansas Nebraska

117
00:09:29.161 --> 00:09:30.600
Act.
It was often the first call,

118
00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:35.601
the Anti Kansas party there three or four towns all over the Midwest and United

119
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.240
States repping Wisconsin,
Jackson,
Michigan,

120
00:09:39.241 --> 00:09:43.050
and others that all claim to be the site of the birth of the Republican Party

121
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.820
and they all have their little monuments are the plaques and town squares and

122
00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:51.270
parks to say they were the place where the first Republican Party meeting was

123
00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:52.050
held,

124
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:56.460
but there were a part of public and party was really born amidst hundreds of

125
00:09:56.461 --> 00:10:01.461
meetings across the north to discuss the Kansas Nebraska Act to react to it,

126
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.340
to figure out some way to politically resisted.

127
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:08.550
Okay.

128
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:13.080
<v 0>That hell of a storm that Stephen Douglas had predicted is exactly what
happened,</v>

129
00:10:13.081 --> 00:10:14.580
but he didn't have any clue

130
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:16.783
<v 1>the</v>

131
00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:22.410
<v 0>direction or the ferocity of the political storm that this would cause to so</v>

132
00:10:24.521 --> 00:10:29.521
many northerners now who believed who for whom the American dream was mobility

133
00:10:32.561 --> 00:10:36.310
in the west.
Availability of cheap,
if not free land in the West,

134
00:10:36.311 --> 00:10:39.010
the possibility of the small farmer,

135
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:44.310
the small mechanic moving west and getting land in a society without slaves now

136
00:10:45.641 --> 00:10:50.641
seem to be completely thrown up in the air.

137
00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.930
If not denied.

138
00:10:56.350 --> 00:11:00.370
I don't know what to really compare it to today.
That might shock people.

139
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.380
Something you assumed was just going to be there and tomorrow it's not.

140
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:11.400
It's just gone and you basically define the future of your children on it.

141
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.240
Lots of people.
Now I wondered,

142
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:21.770
you know what happened to the compromise of 1850 well that was a essentially

143
00:11:22.411 --> 00:11:26.650
dead letter and what was born in that Republican part.

144
00:11:26.651 --> 00:11:28.440
It what was born in those meetings and forms.

145
00:11:28.441 --> 00:11:31.350
The Republican Party in the summer of 1854

146
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.950
was a theory and idea.

147
00:11:34.951 --> 00:11:39.150
They called the slave power conspiracy air.
Actually,

148
00:11:39.151 --> 00:11:43.170
it wasn't born there.
That's an old idea.
The idea of a

149
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.170
slave power.
Let me zoom on this a bit.

150
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.170
Oh cool.

151
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:57.730
I could become a techie before this course is over.

152
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.340
But the idea of a slave power,
this notion of a,

153
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:06.250
some kind of conspiracy or cadre and oligarchy,

154
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:11.020
a small number of great planters in the deep south and nevertheless had

155
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:15.880
tremendously disproportionate power over their own states,

156
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.970
over their own region.
And then in the Congress and in the Supreme Court in,
in,

157
00:12:20.971 --> 00:12:24.100
in the presidency was an old idea.

158
00:12:24.101 --> 00:12:28.870
I found it as early as the 1820s and an old article I once wrote where people

159
00:12:28.871 --> 00:12:31.480
were actually is already using the term the slave power,

160
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.760
but it really crystallized in the 1850s.

161
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:40.660
This is a poster,
um,
one of hundreds,

162
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:44.950
thousands of posters from 1854,
uh,

163
00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:48.330
calling for a meeting.
It doesn't even use the term Republican party anywhere.

164
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.820
Just calling people together.
It's in Chester,
Pennsylvania.

165
00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:54.790
I think just calling people together to discuss the Kansas Nebraska act to

166
00:12:54.791 --> 00:12:59.791
discuss what's really happened here and to discuss the slave power,

167
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.910
classic 19th century broad side with,
you know,

168
00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:06.280
eight things going on at once in front of your eyes.

169
00:13:06.281 --> 00:13:10.060
But the bold is print is reserved for the slave power.

170
00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.920
<v 1>Fear
conspiracy</v>

171
00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.160
come together,
watch out,
get ready.

172
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.220
<v 0>The fear now you see,</v>

173
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:32.340
think closely about this to northerners was now wait a second if for the Kansas

174
00:13:33.431 --> 00:13:37.150
Nebraska Act is saying is that the Louisiana pertinent all the rest of the

175
00:13:37.151 --> 00:13:40.630
Louisiana purchase is now open to the possible expansion of slavery.

176
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:42.363
<v 1>Okay.</v>

177
00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.700
<v 0>It's got to be rooted in a constitutional theory that probably is supporting</v>

178
00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:48.680
that Fifth Amendment,
which is the right to life,

179
00:13:48.681 --> 00:13:52.160
liberty and property and the transport of that property anywhere you want.

180
00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:59.030
So what's to stop someday somehow slaveholders from coming into Illinois,

181
00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:01.253
<v 1>Ohio,</v>

182
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:07.500
<v 0>New York,
Boston,
I seem a bit farfetched,</v>

183
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.840
but editorial started appearing all over the north like this one from the New

184
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:17.840
York Post that predicted quote gangs of men and women chained together may yet

185
00:14:17.971 --> 00:14:22.971
be seen now marching up or down Broadway or trembling in battery park.

186
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.670
What was born in that summer and especially that fall,

187
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:36.240
was the most rapid third party political coalition movement in all of American

188
00:14:36.431 --> 00:14:37.264
history.

189
00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:42.450
And if you want a prototype for any possibility of that kind any other time in

190
00:14:42.521 --> 00:14:44.710
our political history,
this is it.

191
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:51.560
The Republican Party,
brand new,
not six months old.

192
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:57.960
We'll elect 100 people to the House of Representatives in the fall elections of

193
00:14:58.851 --> 00:15:00.410
1854

194
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:06.130
and they will begin to draw together a remarkable coalition.

195
00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.900
They're going to draw a first,
a whole lot of old Whigs,

196
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.760
northern Whigs in particular,
who don't have any home anymore.

197
00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:18.460
This is the old wig party of Henry Clay,

198
00:15:18.461 --> 00:15:22.660
but it's also the old wig party that had a reformist element to it.

199
00:15:22.661 --> 00:15:27.100
This was the old John Quincy Adams wing of the Whig party,

200
00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.970
and there were some wigs who had become genuine abolitionist

201
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.130
in many states,

202
00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:39.050
and they know we're looking for a real political home in which to plant their

203
00:15:39.051 --> 00:15:41.420
flag.
I've not just free soil,

204
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.180
but a moral case against slavery.

205
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.360
You got the old free soilers.

206
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:51.540
The free soil party had existed in any 48 in the 1852 elections.

207
00:15:51.541 --> 00:15:52.880
And remember I told you they liked it.

208
00:15:52.881 --> 00:15:55.580
The web is it for people that the House of Representatives,

209
00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:04.300
but more importantly,
that Republican party now had tremendous,

210
00:16:04.301 --> 00:16:06.160
we're calling it now crossover,
aren't we?

211
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:09.610
Tremendous Crossover appeal to northern Democrat,

212
00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:14.800
lifelong northern Democrats who will now break with Stephen Douglas,

213
00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.720
break with popular sovereignty,

214
00:16:16.721 --> 00:16:21.721
break with their own political lives and join a new free soil antislavery party.

215
00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.553
David Wilmata,

216
00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:30.700
the author of the Walmart provides all you'll remember from a week ago that

217
00:16:30.701 --> 00:16:34.690
Pennsylvania Democrat who launched this idea during the debates in the Mexican

218
00:16:34.691 --> 00:16:36.160
war,
the sit in any territory,

219
00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:39.430
any state form from a territory gain from the Mexican war,

220
00:16:39.431 --> 00:16:44.290
slavery shall never exist.
The basic free soil position.
In 1854,

221
00:16:44.291 --> 00:16:46.570
David Wilma became a Republican.

222
00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:51.900
This new political coalition,
fledgling as it was,

223
00:16:51.901 --> 00:16:53.760
a lot of strange bedfellows here.

224
00:16:53.761 --> 00:16:57.630
Guys who would just fought like hell with each other for years in the congress.

225
00:16:57.631 --> 00:17:00.360
We're now kind of forming the same party.

226
00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.470
They're forming it around a few key ideas.
One is this,

227
00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:12.090
this notion,
this,
you know,
this idea of a slave power.

228
00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.860
There has to be resisted now,
uh,
as a political force.

229
00:17:16.861 --> 00:17:20.640
It has to be resisted as an expansion,
as migration forced.

230
00:17:20.641 --> 00:17:24.990
It has to be resistant as a labor system.
It has to be resistant.

231
00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:26.723
And secondly,

232
00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:32.960
they are rooting their political future in radiology and what they're calling

233
00:17:33.691 --> 00:17:38.400
quite explicitly now and they've rehearsed this many of them for some years and

234
00:17:38.401 --> 00:17:41.490
antislavery interpretation of the constitution.

235
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:47.630
They're going to now really rehearse publicly the idea that yes,

236
00:17:47.631 --> 00:17:52.631
slavery may be constitutionally where it already exist because slaves are

237
00:17:54.601 --> 00:17:58.080
legally property.
Okay,
we've heard that for decades and they're going to say,

238
00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:03.150
but the federal government has jurisdiction over territories.

239
00:18:03.151 --> 00:18:05.550
It has jurisdiction over the district of Columbia,

240
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:11.190
and the slogan that flows from this idea of a of an anti slavery interpretation

241
00:18:11.191 --> 00:18:16.191
of the Constitution is make freedom national slavery sectional.

242
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:22.550
That's slavery shall forever be.

243
00:18:22.551 --> 00:18:26.450
They say a regional sectional local institution,

244
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:28.370
not a national institution,

245
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:33.430
which was an implicit way of saying the west shall be kept free for free labor

246
00:18:34.821 --> 00:18:35.690
at all costs.

247
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:39.860
And then thirdly,

248
00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.640
the Republican party is rooted and this is why it could become a coalition.

249
00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:46.430
It's rooted in this cluster of ideas.

250
00:18:46.431 --> 00:18:50.030
We've come to call here and Bruce Levine's book is terrific on this,

251
00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:52.670
a free labor ideology,

252
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:58.120
a fear of concentrated power.

253
00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:03.220
The defense of the individual,
the small man.

254
00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:08.500
It was a fanfare for the common man,
the small farmer,
the small clerk,

255
00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:12.220
the small,
small in the sense of he has nothing.

256
00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.370
He may own nothing but he wants to own something.

257
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.170
It's the immigrant with nothing who wants to own a farm

258
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:25.500
and he must have,
at least in this America of it's boundless West,

259
00:19:25.501 --> 00:19:30.000
he must have physical mobility,
geographical mobility,

260
00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.900
and historians have come to define all of this.
Of course,
under a this,

261
00:19:36.901 --> 00:19:41.370
this cluster of notions we call republicanism.

262
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.110
The belief that the United States was,
if not a democracy,

263
00:19:47.111 --> 00:19:48.730
at least a republic

264
00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:55.720
or the people rule or consent of a majority really counts.

265
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:04.550
And if that majority is increasingly becoming small farmers and clerks and

266
00:20:04.861 --> 00:20:08.070
mechanics and a lot of them immigrants,

267
00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:11.810
then oligarchies ought to be put on the run.

268
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.880
Whether those oligarchies are bankers or those oligarchies are made up of slave

269
00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:16.714
holders.

270
00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.160
This was in its birth and for the next six years,

271
00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:31.730
one of the most potent political coalition ideologies this country has ever

272
00:20:32.401 --> 00:20:33.234
seen.

273
00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.840
<v 1>Now what happens next?</v>

274
00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.350
<v 0>What happens to this new coalition?</v>

275
00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:42.373
<v 1>Okay.</v>

276
00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.160
<v 0>Why are they going to be so threatening to the south?</v>

277
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:50.050
This is in some ways it's going to become the planter,

278
00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.690
elite southern slave holding classes,
greatest fear,

279
00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:59.420
a genuine Yankee anti slavery,

280
00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:04.480
northern political party after all the north now has close to pushing a two to

281
00:21:07.701 --> 00:21:10.250
one advantage and population.
That is,

282
00:21:10.251 --> 00:21:14.420
if we'd simply define that by free states.
Slave states.

283
00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:15.940
No.

284
00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:16.773
<v 1>Okay.</v>

285
00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:27.400
<v 0>Oh,
but a zoom back here,</v>

286
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:36.400
maybe you've seen this picture before.
It's the,
uh,

287
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:41.840
it's Alyssa graph of the famous beating of Charles Sumner in the spring of 1856

288
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:47.430
on the floor of the u s Senate by Preston Brooks.

289
00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:52.940
But how do we get to a scene in the u s senate of a southern Congressmen beating

290
00:21:54.721 --> 00:21:59.130
the hell out of,
uh,
out of a Massachusetts senator beating him,

291
00:21:59.131 --> 00:22:04.020
literally unconscious,
uh,
bloodying him on the floor of the Senate

292
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:09.100
while his fellow senators looked on and some of them in Glee,

293
00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:17.860
there were 91 northern Democrats in the House of Representatives when they voted

294
00:22:18.531 --> 00:22:20.210
on the Kansas Nebraska Act.

295
00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:25.790
After the fall elections of 1854,
there were only 25 left.

296
00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.110
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

297
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:31.040
<v 0>This is a political see change happening and no one quite knows where it's going</v>

298
00:22:31.041 --> 00:22:35.780
yet.
And then that same year of 1854,
this nativist party,

299
00:22:35.781 --> 00:22:37.730
they call themselves the American party,

300
00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:43.300
a party that stood essentially for trying to stop Catholic,

301
00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:49.880
namely Catholic immigration into the United States.
This was the,

302
00:22:49.881 --> 00:22:52.250
this was the moment,
of course.
And you look around today,

303
00:22:52.251 --> 00:22:57.080
we've got a huge debate going on about immigration,
and I won't go into that,

304
00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:02.260
but you can see how it's clustering in parts of our political culture heighten

305
00:23:02.641 --> 00:23:05.660
that six times over to the early 1950s,

306
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:10.870
the huge Irish migrations to the United States had just happened between the mid

307
00:23:11.631 --> 00:23:12.530
1840s,

308
00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:16.730
especially the late 1840 [inaudible] and about 1852 to 54.

309
00:23:16.731 --> 00:23:17.690
This is the moment,

310
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:22.370
the historical moment of the terrible infamous potato famine in Ireland.

311
00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:28.090
The native,
his party was anti-catholic,
anti-immigrant.

312
00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:33.310
They believe the Catholicism would undermine American Protestant values and the

313
00:23:33.311 --> 00:23:36.730
Protestant work ethic.
Um,

314
00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:41.790
they believe that the United States of America ought to be a white Anglo Saxon

315
00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:44.530
Protestant nation as it was in its founding.

316
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:51.040
They believed in a conspiracy of popery crazy as that may seem to some of us

317
00:23:52.581 --> 00:23:53.414
today,

318
00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:59.290
they believe that Catholics owed and demonstrated a higher loyalty to the pope

319
00:23:59.961 --> 00:24:04.640
in Rome than they ever would in the United States to the United States

320
00:24:04.641 --> 00:24:08.210
government,
and therefore Catholics could not be true.
Republicans,

321
00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:14.740
I know.
Give me a break,
but it is what this party was rooted in

322
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:19.150
and man,
did they succeed?

323
00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:21.850
<v 1>Okay?</v>

324
00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:26.850
<v 0>They're one huge electoral victories in the fall of 1854 particularly because</v>

325
00:24:27.221 --> 00:24:29.560
there's this new vacuum.
Now,
the Whig party is dead

326
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:37.470
by 1856 and the presidential election of 56 the nativists American party

327
00:24:38.021 --> 00:24:41.560
candidate well went over 800,000 votes for the presidency.

328
00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:43.150
More on that in a second,

329
00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:51.920
the American party won 40 seats in the u s congress in 1854 they dominated a few

330
00:24:53.821 --> 00:24:57.990
northern state legislatures.
They won the governorship of,
of,
of Massachusetts,

331
00:24:57.991 --> 00:25:00.630
and a majority of its legislature.
It shocked people.

332
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:07.690
It's shocked.
Some northern Democrats who weren't comfortable.
Well,

333
00:25:07.691 --> 00:25:12.060
this nativism,
the variance of this nativism to become Republicans instead

334
00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:22.030
now out west,
of course,
what's going to happen to Kansas and Nebraska.

335
00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:26.440
Kansas now became the object of tremendous migration.

336
00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:32.910
It was nothing but a series of frontier settlements in 1855 but pop,

337
00:25:34.711 --> 00:25:37.960
but but large numbers of people began to go there.

338
00:25:37.961 --> 00:25:41.290
These were the so called squatters.
Squatters or farmers.

339
00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:42.773
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

340
00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:48.150
<v 0>but immediately it became a contest between how many Yankees and northerners</v>

341
00:25:48.151 --> 00:25:53.151
would actually get there and try to make the place free soil and how many

342
00:25:53.371 --> 00:25:58.371
southerners would actually get there with slaves and try to produce a pro

343
00:25:59.341 --> 00:26:00.720
slavery constitution.

344
00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:06.070
Kansas became the great testing ground of popular sovereignty.

345
00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.300
Immigrant aid societies is emerge is especially in New England,

346
00:26:14.301 --> 00:26:18.560
one famous one that had a lot of financial backing behind it called the New

347
00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:22.760
England immigrant aid society.
They recruited settlers.
They raised money.

348
00:26:22.761 --> 00:26:26.810
They paid people's way out to Kansas.
In some cases,

349
00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.280
Kansas now became a kind of symbol and reality

350
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:37.490
out on its border.
Of course,
as eastern border was the state of Missouri,

351
00:26:37.491 --> 00:26:38.960
which was a slave state,

352
00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:44.400
and Missourians being a flock across the border into Kansas,
taking land

353
00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:50.860
by March of 1855 only one year,
less than a year,

354
00:26:50.861 --> 00:26:53.980
11 months after the passage of the Kansas Nebraska Act,

355
00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:59.490
they held their first election for a territorial legislature in the territory of

356
00:26:59.741 --> 00:27:00.574
Kansas,

357
00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:07.620
an estimated 5,000 so called border Ruffins or that meant Missourians flocked

358
00:27:08.771 --> 00:27:13.060
over into Kansas for a day or two to vote

359
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:16.150
the census.

360
00:27:16.151 --> 00:27:21.151
They took a rapid census in the early spring of 1855 and Kansas recorded 2,905

361
00:27:24.401 --> 00:27:29.401
eligible voters in all of Kansas and that territorial legislature election,

362
00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:33.580
6,307 people voted

363
00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:40.030
way more than half of the people registered to vote.
Voted

364
00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:41.870
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

365
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:44.000
<v 0>Uh,
something was wrong.</v>

366
00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:47.720
They elected a pro slavery legislature,

367
00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:52.900
adopted a pro slavery and a constitution overnight and free soilers cried foul,

368
00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.080
formed their own attempt at a government that summer

369
00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:06.880
and by January of 1856 the beginning of the next year,

370
00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:08.750
in a sense.
In essence,

371
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:13.190
there were two fledgling territorial governments in Kansas,

372
00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:16.760
one free soil,
one pro slavery,

373
00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:23.800
and it was then that spring of 1856 that what we call bleeding Kansas.

374
00:28:23.871 --> 00:28:28.340
This border front tier civil war,
this village against village,

375
00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:33.940
a river ravine against river ravine broke out before it played out over about a

376
00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.040
year and a half,
about 250 people would be killed.

377
00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:45.940
Many of them in nighttime raids and vigilante violence and millions and

378
00:28:47.301 --> 00:28:48.134
treasure.

379
00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.920
I will come back to John Brown later next week.
In fact,

380
00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:01.850
our friend John Brown from upstate New York or somebody friend he wasn't easy to

381
00:29:03.001 --> 00:29:07.800
be friends with,
had already sent out some of his sons.

382
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:09.450
More on that later in,

383
00:29:09.451 --> 00:29:14.250
John Brown arrived himself and the winter of 1856 John Brown,

384
00:29:14.251 --> 00:29:16.800
a genuine radical,

385
00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:21.900
deeply religious old testament abolitionist who went to Kansas.

386
00:29:21.901 --> 00:29:26.901
Make no mistake to make Kansas free and to kill slave holders if necessary,

387
00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:31.320
and what he believed was a justifiable war.

388
00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:34.921
That's spring.

389
00:29:34.921 --> 00:29:39.921
John Brown with his band of men was traveling along the road when he got news of

390
00:29:41.441 --> 00:29:44.320
the beating of Charles Sumner incentive.

391
00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:49.630
What happened in the Senate is the Charles Sumner,

392
00:29:49.631 --> 00:29:54.310
the radical abolitionist senator from Massachusetts,

393
00:29:54.311 --> 00:29:56.860
one of only a tiny handful,

394
00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.500
actually one of only two or three,

395
00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:05.910
three or four real card carrying abolitionist if we wouldn't want to call them

396
00:30:06.101 --> 00:30:10.960
that,
who had seats in the u s Senate,
some Nerd,

397
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.050
deeply well-educated,
classically educated.

398
00:30:14.051 --> 00:30:19.051
Harvard man began his political life as a so cold conscience wig in

399
00:30:19.571 --> 00:30:20.680
Massachusetts.

400
00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:26.580
He got elected to the U S Senate in the fervor over the Mexican war and in the

401
00:30:27.251 --> 00:30:32.170
fervor over the expansion of slavery in its first few years in the Senate from

402
00:30:32.171 --> 00:30:37.171
(840) 950-5152 a they had a virtual gag on him.

403
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:42.310
Anytime someone who tried to get the floor,
that's when on for about four years,

404
00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:46.690
there were all kinds of parliamentary maneuvers that the opposition could use to

405
00:30:46.691 --> 00:30:51.691
prevent him from speaking and one or abolitionists rhetoric in the halls of the

406
00:30:51.941 --> 00:30:52.774
u s senate.

407
00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:58.210
But with time he got a position that is a,

408
00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:01.570
a place where he could speak

409
00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:05.230
in the sentence calendar

410
00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:08.880
and he did.

411
00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:13.970
He delivered a speech earlier that Spring called the crime against Kansas.

412
00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:20.040
He delivered it in March,
1856.
It took him about six hours.

413
00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:24.660
It was later published in a pamphlet form.
It's about 35,
40 pages.

414
00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:31.680
It was the classic free soil argument of what was now the Republican Party.

415
00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:39.100
And Sumner was by now of course,
a Republican.
Uh,

416
00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:42.050
he made all the arguments about a slave power conspiracy and,

417
00:31:42.051 --> 00:31:46.270
and antislavery interpretation of the constitution.
He argued deeply into the,

418
00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:46.781
into the,

419
00:31:46.781 --> 00:31:51.610
into that cluster of ideas we call free labor ideology.

420
00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:56.080
But then he lays this beach over and over with personal attacks on southerners,

421
00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:01.150
personal attacks on southern slave holders.
He singled out,

422
00:32:01.151 --> 00:32:04.720
especially Senator Andrew Butler,
South Carolina,

423
00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:10.890
and he used Butler's alleged fathering of children by a slave woman as

424
00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:16.660
representative of what Sumner said was a common practice across the south.

425
00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:22.410
You could not imagine laying a bigger taboo and your fellow southern senators.

426
00:32:22.661 --> 00:32:25.840
And then this one,
he described a Butler as quote,

427
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:31.080
a Don Quixote who had taken the harlots slavery as his mistress.

428
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:34.360
And then he went on and on with that.

429
00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:40.160
He was weird southern

430
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.940
<v 1>instead of shouting at him and Sumner just enjoyed it and went on.</v>

431
00:32:43.941 --> 00:32:48.740
Many of them walked out,
but he'd already had copies of the speech printed.

432
00:32:48.741 --> 00:32:53.430
He had speech copies of the speech on the street within a few days

433
00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.570
<v 0>in the audience.
That day,</v>

434
00:32:56.571 --> 00:33:00.410
sitting up in the balcony was a member of the US House of Representatives named

435
00:33:00.411 --> 00:33:03.380
Preston Brooks,
who was the nephew of Senator Butler.

436
00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:08.580
About a week after this event

437
00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:11.430
<v 1>may have been two weeks,</v>

438
00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.950
<v 0>Butler decided that he was going to have honor.</v>

439
00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:20.140
He was going to exercise a,
um,

440
00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.580
an act of honor and revenge.

441
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:28.210
A deeply rooted in what he believed was the old south sense of honor.

442
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:32.360
He had thought about challenging Somner to a duel,

443
00:33:32.361 --> 00:33:35.000
but duals by this point in time were highly illegal.

444
00:33:35.001 --> 00:33:39.650
Even though people did get challenged.
I read my colleague Join Freeman on this.

445
00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:44.420
They're still challenging each other to duels all the time and 1850s,

446
00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:45.590
well a lot of times,

447
00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:50.600
but he decided against challenging song or do a dual.
Instead,

448
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:54.620
we thought it would take a sort of plan B.

449
00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:57.860
He would meet Sumner at his desk with a cane and try to kill him.

450
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:06.400
Any Dude,
uh,
Brooks took a cane to Sumner.
Sumner was sitting at his desk,

451
00:34:06.401 --> 00:34:10.990
literally signing copies of the crime against Kansas speech to be sent out and

452
00:34:10.991 --> 00:34:12.250
he got trapped in the desk.

453
00:34:12.251 --> 00:34:16.210
We're told he couldn't get out of it and Brooks does kept banging on his head

454
00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.060
over and over,

455
00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:20.590
digitally bloodied him and done consciousness and Sumner fell on the floor.

456
00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.120
And they're all kinds of stories.

457
00:34:22.121 --> 00:34:24.160
And the effect is lithograph tries to capture it,

458
00:34:24.161 --> 00:34:26.200
although I'm not sure you can see it very well.

459
00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.020
And all kinds of stories about senators,

460
00:34:29.021 --> 00:34:33.070
especially southerners gathering around saying,
you know,
holding back,

461
00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:37.480
holding me back as they smiled and watch something or bleed on the floor.

462
00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:41.560
And finally somebody grabbed Brooks is Cain and said,
you know,

463
00:34:41.561 --> 00:34:42.940
that's probably enough.

464
00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.153
<v 1>Okay.</v>

465
00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:51.190
<v 0>Any by any definition.
This was an assault with a deadly weapon.</v>

466
00:34:51.191 --> 00:34:53.950
This was an assault and batteries and attempted murder.

467
00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:58.090
Preston Brooks went back to the House of Representatives,

468
00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:01.740
tendered his resignation.
Instead,

469
00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:06.430
he would go back home to South Carolina and submit himself to the people of his

470
00:35:06.431 --> 00:35:07.264
district.

471
00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:08.763
<v 1>And you did.</v>

472
00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:11.820
<v 0>And they overwhelmingly reelected him.</v>

473
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:19.530
He also received more than 100 commemorative canes in the mail.

474
00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:26.360
Some of what you can see today at the Caroliniana Library in Columbia,

475
00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:32.070
South Carolina.
This became of course a cause Celeb,

476
00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:33.900
um,
uh,

477
00:35:33.901 --> 00:35:38.901
brutal example now of the way in which compromise was being ruined.

478
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:46.830
Middle Realm for moderation was perhaps being destroyed.

479
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:50.610
Violence at broken out all over Kansas.

480
00:35:50.611 --> 00:35:55.500
Violence had not broken out in the U S Senate.

481
00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:59.970
It led many people to a fearful set of expressions.

482
00:35:59.971 --> 00:36:03.840
There literally hundreds of these in the press.

483
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:05.070
Uh,

484
00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:10.070
this is one from William Cullen Bryant who wrote in the New York evening post

485
00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:16.560
after the news broke of the beating of Sumner.
I quote him,

486
00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:19.620
violence rains in the streets of Washington.

487
00:36:19.621 --> 00:36:22.350
Violence has now found his way into the Senate.
Chamber.

488
00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:25.700
Violence lies in wait all over the navigable rivers in the,

489
00:36:25.701 --> 00:36:29.440
all the railways of Missouri to obstruct those who pass from,

490
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:32.850
from the free states into Kansas.
Violence overhangs,

491
00:36:32.851 --> 00:36:36.960
the frontiers of that territory,
like a storm cloud charged with hail,

492
00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:41.400
enlightening violence has carried election after election in that territory.

493
00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:44.370
In short,
violence is the order of the day.

494
00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:49.490
The North needs to be pushed to the wall by it and this plot will succeed if the

495
00:36:50.551 --> 00:36:54.840
people of the free states are as apathetic as the slave holders are.

496
00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:55.913
Insolent.

497
00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:04.600
It was news of the beating of Sumner on the floor of the Senate that apparently

498
00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:09.830
made John Brown snap and within 48 hours,

499
00:37:09.831 --> 00:37:14.420
he led the what's called the Pottawattamie creek massacre,

500
00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:15.973
um,

501
00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:21.010
where he murdered five pro slavery advocates in cold blood with broad swords and

502
00:37:22.911 --> 00:37:23.780
the dark of the night.

503
00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:29.810
We will return to John Brown's exploits next week.
Now

504
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:36.430
that year was though a presidential election year and the problem is still just

505
00:37:36.711 --> 00:37:40.580
laying there out on the landscape what is to happen

506
00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:47.570
with Kansas,
Nebraska,
what's to be done with bleeding Kansas,

507
00:37:47.571 --> 00:37:51.950
what's to be done with,
oops,
sorry.

508
00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:02.330
Now in that election of 1856,

509
00:38:02.331 --> 00:38:05.720
this is terribly important.
Just to note for a moment,

510
00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:11.290
the Republican Party will mount it's first effort at the presidency and it all

511
00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:16.160
but in an all but one is a never happened in American history until then.

512
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:21.250
It's never happened since a new third party that comes so close to winning the

513
00:38:21.871 --> 00:38:26.871
platform of the Republican Party in 1856 was as if anything slightly more

514
00:38:28.311 --> 00:38:30.710
radical than it had been in two years earlier.

515
00:38:30.711 --> 00:38:35.711
And those congressional elections of 1854 they took a staunch stand about

516
00:38:37.811 --> 00:38:38.980
slavery expansion.

517
00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:43.150
They took a staunch Stan and keeping Kansas free.

518
00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:44.753
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

519
00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:49.750
<v 0>they announced directly that they would quote,</v>

520
00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:54.610
destroy Slavery Wherever Federal Jurisdiction,

521
00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:59.970
rain
for president.
They ran John,

522
00:38:59.971 --> 00:39:03.780
see Fremont,
young,
dashing,
romantic,

523
00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:05.730
heroic type.

524
00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:09.300
He had been one of the great surveyors and explorers of the West.

525
00:39:09.301 --> 00:39:14.301
He was already known by the nickname of the Pathfinder and he was the first

526
00:39:15.121 --> 00:39:17.850
senator from the state of California.

527
00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:20.533
<v 1>Okay.</v>

528
00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:25.270
<v 0>He's also the son in law of Thomas Hart Benton and a very powerful now</v>

529
00:39:25.271 --> 00:39:28.330
Republican from Missouri.
He,
he was well married,

530
00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:30.640
well connected and good looking.

531
00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:37.980
They centered their campaign,
they borrowed some nature's own language.

532
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:39.260
<v 1>Okay.</v>

533
00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:43.820
<v 0>And they centered their campaign on what the Republican Party itself now called</v>

534
00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:45.530
the crime against Kansas.

535
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:52.990
They were all so for tariffs for the transcontinental railroad across the West

536
00:39:53.541 --> 00:39:54.740
and so on.

537
00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:00.000
The American party known as the know nothings by the way,

538
00:40:00.001 --> 00:40:01.260
because in their origins,

539
00:40:01.261 --> 00:40:05.940
if you didn't know this about the know nothings in their origins,

540
00:40:05.941 --> 00:40:09.540
the American nativist party tried to maintain a secrecy.

541
00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:15.120
They were kind of secret society at first and when asked who they were and how

542
00:40:15.121 --> 00:40:16.500
they met and what they were for,

543
00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.110
their original members would always say they knew nothing.

544
00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:24.720
So whenever you hear that term,
no,
nothing ism in American politics.

545
00:40:24.721 --> 00:40:28.860
If somebody throws it,
you know,
if Chris Matthews throws that term off at you,

546
00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:34.250
showing off his political history now and usually means nativism or it means

547
00:40:35.251 --> 00:40:38.250
some kind of third party phenomenon,

548
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:44.250
the know nothings nominated that you're Millard Fillmore pre former president.

549
00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:48.420
He'd been the president during the compromise of 1850 it was a very strange

550
00:40:48.421 --> 00:40:50.900
choice and the know nothings,

551
00:40:50.901 --> 00:40:54.920
we're now in some trouble because of this powerful new Republican coalition,

552
00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:59.300
which is managing now to draw some of the native is into them because it turns

553
00:40:59.301 --> 00:41:00.470
out some nativists.

554
00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:04.700
We're actually more afraid of the slave holding oligarchy.

555
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:09.830
Then there were of this Catholic conspiracy,
if they had to choose conspiracies,

556
00:41:09.831 --> 00:41:12.710
they were a little more frightened to slave holders and pups.

557
00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:18.160
The Democrats when safe,

558
00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:25.450
they chose a largely in competent James Buchanan to run for president.

559
00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:31.470
He was from Pennsylvania,
you know,
kind of lower north.

560
00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:36.680
He was known to have very strong ties to the south and to be a co what

561
00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:38.810
Republicans are already calling a doe phase,

562
00:41:38.811 --> 00:41:40.880
which meant a northerner was southern sympathies

563
00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.560
and he had been in the United States ambassador to Britain during the Kansas

564
00:41:45.561 --> 00:41:50.420
Nebraska crisis.
So he had never voted on it.
He had no position to defend.

565
00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:56.170
It was a highly sectionalized election.

566
00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:00.940
Buchanan carried every slave state except Maryland.

567
00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:02.800
<v 1>Okay.</v>

568
00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:07.030
<v 0>And then you carried New Jersey,
Pennsylvania,
Indiana,
Illinois,
and California.</v>

569
00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.620
The Democratic Party was still a national party.

570
00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:13.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

571
00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.430
<v 0>Fremont,
the Republican carried</v>

572
00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:21.850
the rest of the free states and New England decisively,

573
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:29.690
Fremont and Fillmore together and fill more of a native nativist candidate.

574
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:32.510
Got 850,000 votes.

575
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:35.540
Buchanan about 1.8 million.

576
00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:40.960
Fremont about 1.51 point 6 million.

577
00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:44.660
I wouldn't know I had 1.3 million.

578
00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:46.580
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

579
00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:49.550
<v 0>If the native,
his party had not been in this election,</v>

580
00:42:49.551 --> 00:42:52.370
and if most of the nativist had gone to Fremont,

581
00:42:52.371 --> 00:42:55.610
the Republican or even two thirds of them,

582
00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.790
Fremont would have won the presidency.

583
00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:06.550
This antislavery northern coalition of free soil advocates came very close.

584
00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:11.870
They would even call it in its wake,

585
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:16.610
a victory within defeat for such a brand new political party.

586
00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:20.350
No out in Kansas,

587
00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:24.160
there's still trying to hold elections.

588
00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:29.880
One corrupt fraudulent election after another you can and took office.

589
00:43:30.191 --> 00:43:34.630
In the spring of 57 he appointed a new governor for the territory of Kansas

590
00:43:34.631 --> 00:43:37.170
named Robert Jay Walker,
whose job it was going.

591
00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:40.480
He was a solid Pennsylvania Democrat,

592
00:43:40.481 --> 00:43:44.080
but nevertheless said I will go out there and enforce popular sovereignty.

593
00:43:44.081 --> 00:43:47.920
We're going to have a true free ballad in Kansas.

594
00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:49.660
Popular sovereignty is still gonna work.

595
00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:58.730
The trouble was popular.
Sovereignty was now dead in the water.

596
00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:01.880
It was tainted at best

597
00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:08.680
and the election of delegates to yet another attempt at a state constitutional

598
00:44:08.681 --> 00:44:13.681
writing convention in Kansas in the fall of 1857 the free soilers boycotted the

599
00:44:14.741 --> 00:44:18.130
election.
So at La,
Compton,
Kansas,

600
00:44:18.131 --> 00:44:20.950
and hence the term [inaudible] constitution,

601
00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:27.690
a pro slavery constitutional convention met with the free soilers all boycotting

602
00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:30.880
and they drafted no mistake,
a pro slavery.

603
00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:37.910
It protected slavery and the right to slave ownership eternally forever in the

604
00:44:38.281 --> 00:44:39.330
state of Kansas.

605
00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:43.470
It excluded from residents in the state of Kansas.

606
00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.300
Any free negroes.

607
00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:48.053
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

608
00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:53.170
<v 0>and it said that it could not be amended in any way.
For seven years,</v>

609
00:44:57.830 --> 00:45:01.970
this process had taken drastic liberties with the ID of popular sovereignty,

610
00:45:01.971 --> 00:45:03.730
which is you'll remember was the idea.

611
00:45:03.731 --> 00:45:07.640
You're supposed to have a popular referendum and just let the vote determine

612
00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:10.130
whether slavery shall exist.

613
00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:15.470
This governor Walker lost control of the territory,
violence,

614
00:45:15.471 --> 00:45:19.190
continued terrible violence

615
00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.910
and walker came back to Washington,

616
00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:27.800
urged his own president who had appointed him to not support this La Compton

617
00:45:27.801 --> 00:45:32.150
constitution.
He said,
it's just,
it's not right.
It's just to fraudulent.

618
00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:36.050
It was boycotted by half of the people,
probably more than half the people,

619
00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:40.700
and Buchanan made a fateful decision.
He said,
nope.

620
00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:42.980
They've had their popular sovereignty.

621
00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.960
They've had their constitution right and convention.
If the free show,

622
00:45:45.961 --> 00:45:48.320
this show's not participate.
That's the way it goes.

623
00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:53.690
And Buchanan took the La Compton Constitution,
the congress,

624
00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:58.100
and asked for it's approval of Kansas as a slave state.

625
00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:05.450
Buchanan took huge political risks here and didn't prep for all practical

626
00:46:05.451 --> 00:46:09.500
purposes,
apparently know what he was doing.
And here we begin.

627
00:46:09.501 --> 00:46:11.750
To see now the breakup,

628
00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:15.590
a tearing apart now of even the Democratic Party,

629
00:46:15.591 --> 00:46:20.150
cause none other than Steven Douglas,
father of popular sovereignty,

630
00:46:20.151 --> 00:46:24.590
author of the Kansas Nebraska Act.
Uh,
the man who had,
who had,

631
00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:29.210
who would push that acts through,
went to Buchanan and said,

632
00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:33.020
no sir,
you cannot support the comp,
the constitution.

633
00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:35.000
It's a fraudulent constitution.

634
00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:39.170
The majority of the people in that territory are probably free soil.

635
00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:41.120
You can't do this.

636
00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:46.330
He broke with his own president and it would be disastrous for the Democratic

637
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:50.540
Party.
Uh,

638
00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:54.500
Compton Constitution was not accepted by the congress.

639
00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:58.073
<v 1>Now</v>

640
00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:02.670
<v 0>the dred Scott decision,</v>

641
00:47:02.671 --> 00:47:07.671
which came down that same spring of 1857 and the immediate aftermath of

642
00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:12.030
Buchanan's election,
and there's old dread,

643
00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:17.220
not a great picture of him,
but see,
the only photograph we have of dred Scott,

644
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:22.620
the dred Scott decision also came down in the midst of a major American

645
00:47:22.621 --> 00:47:23.454
depression.

646
00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:29.360
The so called panic of 1857 broke out that very spring.

647
00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:33.350
Same time as the Buchanan is being inaugurated,

648
00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:36.790
the Compton Constitution is being forged out in Kansas.

649
00:47:36.791 --> 00:47:38.740
The dred Scott decision is going to be announced.

650
00:47:38.741 --> 00:47:41.950
The country is falling into a horrible economic panic.

651
00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:46.330
There are many causes of it.
I wish I had the time.

652
00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:56.070
Actually.
I'm going to save the panic of 1857 because it sets up

653
00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:02.380
Lincoln and Douglas and 58 59 for me later,
but I want to leave you.

654
00:48:02.381 --> 00:48:04.510
I've got three minutes.
Two minutes.

655
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:06.343
<v 1>Okay,
great.</v>

656
00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:10.860
<v 0>Would this fateful supreme court case,</v>

657
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:14.910
many people like to say the worst supreme court decision in all of American

658
00:48:14.911 --> 00:48:17.850
history,
but I suspect you can get up a debate over that.

659
00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:21.510
I think we've had a couple others.
I won't name them.

660
00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:23.383
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

661
00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:24.930
<v 0>Who was dred Scott.</v>

662
00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:28.800
This man who was an old man.

663
00:48:28.801 --> 00:48:32.600
By the time the Supreme Court ruled on him and put his name forever into

664
00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:37.610
American history as a symbol was born a slave and 1795 in Virginia.

665
00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:46.670
He had moved to Missouri and the 1820s with his master,
a man,

666
00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:49.550
his original master,
his name was Peter Blow.

667
00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:55.290
It was then later on by physician,
a doctor named John Emerson.

668
00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:02.570
Emerson was an army surgeon and Emerson traveled from Missouri all over the

669
00:49:03.961 --> 00:49:08.961
upper Midwest and into what then was the great plains as an army surgeon working

670
00:49:11.221 --> 00:49:13.020
at army camps and basis.

671
00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.620
Dred Scott went with him is his personal servant.

672
00:49:19.350 --> 00:49:21.450
They travel to Illinois and Minnesota.

673
00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:26.130
Dred Scott lived with his master from 1834 to 1838,

674
00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:31.220
four years with Dr. Emerson on various kinds of military bases,

675
00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:36.690
especially in Minnesota,
a free territory.

676
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:42.060
At one point,
dred Scott tried to buy his own freedom in Minnesota.

677
00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:43.770
It wasn't allowed to do it.

678
00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:48.880
He married a free black woman named Harriet while he was in Minnesota.

679
00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:50.240
<v 1>Okay.</v>

680
00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.990
<v 0>Four years,
residents on free soil and attempt to buy his own freedom,</v>

681
00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:55.730
marries a free black woman.

682
00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:03.550
Emerson brought him back to Missouri in 1838 and through,
uh,

683
00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:08.730
an intricate series of events for the next five to six years,

684
00:50:09.751 --> 00:50:14.310
not the least of which was Missouri is a very divided place,
especially St Louis.

685
00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:20.300
A group of antislavery folk gathered around dred Scott and tried to help him sue

686
00:50:21.601 --> 00:50:26.380
for his freedom.
1846.

687
00:50:26.381 --> 00:50:28.640
They moved his through local courts.

688
00:50:28.641 --> 00:50:31.670
In the first decision was that a local court,

689
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:35.630
because of his residence and free soil for four years,

690
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:38.480
gave dred Scott his freedom.

691
00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:43.010
That court decided the case in 1850

692
00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:47.540
it was then appealed by the state of Missouri.

693
00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:53.740
She was really worried about this case to the Missouri Supreme Court and the

694
00:50:54.711 --> 00:50:57.620
Missouri Supreme Court by a decision of two to one

695
00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:03.380
ruled.
No,
no,
no.
On appeal,

696
00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:06.950
dread Scott's freedom would be denied that he had did.

697
00:51:06.951 --> 00:51:10.910
He did not have the right to his freedom because of residents on free soil.

698
00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:17.390
Then again with the help of an antislavery group and even his own owner,

699
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:22.130
believe it or not,
they push this appeal to the u s supreme court.

700
00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:24.680
Dr. Emerson was gone.

701
00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:28.910
Dread was now owned by a man named John Sanford and hence the cases called

702
00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:31.700
Sanford versus Scott.

703
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:37.690
Scott's case came before the u s supreme court as early as 1854 it got on the

704
00:51:37.761 --> 00:51:40.820
docket.
It would not be decided for two and a half years.

705
00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:45.350
Most people didn't even know this was happening.
I'll leave you here.

706
00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:50.090
Only three days after James Buchanan was inaugurated president

707
00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:56.450
having just only narrowly defeated this new Republican coalition news,

708
00:51:56.451 --> 00:52:01.040
broken Washington of something called the dred Scott decision,

709
00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:06.440
and it would electrify the political culture of the country.

710
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:12.040
It will fuel this Republican Party antislavery coalition as much as in some

711
00:52:14.091 --> 00:52:17.960
places,
as much as the Kansas Nebraska act ever had,

712
00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:22.400
and it will inspire Abraham Lincoln to run for the Senate.

713
00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:25.700
That's it for now.
