1
00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.040
Yeah.
The day I laid,
um,

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.570
well in part I laid a list of pro slavery arguments are on you and a lot of

3
00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:17.641
quotations to give you a sense of the depth and breadth of pro slavery ideology.

4
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.230
I didn't want to leave that entirely without tying up or not or to

5
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.280
just consider this as a sense of the scale of pro slavery writing.

6
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.330
I don't want anybody to think that

7
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.280
one slave holding politicians,

8
00:00:42.281 --> 00:00:47.281
when the planter elite of the American south begins to organize toward at least

9
00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:54.601
toward some kind of separation in succession over this slave society.

10
00:00:57.221 --> 00:00:58.480
They want to protect.

11
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.590
They are reading hundreds and hundreds of pages

12
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.380
about their system.

13
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.460
In 1855 and anthology of pro-slavery writings was published in the south.

14
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.310
There was about 450 pages long in 1860 that anthology was updated,

15
00:01:18.221 --> 00:01:23.170
particularly with the words of George fits you into a 900 page volume,

16
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.020
which was really in most ways only excerpts of pro-slavery writing

17
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and it was a work on the desks of most secessionist.

18
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.630
I also didn't want to leave you thinking this was all about

19
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.040
abstract ideology.

20
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.010
One of the best descriptions I've ever read

21
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.770
and why slavery persisted of why people defended it and why people went to war

22
00:01:57.171 --> 00:02:02.171
for it came before the war in 1857 in the speech by the African American woman,

23
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.320
novelist,
writer,
Poet Francis Ellen Watkins Harper,

24
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.330
and an 1850 antislavery speech.
She said,
among other things,

25
00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:14.900
this conclusion,
in fact,

26
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:16.450
she's answering the question now,

27
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.410
why has slavery boomed and persisted in and grows still?

28
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.210
And this is in the wake of the dred Scott decision.
Ask Marilyn.

29
00:02:26.211 --> 00:02:30.500
She says,
whether 10,000 with her tens of thousands of slaves.

30
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.100
If she is not prepared for freedom and hear her answer,

31
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.400
I help supply the coffles gangs to the south as Virginia where there are

32
00:02:40.401 --> 00:02:45.230
hundreds of thousands of slaves if she is not weary with her merchandise,

33
00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:49.370
a blood and anxious to shake the gory traffic from her hands.

34
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.490
And here her reply though fertility has covered my soul.

35
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.360
This is Virginia speaking.

36
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.750
Though I hold in my hand or wealth of power enough to turn the spindles to close

37
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:04.450
the world.
Yet,

38
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:09.340
one of my chief staples has been the sons and daughters I sent to the human

39
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:11.980
markets as farther south.

40
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:14.530
And all the cotton growing states chime in.

41
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.430
We have need of fresh supplies to fill the ranks of those whose lives have gone

42
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:24.900
out and unrequited toil and our distant plantations.

43
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.780
100,000 newborn babies are annually added to the victims of slavery,

44
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.090
said Fran and Francis Ellen Watkins,
Harper,
20,000 lives or annually sacrificed.

45
00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:40.950
And the plantations of the Sao such a site should send a thrill of a horror

46
00:03:40.951 --> 00:03:45.951
through the nerves of civilization and impel the heart of humanity to lofty

47
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.600
deeds.
So it might,

48
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.200
if men had not found,

49
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.950
oh and here's her phrase worth remembering,

50
00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.610
a fearful alchemy by which this blood can be transformed and the gold,

51
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.080
instead of listening to the cry of agony,

52
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.680
they listened to the ring of dollars and stoop down and pick up the coins.

53
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.310
Uh,
fearful alchemy.

54
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.950
That's a useful definition of slavery.

55
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.450
Why did it in humane institution?

56
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:27.900
Of course not everybody who defended and thought it was inhumane,

57
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.710
but why did that systems survive?
Persists.

58
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.603
<v 1>It's him grow.</v>

59
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.450
<v 0>Cause it was so damned profitable.</v>

60
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.440
Last time I began with Alexander H.
Stevens,

61
00:04:42.441 --> 00:04:47.441
famous cornerstone speech and 1861 famous passage by the vice president,

62
00:04:47.801 --> 00:04:49.580
the confederacy,
declaring slavery,

63
00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:54.530
the cornerstone of the confederate movement.
We'd go north.

64
00:04:54.531 --> 00:04:57.830
Today we're going to look largely at the nature of northern society.

65
00:04:57.831 --> 00:05:02.831
We're going to look to some extent today and mostly next Tuesday at the roots

66
00:05:03.051 --> 00:05:08.051
and origins of an antislavery ideology of growing antislavery out ideology.

67
00:05:09.141 --> 00:05:10.970
And it's many layered forms.

68
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.190
But I want to begin today with another passage

69
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:23.170
from the warriors and ask now from a northern point of view,

70
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.970
how do we get to Uriah parmelee now there is a 19th century name for you.

71
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.290
Nobody's named Uriah anymore.
You know any of your Riaz.

72
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:34.813
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

73
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.380
<v 0>Uriah Parmalee</v>

74
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.940
was a kid who grew up on a Connecticut farm.

75
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.200
The Best I've been able to determine.

76
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.890
His family was part of this market revolution.

77
00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:51.660
They ended up moving to a small town,

78
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.000
are no longer engaged in subsistence agriculture if his parents had or his,

79
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.880
and by means,
I don't entirely understand your parmelee.

80
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.690
In the spring of 1861

81
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.020
<v 1>was an abolitionist.</v>

82
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.720
<v 0>It was a junior at Yale College.</v>

83
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:13.440
<v 1>Okay.</v>

84
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.980
<v 0>He'd gotten caught up and abolitionism an anti slavery.
I was young.</v>

85
00:06:16.981 --> 00:06:21.960
People get caught up in political fervor and movements of their times sometimes.

86
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.050
<v 1>Okay.</v>

87
00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.950
<v 0>As soon as the civil war broke out in Lincoln call for volunteers and late</v>

88
00:06:28.951 --> 00:06:30.390
April,

89
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:35.390
1861 Uriah permanently dropped out of his junior year at Yale and he joined the

90
00:06:35.431 --> 00:06:37.110
first regimen he could get into.

91
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.980
There wasn't one organizing it around new haven or nearby in Connecticut,

92
00:06:40.981 --> 00:06:44.760
so he went to New York and he joined the sixth New York cavalry

93
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.170
to his brother.
Permanently confided.

94
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.840
I am more of an abolitionist than ever now,
right up to the handle.

95
00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.640
If I had money enough to raise a few hundred contrabands and arm them,

96
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.030
I'd get up and insurrection among the slaves.

97
00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.320
Told the captain I had dessert to do it.

98
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.983
<v 1>Nah,</v>

99
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:13.090
<v 0>a lot of Chutzpah.
That passage,
he hasn't seen any real war yet.</v>

100
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.970
He wants to be John Brown at that point.

101
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.420
He's going to get him stuff with band of insurrection isn't going on here and

102
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.100
kills them.
Slave holders.

103
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.493
<v 1>He says</v>

104
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:31.030
<v 0>Parmalee and letters back home to his parents,
his brothers,
his sisters,</v>

105
00:07:31.031 --> 00:07:32.320
and he wrote lots of them.

106
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:38.070
He at first denounce Lincoln's government for its failure in 1861 and

107
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.180
[inaudible] early 80 62 to come out against slavery to make it a war against

108
00:07:43.181 --> 00:07:44.014
slavery.

109
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:44.790
<v 1>Okay?</v>

110
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.080
<v 0>He denounces the government.</v>

111
00:07:46.081 --> 00:07:50.310
He's serving in a letter in late 1861 from the front.

112
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.740
The president contest,
he says,

113
00:07:52.741 --> 00:07:57.030
will indeed subtle the question for some years at least as to where the union,

114
00:07:57.031 --> 00:08:01.710
our succession,
the constitution or rebellion shall triumph.

115
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:07.260
But the great heart wound,
slavery,
well not be reached.

116
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:08.420
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

117
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:12.560
<v 0>he's angry.
He's pissed off.
He wants the war to be against slavery</v>

118
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.363
<v 1>and it's not.</v>

119
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:16.840
<v 0>He goes on and a letter,</v>

120
00:08:16.841 --> 00:08:21.400
and in spring 1862 the war still isn't a war against slavery in any official

121
00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:22.234
sense.

122
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.630
And he writes on his brother's saying he wishes he had the quote,

123
00:08:27.631 --> 00:08:32.190
moral courage to dessert because he no longer wants to serve this car,

124
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:39.230
but he doesn't dessert.
By March,

125
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:44.230
1863 he had concluded that emancipation would indeed be achieved.

126
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.690
This is now in the wake of Congress's confiscation accident 62 Lincoln's

127
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.200
preliminary proclamation,

128
00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:55.980
the ultimate emancipation proclamation as of January,

129
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.080
1863 and by march of that Spring,

130
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.370
he's convinced the war has transformed.

131
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.250
He refused a furlough to stay and fight.

132
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:10.020
He rides home.

133
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:15.390
I do not intend to shirk now that there is really something to fight for.

134
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.420
I mean freedom since the 1st of January.

135
00:09:18.421 --> 00:09:22.740
It has become more and more evident to my mind that the war is henceforth to be

136
00:09:22.741 --> 00:09:25.170
conducted upon a different basis.

137
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:30.480
Those who profess to love the union or not so anxious to preserve slavery.

138
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:35.130
While those who are opposed to the war knowledge and all their actions that its

139
00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:37.530
continuance.
We'll put an end to this,

140
00:09:37.531 --> 00:09:42.531
a curse it system so then I am willing to remain and endure whatever may fall to

141
00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:45.510
mindshare.

142
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:53.710
He was honored for bravery by at least three commanding officers in numerous

143
00:09:55.101 --> 00:09:55.701
battles,

144
00:09:55.701 --> 00:10:00.380
especially the battle of Chancellorsville in May of 1863 he was promoted to

145
00:10:00.381 --> 00:10:01.214
captain.

146
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.370
Eventually a switched his New York Raj.

147
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.710
This happened to many regimens in the civil war.
Took so many casualties.

148
00:10:09.711 --> 00:10:14.711
It ceased to exist and he switched to a Connecticut Regiment and he served that

149
00:10:16.161 --> 00:10:21.080
Connecticut regimen through the summer of 1864.

150
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:26.090
The Great War of attrition in Virginia.
He survived the battle of the wilderness,

151
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.110
the battle of Spotsylvania courthouse,
Battle of cold harbor,

152
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:35.350
the entire siege of Petersburg from August of 64 all the way until the end of

153
00:10:37.371 --> 00:10:39.870
March of 1865.
Okay.

154
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:46.860
He was killed on April 1st,
1865 at the battle of five oaks of,
of uh,

155
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:50.510
excuse me,
at five forks just west of Richmond,

156
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.530
the last major engagement of the civil war.

157
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.710
And when you walk out today and you go through Woolsey Hall,

158
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.330
if you haven't done this before,

159
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.560
you'll note if you haven't before that that's full of the names of El College

160
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.130
man who died in war.

161
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.650
And Uriah Parma Lee's name.

162
00:11:16.651 --> 00:11:19.950
We'll be right on your right as you're walking through these,

163
00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.530
this high on my arm or shoulder.

164
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:28.760
And there's his name dropped out junior year to fight to destroy slavery.

165
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:36.540
And he did for four years and died in the last battle.

166
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.590
But how do you get to your riot?
Parmelee

167
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.140
a kid from Connecticut,

168
00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:48.160
obviously bright enough or connected enough to get into Yale,

169
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:54.700
gave all that up for something he saw as a lot higher.

170
00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:01.380
If you can come to understand a Uriah parmelee or better yet,

171
00:12:03.191 --> 00:12:07.150
if you can come to understand young white,

172
00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:10.550
northern Yankee,

173
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:13.160
Anglo Saxon Protestants,

174
00:12:13.161 --> 00:12:18.161
who often were very contemptuous of Irish immigrants and even more contemptuous,

175
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.800
a black Americans who nevertheless believed the war of 1861 had to be fought and

176
00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:30.710
ultimately came even to support the destruction of slavery.

177
00:12:30.711 --> 00:12:35.650
If you can understand why those northern Yankees get to that point,

178
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.150
you really will understand the civil war.

179
00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:46.530
Uriah parmelee had an inheritance.
What level?
He exactly understood it.

180
00:12:46.531 --> 00:12:50.580
I can't necessarily know about his letters are extraordinarily rich.

181
00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:54.963
No.

182
00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
In that northern society and here we're using labels pretty loosely,

183
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:05.730
but so be it.
The northern states and,

184
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.950
well,
I'll leave the outline up for the moment.
No,
I won't

185
00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:18.480
use,
I'm told I have to.
I can brighten that apparently.

186
00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:19.410
Whoops,
that's clapper.

187
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:26.840
It's a wonderful painting of a,

188
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:34.180
<v 1>oops,
I didn't do it.
Live it.
Huh?</v>

189
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:36.423
<v 0>What a</v>

190
00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:44.080
wonderful painting from meeting 30 called the Yankee peddler was hurting Yankee

191
00:13:44.081 --> 00:13:44.914
peddler's.

192
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:49.600
It'll come door to door anymore unless they're working for the Jehovah's

193
00:13:49.601 --> 00:13:51.850
Witnesses.
Oops.

194
00:13:56.110 --> 00:14:00.880
Well,
or the,
um,
environmental action committee or the,
uh,

195
00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.350
let's see.
Nevermind

196
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.090
what the voice of what's the Yankee peddler peddler cloth.

197
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:15.600
Readymade factory made cloth for a woman,

198
00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:20.740
a housewife who isn't making her own cloth anymore.

199
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:26.770
That's the market revolution in a thousand ways to see it,

200
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.300
understand it,
grasp it.

201
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:36.620
If the south was a slave society and we tried to demonstrate that last time we

202
00:14:36.621 --> 00:14:40.850
tried to,
um,
define that,

203
00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:45.740
although it's not defined in that newspaper that you're reading back there in

204
00:14:45.741 --> 00:14:50.160
row 12 marketing revolution is not reported in this morning's newspaper.

205
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.690
Actually.
It probably is.
The markets are going bad,

206
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.310
although they went back up yesterday.

207
00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.300
But this market revolution is not reported in that newspaper.

208
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:04.620
I would venture,
sorry to interrupt you,
but it was,

209
00:15:04.621 --> 00:15:08.700
the south was a slave society.
The North was a market society.

210
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.540
It was a booming market society by the 1820 [inaudible] and 1830s.

211
00:15:12.541 --> 00:15:16.260
It was beginning to be a market society.
Even the late 18th century,

212
00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:19.740
the northern states by the antebellum period,

213
00:15:19.741 --> 00:15:24.741
1820s thirties 1840s was beginning to sort of hurdle toward a different future

214
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:31.220
than what that slave society was perhaps.
No,
not really.

215
00:15:31.221 --> 00:15:35.850
Slowly two is hurtling toward a certain future.
This market,

216
00:15:35.851 --> 00:15:38.610
this booming market society with its market,

217
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:43.710
commercial consumerist mentalities,
and it's,
it's belief.

218
00:15:43.711 --> 00:15:48.711
Eventually it's faith in its defense of free labor for the common man.

219
00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:51.100
It's kind of fanfare for the common man.

220
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:54.050
Etiology would be something a lot of white southerners.
Okay.

221
00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:59.420
Would actually fear and be frightened by what is the market revolution.

222
00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:04.410
It's the time in which it's not a single moment in time.
Of course,

223
00:16:04.411 --> 00:16:05.370
it's a long process,

224
00:16:05.371 --> 00:16:10.371
but it's the time in which long distance commerce began to take hold because of

225
00:16:10.651 --> 00:16:15.360
transportation,
revolutions,
canals,
roads,
railroads in particular.

226
00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:20.560
It's a time of technological innovation,
tremendous technological innovation.

227
00:16:20.561 --> 00:16:24.870
So much technological change that half the time it frightened people.

228
00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:26.250
If how you can find all over,

229
00:16:26.251 --> 00:16:31.251
we're American culture in 1800 1810 even into the 1820s a lot of fear of tech.

230
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:35.370
No.
What is this thing?
A telegraph

231
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.880
that today you probably don't fear technology.

232
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:43.820
I still have a little bit of there.

233
00:16:43.821 --> 00:16:45.830
I'm still a little 19th century in that sentence.

234
00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.460
I hate it when they tell me they want to buy me a new laptop.

235
00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.870
Enough already care.

236
00:16:53.871 --> 00:16:56.750
If it's four years old and I want another one,

237
00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:03.100
don't make me learn something new with my machines.
Okay.

238
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:06.500
The market revolution was driven of course by the growth of cities,

239
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:11.450
which became market centers and manufacturing centers.
Maybe more importantly,

240
00:17:11.451 --> 00:17:14.570
the market revolution is that time in American history.

241
00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:20.080
That incredible time really when you think about the scale of change

242
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:26.710
when 18th century subsistence farmers who engaged in what was always called or

243
00:17:26.721 --> 00:17:29.630
we've always called mixed agriculture that is that right?

244
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:34.800
All kinds of food stuffs almost always for themselves.

245
00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:40.660
When that kind of 18th century style farming gave way to commercial farming or

246
00:17:40.661 --> 00:17:45.570
farmers now produced cash crops for a much broader market,

247
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.790
a market on the east coast,

248
00:17:47.791 --> 00:17:52.560
if they were in upstate new or out in Ohio eventually and a market of the whole

249
00:17:52.561 --> 00:17:53.394
world.

250
00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:00.040
It's that period when the home or the farm.

251
00:18:00.041 --> 00:18:04.400
Still a majority of northern people buy the 18,018 Ford.

252
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.220
We're making their livings from agriculture,

253
00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:11.680
but it's a time when that home and farm became its own domestic factory

254
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:19.060
or people began to produce in their homes for markets,
not for themselves.

255
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.710
The vast multitude were still farmers,
but they began to now buy goods,

256
00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:30.370
manufactured goods,
readymade clothing and shoes,
cloth candles,

257
00:18:30.371 --> 00:18:32.300
soap,
all kinds of food stuffs,

258
00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.960
stuff that the 18th century farm made for him and herself.

259
00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:37.573
Now

260
00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:43.310
you bought from a peddler or you bought from a store in town.

261
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:51.980
This all course leads to a change in what European history has taught us to call

262
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.650
mentalities mentality.

263
00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:00.660
It brought about fundamental alteration slowly in ways.

264
00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:02.400
Sometimes people never know it's happening.

265
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.390
Fundamental alterations in aspirations,

266
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.640
in habits and activities,

267
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.690
in conceptions and definitions of work and leisure.

268
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:17.400
What is work and leisure now in a society where you don't have to produce

269
00:19:17.401 --> 00:19:19.200
everything for yourself,

270
00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.280
<v 1>okay?</v>

271
00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:25.840
<v 0>It produced,
it would produce fundamental alterations in the conception of labor.</v>

272
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.120
Who's the worker?
What is Labor?

273
00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:34.380
Is the labor anymore Justin individual or as a labor part of a collective

274
00:19:35.501 --> 00:19:38.590
problem,
part of a collective mentality,

275
00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:44.340
part of a collective movement against a much greater force now called capital

276
00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.000
manufacturing is our company.

277
00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:54.010
It's going to alter the very idea of individual rights.

278
00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:58.960
We have a habit in this society to think that individual rights when when,

279
00:19:59.170 --> 00:19:59.560
when they,

280
00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.710
when they drafted the bill of rights was just laid down for us and it's just

281
00:20:02.711 --> 00:20:06.190
travel through time and here they are.
Just go back and look at the founders.

282
00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:08.710
It's such nonsense.
It's a historical,

283
00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.730
the very idea of individual rights got reshaped by the market revolution.

284
00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.590
What do you have a right to know

285
00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:19.283
<v 1>new shoes?</v>

286
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.850
<v 0>It's going to change the very idea of mobility.</v>

287
00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:29.810
Where can you go and how by what means it's going to really change and this is

288
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.840
absolutely crucial indirectly in helping us understand this war that's going to

289
00:20:36.241 --> 00:20:37.200
come down the way

290
00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:43.380
it's going to change for a lot of northern millions of northern people.

291
00:20:43.381 --> 00:20:44.250
Some of them now,

292
00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:49.150
immigrants who have come here with a clear purpose and as the makeup better

293
00:20:49.151 --> 00:20:53.260
life,
it's going to change their conception of what they can give the children

294
00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.440
and we're gonna hear a lot more later on next week,

295
00:20:59.441 --> 00:21:04.180
week after about free Labor ideology.
Yeah,
I do.

296
00:21:04.181 --> 00:21:09.010
That of labor is left free then that common man always has a chance if the land

297
00:21:09.011 --> 00:21:12.000
isn't taken up by the large oligarchies like slave hope.

298
00:21:12.001 --> 00:21:16.300
I slave holding class and I'm the small guy has a chance but rooted in free

299
00:21:16.301 --> 00:21:19.270
Labor ideology is among other ideas,

300
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:24.480
this notion of mobility that are free labor is a mobile labor,

301
00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:30.060
especially in a society like the United States that had this thing called the

302
00:21:30.101 --> 00:21:34.720
West,
the limitless apparently to them anyway,

303
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.540
boundless West,

304
00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.730
even such concepts,
such great American concepts,

305
00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:47.760
let's call it that as self-reliance about which Ralph Waldo Emerson may have

306
00:21:47.921 --> 00:21:50.590
written his greatest essay.
I go,

307
00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.620
I go read Emerson and self reliance of at least once a year just,

308
00:21:53.621 --> 00:21:55.660
I don't know the field better or something.

309
00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:01.280
It's the quintessential sort of expression of individualism,

310
00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.650
but it's more than that.
But even an idea like self reliance,

311
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.760
I can remake my world,

312
00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:12.360
I can be anything I want is changed by the market revolution.

313
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:16.720
It doesn't mean people believe any lesson in self reliance.

314
00:22:16.721 --> 00:22:18.820
It's just the keep seeing evidence.

315
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:24.120
They keep bumping into realities of the show them that in the face of the market

316
00:22:25.031 --> 00:22:28.570
now especially the boom and bust cycles of the market,

317
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:35.160
their individualism is not so powerful.

318
00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:42.420
A market revolution would on the level of ideas and thinking and sort of common

319
00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:49.050
behavior would bring about a kind of combination of tremendous optimism

320
00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:56.360
possibly like we've never experienced sin so that you can find other moments in

321
00:22:56.361 --> 00:23:00.000
American history like the 1950s um,

322
00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:05.260
where a kind of broad bra social optimism took hold of Americans.

323
00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.090
It's one of the reasons we had a civil rights movement,

324
00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:14.530
but at the same time a market revolution is going to bring a certain sense of

325
00:23:15.801 --> 00:23:19.940
anxiety,
even dread,
even despair.

326
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:23.360
It will also,
it will lead to great wealth.
Of course,

327
00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:29.140
fortunes will begin to be made and the textile industry and in the railroad

328
00:23:29.361 --> 00:23:33.440
industry by the forties and fifties and in a host of other ways,

329
00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:37.970
real fortunes and some fortunes will begin to be made in simple financial

330
00:23:37.971 --> 00:23:38.870
speculation.

331
00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:44.210
Wall Street will be born at the same time,
of course,

332
00:23:44.211 --> 00:23:48.080
as well as the inequality in wealth grows too.

333
00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:55.230
Specialization will set in workplaces that some,
you know,
the,

334
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.070
that your parent's generation may have grown up understanding as a very personal

335
00:23:59.071 --> 00:24:01.890
place.
Even if you worked in a small shop,
you know,

336
00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.710
they only had eight workers and you were related to half of them.

337
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:11.510
The workplace would become less personal,
bigger,

338
00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:18.820
uncontrollable women went to work most famously in the low factories in

339
00:24:22.251 --> 00:24:24.020
Massachusetts and in other places.

340
00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:27.263
<v 1>MMM.</v>

341
00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:30.380
<v 0>Among the many images</v>

342
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:33.303
<v 1>of</v>

343
00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:40.680
<v 0>the famous mill girls is this one taken an 1850 I believe in Lowell,</v>

344
00:24:40.681 --> 00:24:43.800
Massachusetts.
She looks about nine years old.

345
00:24:43.801 --> 00:24:46.790
She may have been 12 or 13 both fee,

346
00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.980
but for the first time in significant numbers,

347
00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:54.450
young girls and young women left farm,

348
00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:57.900
left around of domesticity,

349
00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:03.410
left that world in which they presumably had been shielded as children and now

350
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:08.100
entered a world where they were

351
00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:09.440
<v 1>okay</v>

352
00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.110
<v 0>child labor hours</v>

353
00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:18.340
and in a world now that breeds child labor and even defense child labor,

354
00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.650
uh,
you have problems.

355
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:26.900
Market Revolution would also lead to a lot of natural environmental degradation.

356
00:25:26.901 --> 00:25:29.720
People got to be got worried about rivers.
They really did.

357
00:25:29.721 --> 00:25:34.010
There's now an environmental history being written sort of the impact of market

358
00:25:34.011 --> 00:25:36.950
revolution and as I mentioned earlier,

359
00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:41.220
it would lead of course two big cycles of boom and bust.

360
00:25:41.221 --> 00:25:46.221
The big depression hit in 1837 and other big depression hitting 1857 much more

361
00:25:47.001 --> 00:25:51.830
on that 1857 panic as they were called then a little later in the course because

362
00:25:51.831 --> 00:25:56.240
it's absolutely pertinent to what happened in the great political debates of the

363
00:25:56.241 --> 00:25:57.390
late 1850 [inaudible].

364
00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:03.670
Even the idea of what a child is since we've got a child up here,

365
00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:05.350
even the idea of of,

366
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.590
and there's a growing little sub field now of children's history,

367
00:26:08.591 --> 00:26:09.910
which is actually very interesting.

368
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.970
There's a guy named Jim Martin and Marquette University's pioneered this.

369
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:18.750
Even the idea of a child and the child's placed in a family undergoes a kind of

370
00:26:18.821 --> 00:26:23.821
revolution in 20 or 30 years in a working class family and immigrant working

371
00:26:24.431 --> 00:26:28.330
class family in particular by the 30s and forties a child meant income,

372
00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:30.220
a child mental worker.

373
00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:34.750
Everybody had to work and usually outside of whatever it was home.

374
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:40.330
But what also said in in the growing middleclass of course was it more bourgeois

375
00:26:40.331 --> 00:26:42.460
definition of childhood,

376
00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:47.940
a modern definition of childhood born somewhere they're between 1,818 60 or the

377
00:26:49.501 --> 00:26:54.501
child was to be a protected youth shielded and not used by a family parenting.

378
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:05.540
And this new bourgeois conception of family parenting was to be moral guardian

379
00:27:07.191 --> 00:27:08.024
ship.

380
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:15.360
I saw it seemed what the market revolution was in so many ways was an engine,

381
00:27:15.361 --> 00:27:19.440
a tremendous Charles Sellers has written a famous book on this was it was a

382
00:27:19.441 --> 00:27:24.441
tremendous engine for what became arguably the most prevalent idea of the entire

383
00:27:25.861 --> 00:27:29.760
19th century in America.
And that's the notion of progress.

384
00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:34.980
America was now going to be the nation of progress.

385
00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:37.500
It was going to be the place of progress.

386
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:41.460
It seems to have boundless borders and boundless resources.

387
00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:45.180
It looked like it could expand almost forever.

388
00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:48.720
It had tremendous riches in,
or

389
00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:52.460
it had tremendous natural wealth.

390
00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:56.990
It would therefore be the place of progress in the world and as Walt Whitman

391
00:27:56.991 --> 00:28:01.040
road in palm after poem and other poets did as well,

392
00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:06.100
and politicians said over and over and over and over America and this United

393
00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:11.120
States,
this nation forum,
there would be the beginning of a new man,

394
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:17.810
a new start for him and Kai,
that's a big idea.

395
00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:23.630
Of course,
we still want to be there.
It's never vanished in our culture.

396
00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:27.860
We still sometimes want to be Winthrop city on the hill,

397
00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:30.800
beacon of something for everybody.

398
00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:37.150
But think with me just for one second about the idea of progress.

399
00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.970
If you come to believe,
if you say to the world,

400
00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:47.380
we are the hope of of humans,
we are the hope of earth,

401
00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:53.340
we are progress and by the way we the people of progress or rooted in those

402
00:28:55.331 --> 00:28:58.660
principles of the Declaration of independence which are written down essentially

403
00:28:58.661 --> 00:29:02.860
as creeds and Olin.
By the way,
we have a written constitution.

404
00:29:02.861 --> 00:29:04.300
We actually wrote it down.

405
00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:08.290
We have a bill of rights where we declare these things on paper.

406
00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.220
Unlike the Brits,
what have you done?

407
00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:15.930
You said,

408
00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:21.440
we are really special and we are really important and we are really good.

409
00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:29.570
You kind of set yourself up having somebody walks in,

410
00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:31.170
you're meeting them for the first time.
Hello,

411
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.800
I'm a beacon of progress and good and hope in the world.
How do you do?

412
00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:38.400
You're probably going to think,
oh shit,

413
00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:43.570
you know this instantly your cynicism kicks in and then who?
Who is this jerk?

414
00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:53.600
The doctrine of Progress I'm simply saying is always bread.
It's contradiction.

415
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.570
Morale,
a whole bunch.
I'm laying out there weren't there.

416
00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:01.860
We were laying all over the place,
but you know,
you couldn't resist it.

417
00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:07.200
How could you resist the sense of change in 1820s,
New York,

418
00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:12.330
1830s Philadelphia,
1840s and 50s,
Ohio,

419
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:16.590
1850 Chicago,
which was already by the 1850s,

420
00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:19.620
a railroad capitol of,
um,
of,
uh,
of North America.

421
00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:24.750
How could you resist that sense of change?
Tocqueville couldn't resist it.

422
00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:28.710
It was the thing he couldn't stop writing about democracy in America and he was

423
00:30:28.711 --> 00:30:33.711
only observing in 1831 he didn't come back and see it in the 1850s.

424
00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:40.260
He was,
he was just amazed that these Americans,

425
00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:44.760
how they just moved all the time and they were just so full of hope all the
time.

426
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:50.370
You said Americans would always build a house but then move before they put a

427
00:30:50.371 --> 00:30:53.910
roof on.
They were always mobile,

428
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.420
always going somewhere,
always changing.

429
00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:02.680
Part of that change,
of course,
bringing fear with it was immigration.

430
00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:04.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

431
00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:09.320
<v 0>And the 1830 600,000 immigrants came to the United States almost entirely from</v>

432
00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:15.360
western Europe.
Now,
1840s alone,
1.5 million,

433
00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:20.280
and then the 1850s almost 3 million more.

434
00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

435
00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:27.090
<v 0>By 1852 53 Boston in New York,</v>

436
00:31:27.121 --> 00:31:31.110
think about this,
Boston,
although we're getting close to that again,

437
00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:36.210
Boston and New York had 50% foreign born population.

438
00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:37.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

439
00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:41.060
<v 0>One of every two people in New York City in 1852 was born outside the United</v>

440
00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:45.000
States.
Same in Boston,
Costa that in Philadelphia,

441
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.490
the northern cities,
seats of market culture,

442
00:31:50.491 --> 00:31:54.060
commercialism,
manufacturing,
were immigrant cities.

443
00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:59.310
All of this of course was fueled by,

444
00:31:59.311 --> 00:32:03.900
I mentioned that already a transportation revolution symbolized by the Erie

445
00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:03.901
Canal,

446
00:32:03.901 --> 00:32:08.901
finished an 1825 which remained profitable all the way out into the 1880s along

447
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:14.750
as a ditch in the world as it was called 300 and some odd miles out to buffalo.

448
00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:16.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

449
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:18.560
<v 0>It was a romantic and by the way,</v>

450
00:32:18.561 --> 00:32:23.561
about 3,300 miles of such canals would be built by the middle of the 1850

451
00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:29.170
[inaudible] all for the purpose of commerce and to move people.

452
00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:34.950
Steamboats became the romantic symbol of this great transportation revolution

453
00:32:35.081 --> 00:32:38.650
and all of this movement,
although they too,

454
00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.750
they too brought dread with them.

455
00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:47.680
One third of every steam boat built in the United States before 1850 exploded

456
00:32:48.441 --> 00:32:50.210
and destroyed.
It became

457
00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:53.253
<v 1>our rec</v>

458
00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.740
<v 0>and there's no mistaking and Mark Twain's imagination.</v>

459
00:32:57.741 --> 00:32:59.540
If you remember the scene and Huck Finn,

460
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:06.970
I mean among the hundred eternal take home images and huck Finn is that Mama.

461
00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:13.910
How can Jim around their RAF?
It's a little foggy.
I can't quite see it can here.

462
00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:15.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

463
00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:19.670
<v 0>And pretty soon here at steamboat,
just smashes into that raft and over they go.</v>

464
00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:26.570
Steamboats were wonderful and exciting and romantic.

465
00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.210
You could go gamble on them,
you can go get sex on him.

466
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:32.330
They also might just blow you up.

467
00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:38.360
And then of course the railroads,
which reshaped North America,

468
00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:43.370
no continent,
you could argue had ever been quite made,

469
00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:47.870
ready made if you want for railroads quite like North America.

470
00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:51.380
It fit the environment perfectly.

471
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:54.920
Once that could make these things actually go 25 miles an hour,

472
00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:59.990
I never figured out how to build gauges properly.
Uh,

473
00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:05.020
there was some 12 to 15 different widths of railroads and the northern states

474
00:34:05.241 --> 00:34:10.220
alone by the 1850s,
you could go into one town on a gauge south,

475
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:11.870
I don't know,
three feet wide,

476
00:34:11.871 --> 00:34:15.140
but on the other side of town it would come out four feet wide.
Why?

477
00:34:15.141 --> 00:34:18.680
They never quite sat down and standardized all this.
I have no idea,

478
00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:24.140
but railroads revolutionized an American sense of time,

479
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:30.070
their ability to travel.
It revolutionized manufacturing.

480
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:33.400
It revolutionized how quickly you could get to markets.

481
00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:37.540
And I made Chicago,
Chicago.

482
00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:44.540
It also made the first multimillionaires,

483
00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:46.650
the first massive fortunes,

484
00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:52.610
and it became the first great example of the deep relationship in the 19th

485
00:34:53.491 --> 00:34:58.491
century back in our hay day of laissez faire government Ho Ho have a

486
00:34:59.101 --> 00:35:02.580
relationship between the federal government and business.

487
00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:07.470
The great American railroads were built by and large for decades,

488
00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:11.880
but government subsidies and had tremendous amount of corruption.

489
00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:14.210
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

490
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:17.630
<v 0>the railroad had I been a lot to do to of course with linking northeast with</v>

491
00:35:17.631 --> 00:35:18.590
northwest,

492
00:35:18.591 --> 00:35:23.591
which has a lot to do with a certain sense of economic isolation that set in in

493
00:35:24.111 --> 00:35:25.880
the south to some extent.

494
00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.230
And I'll just say a word quickly that,

495
00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:37.260
that don't underestimate the influence here of an ideology beneath this.

496
00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.890
We usually only talk about manifest destiny.

497
00:35:39.891 --> 00:35:43.620
When we were talking about the western movement beyond the Mississippi,
uh,

498
00:35:43.621 --> 00:35:46.740
we only usually bring it up when we're talking about the Mexican war and its

499
00:35:46.741 --> 00:35:48.180
aftermath or something.

500
00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.810
No manifest destiny was a very old American idea.

501
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:57.320
It was probably coined by this journalist's name O'sullivan,

502
00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:02.070
although now there's a new theory that it wasn't no side.
I leave it to my ex,

503
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:06.540
my expert colleagues and history of the American west or decide exactly who came

504
00:36:06.541 --> 00:36:09.630
up with the term manifest destiny,
who actually first used it.

505
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:15.090
But manifest destiny was in some ways the fuel of the American imagination.

506
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:19.170
It combines so many ideas.
Under that heading,

507
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:24.120
you might call American progress came the sense of American mission

508
00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:30.540
spreading.
Liberty's spreading democracy,
spreading Christianity.

509
00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:32.611
Uh,

510
00:36:32.611 --> 00:36:37.611
Christian civilization was deeply at the root of this cluster of ideas we call

511
00:36:39.061 --> 00:36:44.061
manifest destiny as was a very violent kind of nationalism that boomed after the

512
00:36:45.931 --> 00:36:50.931
war of 1812 and through the 1820s into the 1830s and manifest destiny was the

513
00:36:52.351 --> 00:36:54.390
engine of capitalism.
Make no mistake.

514
00:36:54.391 --> 00:36:58.230
Why did we want all that land and the Mexican cession?
Why did we want Oregon?

515
00:36:58.231 --> 00:37:02.700
Why did we want California and deep at the root of manifest destiny,

516
00:37:02.701 --> 00:37:03.241
of course,

517
00:37:03.241 --> 00:37:07.920
and his book after book written on this is a deep and abiding American white

518
00:37:07.921 --> 00:37:08.754
supremacy.

519
00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:14.820
It was the destiny of a white Anglo Saxon Protestant United States to take

520
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:21.380
control and improve this great land that had been given.

521
00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:25.050
Not for I leave that.

522
00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:30.320
Let me just suggest sometimes one of the ways when you want to understand how

523
00:37:31.081 --> 00:37:35.250
progress builds builds in his own contradictions

524
00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:41.000
and why I think contradiction is what makes American history interesting.

525
00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.920
We are a,
it's why the world is fascinated with us.

526
00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:49.040
Look at the literature.

527
00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.200
Go back to all the way to James Fenimore Cooper,

528
00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:56.900
his leather stockings,

529
00:37:56.901 --> 00:38:01.670
tails are full of a certain anxiety about what might be happening to that

530
00:38:01.671 --> 00:38:04.670
frontier.
What's coming from east to west.

531
00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:06.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

532
00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:11.610
<v 0>Read Thoreau's Walden.
What's the throw up?
I mean,
thorough may have been a snob.</v>

533
00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.460
He may have been smarmy

534
00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:19.560
and he may want you to think it was cool because he's so pencils.

535
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:27.870
But he wrote one of the most brilliant critiques of change

536
00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:33.610
and what it can mean.

537
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Any American ever rode on throw sits on his little stool outside his cabin at

538
00:38:40.451 --> 00:38:45.451
Walden pond and he hears the train go by over the ridge and he puts his hands

539
00:38:45.671 --> 00:38:47.530
over his ears.
He doesn't want to hear it.

540
00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.273
<v 1>Okay.</v>

541
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:54.440
<v 0>He's representing something.
I'm not saying it was right.</v>

542
00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:59.680
I mean the damn fool should got down and you know,
got real with the railroads,

543
00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:00.523
but

544
00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:01.583
<v 1>he did.</v>

545
00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:08.130
<v 0>What does Emerson up to is that say nature</v>

546
00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.480
and almost every poem Walt Whitman wrote,

547
00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:15.630
He seems to be fashioning himself,

548
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:21.230
if not the whole of this American people or sometimes he did call an American

549
00:39:21.331 --> 00:39:23.190
race as a new Adam

550
00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:27.150
I the singer of a Damick songs.

551
00:39:27.151 --> 00:39:31.260
He said it directly through the new garden of the West,

552
00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:36.210
the great cities calling as Adam early in the morning,

553
00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:40.230
walking forth from the Bauer refresh with sleep.

554
00:39:40.231 --> 00:39:44.790
Behold me where I pass here,
my voice,

555
00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:45.750
and he goes on,

556
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:50.400
I can do anything in this American west,

557
00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:53.070
this American possibility,

558
00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:56.760
but as soon as we read Whitman,

559
00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:03.440
then you realize there's a Nathaniel Hawthorne who in 1844 even before Whitman's

560
00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.640
started writing most of his poems,

561
00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.800
Hawthorne was pretty darn powerful and he was an old puritan.

562
00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:15.660
It was a conservative,
dour,
doubtful kind of.
It was a real new Englander.

563
00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:21.210
Hawthorne wrote a short story.
You should read some time as a balanced.

564
00:40:21.211 --> 00:40:23.430
All of this optimism of this period.

565
00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:28.200
Irresistible is that optimism was,
it's called Earth's Holocaust.

566
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:31.950
Have you ever read that?
It's an incredible story.

567
00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:37.110
He has this whole group of people out somewhere on the American frontier and

568
00:40:37.111 --> 00:40:40.890
there are kind of a cult.
They decide

569
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:44.100
they're going to have a bonfire

570
00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:48.480
and they build this giant fire and intuit.

571
00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:52.230
They throw everything from the past.

572
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:54.990
They throw heraldry,

573
00:40:55.680 --> 00:41:00.680
they throw every kind of vestige of old world culture and monarchy,

574
00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:05.790
aristocracy and civilization.
They throw all kinds of old books,

575
00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:10.920
great old books under the bond.
They burn everything from Europe.

576
00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:12.600
Everything that's old.

577
00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.890
It's a purification they're gonna make and they're going to make a new world.

578
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:24.400
They don't need anything from the past.
And it's Hawthorne's satire.

579
00:41:24.401 --> 00:41:29.400
It's his critique of it says apocalyptic angry,
critique it.
Oh,

580
00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:32.310
these Americans who think they're inventing everything new every day.

581
00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:41.670
Hawthorne had a bummer.
I mean,
well,

582
00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:45.530
I guess of that.

583
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:50.430
If you want to understand the optimism of that time,

584
00:41:50.431 --> 00:41:55.020
just dip into leaves of grass.
Read Whitman's o pioneers.
He can't stop.

585
00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.180
I once kind of the number of times he used the word,
um,

586
00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:03.160
the letter o in that poem and I quit counting.

587
00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:06.850
It's like America to Whitman was,
oh,

588
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:12.530
he just couldn't stop.
Well and sometimes that,
oh,

589
00:42:12.531 --> 00:42:15.980
America meant the tanker.
It meant the inventor.

590
00:42:15.981 --> 00:42:20.120
It meant the guy who invented a new kind of sewing machine and took it in for a

591
00:42:20.121 --> 00:42:20.954
pattern.

592
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:26.200
If you want to understand this Yankee northern market economy society,

593
00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:32.740
just look at some histories of technological innovation throughout this era and

594
00:42:32.841 --> 00:42:37.700
you realize there were just thousands and thousands of patents given mostly to

595
00:42:37.701 --> 00:42:42.701
northerners for inventing this or that kind of thing or trinket or firearm or

596
00:42:45.801 --> 00:42:50.801
method of producing something or printing press or glass or a musical instrument

597
00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:56.200
or or Connecticut clocks or the first refrigerators or ice making machines or

598
00:42:56.361 --> 00:43:00.240
new locks or new elevators and on and on and on and on and on and on.
It,
yeah,

599
00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:04.430
goes,
I forget who it may have been,
Charles Sellers instead,

600
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:08.790
if you want to see the market revolution happened and go study the archives of

601
00:43:08.791 --> 00:43:13.150
the U s patent office.
I've always found that kind of research road boring,

602
00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:16.690
but I think he had a point

603
00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:20.093
now

604
00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:26.530
in any society changing this much,
this fast,

605
00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:29.770
doubling its own population,

606
00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.070
doubling in 25 years.

607
00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:39.540
If the rate of population growth of the United States between 1820 and 1850 had

608
00:43:41.441 --> 00:43:42.940
sustained over time,

609
00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:48.700
we'd have today approximately one and a half billion people in the United
States.

610
00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:51.730
No it didn't.

611
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:56.800
And we had these world wars and it all this history in between.

612
00:43:58.210 --> 00:43:59.590
What do we have now?
300 million.

613
00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:04.990
If the rate of growth that sustained,
that's what the population would be.

614
00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:08.140
Any era of great change,

615
00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:13.560
great ferment usually causes reform

616
00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.073
anxiety.

617
00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:22.060
People who get worried want to change things.

618
00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:27.530
We've probably had four major periods in American history of um,

619
00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.610
there's one of the picture I to put it up.

620
00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:40.140
I don't want to leave that little girl up.
She's much better than the,

621
00:44:40.141 --> 00:44:43.470
I had a picture of the Lowell Mills and Sydney,
but you don't need that.

622
00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:47.850
We've had probably four great reform periods in American history.

623
00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:49.381
Now I'm,

624
00:44:49.381 --> 00:44:54.050
by reform I mean a period in which people became professional reformers,

625
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:59.220
movements,
organizations,
societies,
whole newspapers came into existence.

626
00:44:59.221 --> 00:45:03.330
Magazines came into existence to either eradicate something,

627
00:45:03.331 --> 00:45:04.440
to change something,

628
00:45:04.441 --> 00:45:08.820
or to build something fundamental challenges to the social order.

629
00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:15.110
The first is this era of the 1820s thirties forties and 50s antebellum America

630
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:20.820
exemplified most obviously by the antislavery movement,

631
00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:25.650
which is where we're going to get to as we leave today.
Of course,

632
00:45:25.651 --> 00:45:27.510
there were many other reformed movements at the time.

633
00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.750
The second great reform era is the progressive era.

634
00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:35.690
A great response to urbanization,

635
00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:40.700
industrialization and immigration as it had never quite happened before.

636
00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:45.860
This word is in all likelihood the new deal,
the great depression,

637
00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:47.603
hey,

638
00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:52.790
incredible emergencies and crises of what governments,
oh,

639
00:45:52.791 --> 00:45:57.670
they're people and people owe their governments that the great depression cost

640
00:45:57.710 --> 00:46:02.710
cause and the new deal brought a fundamental new set of approaches,

641
00:46:03.981 --> 00:46:07.610
ideas,
which we're still debating today.

642
00:46:07.611 --> 00:46:10.250
It's all over our political culture,
whether it's named or not,

643
00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:13.040
and the fourth one is the 60s

644
00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:19.280
there it had less to do often was social forms of reform,

645
00:46:19.281 --> 00:46:20.720
although that's not entirely true.

646
00:46:20.721 --> 00:46:25.460
Then it had to do with the civil rights revolution and the Vietnam War

647
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:31.530
in American history are reform.

648
00:46:31.531 --> 00:46:36.531
Crusades have usually had to do with one of several objects or purposes or

649
00:46:40.351 --> 00:46:41.220
problems.

650
00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:47.800
The first is the industrializing process and we've been living the,

651
00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:48.810
the,

652
00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:53.810
the history of how to reform the industrializing process and now the post

653
00:46:54.361 --> 00:46:57.450
industrializing process.
Ever since our first market revolution,

654
00:46:57.451 --> 00:46:58.284
we're still living it.

655
00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.060
Why are we having a debate over social security?

656
00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:09.380
The second is racial equality and we're still having that reform movement.

657
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:14.670
Well,
or are we,
the third is gender equality.

658
00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:20.010
That's at least as old as abolitionism.
The fourth is war.

659
00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:26.090
We've got peace movements in American history and anti war fervor and ferment of

660
00:47:26.671 --> 00:47:28.650
all kinds for a very long time.

661
00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:32.350
And the fifth kind of American reform,
and it's here,

662
00:47:32.351 --> 00:47:36.460
it takes on sometimes some distinctive distinctly American forms

663
00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:40.160
is religious and individual morality.

664
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:44.290
Movements of piety.

665
00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:46.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

666
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:51.900
<v 0>Movements that try to define deviants and others and try to reform others to a</v>

667
00:47:52.691 --> 00:47:57.610
certain personal conception of faith or religion or behavior.

668
00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:00.730
But whenever we've had a reform era,

669
00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:07.620
there's been a big issue or two or three or four.

670
00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:12.300
That's why all these arguments that we all get into these days about third party

671
00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:15.090
political candidates,
uh,
you know,

672
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:17.340
what do we really need in our political culture?

673
00:48:17.341 --> 00:48:21.000
What would break apart the stagnation of our two party system if that's what

674
00:48:21.001 --> 00:48:25.980
people want or put more directly,
we'll Michael Bloomberg run or not.

675
00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:32.230
I always throw that back at people and say,
dammit,
read some history.

676
00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:33.480
<v 1>Okay.</v>

677
00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:38.480
<v 0>There's never been a successful third party political culture take hold in this</v>

678
00:48:38.911 --> 00:48:42.930
country without one really big issue to drive it.

679
00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:46.950
Name that issue that Michael Bloomberg Bloomberg would use.

680
00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:53.430
I'm a billionaire and you can be too.
That's unfair.

681
00:48:53.431 --> 00:48:54.690
I know he's a nice guy.

682
00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:03.280
Well,
let me just end here.
Uh,
with this

683
00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:09.840
to be anti slavery in America by the 1820s and 1830s

684
00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:15.230
what's the face a host of barriers,

685
00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:19.550
and I'll come back to these barriers next time.
A host of barriers,

686
00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:24.860
the sanctity of the u s constitution,
the depth of that pro slavery argument,

687
00:49:24.861 --> 00:49:28.760
which America was northern abolitionist overtime had to actually come to to

688
00:49:28.761 --> 00:49:32.420
realize even existed and they began to realize it existed in the agent twenties

689
00:49:32.421 --> 00:49:36.900
and thirties
they faced tremendous barriers.

690
00:49:36.901 --> 00:49:41.490
There was no good reason in the world that an abolitionist and the 1830s forties

691
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:44.610
even 50s had any right to believe.

692
00:49:44.611 --> 00:49:46.560
They would see the end of slavery in their lifetime.

693
00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:57.743
<v 1>And last point,</v>

694
00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:03.910
<v 0>one of the barriers,
I think about this,</v>

695
00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:07.590
one of the barriers that an anti slavery,
you know,

696
00:50:07.591 --> 00:50:11.080
a few were you were worried about slavery in America.
It's expansion.

697
00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:14.530
It's influencing the government,
what it did to free labor,

698
00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:18.100
how it might retard that market revolution that you wanted your children to

699
00:50:18.101 --> 00:50:18.940
benefit from.

700
00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:24.330
Whatever position you might end up taking between 1830 in 1860 that made you at

701
00:50:24.701 --> 00:50:28.070
least suspicious of slavery.
Whatever you thought of African Americans,

702
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:32.600
one of the barriers you're up against is the simple fact that the United States

703
00:50:32.601 --> 00:50:33.620
was a republic,

704
00:50:36.490 --> 00:50:41.230
and that the side that own those slaves,
that vast slave society,

705
00:50:41.231 --> 00:50:44.620
half of the United States,
it's still half the states in 1850

706
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:48.760
they were free.
Their leaders,

707
00:50:48.761 --> 00:50:53.080
at least we're free to defend their system.

708
00:50:53.890 --> 00:50:58.850
They were free to dissent.
They were Republicans.
Smaller too.

709
00:51:05.830 --> 00:51:08.890
The greatest tragedy of America,
of American history,
arguably,

710
00:51:08.891 --> 00:51:13.891
is that this struggle could not be decided by debate.

711
00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:22.470
Okay?
See you in the gym.
