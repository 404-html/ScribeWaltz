1
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.690
On a morning and the second week of March,
1857.

2
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.073
<v 1>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.000
<v 0>Americans grew up living,
they didn't all quite understand it yet,</v>

4
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:18.390
but that grew up living in the land of the dred Scott decision.

5
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.980
And if you were African American,
that really meant something.

6
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.270
No,
1857 is of course,

7
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.690
the final year of the playing out of bleeding Kansas.

8
00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:37.550
And we'll return to that in just a second.

9
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.310
And we're going to discuss mostly today,
uh,

10
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.090
the story of one abolitionist.

11
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.270
You could say the most famous abolitionist,

12
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.410
certainly the most notorious American abolitionist,

13
00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.460
John Brown.

14
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.430
John Brown never made it easy for people to love him.

15
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.840
In some ways,
he wasn't very lovable

16
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.530
until he died on the gallows.

17
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.870
And the gallows made him heroic,
at least to some people.

18
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.010
And it made him all but the devil to others.

19
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.660
There are catalytic events in history that is events around which ideas,

20
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.040
forces,
movements,
problems,
coalesce.

21
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.240
Unfortunately,
they often have a lot to do with violence.

22
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.480
And we'll come back to this point to Dan today,

23
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.320
but John Brown was far,
far,
far,

24
00:01:48.321 --> 00:01:52.310
far more important dead than he'd ever been alive.

25
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.230
Poets,
songwriters,
lyricists,

26
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.450
biographers,

27
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.050
those who would come to loving those who would come to hate him.

28
00:02:05.051 --> 00:02:09.700
And those who cannot quite figure out what to do with him would never stop

29
00:02:09.701 --> 00:02:11.470
writing about him.
And we still haven't.

30
00:02:11.471 --> 00:02:15.790
And we're in the midst right now of John Brown biography revival.

31
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.280
That's in part because next year is the hundred and 50th anniversary of the

32
00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:22.660
harpers ferry raid.

33
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.330
Almost all major African American poets in the 20th Century attempted there John

34
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.610
Brown poem.
It's Soda Soda,

35
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.050
Steven Vinson,

36
00:02:38.051 --> 00:02:43.051
Venay and I famous and classic lyric epic poem called John Brown's body

37
00:02:45.761 --> 00:02:50.761
published in the 1920s and embedded in that poem is this verse we're Benet I

38
00:02:52.841 --> 00:02:53.770
think captured.

39
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.283
<v 1>Okay.</v>

40
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.300
<v 0>The dilemma of John Brown,
John Brown is not easy to decide</v>

41
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.950
was he a heroic revolutionary
or a midnight terrorist.

42
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.940
This is [inaudible] verse embedded in a 250 page epic poem.

43
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.510
The law is our yard stick and it measures well or well enough when they're our

44
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:25.000
yards to measure,
measure a wave with it,

45
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.430
measure fire,

46
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.950
cut sorrow up in inches,
way content.

47
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.550
You can wait John Brown's body well enough,

48
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.200
but how and in what balance do you way John Brown,

49
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.140
he had no gift for life,

50
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.380
no gift to bring life,

51
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.010
but his body in a cutting edge and he knew

52
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.633
<v 1>how to die</v>

53
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.360
<v 0>more on old John Brown coming up</v>

54
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.710
the year before John Brown's raid,

55
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.260
the most important,

56
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.240
the most exhilarating and by far than all those substantively interesting

57
00:04:15.241 --> 00:04:19.530
political debates in American history would occur in Illinois.

58
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.990
And Abraham Lincoln runs for the u s Senate against Stephen Douglas,

59
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.870
even Douglas,
same Stephen Douglas author,

60
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.890
the Kansas Nebraska act parliamentarian genius of the compromise of 1850 the man

61
00:04:34.831 --> 00:04:38.730
most associated with the Democratic Party's theory of popular sovereignty for

62
00:04:38.731 --> 00:04:40.980
Kansas and Nebraska and the whole of the West.

63
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.480
And this Guy Abe Lincoln with one term in the US House of Representatives and

64
00:04:45.481 --> 00:04:47.400
then a failed attempted reelection.

65
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:49.210
<v 1>Okay.</v>

66
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.020
<v 0>A guy with very little experience when he ran for president</v>

67
00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.490
in the opening of his campaign,

68
00:04:59.491 --> 00:05:04.491
he decided to open it in the legislative hall of the Old State House and

69
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.043
Illinois.

70
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.760
It's on the outside steps of that state house where Barack Obama began his

71
00:05:11.761 --> 00:05:14.250
campaign almost exactly a year ago,

72
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.240
but inside Lincoln gave his now famous house divided speech.

73
00:05:21.031 --> 00:05:24.090
Now in your reader,
your Lincoln reader edited by Mike Johnson,

74
00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:27.930
you have the house divided speech,
but read past the first page.

75
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.670
<v 1>Okay?</v>

76
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.000
<v 0>Don't just read that first lyrical biblical paragraph.</v>

77
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.050
Read what Lincoln goes on to argue the speeches about the dred Scott decision.

78
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.230
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

79
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.930
<v 0>This beaches is his opposition to the dreads get to the Supreme Court case has</v>

80
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.180
just been passed the year before his speeches,

81
00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:52.650
his opposition to the Kansas Nebraska Act,
his speeches,
a warning.

82
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.860
It's the warning of a moderate Republican.
Nevertheless,

83
00:05:57.861 --> 00:06:01.040
a moderate antislavery free soil republican

84
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.050
who throws down the gauntlet in the wake of dred Scott.

85
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:10.130
This is a sentence on the fifth page of the house divided speech.

86
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.640
Page 68 and your reader,
if you'll look it up,

87
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.360
we shall lie down soon,

88
00:06:16.361 --> 00:06:21.361
said Abraham Lincoln pleasantly dreaming that the people of Missouri are on the

89
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:26.381
verge of making their state free and we shall awake the next morning to the

90
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:32.111
reality instead that the Supreme Court has made Illinois a slave state,

91
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:37.480
get his drift,

92
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.830
dred Scott decision in his view and the view now most in this new extraordinary

93
00:06:46.301 --> 00:06:47.220
coalition,

94
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.970
the Republican Party believed the dred Scott decision now threatens everybody

95
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.000
north,
south and west

96
00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:01.490
with the presence of slavery and slave labor and all that goes with it.

97
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.080
It's the opening of that speech though of course that the world always remembers

98
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.060
and we love to return to this in our political culture,
in our political history,

99
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.570
whenever we feel great polarization and great division,

100
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.380
are we a house divided again against ourselves?

101
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.900
If we could first and know where we are and whether we are tending this is so

102
00:07:24.901 --> 00:07:25.734
Lincoln,

103
00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:31.310
he kinda Manders and a bit of a home spun way into a very serious argument.

104
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:40.020
We could then better judge what to do and how to do it.

105
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.080
We are now far into the fifth years since a policy was initiated.
Kansas,

106
00:07:46.081 --> 00:07:50.870
Nebraska with the avowed object and confident promise and putting it in to the

107
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:55.740
slavery,
agitation
under the operation of that policy,

108
00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:58.500
that agitation is not only not cease,

109
00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:02.880
but has constantly or augmented in my opinion,

110
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.400
and will not cease until a crisis shall had been reached and passed.

111
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:13.500
A house divided against itself cannot stand.

112
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.700
I believe this government cannot endure permanently,

113
00:08:17.701 --> 00:08:20.040
half slave and half free.

114
00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:25.500
I did not expect the union to be dissolved.
I do not expect the house to fall,

115
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.410
but I do expect it will cease to be divided.

116
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.880
It will become all one thing or all the other southerners never forgot that

117
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.950
sentence.
Either.

118
00:08:41.951 --> 00:08:45.790
The opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it and place it where

119
00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:50.791
the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate

120
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:56.940
extinction and those two words more than else Lincoln had uttered before the

121
00:08:57.511 --> 00:08:58.350
civil war.

122
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.680
Southern Democrats would never forget or it's advocates will push it forward

123
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:11.540
until it shall become a like lawful and all the states old as well as new north

124
00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:16.941
as well as south have we no tendency to the ladder condition.

125
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.670
Let anyone who doubts carefully contemplate that now almost complete legal

126
00:09:23.671 --> 00:09:27.270
combination piece of machinery so to speak.

127
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:32.271
And here he's arguing the slave power conspiracy without naming it compounded of

128
00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:36.270
the Nebraska doctrine and the dred Scott decision.

129
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:41.420
Let him consider not only what work the machinery is adapted to do and how and

130
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.460
the machinery and how well adapted,

131
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:49.760
but also let him study the history of its construction and trace if he can or

132
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.660
rather fail,
if he can,

133
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.960
to trace the evidences of design and concert of action among its chief bosses

134
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:00.960
from the beginning.

135
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.153
<v 1>Okay.</v>

136
00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:05.200
<v 0>It's all there.</v>

137
00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:10.650
The Republican Party coalition of ideas and fears is all there,

138
00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.790
but what was everybody's so angry about?
What were the dred Scott Decision?

139
00:10:15.791 --> 00:10:17.260
It's just a supreme court decision.

140
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:24.853
Well,

141
00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:29.450
I left you the other day hanging in the balance.

142
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.010
Dred Scott,
was this a Serta and old old man?

143
00:10:35.011 --> 00:10:39.600
By the time this thing finally got before the ship got on the docket in 1854

144
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:40.621
finally,

145
00:10:40.621 --> 00:10:45.621
it was argued in late 1856 and early 1857 and when the court brought down his

146
00:10:47.131 --> 00:10:49.920
decision,
literally two days,
I believe,

147
00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:54.921
48 hours after the inauguration of James Buchanan is president in 1857

148
00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.540
<v 1>okay.</v>

149
00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:02.540
<v 0>His case was now his name would now become almost a household word across the</v>

150
00:11:03.361 --> 00:11:04.194
country.

151
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:06.050
<v 1>Okay.</v>

152
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:10.520
<v 0>No.
A measure of how important this case was as it was developing largely illegal</v>

153
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.970
secrecy was the kind of lawyers who argued it.

154
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:19.130
Montgomery Blair and George Tickner.
Curtis for Scott Montgomery,

155
00:11:19.131 --> 00:11:23.420
Blair with come with the famous Blair family from Missouri and moderate

156
00:11:23.421 --> 00:11:27.140
antislavery leaning Republicans by this point in time,

157
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:31.910
member of Congress,
George Tickner,
Curtis,

158
00:11:31.911 --> 00:11:36.911
a former attorney general of very important famous trial lawyer.

159
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:38.480
<v 1>Okay.</v>

160
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:43.480
<v 0>And for the government and other former us attorney general remedy Johnson and a</v>

161
00:11:43.611 --> 00:11:47.330
u s senator Henry Guyer,
where the lawyers,

162
00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:49.650
<v 1>okay.</v>

163
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:52.950
<v 0>Brevity.
Johnson made the startling statements in the arguments,</v>

164
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.440
the supreme court and called for a pronounced.

165
00:11:56.441 --> 00:12:00.010
He made startling staves and he called for a broader pronouncement from the

166
00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:02.230
court.
He urged Justice Tawney,

167
00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:07.150
the chief justice and the court to render a big decision here and try once and

168
00:12:07.151 --> 00:12:10.870
for all the put this late as Lincoln it slavery,
agitation,

169
00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:12.930
this whole slavery in the Western territory.

170
00:12:12.931 --> 00:12:17.140
His problem to rest supreme court I after all is supreme.

171
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:21.690
<v 1>Okay.</v>

172
00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:25.380
<v 0>Remedy Johnson said,
I quote him.
This is the case.</v>

173
00:12:25.381 --> 00:12:30.381
The shell determine whether slavery shall live forever for ever.

174
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:37.820
Whether it preservation of slavery was the only way to preserve the union.

175
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:41.903
<v 1>Okay.</v>

176
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:47.220
<v 0>The decision came on the sixth of the March,</v>

177
00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:51.750
1857 and here was the decision Tani and the majority in the court did not have

178
00:12:51.751 --> 00:12:53.160
to go as far as they did.

179
00:12:53.161 --> 00:12:58.161
This is now legendary and famous Tawney developing his majority and it was

180
00:12:59.581 --> 00:13:02.280
ultimately a six to three decision.

181
00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:08.810
Unless you think the supreme court doesn't really matter in our political

182
00:13:08.811 --> 00:13:09.644
history,

183
00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:14.300
please remember the dred Scott decision number one,
part of the,

184
00:13:14.301 --> 00:13:17.060
there were three parts of the decision.
The first was jurisdiction.

185
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:23.630
Did dred Scott as a black person have the right to sue.

186
00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.200
That's just the first question they were asked to,

187
00:13:27.201 --> 00:13:31.560
to settle the right to sue for anything in a federal court.

188
00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.560
Could a noncitizen

189
00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.980
because he was a negro,
which is the language used.

190
00:13:39.981 --> 00:13:43.040
Then sue in federal court

191
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.033
<v 1>two</v>

192
00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.440
<v 0>did Scott's residents on free soil.</v>

193
00:13:48.441 --> 00:13:52.280
Remember is four years with Dr. Emerson is former owner from 1834 to eight and

194
00:13:52.281 --> 00:13:54.860
38 living in Minnesota territory.

195
00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:58.760
Did his residence on free soil entitle him to freedom

196
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:05.500
or if a slave was taken by his owner to free states or free territory's?

197
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.740
Was that the law of the state?

198
00:14:09.741 --> 00:14:13.370
The master came from that always had jurisdiction.
In other words,

199
00:14:13.371 --> 00:14:16.340
was it the law of Missouri that took precedent here.

200
00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:17.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

201
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:19.590
<v 0>Or the law of Minnesota.</v>

202
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:22.953
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

203
00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:26.450
<v 0>and the third question before the court,
they didn't have to take this one up,</v>

204
00:14:26.451 --> 00:14:27.440
but they sure did.

205
00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.970
Was Congress's right to determine slavery in the Western territory?

206
00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.400
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

207
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.490
<v 0>the pressure's on the court were tremendous,
as I said,</v>

208
00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:40.060
to move for a broad decision to try and put this thing to rest.

209
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.460
Well,
the decision of course six to three

210
00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:50.470
and at that point there were five southern born justices,

211
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:55.370
five either slave holders or former slave holders on the supreme court.

212
00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.480
The six judge who voted with them was Greer of Pennsylvania forming a majority

213
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:08.780
against the three northern born justices who voted against it.

214
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:11.480
The decision was one,

215
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:18.250
Scott had no right to sue in a federal court to his residence on free soil,

216
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.080
did not give him his freedom.

217
00:15:21.081 --> 00:15:26.081
The law of Missouri was in place and third,

218
00:15:26.631 --> 00:15:31.631
and by far most important the court rule trying to put the rest now nearly 40

219
00:15:32.871 --> 00:15:37.370
years of this problem that had been compromised this way and compromise that way

220
00:15:37.371 --> 00:15:39.980
and argued with that principle and that principle and that principle.

221
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:45.280
As we've seen it ruled the congress had no authority to exclude slavery from any

222
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:52.960
u s territory because it would be just as southerners had been arguing now for

223
00:15:53.481 --> 00:15:54.770
two generations,

224
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:59.720
a violation of the fifth amendment to the constitution.

225
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:03.860
A person's right to life,
liberty,
and property.

226
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:10.510
If someone ever wants to doubt that American history is about its ironies,

227
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:16.310
just note that language.
Therefore,

228
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.930
the Missouri compromise line that's Oh called sacred pledge that had now been

229
00:16:20.931 --> 00:16:21.621
violated,

230
00:16:21.621 --> 00:16:26.621
said northerners and the Kansas Nebraska Act had never been constitutional to

231
00:16:26.991 --> 00:16:27.824
begin with.

232
00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:34.030
Then any attempt to prevent slavery's expansion anywhere

233
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.620
would be unconstitutional.
Now,

234
00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:44.390
tawny not only went that far,
but in his opinion and his own written opinion,

235
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:50.470
he famously went a step further and he argued or he said quote that blacks or

236
00:16:53.001 --> 00:16:56.450
Negroes,
the word he used had four I'm quoting,

237
00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:58.130
had for more than a century,

238
00:16:58.131 --> 00:17:03.131
been regarded as beings of an inferior order so far inferior that they had no

239
00:17:05.271 --> 00:17:09.320
rights,
which the white man was bound to respect.

240
00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:12.483
<v 1>MMM.</v>

241
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:18.480
<v 0>Some of the most infamous words ever in an American Supreme Court decision.</v>

242
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:21.343
<v 1>Now</v>

243
00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:24.320
<v 0>the decision is six to three was issued</v>

244
00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:29.030
for this new Republican Party coalition and the north.

245
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:34.730
And in some ways this was horrible news and in some ways it was good political

246
00:17:34.731 --> 00:17:39.500
news cause nothing crystallize this Republican coalition now quite like this

247
00:17:39.501 --> 00:17:40.334
case.

248
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.030
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

249
00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:47.030
<v 0>They will crystallize and resistance to it as I just tried to demonstrate from</v>

250
00:17:47.911 --> 00:17:52.830
quoting from Lincoln's house divided speech.
But most importantly here,

251
00:17:52.831 --> 00:17:55.530
I'd argue,
I mean the hook to hang your hat on here.

252
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.860
Is it the dred Scott Decision?
It's not once and for all.

253
00:17:58.861 --> 00:18:03.861
The war is not necessarily now inevitable contingencies are always there.

254
00:18:04.531 --> 00:18:06.060
They're always laying there to happen.

255
00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:12.150
But what the dred Scott decision did almost once and for all,

256
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.240
is that it destroyed compromise.

257
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:21.500
It destroyed almost any conception now of consensus or compromise or put another

258
00:18:24.241 --> 00:18:27.450
way it ruined moderation.

259
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.510
Moderate politicians,

260
00:18:30.511 --> 00:18:34.740
former Democrats like David will muck from Pennsylvania racist to the core,

261
00:18:34.741 --> 00:18:39.000
but free soiler who's joined the Republican Party,
Abraham Lincoln,

262
00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:39.883
Illinois.

263
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:41.983
<v 1>MMM.</v>

264
00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:43.930
<v 0>Got his own racial problems,</v>

265
00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:48.340
but a much more advanced sort of antislavery thinker,

266
00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:49.630
but still a moderate.

267
00:18:49.631 --> 00:18:52.990
He didn't like abolition is he'd never been a member of an abolitionist society.

268
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.920
Never would be
believe there were concert institution,

269
00:18:56.921 --> 00:19:00.700
constitutional restraints on what Congress could actually do about slavery,

270
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.950
but it will bring together now some strange bedfellows in this Republican

271
00:19:05.951 --> 00:19:06.790
coalition

272
00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:13.880
who cannot find anymore any middle ground would their photos.

273
00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.930
And that's when you see danger.

274
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:24.500
You just think you're more than see danger in American political history.

275
00:19:24.501 --> 00:19:29.501
It's when the side that loses a debate cannot accept the result.

276
00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:35.673
<v 1>No.</v>

277
00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:40.210
<v 0>There are many ways to try to demonstrate the importance of that dred Scott Case</v>

278
00:19:40.211 --> 00:19:43.060
as it's sunk in now,

279
00:19:43.061 --> 00:19:48.061
it's sinking in now in the summer of 1857 as a depression hits the country wages

280
00:19:49.331 --> 00:19:54.130
in America,
north in northern cities like New York,
Boston,
Philadelphia,
and so on.

281
00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:57.910
Drop 40 and 50% in six months.

282
00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:03.850
The estimate is that 100,000 workers in New York City were thrown out of work by

283
00:20:03.851 --> 00:20:05.170
the end of 1857

284
00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:11.260
about 50,000 in Philadelphia,
uh,

285
00:20:11.261 --> 00:20:15.040
prices of wheat go plummeting practically overnight.

286
00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:20.200
The United States had one of its first significant stock market crashes.

287
00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:26.490
There's a lot to be feared here and on both sides of this north and south,

288
00:20:26.491 --> 00:20:27.690
they're going to blame each other.

289
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.200
Southerners are going to blame northerners for over speculation,

290
00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:35.550
for the overfishing of credit by banks.
And of course they're right about that.

291
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.100
There were no controls on banks in these years.

292
00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:40.760
It was no federal deposit insurance corporation.

293
00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:44.580
You only got that from the new deal in the 20th century.

294
00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:46.490
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

295
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.160
<v 0>And Northern,
there's going to blame southerners</v>

296
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:54.480
<v 1>because of their belief in king cotton and this kind of dependence on a single</v>

297
00:20:54.521 --> 00:20:57.460
export.
I think I'll throw blame all over the place.

298
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:04.390
<v 0>If you are African American,
you now live in the land of the dred Scott decision,</v>

299
00:21:04.391 --> 00:21:06.040
which had said what?
It said,

300
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:09.790
you will never be a citizen of the United States.

301
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:14.440
You have no rights,
which the white man has to respect,

302
00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:17.770
which means the white man's constitution,
which means the white men society.

303
00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:21.460
It means you live in the land of the dred Scott decision that said,

304
00:21:21.461 --> 00:21:23.980
you have no future in the United States.

305
00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

306
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:28.800
<v 0>In the wake of the dred Scott Case,
about a month after it,</v>

307
00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:34.810
Frederick Douglass gave a speech,
which was a bit uncustomary for him.
Uh,

308
00:21:34.811 --> 00:21:38.010
and the 1850 [inaudible] Frederick Douglass was learning his politics.

309
00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:39.480
He really was learning.

310
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.950
He was getting his feet as a political thinker and even as a politician,

311
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:47.520
he was trying to sidle up to this Republican Party.
Don't know.

312
00:21:47.521 --> 00:21:51.570
It was kind of a half baked loaf of bread to him.
It wasn't real.

313
00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:52.530
Abolitionism

314
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.930
this case drove him further into their laps,

315
00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.960
but he gave a speech largely to a black audience and the way could dred Scott

316
00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:07.100
and so typical of Douglass's brilliance is in order.

317
00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:12.970
He started to discuss how he saw fear on the horizon and trouble and dread on

318
00:22:13.761 --> 00:22:14.630
the horizon,

319
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:21.480
and he said he saw what he called the manifold discouragements of my people.

320
00:22:21.481 --> 00:22:24.180
Everywhere I go,
I quote him.

321
00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:29.750
They fling their broad and gloomy shadows across the pathway of every thoughtful

322
00:22:29.911 --> 00:22:34.890
colored man in this country.
And then he ended with this lament.

323
00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:40.440
I see them.
These are discouragements.
I see them clearly and feel them.
Sadly,

324
00:22:40.441 --> 00:22:42.030
with an earnest Dakin Hart,

325
00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:46.500
I have long looked for the realization of the hope of my people standing as it

326
00:22:46.501 --> 00:22:51.090
were barefoot and treading upon the sharpened flinty rocks of the present and

327
00:22:51.091 --> 00:22:53.610
looking out upon the boundless see of the future.

328
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.590
I have sought in my humble way to penetrate the intervene in your intervening

329
00:22:58.591 --> 00:23:03.591
myths and clouds and per chance to see in the distance of time at which the

330
00:23:05.641 --> 00:23:10.641
cruel bondage of my people should somehow in and the long and tuned millions

331
00:23:11.101 --> 00:23:14.730
rise from their file grave of slavery and death.

332
00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:20.480
But of that time I can now know nothing and you can know nothing in all is

333
00:23:22.831 --> 00:23:24.450
uncertain at this point.

334
00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:28.440
Our walk by faith and not by sight.

335
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.943
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

336
00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:37.040
<v 0>that's Douglas as beautiful and terrible way of expressing that he's now told is</v>

337
00:23:39.091 --> 00:23:43.170
an African American.
You have no future in the United States.

338
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:52.200
All right,
so who was John Brown?

339
00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:59.410
<v 1>MMM,</v>

340
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:04.100
<v 0>that picture.
I'm going to show you just a couple of images here.</v>

341
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:05.150
John Brown of course,

342
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:09.620
has been a fascination for artists to say the least.

343
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:12.320
I don't want to take too much time with this,

344
00:24:12.321 --> 00:24:15.020
but this is a black and white version.

345
00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:17.300
I don't know if you can see the rope up here.

346
00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:24.080
This is one of the 22 panels and Jacob Lawrence's magnificent series on John

347
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.360
Brown.
Jacob Lawrence,
the great African American painter.

348
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:28.640
He painted this in the 1930s

349
00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:35.460
in at least 20 of the 22 images in Lawrence's incredible series on John Brown,

350
00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:41.370
you will find some image of a crucifix

351
00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:44.523
<v 1>of</v>

352
00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:47.770
<v 0>execution.
The hanging,</v>

353
00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:54.490
when I was teaching at Amherst College,
I don't know,
eight or nine years ago,

354
00:24:54.491 --> 00:24:57.100
we had Jacob Lawrence for an honorary degree

355
00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.670
and I got to spend like two days with him.

356
00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:04.390
It was one of the greatest thrills of my life.
And uh,

357
00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:09.940
the museum at Amorous managed to get the,
the series on John Brown.

358
00:25:09.941 --> 00:25:14.080
They had it in a room and I was asked to do a gallery talk on it.

359
00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:20.030
And so I went into the room the day before I was to give this talk all by
myself,

360
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:20.893
nobody in there.

361
00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.700
And I just commune with these terrible images.

362
00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.830
Sometimes the images sort of crisscross bayonets and sometimes criss cross

363
00:25:30.831 --> 00:25:34.250
rifles.
And sometimes it's literally crosses on the wall in rooms.

364
00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:37.760
And sometimes it's this image brown hanging.

365
00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:39.440
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

366
00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.640
<v 0>And I was overwhelmed by it.</v>

367
00:25:40.641 --> 00:25:44.600
And the next day I gave this talk and I talked about these images of crucifixes.

368
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:48.290
What they hadn't told me is that they were also inviting a busload of fifth

369
00:25:48.291 --> 00:25:49.880
graders to come to the lecture.

370
00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.520
And they also hadn't told me that that morning and the New York Times and the

371
00:25:55.521 --> 00:25:58.040
headline today is wouldn't even get headlines.

372
00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.000
There'd been a bus bombing in Jerusalem and 38 people were slaughtered in a bus

373
00:26:02.001 --> 00:26:06.050
by a terrorist bomb.
And I was going to talk about John Brown,

374
00:26:06.051 --> 00:26:10.850
whether he was a terrorist and walk the fifth graders,
toughest.

375
00:26:10.851 --> 00:26:13.000
Dot.
One of the toughest audiences I ever had.

376
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:18.010
How do you smooth over John Brown and all those crucifixes the fifth graders on

377
00:26:19.101 --> 00:26:23.030
a field trip?
Don't even try.
Just the answer

378
00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:28.130
now.
Their favorite image in mind of John Brown's,

379
00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:32.220
David Levine's David Levine as the artist for the New York review of books.

380
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
It's actually comes from 1969 a series of books had come out and John Brown,

381
00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:44.160
I mean this is an image that kind of fits brown to many people.

382
00:26:44.161 --> 00:26:48.840
The gardens,
you know,
Kinda wild man.

383
00:26:48.841 --> 00:26:49.950
He's got red face,

384
00:26:49.951 --> 00:26:54.951
probably big nose gun belt bullets all around him kind of saying don't mess with

385
00:26:57.091 --> 00:27:02.070
me.
But then of course there's

386
00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:08.370
Thomas Hovenden
incredible painting of John Brown,

387
00:27:08.371 --> 00:27:12.120
which hangs in the Metropolitan Museum of art in New York.

388
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:17.250
Um,
I don't have the full version of it.
Yeah.

389
00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:21.600
This is the painting that depicts the scene of John Brown leaving his jail cell

390
00:27:21.601 --> 00:27:25.340
and Charles Town Virginia on the day of his execution.

391
00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:26.990
<v 1>Okay.</v>

392
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:31.520
<v 0>According to the artist with the hangman's noose already around his neck before</v>

393
00:27:31.521 --> 00:27:34.250
you even wrote to the gallows details.

394
00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:40.270
And a black woman comes up with her baby and raises her baby to John Brown and

395
00:27:40.271 --> 00:27:45.260
he kisses trial.
It's the legend of the kiss is John Greenleaf.

396
00:27:45.261 --> 00:27:48.620
Whittier put it in a poem that didn't happen,
but

397
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:55.240
in art,
anything can happen.
This is the gentle savior,

398
00:27:55.241 --> 00:28:00.160
John Brown.
This is the liberator,
John Brown.
This is the murderer,
John Brown.

399
00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:03.550
There are many,
many,
many John Brown's.

400
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:05.490
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

401
00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:10.490
<v 0>And you're going to start hearing about and seeing a lot more of them next year.</v>

402
00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:18.190
Um,
oh gosh.
Does that backward?

403
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:23.530
No,
I guess that's not bad.
You can't see that very well,
but so be it.

404
00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:29.100
Well,
John Brown was

405
00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:34.040
born in Connecticut.
Uh,

406
00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:39.060
Torrington to be exact and just our ways up the road,

407
00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:45.050
um,
is born in 1800 [inaudible].

408
00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:49.360
He grew up mostly out in the western reserve as it was called of Ohio.

409
00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:55.040
He witnessed at the age of 12,
the beating of a slave boy.

410
00:28:55.041 --> 00:29:00.041
There were remnants of slaves don't traversing the north and the 18 teens.

411
00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:05.530
Okay.
He tried divinity school for a little while at the age of 16,

412
00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.230
but said he quit because of insufficient funds.

413
00:29:08.231 --> 00:29:10.780
And because all the reading caused him sore eyes,

414
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:16.110
he experienced a confession of faith in his father's church.

415
00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:20.250
Congregational old fashioned Calvin is congregational church.

416
00:29:20.251 --> 00:29:21.750
When he was about 16,

417
00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:25.410
he married first in 18,

418
00:29:25.411 --> 00:29:29.800
21st wife would die on him.

419
00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:31.450
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

420
00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:36.450
<v 0>He had no less than 20 children by two wives over some 30 years.</v>

421
00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:41.100
Nine of those children would die in infancy

422
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:48.730
from 1822 1855 he engaged in approximately 20 different business ventures of one

423
00:29:50.481 --> 00:29:53.930
kind and another in six different northern states,

424
00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:59.560
virtually all of which ended in failure and poverty for his family,

425
00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:05.800
several of which ended in lawsuits and bankruptcies and one litigation after

426
00:30:06.051 --> 00:30:06.884
another,

427
00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:11.180
one of which led to debtor's prison for a while.

428
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:16.760
He and his family had to live a poverty stricken,

429
00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:21.680
rolling stone existence across the northern states.

430
00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:26.200
Probably what sustained him,

431
00:30:26.201 --> 00:30:30.820
and we know good deal about this was his religion,
his faith,

432
00:30:30.821 --> 00:30:32.560
his theology if you want.

433
00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:35.920
He was a kind of orthodox in 19th century Calvinist.

434
00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:40.360
He believed in such things as a Nate depravity,
providential designs,

435
00:30:40.361 --> 00:30:45.280
predestination on some level and the total human dependence on a sovereign and

436
00:30:45.281 --> 00:30:50.281
arbitrary God and an arbitrary God that sometimes chose certain individual human

437
00:30:50.591 --> 00:30:52.390
beings in history to act for him.

438
00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:53.910
<v 1>Okay.</v>

439
00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:57.690
<v 0>He believed in an old testament kind of justice and I for nine a tooth for a</v>

440
00:30:57.691 --> 00:30:58.051
tooth.

441
00:30:58.051 --> 00:31:03.051
He punished his children and his employees with mosaic vengeance.

442
00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.740
He had a puritanical obsession with the wickedness of other people.

443
00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:16.640
He could be domineering vein obstinate as one friend once put it impervious to a

444
00:31:19.321 --> 00:31:20.154
joke,

445
00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:25.890
probably not a lot of fun to just have lunch with.

446
00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:27.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

447
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:27.881
<v 0>He gave orders,</v>

448
00:31:27.881 --> 00:31:31.490
remembered Brown's younger brother quote like a king against tune.

449
00:31:31.491 --> 00:31:33.160
There is no rising up.

450
00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:37.370
He was a thorough going nonconformist.

451
00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:44.010
He probably never joined any formal antislavery organization,

452
00:31:44.141 --> 00:31:46.090
although we went to lots of their meetings.

453
00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:51.550
He never joined a political party and we're not even sure if he ever voted.

454
00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:57.740
He was a practitioner of what would become known in these years by certainly by

455
00:31:57.741 --> 00:32:02.741
the 1850s of a kind of higher law doctrine about slavery and allegiance to God's

456
00:32:04.761 --> 00:32:07.280
will and God's law above man's law.

457
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:09.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

458
00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.140
<v 0>To John Brown,</v>

459
00:32:10.141 --> 00:32:15.141
put simply slavery represented and unjustifiable state of war.

460
00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:17.430
<v 1>Okay.</v>

461
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:22.430
<v 0>By one portion of the people against another and in the state of war.</v>

462
00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:23.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

463
00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:25.180
<v 0>You do what's necessary.</v>

464
00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:26.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

465
00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:27.640
<v 0>Do defend yourselves.</v>

466
00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:29.280
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

467
00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.500
<v 0>He believes slavery was,
was an evil,</v>

468
00:32:31.501 --> 00:32:34.410
so entrenched and he was dead serious about this.

469
00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:39.890
So entrenched in America that it required revolutionary ideology and

470
00:32:40.791 --> 00:32:45.791
revolutionary means to eradicate it and it led to him as it has often in history

471
00:32:48.111 --> 00:32:53.111
led most proponents of revolutionary violence that the means can therefore

472
00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.090
justify the ends.

473
00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:00.360
<v 1>Okay.</v>

474
00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:05.360
<v 0>As God had willed so often in his old testament that the wicked must die.</v>

475
00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:11.600
So to heady willed that slave holders and their defenders at least deserve the

476
00:33:13.201 --> 00:33:14.034
same fate.

477
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:15.733
<v 1>Okay.</v>

478
00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:21.220
<v 0>John Brown came to believe that violence in a righteous cars was like a rite of</v>

479
00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:27.720
purification.
Uh,

480
00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:32.260
what did he do
in brief?

481
00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:39.660
John Brown's interest in Kansas was intense after the Kansas Nebraska Act.

482
00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:46.150
He was living then by then in upstate New York,

483
00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:51.280
uh,
up near what is today lake placid North Elbow,

484
00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:53.320
which is indeed where he is buried.

485
00:33:56.580 --> 00:34:01.580
Five of Brown sons went west to Kansas and late 1854 and early 1855.

486
00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:07.500
There's an extraordinary exchange of letters between a couple of those sons

487
00:34:07.501 --> 00:34:10.350
especially Oh and brown and his father back in New York,

488
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:14.490
letters that are saying things like,
father,
you must come out here with us.

489
00:34:14.491 --> 00:34:18.420
There are slave holders living over on such and such a creek within two miles of

490
00:34:18.421 --> 00:34:22.260
his father.
Violence is beginning to break out father.

491
00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:24.870
And so the father came

492
00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:27.570
<v 1>okay.</v>

493
00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:32.570
<v 0>And John Brown developed in Kansas by early 1855 by lady and 55 and in 1856 his</v>

494
00:34:36.421 --> 00:34:40.110
own little gorilla band,
they had gone to Kansas.

495
00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:42.990
The fight in Kansas is border war.

496
00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.590
Now I mentioned the other day that it was on,

497
00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:55.120
it was in the spring of 1856 brown and his men are traveling along a roadway and

498
00:34:55.611 --> 00:34:59.330
they get word of the beating of Charles Sumner on the floor of the Senate.

499
00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:03.620
I think it was first told to them that summer was all but dead.

500
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:07.190
This to him,
great abolitionist,
Senator

501
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:11.270
and Brown,
it appears,

502
00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.540
went into a frenzy and vowed revenge.

503
00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:20.620
And a couple of days later he and four of his sons or three of his sons went and

504
00:35:21.561 --> 00:35:26.561
did visitations at three houses along Pottawatomie creek and eastern Kansas,

505
00:35:26.571 --> 00:35:30.380
known to be an area settled by slaveholders or pro slavery people.

506
00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:36.290
And they dragged several men from their houses in front of their wives.

507
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.770
And hacked them to death five men to be exact,

508
00:35:40.771 --> 00:35:45.771
hack them to death with these huge broad swords and deposited their bodies on

509
00:35:46.531 --> 00:35:49.050
the front steps of their cabins.

510
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.400
This was the Pottawattamie creek massacre.

511
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:59.180
It touched off even greater violence in bleeding Kansas throughout that summer

512
00:36:00.181 --> 00:36:02.190
into the fall of 1856

513
00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:08.720
to John Brown.
He had kind of tried to even the score because just a few,

514
00:36:08.721 --> 00:36:13.070
a couple of weeks before that pro slavery forces had sacked,
attacked,

515
00:36:13.071 --> 00:36:17.870
and burned.
The antislavery capital of Kansas,

516
00:36:17.871 --> 00:36:22.460
Lawrence,
Kansas burned the hotel and killed six people

517
00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:26.750
brown by killing five said he hadn't quite even it up.

518
00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:32.620
He spent the summer of 1856 in hiding.

519
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.020
<v 1>No,
the fall</v>

520
00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.210
<v 0>in October,</v>

521
00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:42.410
1856 he left Kansas and went back east to launch what became the harpers ferry

522
00:36:42.411 --> 00:36:46.520
conspiracy,
and I'm in legal terms.
That's exactly what it was.

523
00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:52.210
He launched a fundraising campaign to finance a new and more daring attempt to

524
00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:59.150
take this war as he put it into Africa.

525
00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.330
By that he meant the south.

526
00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:07.720
It was his hope of attacking ultimately the largest federal arsenal in the

527
00:37:08.271 --> 00:37:10.070
United States,
which was in Harper's ferry,

528
00:37:10.071 --> 00:37:13.970
Virginia at the confluence of the shun and door and Potomac rivers,

529
00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:20.560
just some 30 40 miles from Washington d c capture that largest federal arsenal

530
00:37:22.341 --> 00:37:27.341
with its thousands of rifles and sidearms and barrels of gunpowder and

531
00:37:28.701 --> 00:37:32.330
apparently launch a growing,

532
00:37:32.331 --> 00:37:35.030
developing slave insurrection.

533
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.870
<v 1>Okay.</v>

534
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:38.370
<v 0>Down through Virginia.</v>

535
00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:44.470
And it was his hope at least.
So the best we can understand

536
00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:51.260
to engage in in effect a violent coup d'etat and take over the state of

537
00:37:52.861 --> 00:37:53.694
Virginia.

538
00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:56.980
<v 1>No mic.</v>

539
00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:02.270
<v 0>How long and dramatic story.
Short enough,</v>

540
00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:08.100
his fundraising campaign by 1857 fell by the way,

541
00:38:08.101 --> 00:38:13.050
in part because of the panic of 1857 but he visited all over the north.

542
00:38:13.051 --> 00:38:16.920
He visited the parlors of many famous abolitionist in New England.

543
00:38:16.921 --> 00:38:21.570
He sat and Ralph Waldo Emerson study people hosted dinners for him.

544
00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:26.010
He was this fascinating romantic,

545
00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:31.460
somewhat bizarre old man was with hair that was whitening and had been out there

546
00:38:33.091 --> 00:38:34.530
in Kansas raising hell.

547
00:38:34.531 --> 00:38:39.040
They didn't all the details of the Pottawattamie creek massacre and even when

548
00:38:39.041 --> 00:38:41.560
they began to hear them,
they didn't want to know too much,

549
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:47.140
but Brown was leading a crusade in Kansas to keep Kansas free soil.

550
00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:49.000
Brown was doing in Kansas.

551
00:38:49.001 --> 00:38:52.750
What a lot of these abolition is back east could not themselves do,

552
00:38:52.751 --> 00:38:54.220
but they were glad he was doing it.

553
00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.820
Began to raise some money for him.

554
00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:02.530
He came down here to Connecticut and he ordered some 200 excuse me,

555
00:39:02.531 --> 00:39:04.840
1000 spears.

556
00:39:04.841 --> 00:39:09.841
He called him pikes from afford from a a forgery which are ultimately delivered

557
00:39:11.201 --> 00:39:16.201
in boxes to a farm near Harper's ferry labeled famously Beecher's bibles,

558
00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:22.570
huge heavy boxes,
labeled bibles

559
00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:31.200
and then he went back west.
He established a headquarters in Tabor,

560
00:39:31.201 --> 00:39:35.850
Iowa,
a town known to be settled by abolitionists from the east,

561
00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:41.100
a place where he could begin to recruit men and train them.

562
00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:44.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

563
00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:49.460
<v 0>Then an early 1858 he spent one full month living in the attic apartment of</v>

564
00:39:49.681 --> 00:39:52.290
Frederick Douglass home in Rochester,
New York.

565
00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:57.840
We have only one little letter they exchanged during that time.

566
00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:02.310
It says,
John,
come down to dinner.

567
00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.400
Thanks a lot guys.

568
00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:10.830
But what we do know is that in that attic of Frederick Douglass House,

569
00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:15.600
John Brown wrote his so called provisional constitution for the state of

570
00:40:15.601 --> 00:40:18.870
Virginia.
When he took over Virginia,

571
00:40:18.871 --> 00:40:22.350
he was going to announce a new constitution.

572
00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:24.630
<v 1>Okay?</v>

573
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:29.190
<v 0>He in fact was going to be the governor unless you had any doubt.</v>

574
00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:34.920
And then he called the convention in May,
1858 and Canada Chatham,

575
00:40:34.921 --> 00:40:39.570
Ontario,
to which he invited abolitionist now black and white,

576
00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:45.120
and it was to be a recruiting convention to recruit the men who would become

577
00:40:45.121 --> 00:40:47.940
part of his abolitionist army.

578
00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.660
Now the problem here with John Brown,
for everybody who met him,

579
00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.460
including Douglas,

580
00:40:53.461 --> 00:40:57.000
who may have known more about the harpers ferry plans in anybody alive,

581
00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:00.060
the problem was he was so secret,

582
00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:03.960
he would never tell people the details of what he was doing,

583
00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:07.560
who he was actually hiring

584
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:15.770
46 so cold delegates,
one to this Chatham Convention,
13 of them white,

585
00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:17.000
the rest of them blank.

586
00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:23.000
Most of the people attending it were fugitive slaves living in Canada who had

587
00:41:23.001 --> 00:41:24.830
escaped slavery in the United States,

588
00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:27.950
many of whom still had family back in the south.

589
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:32.630
Here was a man in the midst of this political crisis going on in the country.

590
00:41:32.631 --> 00:41:34.490
This is 50 is 1958 now,

591
00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.033
who is saying,

592
00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:42.490
I'm going to lead you back into the south and we're going to get your families

593
00:41:42.491 --> 00:41:47.110
out.
He lacked money.

594
00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:53.110
He had hired an unreliable drill master,
a guy named Hugh Forbes,

595
00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.390
an English soldier of fortune,

596
00:41:55.391 --> 00:42:00.391
who'd been off in Italy in the late forties and early 1850s kind of,

597
00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:02.020
uh,

598
00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:06.460
soldiering as a soldier of fortune and Garrett with Garibaldi in the Italian

599
00:42:06.461 --> 00:42:11.110
revolution.
But it turns out it wasn't very reliable.

600
00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:18.050
He got involved with a so called secret six of New England abolitionist time.

601
00:42:20.191 --> 00:42:22.350
Doesn't really allow me to tell you everything about him,

602
00:42:22.351 --> 00:42:23.970
but they were Franklin Sandborne.

603
00:42:23.971 --> 00:42:27.060
Tom Is one where the Higgins and Theodore Parker,
Samuel Gridley,

604
00:42:27.061 --> 00:42:31.230
how George Luther Sterns,
Garret Smith and others,
prominent,
powerful,

605
00:42:31.231 --> 00:42:34.380
and in one case,
rich white,

606
00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:38.460
New England and northern abolitionist who supported him.

607
00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:43.990
<v 1>Okay.</v>

608
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:47.470
<v 0>And then Brian went back out to Kansas that winter of 58</v>

609
00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:49.640
<v 1>okay.</v>

610
00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:54.200
<v 0>And in December of 58 with a band of about 13 men,</v>

611
00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:58.910
you want to cross the Kansas border in the Missouri dead of winter,

612
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:03.230
he attacked three farms,

613
00:43:03.231 --> 00:43:07.040
or I suppose you could call them small plantations in Missouri

614
00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:13.840
where he sees the 11 slaves killed one of the owners.

615
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:15.760
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

616
00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:19.000
<v 0>And then went back across the border into Kansas and hid out for a while.</v>

617
00:43:19.001 --> 00:43:22.780
And the debt of January,
1859

618
00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:24.940
<v 1>okay.</v>

619
00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:26.570
<v 0>How long?
Pottawatomie creek.</v>

620
00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:32.040
And then he engaged in an 82 day winter time,

621
00:43:32.041 --> 00:43:37.041
trek of over 1000 miles with these 11 freed slaves from Kansas North into

622
00:43:39.001 --> 00:43:43.620
Nebraska,
then into Iowa and to Grinnell,
Iowa,

623
00:43:43.621 --> 00:43:47.370
by the way,
also settled by New England abolitionists.
And in Grinnell,
Iowa,

624
00:43:47.371 --> 00:43:49.620
he was given a key to the city by a mayor

625
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:56.870
and in Grinnell where the,
the railroad had reached as far as Grinnell,
Iowa,

626
00:43:56.871 --> 00:43:59.740
they put them all in a boxcar special box car.

627
00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:01.230
<v 1>Okay.</v>

628
00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:06.230
<v 0>And they rode by train all the way to Chicago and then all the way to Detroit.</v>

629
00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:12.000
And on the 12th of March,

630
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.000
1859 it was a remarkable scene on the Detroit River as John Brown ushered these

631
00:44:19.051 --> 00:44:24.051
11 freed slaves from Missouri across the river into Canada.

632
00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:25.711
But at this point,

633
00:44:25.711 --> 00:44:30.711
there was a 12th a baby had been born in the boxcar and mother had named him

634
00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.380
John Brown Daniels.

635
00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:41.130
So less we think this guy was
only a lunatic.

636
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.660
This was the real thing.
It freaks some slaves.

637
00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:50.460
And he had carted them all across the northern states in the dead of winter

638
00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:54.323
to their freedom.

639
00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:59.970
To the extent he had a messianic image sense of himself as a Moses,

640
00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:03.510
actually his greatest heroes,
Oliver Cromwell.

641
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:08.450
If you know anything about the English civil war and the puritan armies makes

642
00:45:08.451 --> 00:45:12.210
sense.
It was based on something.

643
00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:16.320
Now I only have a few minutes.

644
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:22.610
The Radon Harper's ferry would have actually happened a bit earlier.

645
00:45:22.611 --> 00:45:26.420
It would have happened in the summer of 1859 had he been able to pull everything

646
00:45:26.421 --> 00:45:30.960
together and get everybody to gather.
Uh,

647
00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:34.130
and in the end,

648
00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:39.910
it is one of those sad and tragic stories that then takes on a much,

649
00:45:41.391 --> 00:45:45.050
much larger meaning than anyone could have ever predicted.

650
00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:47.210
It's so called provisional army.

651
00:45:47.211 --> 00:45:51.290
That's what he called for his provisional constitution for his provisional new

652
00:45:51.291 --> 00:45:55.520
Virginia would ultimately be about 22 men.

653
00:45:57.410 --> 00:46:01.460
He rented a farm five miles north of harpers ferry in Maryland,

654
00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:04.220
where they're were all together that summer.

655
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:07.730
He wanted Frederick Douglass to join him.

656
00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:10.160
He actually had met Harriet Tubman in Canada.

657
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:15.080
He tried to convince Harriet Tubman did join him.
He'd heard of her legend,

658
00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:21.710
but she was a little too smart for this.
She'd done this stuff.

659
00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:25.250
She had more experience and your friends' lives and getting them out then

660
00:46:25.251 --> 00:46:28.970
anybody.
And she apparently said in effect,

661
00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:33.860
no thanks.
He desperately wanted Douglas to join him.

662
00:46:33.861 --> 00:46:35.000
And how'd he joined him?

663
00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:41.490
Douglas would have been dead in 1859 but Douglas did have a final meeting with

664
00:46:42.711 --> 00:46:47.600
John Brown at an old stone query outside of Chambersburg,
Pennsylvania.

665
00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:50.990
And late August of 1859,

666
00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:55.950
he went down from New York.
Well,

667
00:46:55.951 --> 00:46:58.580
the fugitive slave Douglass had helped to his freedom.

668
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:04.460
Name Shields Green.
Here's shields.
Where is he?

669
00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:08.000
There he is.
Douglas took him along.

670
00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:11.720
They met at this old stone querying and Douglass his testimony.

671
00:47:11.721 --> 00:47:13.310
They had a long conversation.

672
00:47:13.311 --> 00:47:18.311
Brown tried one last time to talk Douglas into coming with me and Douglas and

673
00:47:18.471 --> 00:47:22.070
his recollection famously said,
I can't do it.

674
00:47:23.330 --> 00:47:26.360
You're going to be trapped in a how's he put it?

675
00:47:26.361 --> 00:47:30.700
You're going to be surrounded in a trap of steel.
You will never get out,

676
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:35.800
but if you must go,
go.
And then he said,
does shields green your call,

677
00:47:35.801 --> 00:47:37.450
your choice?
Well,
it turns off.

678
00:47:37.451 --> 00:47:40.840
Shields Green was a fugitive slave from Virginia.

679
00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:45.940
His wife was still in Virginia.
He said,
I,
according to Douglas,

680
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.710
I think I'll go with the old man.

681
00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:53.260
And shields did and he'll die.
At Harper's ferry.

682
00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:58.600
There were five black men.
Finally who join John Brown's raid,

683
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:04.510
Osborn,
Terry Anderson,
Dangerfield,
newbie shields,
green,

684
00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:07.150
John Copeland,
Louis Leary,

685
00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:10.240
two of them were Oberlin college graduates.

686
00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:15.880
Three of them were former fugitive slaves.
Dangerfield.

687
00:48:15.881 --> 00:48:19.660
Newbie had a letter in his pocket from his wife

688
00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:24.570
in Virginia when he died at Harper's ferry.

689
00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:28.950
The plan simply put so far as we know,

690
00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:35.910
what's the attack?
Harper's ferry,
take the federal arsenal and begin if he could,

691
00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:40.660
to escape into the mountains.
The of,
you know,

692
00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:43.620
the Blue Ridge mountains on either side of harpers ferry

693
00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:50.210
to establish mountain hideaways to try things from those hideaways to get slaves

694
00:48:52.321 --> 00:48:54.390
to escape into his lines,

695
00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:59.780
to arm them and then to begin as a guerrilla warrior to selectively attack sites

696
00:49:02.521 --> 00:49:04.770
in northern Virginia.
Moving on Richmond.

697
00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:07.890
Now I say to the extent we understand it,

698
00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:13.250
cause he didn't leave us much to go on in terms of what his actual plan was.

699
00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:17.970
What we do know is the rate only lasted 48 hours.

700
00:49:18.930 --> 00:49:20.670
They never got out of harpers ferry.

701
00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:25.380
He did free about a dozen slaves in the surrounding countryside,

702
00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:28.920
brought them into the old fire engine house of the Federal Arsenal.

703
00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:33.920
The harpers ferry hit out and the news sprung across the country.

704
00:49:34.501 --> 00:49:37.080
Like news had never spread in the United States.

705
00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:42.480
Partly because John Brown's first major strategic mistake or tactical mistake

706
00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:45.900
was it the Manaca.
See Railroad came through Harper's ferry,

707
00:49:45.901 --> 00:49:50.000
right as he was entering the town,
they stopped the train.

708
00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:54.290
The first casualty was a free black watchmen on that train and was shot by one

709
00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:57.810
of Brown's men.
Then Brown within two hours,
let the train go.

710
00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:03.740
Dom Conductor of the train at the next town wired Washington and said,

711
00:50:05.161 --> 00:50:08.100
one man and 200 men are attacking Harper's ferry.

712
00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:11.100
By the time it reached Buchanan's desk in the White House,

713
00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.980
it was 500 men attacking Harper's ferry

714
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:17.130
and within 24 hours,

715
00:50:17.131 --> 00:50:21.510
Buchanan order to contingent of US Marines under the command of Robert E.

716
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:26.280
Lee and a lieutenant named Jeb Stewart to get to Harper's ferry as fast as

717
00:50:26.281 --> 00:50:28.640
possible and crush the slave insurrection,

718
00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:32.270
which they did.

719
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:39.320
Now I'm going to leave you there.
In this situation,

720
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:41.690
Brown was captured

721
00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:48.340
all but two or three of his men were killed or captured and all those captured

722
00:50:48.471 --> 00:50:53.420
will be hung.
One of his sons,
Owen Browne,
did manage to escape

723
00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:57.110
what ensued at Harper's ferry for 24 hours.

724
00:50:57.111 --> 00:51:00.380
It was an absolute pitch battle between the towns,
people,
local militias,

725
00:51:00.381 --> 00:51:04.640
and Brown's men and many towns.
People were killed.

726
00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:07.820
I want Brown would escape,

727
00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:13.780
eventually move as far as far away as he possibly could and live on a little

728
00:51:14.031 --> 00:51:17.000
desert farm up above Pasadena,
California.

729
00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.120
Halfway up the San Gabriel mountains,

730
00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:25.900
most of the rest of his life trying to escape the infamy of his father's legacy.

731
00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:32.950
Brown was captured in the engine house.

732
00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:36.910
They tried to run him through with a sword.
They beat him over the head.

733
00:51:36.911 --> 00:51:40.030
They bloodied him up.
But there's the story goes,

734
00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:44.230
he was saved by huge brass belt buckle he had and they kept stabbing at him and

735
00:51:44.231 --> 00:51:45.910
I kept hitting the brass belt buckle.

736
00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:52.680
He's captured,
put in jail in Charles town,
Virginia,

737
00:51:52.681 --> 00:51:54.270
just four miles up the road.

738
00:51:56.280 --> 00:52:00.780
And in November,
1859,
he would get the most famous,

739
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:02.010
uh,

740
00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:06.900
sensational trial that the United States had ever seen.

741
00:52:07.530 --> 00:52:12.030
I'm going to leave you there because it's the John Brown hanging in execution

742
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:17.150
and the aftermath that is the most important template of that election year of

743
00:52:19.411 --> 00:52:22.350
1860.
Soon to come.
