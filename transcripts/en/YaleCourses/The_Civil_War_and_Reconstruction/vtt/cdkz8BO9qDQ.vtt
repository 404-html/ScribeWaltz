1
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.350
I want to start with the

2
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.180
what many Americans therefore do with it.

3
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.500
Some of you in this room may have grown up civil war buffs like I did.

4
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.480
I confess there millions of civil war tourists.

5
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.860
It has this enduring the military history in particular.

6
00:00:32.861 --> 00:00:37.861
The battle history has an enduring eternal hole on our imagination,

7
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.320
but this is a first for me.
I just got this email,

8
00:00:44.321 --> 00:00:49.321
well a couple of weeks ago from a woman named Nicky Blackburn in Charleston,

9
00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:53.530
South Carolina has her photograph on it.

10
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.300
She's a real estate agent,
a pretty real estate agent,

11
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.840
and she wanted me to know as a civil war historian
did,

12
00:01:04.841 --> 00:01:09.010
she and her firm have put a 24 hour web cam

13
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.890
on the Calhoun,

14
00:01:11.891 --> 00:01:15.970
mentioned near Battery Park on the Cooper Law.

15
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.280
I was a Calhoun mansion near Battery Park and Lower Charleston and which looks

16
00:01:21.341 --> 00:01:25.060
out directly on the fort Sumpter a mile away

17
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.560
so that you can dial up on the Internet and watch Fort Sumpter 24 hours a day.

18
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.563
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

19
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.950
<v 0>Um,
I've experienced a wide variety of</v>

20
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.700
bizarre phenomena

21
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.660
about the civil war with reenactors.

22
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.850
It's sites and so on and so on and so on.
And when you're on CSPAN,

23
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.890
if you're on cspan enough,
believe me,

24
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.240
you get every kind of late night.

25
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.580
Crazy American writing too.

26
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.340
But that's the first 24 hours when Cam Fort Sumpter,

27
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.700
I don't know what the hell you're supposed to see.

28
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.933
<v 1>Okay.</v>

29
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.430
<v 0>Maybe they're ghost of confederates that come out at night and if they have the</v>

30
00:02:21.681 --> 00:02:25.760
right kind of night vision,
God,
I don't know,

31
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.920
but she's serious.
I'm sorry.
All right.

32
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.293
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

33
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.160
<v 0>In 1863</v>

34
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.170
on the beautiful,
um,

35
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.250
little hilltop cemetery and the south edge of the town of Gettysburg,

36
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.960
Pennsylvania,
small,
sleepy town,

37
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.080
large population of German,
a couple of little shoe factories,

38
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.900
a crossroads town market town.

39
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.140
They had a cemetery in this beautiful setting

40
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.490
and over the archway or,

41
00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:16.491
or as part of the archway into that cemetery that would soon become famous.

42
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.130
There was a sign that read quote,

43
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.270
all persons found using firearms on these grounds will be prosecuted within the

44
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:30.880
utmost rigor of the law.

45
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.410
<v 1>Okay.</v>

46
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.950
<v 0>Irony makes the world go around the world.
Go around.</v>

47
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.560
Okay.
Today,
I want to take up with you

48
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.740
at least the beginnings of the question of confederate defeat and union victory.

49
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.450
Hold on.
A focus in particular on battle fronts.

50
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.330
There are numerous reasons,
explanations,

51
00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.340
a terp causal interpretations for confederate defeat in union victory that have

52
00:04:01.161 --> 00:04:04.180
flowed fourth and civil wars scholarship for years.

53
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.490
And we began to have a new kind of heated argument about it,
at least in books,

54
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.930
um,

55
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.990
about 10 years ago in part because of a series of two books by historians name

56
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.770
Hattaway in Beringer they wrote two big tomes.

57
00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:24.610
One was entitled why the North won the civil war and the other was entitled why

58
00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:28.000
the South lost the civil war,
not very subtle titles.

59
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.930
And they were the ones who posited,
uh,

60
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.520
more than anyone ever had before in a much more sophisticated way.

61
00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:37.630
And I want to come back to that.

62
00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:42.631
And it's part of exactly what's at stake in these two wonderful books you're

63
00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:47.530
reading or have read or are about to read by Drew Faust and Gary Gallagher.

64
00:04:47.531 --> 00:04:51.610
Gallagher is confederate war and the mothers of invention take up this question

65
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.130
of the so called loss of will.

66
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.920
Did the south lose the civil war because it ultimately lost its will to sustain

67
00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:01.654
the fight.

68
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.390
There are many sides to that argument and I'll take it up in a moment.

69
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.363
I want to do,

70
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.860
I don't know what's happening in my sound.

71
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.390
It's your son.
It's too high.

72
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.030
Turn it down.
How about that?
How's that in the back row?

73
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.660
All right,
good.
Well anyway,

74
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.670
the civil wars we've said many times is the first great photograph,

75
00:05:35.671 --> 00:05:39.240
Divan of American history.
The thousands of photographs.

76
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.410
We didn't had thousands more if people hadn't destroyed so many of them.

77
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.990
And of course Ken Burns is film series,

78
00:05:45.991 --> 00:05:50.880
is in part in great part reliant on those photographs.

79
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.050
And he and his camera man,
of course they've cameras now.

80
00:05:55.051 --> 00:06:00.051
They can take right inside almost these old the girl types and 10 types and,

81
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.880
and make them live in ways that,
uh,
they didn't at the time.

82
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.800
But that's an image of soldiers at the front smoking a pipe,

83
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.370
petting his dog.
It's an officer whose wife has come to the front.

84
00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:18.371
Of course it's winter quarters and you're cold pepper courthouse,

85
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.690
Virginia 1863

86
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.680
<v 2>okay.</v>

87
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.000
<v 0>They always built these cabins with these chimneys.</v>

88
00:06:27.001 --> 00:06:30.510
They will thousands of these with barrels on top.

89
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:32.820
Those are their chimneys.

90
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.740
Since I've been discussing this question,
the mobilization there many,

91
00:06:38.741 --> 00:06:43.741
many images in the war from the war that show this kind of industrial might have

92
00:06:43.901 --> 00:06:44.501
the north.

93
00:06:44.501 --> 00:06:49.501
There's incredible photographs of the James River landings in Virginia by 1864

94
00:06:50.561 --> 00:06:52.660
and just as far as the horizon can see,

95
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.790
supplies materiel piled up all over the wars.

96
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.770
This is an image in Virginia of the wagon trains of the Potomac army of the

97
00:07:02.771 --> 00:07:06.940
Potomac by 1864 thousands of wagons.

98
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.600
This is mobilization for total war

99
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.240
and I just for the sake of reality,

100
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:21.250
want to show that also photographers like Matthew Brady and Alexander Gardner

101
00:07:21.821 --> 00:07:23.620
and their troops of photographers.

102
00:07:23.621 --> 00:07:27.610
It was Gardner in particular who went to Gettysburg after the battle of

103
00:07:27.611 --> 00:07:32.470
Gettysburg and photograph so many of them.
So many of the dead.

104
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.570
This is a soldier,
a union soldier killed at Gettysburg.

105
00:07:37.571 --> 00:07:40.570
It became a kind of macabre fascination,

106
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:46.320
especially in the north where these photographs were often displayed publicly.

107
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:51.810
Brady first started doing it in 62 and early 63 enhance that famous comment by

108
00:07:53.531 --> 00:07:55.750
believe,
um,

109
00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:02.340
George Templeton strong who said it was Brady who brought the war into people's

110
00:08:02.861 --> 00:08:03.694
homes,

111
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:09.150
into their living rooms if they went to witness these photographs.

112
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:13.600
Now more on that,
perhaps at the end,

113
00:08:13.601 --> 00:08:18.340
but go back with me now to this question of union victory confederate defeat.

114
00:08:18.341 --> 00:08:19.450
We're not going to end the war to there.

115
00:08:19.451 --> 00:08:24.451
That's next week and we're going to take the war today through 80 and 63 and

116
00:08:24.551 --> 00:08:28.930
major military turning points where you can begin to make an argument from this

117
00:08:28.931 --> 00:08:32.020
point forward.
From this point forward,

118
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:35.980
it would be very difficult for the confederacy to win,
although not impossible.

119
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:40.420
As we'll see in 1864 now on any list,

120
00:08:40.421 --> 00:08:43.390
and I'm going to just give you a list out front and then we'll kind of take up

121
00:08:43.391 --> 00:08:44.224
some of them,

122
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:49.390
but on any list of why they went north winds and why the south loses,
of course,

123
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:54.630
are these elements one resources and numbers goes without saying,

124
00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:57.933
you know,

125
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.790
a world of war that is becoming more industrialized,

126
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:06.420
more modern in it's a weaponry and it's um,

127
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.160
to some extent it's tactics.

128
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.760
Although that's one of the reasons of course casualties.

129
00:09:11.761 --> 00:09:16.761
In this war we're so ghastly because they were fighting with much more modern

130
00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:17.994
weapons,

131
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:23.100
repeating rifles and of course the rifled muskets that could actually hit

132
00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:28.020
something at 800 yards and could be deadly at two to 300 yards.

133
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:31.140
Think of that two to 300 yards.

134
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.440
You could hit something and see it,

135
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.090
but they were fighting with old tactics line upon line,

136
00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:43.710
shoulder to shoulder double ranks.
If a front of the rank fell,

137
00:09:43.711 --> 00:09:47.010
the second rank was supposed to be there and there were supposed to have loaded

138
00:09:47.011 --> 00:09:50.760
their rifles in time to be up front while the ones that went back and reload it

139
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:55.761
again and an a veteran soldier in this war could load his muzzle loader a you

140
00:09:57.481 --> 00:09:58.111
have the load,

141
00:09:58.111 --> 00:10:03.111
the mini ball and the cap back here and then with your ramrod a veteran soldier

142
00:10:03.571 --> 00:10:08.571
could do that without pressure about three times a minute because under the

143
00:10:09.271 --> 00:10:14.130
pressure of about them being shot at and the cacophony of sound and terror and

144
00:10:14.131 --> 00:10:15.630
fear soldier went through.

145
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:20.930
Sometimes it couldn't perform that and all over battlefields and this war they

146
00:10:21.661 --> 00:10:25.620
would find dead soldiers sometimes with a rifle they had loaded three and four

147
00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:28.030
times and never fired it.

148
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.860
They just kept loading but sort of lose their minds.

149
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:37.730
But in a war that is now foot with such weaponry and it's going to depend on

150
00:10:39.391 --> 00:10:40.560
industrial production,

151
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.030
there is an argument that this war was won by the north and the shoe factories

152
00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:48.450
of Lowell,
Massachusetts or the gun factories of new haven.

153
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
The gun factors is Springfield mass and the sheer productive Kapow or on those

154
00:10:54.481 --> 00:10:58.380
railroads of the north,
which was so much better,

155
00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.320
more efficient than the railroads of the south.

156
00:11:01.321 --> 00:11:05.550
There's certainly an argument for that now.

157
00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.980
Uh,
that handwriting was on the wall from the beginning of the war.

158
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:16.230
I'm in the lovely old book that David Donald did.
One's called why the north one,

159
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.030
he quotes on the first page of the book,
a newspaper in Lynchburg,
Virginia.

160
00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.530
Some are 1861 battle of bull run hasn't even happened yet.

161
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:30.660
And all this fury for war,
the editor of the Lynchburg,

162
00:11:30.661 --> 00:11:35.661
Virginia and wrote quote dependent upon Europe and the north for almost every

163
00:11:36.391 --> 00:11:41.391
yard of cloth and every coat and boots and hats that we wear for our axes,

164
00:11:42.811 --> 00:11:45.930
sides,
tubs and buckets.
In short,

165
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.510
for everything except our bread and meat,

166
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:52.950
it must occur to the south that if our relations with the north are ever,

167
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:58.090
we should,
they'd already been severed.
We should in all of the south,

168
00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:02.980
not be able to close ourselves.
We could not fill our firesides plow,

169
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:05.980
our fields and our Mo,
our meadows.
In fact,

170
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:11.190
we should be reduced to a state more abject than we are willing to look at even

171
00:12:11.261 --> 00:12:16.180
prospectively.
And yet all these things staring us in the face.

172
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.840
We shut her eyes and we go in blind fold.

173
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.870
Man,
was that prescient?

174
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:27.190
One of the most remarkable facts about the American civil war and Jane's

175
00:12:27.191 --> 00:12:30.400
Macpherson makes a big deal of this and battle cry of freedom over and over,

176
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:35.770
is that despite their lack of this product to industrial productivity in

177
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:37.210
relation to the north,

178
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:42.310
it is amazing how long the south held out an amazing,

179
00:12:42.311 --> 00:12:47.311
how close they actually came to winning their version or definition of victory.

180
00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:54.090
The North had more banking,
more labor capacity,

181
00:12:54.091 --> 00:12:59.091
everything to an argument has always been made that the north in the end had

182
00:13:01.951 --> 00:13:06.930
superior political leadership.
I,
he,
Abraham Lincoln,

183
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.780
now lock can be made of this.

184
00:13:09.781 --> 00:13:13.890
And a lot has been made of this and book after book comparing Lincoln with
Davis.

185
00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.780
Um,
and there's no question that as an executive,
as a leader,

186
00:13:18.781 --> 00:13:23.290
as a politician,
as a manipulator of people,
uh,

187
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.260
for in terms of an acumen,

188
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:30.240
even a genius for politics and organization.

189
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.240
Abraham Lincoln is about as good as we've ever had.

190
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.730
Jefferson Davis on the other hand,

191
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.380
a smart and brilliant man that he was a long military career,

192
00:13:40.381 --> 00:13:42.000
long service in the Senate,

193
00:13:42.001 --> 00:13:46.590
the war department and all else was nevertheless not a very good executive.

194
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:52.370
He always had one foot sort of tied in the states rights tradition

195
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:59.630
and that other foot now really where his soul was by 1860260360 four wasn't

196
00:14:01.261 --> 00:14:05.540
trying to create a nation,
a centralized nation state,

197
00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:09.690
doing all the things that the stays rights tradition said he should not,

198
00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:13.630
he was not in the end,

199
00:14:13.631 --> 00:14:17.890
a great war president and impart some have argued because he would have

200
00:14:17.891 --> 00:14:22.000
preferred to be on the battlefield and not in an executive's role.

201
00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:27.490
He listened to those generals who were his friends and didn't tend to listen to

202
00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:32.450
those who were not.
He often made um,

203
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:37.650
sort of leadership mistakes such as the time he personally went out west.

204
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:44.040
I'll come to that in a moment during the just before the great campaign for

205
00:14:44.861 --> 00:14:49.861
Chattanooga in late summer and then the fall of 1863 for,

206
00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:55.060
for the possession of this terribly important strategic crossroads in South East

207
00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:57.771
Tennessee,

208
00:14:57.771 --> 00:15:02.030
the sort of gateway into the deep South crossroads of two Great Southern Rivers,

209
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.870
crossroads of the two main east,
west southern railroads and so on.

210
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:10.880
He goes out there in the wake of the fall of Chattanooga when Braxton brags
army,

211
00:15:10.881 --> 00:15:15.881
it had to retreat south and he goes to the whole journey that been terrible.

212
00:15:16.161 --> 00:15:21.020
Dissension in that confederate army.
They all the generals want to brag,

213
00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:24.890
fired and Davis goes up,
goes out personally to the camp,

214
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.180
gathers all the generals around with bread,

215
00:15:27.181 --> 00:15:30.500
standing there and asked all the other generals whether they thought they should

216
00:15:30.501 --> 00:15:34.920
have a new commander
and to a man.

217
00:15:34.921 --> 00:15:39.390
They basically all said yes in front of their commander and then Davis

218
00:15:39.391 --> 00:15:44.170
reappointed him.
It was one of the most bizarre decisions of the war.

219
00:15:44.171 --> 00:15:45.940
Brag,
Brag was a disaster.

220
00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:50.050
But this is the sort of thing that [inaudible] Davis and Brag went back years

221
00:15:50.051 --> 00:15:54.610
and they were old friends and Emmy Davis made some strange decisions.

222
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:59.350
But Davis also with handicapped tremendously politically by the state's rights

223
00:15:59.351 --> 00:16:01.060
tradition.
And I would argue one other thing,

224
00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:05.530
and it's really a third reason you can put on this long list of why the north is

225
00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:06.700
going to win this war.

226
00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:13.000
The North had an existing political culture,

227
00:16:13.001 --> 00:16:16.000
it had an existing political party system.

228
00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:20.290
And we can argue that that political parties isn't,
was greatly divided.

229
00:16:20.291 --> 00:16:25.291
And it was by 63 you've got what are called Peace Democrats.

230
00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:30.010
The Democratic Party in the north is beginning to argue for a negotiated peace

231
00:16:30.011 --> 00:16:34.090
and end of the war,
a divided America,
confederate states of America,

232
00:16:34.091 --> 00:16:35.110
United States of America.

233
00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:39.160
And in 1864 they're gonna run it in Mcclellan on that camp,
on that platform.

234
00:16:39.161 --> 00:16:42.640
And we'll talk about how pivotal this 64 election was next week.

235
00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:47.500
But you had an existing party system that could organize politics,

236
00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.950
they could organize descent,
that could channel opposition.

237
00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:56.710
And it also gave Abraham Lincoln the Cudgel or the,
the,
the,
the,

238
00:16:56.711 --> 00:16:58.240
the whip of partisanship.

239
00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.960
He could build enough of a coalition to sustain not only the war effort,

240
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:09.630
but also to pull off some of that remarkable legislation that I started to talk

241
00:17:09.701 --> 00:17:11.920
about last time.
Um,

242
00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.270
especially economic legislation that really in some ways for a while at least

243
00:17:16.271 --> 00:17:19.900
transform,
uh,
the American central government.

244
00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:23.913
Fourth,

245
00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:28.540
one of the principal reasons the north is going to win this war is that it does

246
00:17:28.541 --> 00:17:31.840
ultimately through some remarkable diplomacy,

247
00:17:31.841 --> 00:17:34.360
especially by Charles Francis Adams in London,

248
00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:39.490
the u s ambassador to Great Britain,
grandson of John Adams,

249
00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:44.640
son of John Quincy.
The fact that in the end,

250
00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:50.330
the union government succeeds and keeping Great Britain extensibly out of the

251
00:17:50.551 --> 00:17:54.750
war,
at least militarily,
mostly out of the war,

252
00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.940
is absolutely crucial to union victory.
Had Britain had,

253
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.330
had Lee wanted to Antidem just this is what macpherson means.

254
00:18:03.331 --> 00:18:07.580
And many other historians are really doing this before Jim was,
but,
but he's,

255
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:11.130
he's made it his own argument that you can't understand you and in veteran

256
00:18:11.131 --> 00:18:14.490
confederate defeat without dealing with all kinds of contingencies,

257
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.660
moments in the war.
If this hadn't happened in,
that can't happen.

258
00:18:18.661 --> 00:18:21.360
If that doesn't happen,
then that can't happen.
And so,
so,
you know,

259
00:18:21.361 --> 00:18:24.960
putting your eggs in any one basket to explain this or for that matter,

260
00:18:24.961 --> 00:18:26.550
anything in history is bad idea.

261
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.880
But one of those contingencies is if Lee winds at Antietam succeeds and moving

262
00:18:32.791 --> 00:18:36.780
further into the north threatens northern cities and the British government

263
00:18:36.781 --> 00:18:41.670
formally recognize the confederacy and formally sent British troops to fight

264
00:18:41.671 --> 00:18:46.671
with the confederacy rather than just in a sense sending them a shadow navy,

265
00:18:47.611 --> 00:18:52.611
which was helping the confederacy and building them ships could have had a very

266
00:18:52.741 --> 00:18:54.150
different outcome to this war.

267
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:59.450
If the United States that had to fight a second front in Canada against the

268
00:19:01.621 --> 00:19:05.370
British,
just imagine the possible outcomes.

269
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:10.950
So very important factor.

270
00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.560
Fifth much has always been made about the,
the,

271
00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.790
the so-called in the end,

272
00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:21.750
superior military leadership of the north in the end.

273
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:27.590
And we'll deal with this much more next week and a little bit today on grant and

274
00:19:27.601 --> 00:19:30.720
Sherman and Sheridan and,
and,
and,

275
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:36.860
and General Thomas and a few others actually finally become the principal

276
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:42.590
leaders of this entire ultimately coordinated west and east strategic effort

277
00:19:44.071 --> 00:19:46.350
against the south.
You can argue,

278
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.080
although I think too much is often made of this.

279
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:54.530
You can argue that in some ways grant won the war and there are books that

280
00:19:54.841 --> 00:19:55.890
literally argue that,

281
00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:01.110
that want to give grant in so many ways,
credit,

282
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:06.480
um,
for union victory.
And that will argue,

283
00:20:06.481 --> 00:20:10.560
and I'll come back to this next week,
that in some ways is great.
As Robert E.

284
00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.240
Lee was as a battlefield commander,

285
00:20:12.241 --> 00:20:17.241
as daring and as he was the risk that he took the ability he had to somehow see

286
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:22.680
a terrain to see land,
to uh,

287
00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:27.600
to see the possibilities of a landscape and how to move huge numbers of men

288
00:20:27.601 --> 00:20:28.434
through it.

289
00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:33.890
And the way that he could inspire through a quite amazing level of charisma,

290
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.930
his offer or his,
his officer's staff.

291
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:41.550
There's a lot to the fact that Robert [inaudible] himself had a lot to do with

292
00:20:41.551 --> 00:20:44.550
sustaining the confederate war effort as long as it lasted.

293
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:48.250
And Gary Gallagher is going to make a pretty big deal of that in your book

294
00:20:48.251 --> 00:20:49.240
confederate war.

295
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:55.290
It's just worth remembering that Gallagher's source set by and large is the

296
00:20:57.101 --> 00:21:01.210
officer corps of Lee's army.
Uh,
it's a fine book,

297
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.290
but you've got to remember what were his sources are coming from.

298
00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.370
These are Lee's lieutenants that he's quoting over and over and over,

299
00:21:09.371 --> 00:21:14.080
and they became about as loyal to a military commander as anyone has ever been

300
00:21:14.081 --> 00:21:15.130
in American history.

301
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:20.280
And then six or whatever number I'm on,

302
00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.570
and we've dealt with this a good deal already.
We'll come back to it later.

303
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.210
The policy of emancipation,

304
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.840
the trans formation of this war into far beyond its original limited aims into a

305
00:21:34.801 --> 00:21:37.530
war that will become a war of conquest,

306
00:21:37.531 --> 00:21:42.531
a wars Lincoln to comes to define it in late 62 and it's absolutely clear in 63

307
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:48.800
has to be a war to the ultimate aim of the unconditional surrender of the south,

308
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.390
which means a war on their resources,
on their society,

309
00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:59.010
on their transportation systems,
and on slavery,

310
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.390
their labor system,

311
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:05.630
their greatest source of wealth and wore on the cities.

312
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.320
There are people,
or as Sherman will say,

313
00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:13.470
he wanted to make Georgia howl.

314
00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.610
All right.
No,
that's a short list.

315
00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.960
Now fold into that this theory,

316
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:29.660
it's a theory that in the end you add all this up,
resources,

317
00:22:29.661 --> 00:22:32.930
political leadership,
military leadership,
the policy of unconditional surrender,

318
00:22:32.931 --> 00:22:35.810
emancipation and keeping Great Britain out of the war,

319
00:22:35.811 --> 00:22:40.520
diplomacy and so on and so on.
Um,
and battlefield victories,

320
00:22:40.521 --> 00:22:44.480
as I'll point out in the second,
you get this argument for the loss of morale,

321
00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:47.630
loss of will.
Now,

322
00:22:47.631 --> 00:22:50.870
this was fashioned by his story and his really who cut their teeth in the

323
00:22:50.871 --> 00:22:51.890
Vietnam era,

324
00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.910
and they argued that there are plenty of examples throughout history of

325
00:22:55.911 --> 00:23:00.890
insurgencies,
like the confederacy.
That's what it was.
It's the big one.

326
00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:06.440
It's not just a little gorilla army pecking away at a,
you know,
oil lines.

327
00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:11.150
But they argued that the many cases in history and the most obvious one in the

328
00:23:11.151 --> 00:23:15.320
1970s and eighties to Americans was north Vietnam,

329
00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:18.740
which held out for a generation,

330
00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:24.460
really two generations against the French empire and then against the United

331
00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:27.380
States of America,
the biggest military machine in the world.

332
00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:33.340
They lost three and a half million people and they won.

333
00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:40.450
So suddenly through that experience,
through those eyes,
some American historians,

334
00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.740
we're going to look back at the civil war and say,
you know what?
Whoa,

335
00:23:42.741 --> 00:23:45.570
wait a minute here.
You know,

336
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:49.760
why didn't the confederacy a hole out in longer?
Yeah,
there were bread riots.

337
00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:53.270
There was some starvation.
It was a hell of a lot of desertion.

338
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:58.220
But maybe that's telling us something.
In the end.

339
00:23:58.221 --> 00:24:02.210
It wasn't just Marcus Roberts,
Maurice Robert in his loyal men.

340
00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:06.410
It was the civilians behind the war.
It was the home front.

341
00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.191
This is what drew Faust.

342
00:24:07.191 --> 00:24:11.120
I went to all these women's diaries stretch to try to test and the argument

343
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:16.240
essentially is that the south didn't have a sufficient degree of nationalism

344
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:25.690
of an emotional psychological devotion to a historic nation state that they

345
00:24:30.501 --> 00:24:35.300
would do anything to save and preserve in the ways,

346
00:24:35.301 --> 00:24:39.380
let's say that the Germans did to the absolute bitter end against the Russians

347
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:45.070
and the allies on the western front and the Second World War barons in Hato.

348
00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.820
I love the example of Paraguay.
I,
you know,

349
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:50.960
nobody knows anything about the story of Paraguay in the way it held out against

350
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.360
Brazil.
I think it was a,

351
00:24:55.361 --> 00:24:59.230
it was an early 20th century example and then there've been other kinds of

352
00:24:59.231 --> 00:25:01.000
guerrilla insurgencies over the years.

353
00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:06.180
At the bottom of this argument was why didn't more confederate forces rather

354
00:25:06.671 --> 00:25:09.340
than surrender go off and form guerrilla bands?

355
00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:13.210
Why didn't the American civil war in the way so many civil wars in,

356
00:25:13.211 --> 00:25:18.211
they never quite end band of 20 men here and 300 they're going off into the

357
00:25:18.971 --> 00:25:23.971
hills supplying themselves somehow forming a kind of alternative insurgency that

358
00:25:27.251 --> 00:25:32.110
never quite die.
You read a lot of loss cars,
literature,

359
00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:35.390
the by the late 19th century and you would almost think that is what happened,

360
00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:37.333
but it didn't happen.

361
00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:44.040
Beringian Hattaway have also argued that that that in part the south,

362
00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:49.050
once it begins to lose the war in [inaudible] 63 and 64 that it was southern

363
00:25:49.051 --> 00:25:51.750
unionist that began to come to the fore,

364
00:25:51.751 --> 00:25:55.050
that there were large and there were large pockets of unionism,

365
00:25:55.051 --> 00:25:59.440
people who didn't really support the confederate war effort in western Virginia,

366
00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:03.240
western North Carolina,
eastern Tennessee,
upland,
Georgia,

367
00:26:03.241 --> 00:26:06.990
and those hills that Sherman's army begins to move through and discovers there's

368
00:26:06.991 --> 00:26:10.590
some white folk around who want to support him.
In fact,

369
00:26:10.591 --> 00:26:15.591
Sherman was much kinder to those Georgia whites then he was to those Georgia

370
00:26:15.811 --> 00:26:20.400
blacks who tried to gain freedom by coming to his army moron,

371
00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:22.350
Sherman's racism next week.

372
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:26.550
Now in the end,

373
00:26:26.551 --> 00:26:29.760
this is an argument that what the south lacked was a deep mystical,

374
00:26:29.761 --> 00:26:32.490
emotional level of nationalism.
Well that's been countered,

375
00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.610
that's been countered by numerous historian.
Uh,

376
00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:39.990
drew Faust is one of them in an earlier book called the creation of confederate

377
00:26:39.991 --> 00:26:42.970
nationalism.
Uh,

378
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:48.150
sh she's been joined or she actually joined a whole group of historians studying

379
00:26:48.151 --> 00:26:48.841
this Id.

380
00:26:48.841 --> 00:26:53.550
It's been one of the recurring fascinating questions about the civil war.

381
00:26:53.551 --> 00:26:58.551
And the question is essentially what kind of nationalism did the confederacy

382
00:26:59.521 --> 00:27:03.990
actually developed and frozen?
It only lasted for years.
I mean,

383
00:27:03.991 --> 00:27:04.741
the question really is,

384
00:27:04.741 --> 00:27:09.741
was there a confederate nation or were they just a band of states that came

385
00:27:10.291 --> 00:27:14.430
together in military defense of homeland?
Well,

386
00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:19.860
their arguments on all sides of this,
um,
and I'll just just say a couple things.

387
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:24.810
I think those,
the ends,
it's drew Faust is,
it's John mccartle,

388
00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:26.480
numerous historians.

389
00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:32.590
The weight of the best argument I think is that the south did indeed rather

390
00:27:32.591 --> 00:27:33.131
quickly.

391
00:27:33.131 --> 00:27:38.131
And is it a lot of lessons in this historically develop a serious level of this

392
00:27:39.191 --> 00:27:41.110
mystical kind of nationalism.

393
00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:46.350
They developed an ideology that they said their nation was based on.

394
00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:49.030
They said right up front at the beginning of the war,

395
00:27:49.031 --> 00:27:50.940
Jefferson Davis speech after speech after speech,

396
00:27:50.941 --> 00:27:55.620
he said the confederacy is the logical vessel of the American revolution.

397
00:27:55.621 --> 00:28:00.621
What the confederacy really was was the carry over of 1776 1861 with 1776 the

398
00:28:04.081 --> 00:28:07.590
George Washington,
they will argue was the founder of the confederacy.

399
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:08.940
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

400
00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:13.500
<v 0>The True American democracy was in this resistance to centralization.</v>

401
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.740
They created seals and songs and images in heroes and paintings,

402
00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:24.880
poetry all over the place.
They use religion.

403
00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:27.760
The same kind of millennial Christianity,

404
00:28:27.761 --> 00:28:32.380
the same kind of theory of a divine providence that northerners are praying too

405
00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:36.220
and arguing for is the same kind of millennialism the confederates are going to

406
00:28:36.221 --> 00:28:39.910
argue for.
They're going to say that they are the chosen nation.

407
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:42.943
<v 2>Okay.</v>

408
00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:46.550
<v 0>All over the place among southern clergy.</v>

409
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.200
That argument is put forth especially early in the war and then lastly,

410
00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.633
slavery.

411
00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:59.140
It is in some ways almost amazing how much southerners began to defend slavery

412
00:29:00.361 --> 00:29:03.750
and the ways they began to defend slavery during the war,

413
00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.600
and the ways that the big end to link it to their nation,

414
00:29:06.601 --> 00:29:10.140
the confederacy of how the confederacy was put into this world,

415
00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.230
to perfect slavery,
to improve it,

416
00:29:13.231 --> 00:29:17.790
to show the world that this slave society,
this system is biracial system.

417
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.610
We're one race is the labor and the other races,

418
00:29:20.611 --> 00:29:23.970
the educated to show the world the possibilities of that.

419
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:25.800
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

420
00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:30.800
<v 0>Even developed a whole variety of traveling confederate minstrel minstrel</v>

421
00:29:31.331 --> 00:29:35.740
groups.
Minstrelsy had been primarily a phenomenon of the north.

422
00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:40.210
Often the audiences were largely white working class,

423
00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:41.950
but the war,

424
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:47.040
suddenly you had these confederate troops of minstrels all over the place and

425
00:29:47.111 --> 00:29:50.730
new songs and new poems,
uh,
were,

426
00:29:50.731 --> 00:29:54.760
were written that were tied now to the sort of fade of the confederacy.

427
00:29:54.761 --> 00:29:56.320
I'll just give you one example.

428
00:29:57.070 --> 00:30:02.070
There was one minstrel troupe known as these were whites and black face keeping

429
00:30:02.561 --> 00:30:03.394
morale up.

430
00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:07.960
One of them was called Lincoln's intelligent contrabands

431
00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:10.930
and one little verse ran,

432
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:15.640
I'd rather work to cotton patch and die on corn.
And Bacon,

433
00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:20.800
then live up north on good white bread of abolition,
Macon.

434
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:26.250
And it gets worse and it goes on and on.
And,
and,

435
00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:30.910
and the story or the argument of all these confederate minstrel songs and the

436
00:30:30.911 --> 00:30:34.060
poetry of are based on is that black people don't want to be free,

437
00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.870
don't want anything to do with his free labor nonsense.

438
00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.150
I'm going to stay where they are.

439
00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:47.180
Now I invite you to read Gallagher and foster on this and Gallagher is going to

440
00:30:47.401 --> 00:30:52.401
make pretty aggressive argument against the loss of wealth thesis and he's going

441
00:30:53.911 --> 00:30:58.911
to argue the confederate nationalism ultimately resided and those armies,

442
00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:00.630
uh,

443
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:05.260
the armies that stuck it out against almost unbelievable.
Ah,

444
00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:10.800
all right.
But in 1863,

445
00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.310
the war had major military turning points.

446
00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:18.630
And let me take you through some of that.
Well,
the three major ones,
uh,

447
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:23.580
with some dispatch,
but these are,

448
00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:27.720
I mean on that short list of I believe five major turning points in the civil

449
00:31:27.721 --> 00:31:31.560
war.
I mentioned Gettysburg and Vicksburg.
Well kind of add to that if you want,

450
00:31:31.561 --> 00:31:32.394
if you would,

451
00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:37.860
the fall of port Hudson only a week after Vicksburg out on the Mississippi and

452
00:31:37.861 --> 00:31:42.861
then the ultimate fall final fall of Chattanooga to union hands by the fall of

453
00:31:44.521 --> 00:31:46.710
1863 now,

454
00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:49.800
some maps are in order.

455
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:55.183
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

456
00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:56.511
<v 0>confederacy.</v>

457
00:31:56.511 --> 00:32:01.511
You won a major victory at the battle of Chancellorsville near uh,

458
00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:08.360
sorry.
It just slipped off the map.
There it is.

459
00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.000
Just west of Fredericksburg.

460
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:15.590
First Week of May,

461
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:19.130
1863 this was yet again.
Uh,

462
00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:21.890
you'll remember the whole,
the previous year,

463
00:32:21.891 --> 00:32:26.480
a year before this McClellan and invaded the peninsula up toward Richmond,

464
00:32:26.481 --> 00:32:30.860
the seven days campaign and all the rest defeated.
Retreated.

465
00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.260
Lee then invaded the north.

466
00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:38.840
He's going to do exactly the same thing in the summer of 1863 and the wake of

467
00:32:38.841 --> 00:32:42.650
what was without a question,
a decisive victory at Chancellorsville.

468
00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:48.050
Lee held a,
a council of war in Richmond with Davis and other generals.

469
00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.590
This time,
of course,
stonewall Jackson was not there.

470
00:32:51.591 --> 00:32:56.591
He was shot and killed by his own men after the battle at night of

471
00:32:57.411 --> 00:32:59.360
Chancellorsville,
he lived about a week,

472
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:04.130
that little house where he died and the amputated his arm is a shrine today.

473
00:33:04.131 --> 00:33:07.730
I do you want to see some civil war weirdness?

474
00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.920
Go to the stonewall Jackson Shrine.
Um,

475
00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:12.920
and if you ever saw the movie gods,

476
00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:17.090
if he ever endured the movie gods and generals,
all four and a half hours of it,

477
00:33:17.091 --> 00:33:18.920
which I did cause I had to write a review of it.

478
00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:24.650
You know that they took almost a half hour to have stonewall Jackson die.

479
00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:31.040
I'm sorry.
For those of you who are stonewall Jackson fans,

480
00:33:31.041 --> 00:33:35.150
it's just quite remarkable.
But any rate,
Lee lost a terribly important commander,

481
00:33:35.151 --> 00:33:38.780
then there's no question about it and it will always leave.
And southern lower.

482
00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:42.320
You know,
what if Jackson had lived or what if he'd had Jackson at Gettysburg?

483
00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:47.330
What if he'd had Jackson at cold harbor,
where of it?
At any rate,

484
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:50.780
Lee went to Davis and said,
let me invade the North again.

485
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:54.980
Davis was a little cautious because the first time it didn't work,

486
00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:59.750
and I almost lost the war year ago.
James Longstreet now second in command,

487
00:33:59.751 --> 00:34:00.390
the lead and the,

488
00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:03.420
and the army of northern Virginia had another idea and launched.

489
00:34:03.421 --> 00:34:04.550
It almost always did.

490
00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:08.870
And there's a whole debate and civil war military history about just whether

491
00:34:08.871 --> 00:34:13.340
long streets should have been listened to throughout 63 long streets.

492
00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:18.200
Idea was to take,
uh,
at least two divisions of not an entire core of infantry,

493
00:34:18.201 --> 00:34:22.500
as many as possibly 20,000 men and moved them out west as long street.

494
00:34:22.501 --> 00:34:25.220
Where is the war was being lost in the western,
you know what,

495
00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:28.130
he was right on that at least that,
no,

496
00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:32.550
and always in civil war scholarship,
there's been this question,
you know,
did Lee,

497
00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:37.370
he ultimately lose the war because of his obsession with Virginia is home state

498
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:42.550
is home land and not allowing confederate troops to be moved west.

499
00:34:42.831 --> 00:34:44.960
Well,
they weren't moving west.
Not at this point in time.

500
00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:46.960
<v 3>Okay.</v>

501
00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.370
<v 0>All over the war.
Now,</v>

502
00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:52.570
even though lead one is major victory at Chancellorsville,

503
00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:57.010
the confederacy was potentially him then potentially.

504
00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:03.600
So Liza response to this was daring and how do you want it?

505
00:35:03.921 --> 00:35:07.960
Gettysburg,
decisive,
live.
We wouldn't be,
well,
I don't know what we'd be debating.

506
00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.870
I'm not sure.
I want to know what we'd be debating,

507
00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:16.090
but Lee did decide to go west up over into the upper Shenandoah valley and

508
00:35:16.091 --> 00:35:18.460
invade this time all the way into Pennsylvania,

509
00:35:18.461 --> 00:35:22.840
which he did in June,
1863

510
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:25.220
<v 3>okay.</v>

511
00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.650
<v 0>Lincoln's commander of the army of the Potomac.</v>

512
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:32.950
Now seriously defeated was a general named hooker.

513
00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:39.600
Hooker resigned the 28th of June,

514
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:43.720
1863 and was replaced by General named George Gordon meet only five days was,

515
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:44.191
excuse me,

516
00:35:44.191 --> 00:35:49.080
only three days before what would become the greatest battle of the war.

517
00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:51.190
<v 2>Okay.</v>

518
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:52.780
<v 0>What Gettysburg became</v>

519
00:35:56.170 --> 00:36:00.490
was in some ways an attempt by the confederate,
excuse me,
the Union army.

520
00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:03.580
I'll prove that for you.

521
00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:10.090
It's an effort by the Union army is blue here,
of course,

522
00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:16.180
to catch up with Lee's army as an invaded up into Pennsylvania and to stay

523
00:36:16.181 --> 00:36:18.850
between Lee's army in Washington DC.

524
00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:24.540
It's in some ways a replay what had happened just the year before now,

525
00:36:25.981 --> 00:36:29.100
they actually ended up meeting at this little town of Gettysburg,

526
00:36:29.101 --> 00:36:30.450
almost by mistake.

527
00:36:30.451 --> 00:36:34.830
They hadn't planned that Lee wanted to move all of his troops into central

528
00:36:34.831 --> 00:36:35.611
Pennsylvania.

529
00:36:35.611 --> 00:36:39.630
The whole idea here was to live off the land and the rich farm land of

530
00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:44.490
Pennsylvania to take the war out of ravaged central Virginia,

531
00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.960
relieve Richmond.
Uh,

532
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.450
and Lee believed tap in to the war,

533
00:36:51.451 --> 00:36:55.740
weariness of the north,
and possibly even reinvigorate British intervention

534
00:36:57.530 --> 00:37:00.230
when a lot of likelihood at that point.
But you know,
he,

535
00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:04.370
he hoped at any rate that there might be some possibility.

536
00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:07.490
It was a great calculated risk.

537
00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:08.940
<v 2>Okay.</v>

538
00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:13.050
<v 0>Um,
you know,
had it worked,
who knows?
It did not.</v>

539
00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:16.280
They collide in near Gettysburg because a,

540
00:37:16.281 --> 00:37:18.900
a group of a confederate infantry,

541
00:37:18.901 --> 00:37:22.800
we're marching toward the town from the West on July 1st,

542
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.370
1863 because they'd heard there were shoes in Gettysburg and there were

543
00:37:26.371 --> 00:37:30.840
confiscating,
by the way,
everything,
cattle,
hogs,
food,

544
00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:34.220
everything they could take from Pennsylvania farms.

545
00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:38.430
And rather than tapping into war weariness in the north,

546
00:37:38.431 --> 00:37:43.230
what leak accomplished was to stimulate resistance in the north.

547
00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:45.290
Nothing like an army invading your land,

548
00:37:45.291 --> 00:37:49.710
stealing your at your animals to a cause you some consternation.

549
00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:55.820
Lee's army also took scores of free blacks living in southern and central

550
00:37:57.241 --> 00:38:01.980
Pennsylvania and shuttled them quickly back into the south as slaves.

551
00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:05.760
And when this got into the press,
uh,

552
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:09.000
it also had an effect on northern morale

553
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:12.150
the first day at Gettysburg.

554
00:38:12.151 --> 00:38:15.450
And I can't go into the kind of detail I'd love to hear and I know some of you

555
00:38:15.451 --> 00:38:16.620
would like me to,

556
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:20.880
although I'm going to invite those of you who are military history enthusiasts

557
00:38:20.881 --> 00:38:23.490
to an evening session,
perhaps next week,

558
00:38:23.491 --> 00:38:26.130
perhaps the week after on a Wednesday if anybody wants.

559
00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:30.750
But we can go into more detail on this and you can open your veins and get a

560
00:38:30.751 --> 00:38:33.120
really good shot,
a military history if you'd like.

561
00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:37.030
And if if you o d that's your fault.

562
00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:43.660
The first day at Gettysburg was a confederate victory,
almost a complete route.

563
00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:48.970
It's actually nighttime that stopped it the second day at Gettysburg.

564
00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:53.080
If you look at this map over here,
you'll note that the union battle line,

565
00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:58.260
the union army barely got there in time by the second day to actually oppose

566
00:38:58.271 --> 00:39:02.200
Lee's army.
They had marched all day,
some of these union troops in March,

567
00:39:02.201 --> 00:39:04.720
30 miles in a day just to get there.

568
00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:09.480
But the second day at Gettysburg were attacks,

569
00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:13.810
massive attacks on the two ends of the line,
left Lincoln,

570
00:39:13.811 --> 00:39:17.080
right flank of the union armies,
which we're both very high ground.

571
00:39:17.081 --> 00:39:20.450
If any of you've ever,
how many of you been to Gettysburg,
you know,

572
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:23.690
little round top and copes Hilden Large hills,

573
00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:29.680
huge battles were fought on those hills and joy to 1862,

574
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:34.390
uh,
with huge numbers of casualties,
especially for the confederates.

575
00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:40.260
By the third day long street urged vehemently that Lee retreat,

576
00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:48.320
a strategic retreat and move south southward and then toward Washington and

577
00:39:49.721 --> 00:39:51.580
threatened us capitol.

578
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:56.980
But to choose other ground to fight on because of the way these hills and ridges

579
00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:01.930
were set up in front of them.
Long Street Council,

580
00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:05.770
a kind of strategic defensive move.

581
00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.010
They are on enemy land enemy territory.

582
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.040
Every day is a total risk here.

583
00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:17.820
And they've got a real problem with their supply line,
but least said no.

584
00:40:17.821 --> 00:40:21.370
His blood was up and the evidence all over the dispatches.

585
00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:25.330
Lee wanted to win there.
He wanted to fight.

586
00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:30.930
And as I'll come back to this question next week about Lee's own psyche for war,

587
00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:36.310
and what they said happened to his eyes.
One,
one,

588
00:40:36.311 --> 00:40:40.210
it was time for battle.
So on the third day at Gettysburg,

589
00:40:40.211 --> 00:40:45.211
he ordered a concentration at the center and it became the largest military

590
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:50.410
assault of the war,
the largest infantry assault of the civil war.

591
00:40:50.411 --> 00:40:54.640
It's known as Pickett's charge because it's name for one of the three division

592
00:40:54.641 --> 00:40:58.900
commanders,
uh,
who led it,
um,
George Pickett,

593
00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.860
who hid behind a barn through the whole damn thing.
By the way,

594
00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:08.370
while two of his brigade commanders were killed and all of his 13 kernels in his

595
00:41:09.791 --> 00:41:11.680
brigade were killed or wounded.

596
00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:17.260
So Pickett's charge the charge of 13,000 men for one hour across a wide open

597
00:41:17.261 --> 00:41:18.094
field,

598
00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:23.310
slightly rising towards the ridge lasted about one hour and almost exactly one

599
00:41:24.881 --> 00:41:29.380
half of those 13,000 men were killed or wounded and never got back to the ridge.

600
00:41:29.381 --> 00:41:34.280
They started from,
it was Lee's greatest mistake in the civil war.

601
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.233
He knew it.

602
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:39.290
He wrote out in the middle of this field and the thing was over as the men

603
00:41:39.291 --> 00:41:40.910
strike were straggling back.

604
00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:45.020
Those who survived and he kept going up to them and saying,
it's all my fault.

605
00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:48.590
It's all my fault.
It's all my fault.
Please help me.

606
00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:53.530
He even offered his resignation to Jefferson Davis a couple of weeks later,

607
00:41:53.531 --> 00:41:55.540
but of course,
David's wasn't going to take it.

608
00:41:56.590 --> 00:42:00.670
The great significance of Gettysburg,
there's many things.

609
00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.240
Uh,
it's several things.

610
00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:08.620
It's the greatest battle of the war in terms of its sheer scale.

611
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:14.860
Casualties were ghastly.
28,000 casualties in three days.

612
00:42:14.861 --> 00:42:17.470
That's dead,
wounded and missing on the confederate side.

613
00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:21.100
One third of all the men and gauge,
we're dead or wounded at the end of it.

614
00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:26.530
On the Union side,
there were 23,000 casualties.
That's one of every four.

615
00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:33.240
My Guy,
Charley Brewster,
whose letters I edited,
was actually held in reserve.

616
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:34.680
They didn't even get there in time.

617
00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:40.490
The 10th mass was that was brought out to be burial Cruz and his letters above

618
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:43.710
about the fields,

619
00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:47.400
Gettysburg or just quite almost unbelievable,

620
00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:52.710
isn't a particularly poignant letter where he,
he,
he,

621
00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:55.170
they always rifled the pockets of the dead.

622
00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.950
He rifles the pockets of a con dead confederate soldier.

623
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.970
<v 2>Okay.</v>

624
00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:04.360
<v 0>And in his pockets is a letter,
a love letter home.</v>

625
00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:10.680
And he reads that letter and he quotes from it to his own mother and any

626
00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:13.360
barriers to the guy and saved the letter.

627
00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:18.920
And this was his job for about three days in a rainstorm bearing union and

628
00:43:18.921 --> 00:43:23.390
confederate dead.
It is Getty's.
It is the carnage at Gettysburg,

629
00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:28.420
the vast number of dead 56 odd thousand casualties overall that forced the

630
00:43:29.901 --> 00:43:33.230
United States government to create the first national cemetery,

631
00:43:33.231 --> 00:43:34.790
which would be created at Gettysburg.

632
00:43:34.791 --> 00:43:39.650
And that's of course why Lincoln went there the next fall to give the Gettysburg

633
00:43:39.651 --> 00:43:43.340
address.
Now,
let's strategically,

634
00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:48.020
it's hugely important.
Lee had to retreat as fast as he could.

635
00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:51.590
The great problem now for the next week was whether me,

636
00:43:51.591 --> 00:43:56.140
the union commander would follow this up and push like hell in spite of the,
uh,

637
00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:58.820
the how badly hurt his army was.

638
00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:03.440
And Lincoln was sending dispatch after dispatch to me,
please move.

639
00:44:03.441 --> 00:44:06.440
You've got the menu.
Nixon was saying things like,
you've got them in your grip,

640
00:44:06.441 --> 00:44:08.060
destroyed them.
The war will be over.

641
00:44:08.061 --> 00:44:12.890
The war will be over and lead and me didn't move for three days.

642
00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:19.730
And Lee's army escaped on the 13th and 14th of July on a pontoon bridge.

643
00:44:23.311 --> 00:44:27.180
They hastily managed to build what was left of Lee's army,

644
00:44:27.181 --> 00:44:32.181
managed to get across the Potomac River back into Virginia to fight again.

645
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:39.090
Gettysburg's a major union victory,
but it could have been even bigger

646
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:45.330
out west
and terribly important.

647
00:44:45.331 --> 00:44:47.280
You could argue even more important

648
00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:53.610
where the sieges in the capture of two major places,

649
00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:59.090
I guess you'd call them fortresses or ports along the Mississippi river,

650
00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:05.840
Vicksburg and port Hudson.
Vicksburg was laid under C.

651
00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:09.900
Vicksburg had been brought under siege from months by a union army commanded by

652
00:45:09.901 --> 00:45:11.860
Ulysses grant.
I mean they,

653
00:45:11.861 --> 00:45:16.500
they had even at one point tried to alter the course of the Mississippi River

654
00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:20.760
with the,
with the biggest military engineering scheme,

655
00:45:20.761 --> 00:45:25.110
the world that ever hatched.
And it did.
It didn't really work at a big river,

656
00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:29.160
don't mess with it.
But finally,

657
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:33.990
grant was able to put Vicksburg in the spring of 1863 under siege,

658
00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.000
mostly from the east,

659
00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:42.560
and it was especially under complete lockdown siege from May 22nd to the first

660
00:45:42.631 --> 00:45:43.650
week of July,

661
00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:48.480
in which time the civilian population of Vicksburg that was left and a roughly

662
00:45:48.481 --> 00:45:52.950
30,000 garrison of good of a confederate army began to starve.

663
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:57.510
The civilians were living in caves because much of their housing was destroyed

664
00:45:57.511 --> 00:45:58.920
by artillery bombardment.

665
00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:04.650
On June 28th the confederate commander John [inaudible],

666
00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:09.060
received a petition from his own troops signed by lots of them,

667
00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:13.350
which said,
in part quote,
if you cannot feed us,

668
00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:15.270
you had better surrender.

669
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:19.290
And so Pemberton sued for survey.
Did Sue,

670
00:46:19.291 --> 00:46:21.510
he asks for surrender terms.

671
00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:24.450
He met with grant on the 3rd of July,

672
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:27.870
the same afternoon as Pickett's charge is happening in the east.

673
00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:28.733
They don't know it.

674
00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:33.450
And Pemberton surrounded 30,000 confederate troops,

675
00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:38.900
the blink of an eye on July 4th 80 63 central Mississippi would within weeks be

676
00:46:42.001 --> 00:46:47.001
abandoned by confederate forces and the whole of central and northern

677
00:46:47.611 --> 00:46:52.590
Mississippi would come under union control.
And that is by,
by the way,

678
00:46:52.591 --> 00:46:57.000
folks,
the most densely populated slave region anywhere in the south.

679
00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:02.300
And it is the escape of slaves now by the hundreds and then thousands into

680
00:47:02.941 --> 00:47:07.941
grants lines that forced his hand and the creation of numerous contraband camps

681
00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:11.430
all over northern Mississippi and Tennessee.

682
00:47:11.431 --> 00:47:16.431
And even down in Mississippi a few days later on July 8th that port Hudson down

683
00:47:17.371 --> 00:47:21.930
the Mississippi,
just north of Baton Rouge,
a second fort surrendered.

684
00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:26.850
The two had been under sieged since May.
And when Port Hudson surrendered,

685
00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:32.470
the Mississippi now was completely in union hands and union control.

686
00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:37.030
And the 16th of July,
a merchant steam boat tied up in New Orleans,

687
00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:41.530
having successfully traveled from Saint Louis all the way down the river on

688
00:47:41.531 --> 00:47:44.200
harassed at all by confederate guns.

689
00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:49.920
And Lincoln famously wrote his memo or telegraph to grant saying,

690
00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:56.590
now the father of waters again goes and vexed to the sea.

691
00:47:58.030 --> 00:48:00.370
It's terribly important because if he doesn't look at a map,

692
00:48:00.371 --> 00:48:04.960
you realize now that by controlling the entire Mississippi river and the region

693
00:48:04.961 --> 00:48:05.794
around it,

694
00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:10.390
you're not only are our sewing a havoc in a southern society,

695
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:14.350
freeing slaves,
confiscating land and property,

696
00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:17.200
controlling the south greatest seaports,

697
00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:21.850
but you've cut the confederacy in half and one of the confederacy's largest

698
00:48:21.851 --> 00:48:24.460
supply lines was through Texas.

699
00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:28.990
They were actually being supported to this point in time by the French through

700
00:48:28.991 --> 00:48:32.920
Mexico.
All that was a supplier and it never worked terribly.
Well.

701
00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:36.730
Now clock is running out on me.

702
00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:40.420
That's okay because what happens,
the Chattanooga doesn't.

703
00:48:40.421 --> 00:48:44.380
That could happen to us I think next to the end of 1863 which is a nice place to

704
00:48:44.381 --> 00:48:46.450
pick it up next time.
But let me leave you with this.

705
00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:53.583
<v 2>Okay.</v>

706
00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:57.030
<v 0>Across the south.</v>

707
00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:02.250
This was horrible news and especially when Chattanooga is going to fall in the

708
00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.170
fall.
It's even worse.

709
00:49:04.171 --> 00:49:09.171
News and these kinds of expressions now came from southern leaders and privates

710
00:49:09.901 --> 00:49:14.901
in the army and women at home and here comes your loss of morale thesis

711
00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:22.080
on July 28th after the fall for port Hudson and Vicksburg and the the Barco,

712
00:49:23.650 --> 00:49:27.370
the disaster at Gettysburg,
the confederate chief of ordinance,

713
00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:31.900
Josiah Gorgeous,
wrote into his diary quote,

714
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:36.250
events have succeeded one another with disastrous rapidity.

715
00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:40.900
One brief month ago.
We were apparently at the point of success,

716
00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:45.460
Lee was in Pennsylvania.
It's threatening Harrisburg and even Philadelphia.

717
00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:49.780
Vicksburg seem to laugh at all of grants,
efforts to scorn.

718
00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:55.530
Now the picture is just as somber as it was bright then it seems incredible that

719
00:49:56.111 --> 00:50:00.280
human power could affect such a change and so brief a space.

720
00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:03.970
Yesterday we rode on the pinnacle of success.

721
00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:07.300
Today absolute ruins seems to be our portion,

722
00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:11.590
the confederacy totters to its destruction.

723
00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:14.500
The war isn't over,

724
00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:20.140
and I'll argue next week the confederacy still could have one its version of

725
00:50:20.141 --> 00:50:25.141
victory in 1864 but those battlefields successes of 63

726
00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:29.740
were handwriting on the wall.
