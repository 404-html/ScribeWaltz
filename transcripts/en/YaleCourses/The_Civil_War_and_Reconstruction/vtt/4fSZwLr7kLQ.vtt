1
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.540
We're going to elect that his reelect Lincoln in a moment.

2
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.470
The election of 1864 being one of the without a question crucial turning points

3
00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:27.910
in the war in a war that was so political

4
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.280
but spare the poets.
I want to begin by placing you somewhere.

5
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.190
The ending of the civil war of course

6
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.630
was for thousands upon thousands,

7
00:00:43.631 --> 00:00:48.631
really millions of Americans a confrontation with death on a scale they'd never

8
00:00:51.011 --> 00:00:54.160
known,
never experienced and frankly never have.
Again,

9
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.080
there's a marvelous new book on this,
two new books on this one in particular,

10
00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:03.700
but drew Faust whom you've read already,
a book called the Republic of suffering,

11
00:01:03.701 --> 00:01:06.670
which I recommend to you just came out a couple months ago,

12
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.250
which is all about the deaf culture that the civil war bread,

13
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.840
our greatest death poet was Whitman.
This is risky.

14
00:01:19.841 --> 00:01:22.420
I'm going to actually recite a little piece,

15
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.920
a little bits of what could be women's greatest poem.

16
00:01:26.921 --> 00:01:30.250
At least it is in my view,
but what do I know?
I'm not a literary scholar,

17
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.780
but there are ways in Whitman's one line locks last in the door yard bloom that

18
00:01:37.781 --> 00:01:42.781
he is actually anticipating what's going to happen with time to the problem of

19
00:01:46.031 --> 00:01:50.860
how Americans will remember this ghastly bloodletting.

20
00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:54.310
They've just experiences of course the poem about Lincoln's death.

21
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.960
Woodman really had a thing about Lincoln.
As you may know,

22
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.620
he wrote possibly the only poem that ever rhyme and his magnificent collection,

23
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.090
oh captain,
my captain in relation to Lincoln's death,

24
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.290
but lilacs is a masterpiece.

25
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.910
It's the poem he wrote to try to imagine the funeral train of Abraham Lincoln,

26
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.850
the train that took some
Tony days,

27
00:02:28.851 --> 00:02:33.800
three coffins cause to got damage.
It stopped and I forget now,

28
00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:38.801
1617 different cities and this incredible tour all over New England and then all

29
00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:44.000
across the north and the Midwest.
And finally to his barrier when Springfield,

30
00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:44.834
Illinois

31
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.510
and what a Whitman really wrote here was a kind of a calming,

32
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.270
it's written in a mood of a kind of a calming,

33
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.630
deep politicized contemplation on what Whitman called the fathomless sure

34
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:02.830
unwinding arms of cool and folding death,

35
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.240
but it's very much directly about Lincoln's death.

36
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.970
And Whitman imagines a song.
Bird calls it a warbling

37
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.600
and he says he hears this warbling singing a solitary song.

38
00:03:23.001 --> 00:03:27.080
His words of the bleeding throat deaths outlet,

39
00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:29.960
song of life for well,
dear brother,

40
00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:33.800
he's speaking to the bird now for well,
dear brother,

41
00:03:33.801 --> 00:03:38.450
I know if thou was not granted to sing though,
what's surely die

42
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.990
and he's trying to use the bird,
go read this poem,
read it three,

43
00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:47.740
four and five times.
He's trying to use the warbling,

44
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.970
the song sparrow as a metaphor for all of America.

45
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.960
How shall I wore here?
It gives voice to the bird.

46
00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.380
He even writes lyrics for the bird.

47
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.120
How shall I warble and myself for the dead one that I love,

48
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.140
it's like an offering.
Whitman picks a sprig of Lilac,
he says,

49
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.980
and places Abraham Lincoln's funeral train in the setting of what he calls ever

50
00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:22.991
returning spring across the vast landscape of America from east to the prairie.

51
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.610
It was April like now a little later.

52
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.660
Lilacs were in bloom by late in the month.

53
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.580
And it comes with this magnificent verse over the breast of Spring,

54
00:04:39.261 --> 00:04:39.771
the land,

55
00:04:39.771 --> 00:04:43.940
the mid cities and mid lanes and through old woods where lately the vial,

56
00:04:43.941 --> 00:04:48.860
it's peeped from the ground spotting the grade debris amid the grass in the

57
00:04:48.861 --> 00:04:53.090
fields,
each side of the lanes passing the enlist grass,

58
00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.510
passing the yellow speared wheat,

59
00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.010
every grain from its shroud and the dark brown fields up risen,

60
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.550
passing the appletree blows of white and pink in the orchards carrying a corpse

61
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.410
to where it shall rest in the grave.
Night and day journey's a coffin.

62
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.110
And then he says,
the bird must sing.
It's Carol of death.

63
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.860
And the poet tries to give words to the music,

64
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.880
yet one senses that even Whitman with all his powers could not match the little

65
00:05:29.541 --> 00:05:34.541
wore blings power to deliver what he calls that powerful psalm.

66
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.823
In the night.

67
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.900
This is a poem of grief for the whole country.

68
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.350
He's trying to capture the meaning of death all at death caused in the civil war

69
00:05:48.351 --> 00:05:49.220
if it's possible.

70
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.510
But he gives the job to a tiny little bird.

71
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.520
Whitman himself,
he says is left visions,
his words,

72
00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:03.290
a battle corpses and the debris of all the slain soldiers of the war in his

73
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:04.124
head.

74
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.130
The funeral train passes by all the images the poet can muster and then he's

75
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:13.640
just left to say
his words.

76
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.480
The living remained and suffered.

77
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.810
<v 2>Now,
um,</v>

78
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:27.870
I'll return to Whitman.

79
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.830
<v 0>It's a,
it's one way to get a handle if it is a handle.</v>

80
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.350
I want.
Americans were coping with an 1865,
um,

81
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.180
the level and the scale of sacrifice that they had experienced.

82
00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:48.260
And of course,
Lincoln's assassination came,
uh,

83
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.540
to three days after Robert e Lee's surrender.
It happened,
man.

84
00:06:53.541 --> 00:06:54.920
It's more than that in a minute.

85
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.640
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

86
00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.750
<v 0>But backup with me,
back up with me and have that last year of the war,</v>

87
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.070
it was still possible for the south to win.

88
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.220
It's version of a victory.

89
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.460
As late as I'd say August of 1864 I suppose you could even say September,

90
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.580
but after the fall of Atlanta,
it wasn't likely,

91
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:22.950
but now quickly that election of 64 was one of the most important in our

92
00:07:22.951 --> 00:07:23.430
history.

93
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.090
We don't pay a lot of attention to it because we kind of speed by it or around

94
00:07:27.091 --> 00:07:29.730
it and we almost ignore it sometimes.
That's another election.

95
00:07:29.731 --> 00:07:31.080
Let's get on with the civil war.

96
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.003
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

97
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.060
<v 0>Across the north,
there was tremendous war weariness.</v>

98
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:42.090
That summer I mentioned already 65 66,000 casualties in grants army alone in

99
00:07:43.931 --> 00:07:46.150
Virginia.
In two and a half months,

100
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:52.890
there was great bitterness against the draft that summer.
Uh,

101
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:58.290
in the end,
only about six,
7% of all union soldiers will actually be drafted.

102
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.450
But there was tremendous resentment against it.

103
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:04.030
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

104
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:04.691
<v 0>In the north,</v>

105
00:08:04.691 --> 00:08:08.320
there were the peace Democrats or sometimes that's what they were called.

106
00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:11.440
Sometimes they were called copperheads named for the snake.

107
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.730
Copperheads usually though,

108
00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:18.740
are those people who somehow were deemed truly does loyal to the union and

109
00:08:19.991 --> 00:08:24.370
actually we're engaging in machinations and conspiracies to overthrow the union.

110
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.100
That's always been an open question.

111
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:31.900
There was an effort within the Republican Party is early as May and June of 64

112
00:08:31.901 --> 00:08:35.800
to dump Lincoln and place of either Salmon Chase,

113
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:39.850
a member of Lincoln's cabinet,
his attorney general,

114
00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:45.310
and read Doris Kearns Goodwin team of rivals.

115
00:08:45.311 --> 00:08:50.050
If you want to know just how much chase was scheming to dump Lincoln as his own

116
00:08:50.051 --> 00:08:54.340
attorney general
face May.

117
00:08:54.341 --> 00:08:59.160
I've had the most daughter in Washington,
Kate Chase,
but he had no style

118
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.840
and then there was an effort to dump Lincoln in favor of the candidate.

119
00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:04.780
Jonsi Fremont.

120
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.790
The same frame on who would run in 1856 is the Republican presidential candidate

121
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:15.410
and Lincoln was himself all but convinced by July and early August of 64 that he

122
00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:19.620
probably wouldn't win reelection.
What to do.

123
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:21.510
In the meantime,

124
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:26.040
the Democratic Party nominated George Bien Mcclellan,

125
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:29.490
former general commanding general of the army of the Potomac.

126
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:35.030
That Democratic Party in the midst of the civil war was a confusing lot and when

127
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.170
might even say a confused a lot,

128
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:42.270
some of them truly wanted to sue for a negotiated peace,

129
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.260
but they would always say they wanted a negotiated peace of the south.

130
00:09:46.261 --> 00:09:50.410
It would still restore the union.
Of course,

131
00:09:50.411 --> 00:09:53.570
that was never acceptable.
The Jefferson Davis and the confederate war,
uh,

132
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.850
the confederate government,

133
00:09:55.930 --> 00:10:00.930
many of them were quite explicitly for it negotiated peace that would not result

134
00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:04.600
in emancipation.
They wanted to turn emancipation around.

135
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:09.480
They want a union without emancipation.
That is exactly what Mcclellan wanted.

136
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:16.500
There was a deeply white supremacist strain and much of the northern Democratic

137
00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.343
Party

138
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:23.270
and they put up a formidable challenge to a wartime president in the midst of

139
00:10:23.271 --> 00:10:24.110
civil war.

140
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.630
They painted Lincoln in the Republicans as what they constantly called Miss

141
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.810
Educationist.
He used the term all the time,

142
00:10:32.811 --> 00:10:35.540
the Republicans were going to make whites and blacks marry each other.

143
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:41.270
They called Abraham Lincoln in this campaign aid the widow maker,

144
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:43.910
and we're already waving the bloody shirt.

145
00:10:43.911 --> 00:10:48.710
That would become so ubiquitous in the wake of the war planning Lincoln for all

146
00:10:48.711 --> 00:10:53.540
the death.
They also referred to him as ape,
the nigger lover,

147
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.700
and they,
and they,
they put the democratic papers produced cartoons,

148
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.460
a famous cartoons or wishing,

149
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:05.500
I wish I had an example of one today or what they called miss [inaudible] balls.

150
00:11:05.511 --> 00:11:10.160
These were dances and balls or whites and blacks all came together,
kissed,

151
00:11:10.161 --> 00:11:13.550
made love and mixed the races.

152
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:20.230
What Lincoln desperately needed was battlefield success to alter northern warm

153
00:11:22.041 --> 00:11:26.730
around.
And of course they got that.
They got,

154
00:11:26.731 --> 00:11:31.731
it was the fall of mobile harbor in the first and second week of August.

155
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:33.891
I have no,
David,

156
00:11:33.891 --> 00:11:37.130
Farragut and the largest naval engagement with the war took mobile,

157
00:11:37.131 --> 00:11:42.131
the last major southern sea port to come into union hands.

158
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.850
And then especially with the fall of Atlanta and the 4th of September of 64 a

159
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:52.250
3rd of September,
sorry.
And then in the month of September,

160
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:58.710
further victories by Philip Sheridan's cavalry in the Shenandoah valley driving

161
00:11:59.261 --> 00:12:04.030
confederate armies basically out of the Shenandoah valley made it now possible

162
00:12:04.031 --> 00:12:08.800
to say that the war was on a course of union victory,

163
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.520
that the confederacy was in a state of near collapse and when the election came,

164
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:18.100
the votes were there.

165
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:23.110
Lincoln one 55% of the total popular vote,

166
00:12:23.111 --> 00:12:26.980
45% of the electorate in the northern states.
It did not vote for the Lincoln

167
00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.530
and then the fact that therefore we're not voting for emancipation.

168
00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:34.230
Keep that in mind.
When we started discussing reconstruction,

169
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:43.470
18 of the of the free states made it possible for soldiers to vote at the front.

170
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.940
Only two did not.
And then even though it was led,

171
00:12:46.941 --> 00:12:51.370
soldiers vote by absentee,
it is the first time in,
in,

172
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:55.480
in world history.
So far as we know that a republic in the midst,

173
00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.650
there weren't that many republics.
Speaker,
of course,

174
00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.980
the first time in the course of a,
of a civil war,

175
00:13:02.981 --> 00:13:06.880
that republic held a general election and pulled it off.

176
00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.730
Most importantly,
Blinken one,

177
00:13:09.731 --> 00:13:14.731
an extraordinary 78% of the soldier vote all those hundreds of thousands in the

178
00:13:17.081 --> 00:13:20.440
army and navy,
and they voted in droves.

179
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:26.720
It was that election,
a referendum on the war,

180
00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:31.820
and there was a referendum on its purpose and it was a referendum.

181
00:13:31.821 --> 00:13:34.550
Therefore,
on emancipation,

182
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:40.600
one of the most extraordinary events that happened in that election season was

183
00:13:41.811 --> 00:13:46.460
in the third week of August of 64 Lincoln invited this time,
invited,

184
00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.850
hey,
excuse me,
Fredrick Douglas to come to the White House.

185
00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:54.260
They had met the year before in August and the 63 but that was at Douglass,

186
00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.190
his own prodding.

187
00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:01.220
63 Douglas had gone to the White House to complain about on equal pay and brutal

188
00:14:01.371 --> 00:14:04.070
discrimination's against black troops in the union armies,

189
00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.130
and you've got an audience at least for awhile with Lincoln.

190
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:11.690
The first time they met beginnings of a,
a remarkable relationship,

191
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:16.900
but in 64 Lincoln invites Douglas and Douglas didn't know what,

192
00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:21.400
what he was going to be asked to do and they sat down for about 45 minutes eye

193
00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:26.410
to eye and Abraham Lincoln as Frederick Douglass to lead a campaign to funnel as

194
00:14:27.441 --> 00:14:32.441
many slaves out of the upper south into some kind of security in the north

195
00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:38.170
before election day in November because he feared he would not be reelected than

196
00:14:38.721 --> 00:14:43.721
he wanted as many slaves as possible to be secure within union lines and somehow

197
00:14:43.791 --> 00:14:48.170
legally free under the proclamation before Mcclellan won the election.

198
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:50.840
Now frankly,

199
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:55.840
Douglas was stung here was a blink and asking him to be John Brown sort of,

200
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.580
you can hardly believe it,
and he left there.

201
00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:07.280
Well,
the whole new kind of conception of Lincoln Franklin,
not entirely new,

202
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.690
he was already working on that,
but he went back home to Rochester,

203
00:15:11.691 --> 00:15:16.691
New York and he organized about 15 or 16 agents by letter and telegram in late

204
00:15:17.871 --> 00:15:20.830
August and the first week of September all over the north.

205
00:15:20.831 --> 00:15:23.960
He didn't had a clue how he wasn't really going to do this or how much of the

206
00:15:23.961 --> 00:15:25.190
army was really going to help him,

207
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.880
but he started calling all his old friends in the abolition movement and a lot

208
00:15:28.881 --> 00:15:32.290
of the people who had been recruiting black troops and said,
help me,

209
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.890
we're going to funnel slaves out of the south.
I don't know how,
but helped me.

210
00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:39.980
And then came the fall of Atlanta,

211
00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:46.010
couple of Sheraton's victories in the Shannon door and the whole scheme was

212
00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:46.844
called off,

213
00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:52.930
but it's a measure of Lincoln's own sense of reality that he was about to lose.

214
00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.390
All right.
The war ended of course,

215
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:05.140
in great part with the surrender at Appomattox and then with the surrender of

216
00:16:05.571 --> 00:16:10.571
Joseph Johnson to Sherman and a farmhouse in central North Carolina about 10

217
00:16:10.821 --> 00:16:15.170
days later,
uh,
what is it?
April 21st I believe.

218
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.880
Let me discuss that briefly.

219
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:25.900
It's an extremely important moment and event and the terms of that surrender are

220
00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.340
extremely important for what's to come

221
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:35.600
in a war that had become so political,

222
00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:40.100
so much about morale,
so much about public opinion,

223
00:16:40.101 --> 00:16:44.060
so much about the will have two peoples to see it through

224
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.750
the surrender terms.
We're actually almost utterly apolitical.

225
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:59.140
I had a couple of photos up here.
I don't know if you can see this very well.
Oh,

226
00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:06.400
this is one of many photographs that um,
Matthew Brady and his

227
00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:14.610
troop of photographers took of Richmond after it fell April 5th 80 65 as so many

228
00:17:20.861 --> 00:17:25.390
journalists now started saying the United States was finally an old country

229
00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:30.180
because it had ruins.
No,

230
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.880
great.
You need some ruins to have a history.

231
00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.570
Well,
Richmond fell fifth,

232
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:43.190
5th of April of 65 and Lee's army did escape.

233
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.850
He was experiencing tremendous desertion.
He escaped.

234
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.700
The goalie had as so far as we are now is to reach the Blue Ridge mountains,

235
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.180
maybe even get south into North Carolina,

236
00:17:57.181 --> 00:18:01.110
may be hookup with Johnston's armor that was retreating in front of Sherman up

237
00:18:01.111 --> 00:18:02.250
in the North Carolina.

238
00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:07.820
Maybe somehow connect the two remaining confederate armies and carry on the war

239
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:13.470
if they could lead.
Really didn't ever,

240
00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:18.070
ever want to give up,
but he had to.

241
00:18:18.071 --> 00:18:19.030
He was cut off.

242
00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:26.260
There was an emerging lethal mixture now of no supplies desertion and the almost

243
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:33.590
unfathomable over supply of the Union forces.

244
00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.860
He was grossly outnumbered

245
00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:43.360
and finally he had to send a note after this last little battle.

246
00:18:43.791 --> 00:18:48.791
They actually fought on the 11th of April or 18 men were killed and there's a

247
00:18:49.551 --> 00:18:53.090
little cemetery at Appomattox today where you can see the gravestones of those

248
00:18:53.091 --> 00:18:56.300
18 minutes,
one of the most moving little cemeteries I've ever seen.

249
00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.670
They're the last to die and a totally futile battle.

250
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:07.640
The terms of the surrender where essentially a this,

251
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.660
and by the way,
they were Lincoln's direct orders.

252
00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.090
That's a parole slip.

253
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:22.260
It's a photocopy of exactly what they looked like.

254
00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:27.120
The Union army took printing presses out to Appomattox courthouse,

255
00:19:27.121 --> 00:19:31.440
which was this little town and they set it up in a tavern and they pumped out

256
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:36.030
these parole slips.
About 25 to 30,000 of them in 48 hours.

257
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:40.590
Confederate soldiers were given these parole.

258
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.400
They were allowed to keep their sidearms.

259
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.730
They had to surrender their rifles.

260
00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:52.910
They were allowed to keep horses if they had them.
In essence,

261
00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.470
they were simply told go home.

262
00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:02.510
Nobody except technically Lee himself was taken into custody,

263
00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:10.340
but least custody was simply the right to ride his horse back to Richmond if he

264
00:20:10.711 --> 00:20:12.630
chose or wherever you want it to go.

265
00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.690
And he was technically put under house arrest,

266
00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:19.780
not allowed to leave his house or some period of time,

267
00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:25.720
but never charged with anything.
Jefferson Davis.

268
00:20:25.721 --> 00:20:29.050
Well more on that later,
Alexander Eight,

269
00:20:29.051 --> 00:20:32.480
Steve and the vice president will technically be charged,

270
00:20:32.481 --> 00:20:34.700
although never tried.

271
00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.990
Davis will be charged but never tried.

272
00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:45.100
No one except the commandant of Andersonville prison prison when captain words s

273
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:54.480
a Swiss born immigrant who command at Andersonville the worst of the south,

274
00:20:55.231 --> 00:20:56.064
the prison.

275
00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:02.390
It was the only person accused of treason and war crimes and executed as a

276
00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:07.090
result of this war.
Now,

277
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.570
Lee and grant of course,
and met and Ken Burns milk this for all it's worth.

278
00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:15.160
So I'm going to let you feel it from him.
Um,

279
00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:18.110
they met at the Mclean House.
It happened Maddix go there some day.

280
00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:21.190
It still looks almost exactly as it looked in 1865

281
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:26.620
granted,
leave barely remembered one another.

282
00:21:26.621 --> 00:21:30.430
They knew each other now and all together extraordinarily well from fighting

283
00:21:30.431 --> 00:21:31.900
each other for so long.

284
00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:38.280
I sat down in the parlor of this house and grant gave Lee the terms lead dressed

285
00:21:40.031 --> 00:21:43.000
up in his finest golden sash.
He wore his sword.

286
00:21:43.001 --> 00:21:47.380
He fully expected this to be a traditional 18th or 19th century surrender.

287
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:51.270
He was going to give his sword and all that nonsense.
Grant just said,

288
00:21:51.271 --> 00:21:52.270
I don't want your sword

289
00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:53.903
<v 2>go home.</v>

290
00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:57.410
<v 0>No.
It's also true</v>

291
00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:04.210
that when they finally cut Lee's army off and Lee had to send that note and say,

292
00:22:05.901 --> 00:22:10.160
please meet me,
uh,
to consider surrender terms.

293
00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:13.190
The news just zoomed around.
The Union,

294
00:22:13.191 --> 00:22:18.020
army and union soldiers just started going crazy,
celebrating,

295
00:22:18.021 --> 00:22:21.680
screaming,
shooting off guns,
riding on their horses all over the place.

296
00:22:21.681 --> 00:22:24.740
The war is over,
the war is over.
The war is over.
God,

297
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:29.760
them rebels have surrendered and grant put out an order all through his army.

298
00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.650
If there would be no celebration.

299
00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:40.200
It was grant already understanding that the surrender had to be political too

300
00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:48.580
and that there would be tremendous untold bitterness

301
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.410
to deal with in the wake of this war grant as a general,

302
00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.810
had no idea what politically would come.

303
00:22:55.811 --> 00:22:59.020
He wasn't involved yet in reconstruction plans at all,

304
00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:06.120
but it also was a kind of statement of course of honor among soldiers

305
00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:08.741
to the south.

306
00:23:08.741 --> 00:23:13.741
You can rest assured the day they heard about APP Maddix was the way it was for

307
00:23:13.931 --> 00:23:17.260
most northerners about the day that heard of Lincoln's assassination.

308
00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:22.320
It is all over diaries all over literature it sometimes it's just called the

309
00:23:23.531 --> 00:23:24.364
surrender.

310
00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:29.560
The day we heard there's so many statements of it throughout southern letters

311
00:23:29.561 --> 00:23:31.510
and diaries.
As I've said,

312
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:38.190
I'll just read a couple just briefly and then one from a northerner to show you

313
00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:44.170
what this moment means on both sides and how difficult reconstruction is going

314
00:23:44.171 --> 00:23:47.870
to be.
Just look at their diaries.
Remember Kate Stone?

315
00:23:47.871 --> 00:23:52.871
I read from her diary before Louisiana plant or a woman and flood over to Texas

316
00:23:53.031 --> 00:23:57.350
and lost most of her slaves.
She writes into her diary.

317
00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:03.280
April 28 65 all are fearful,

318
00:24:03.281 --> 00:24:04.220
lead depressed.

319
00:24:04.221 --> 00:24:08.330
She reports I cannot bear to hear them talk of defeat.

320
00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:13.780
She still hope that confederate armies might rally and fight as she puts it to

321
00:24:14.031 --> 00:24:17.180
be free or die.
Easy for her to say.

322
00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:23.550
And May 15 she opened a journal entry with this definition that I may have read

323
00:24:24.501 --> 00:24:28.310
before,
or the first words are conquered.

324
00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.700
Submission subjugation.

325
00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.610
She says out of the words in my heart,

326
00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:38.750
and then when she hears the John Wilkes booth has shot Lincoln,

327
00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:44.650
she rejoiced in Lincoln's death and honored at least under diary John Wilkes

328
00:24:45.291 --> 00:24:47.900
booth for quote,
ridding the world of a tyrant.

329
00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:53.280
We are glad he is not alive to rejoice in our humiliation and insult us with his

330
00:24:53.931 --> 00:24:54.764
jokes.

331
00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:59.870
It sounds as though those expressions and southern letters and diaries

332
00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:05.990
that spring and summer,
an estimated eight to 10,000 next confederates,

333
00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:10.220
many of the former officers would flee the country.

334
00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:15.790
They ended up going to Brazil,
England,
um,
uh,

335
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:20.450
other parts of Europe,
Mexico,
Canada,
and a few.

336
00:25:20.451 --> 00:25:23.870
I even went as far away as Japan for fear.

337
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:29.720
I mean Jubal early
conniving old rat.

338
00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:33.140
More on him.
Later he ran to Mexico.

339
00:25:33.141 --> 00:25:36.800
He was certain they were all going to be executed that at least the officer

340
00:25:36.801 --> 00:25:40.070
corps of Lee's army,
none of them were.

341
00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.870
And let me read you a diary entry from a northern woman.

342
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:49.160
Great diaries this year.
Her diaries hardly known,
but man,

343
00:25:49.161 --> 00:25:52.250
her diary is almost equal to Mary Chestnut.

344
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:56.600
I first encountered it in manuscript and a Korean society,

345
00:25:56.601 --> 00:26:01.130
American according to side in Wooster.
Her name was Caroline Barrett White.

346
00:26:01.131 --> 00:26:06.020
She kept a diary for years,
decades and her warriors diaries extraordinary.

347
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:11.690
This is her April 10 1865 entry,
hurrah,
Hurrah,

348
00:26:11.691 --> 00:26:16.190
sound allowed.
Timble over Egypt dark.
See you early this morning.
Our ears,

349
00:26:16.191 --> 00:26:18.650
we're greeted with the sound of bells ringing.

350
00:26:18.651 --> 00:26:23.651
A joyous peel generally had surrendered with his whole army to general grants.

351
00:26:24.521 --> 00:26:26.210
She's got exclamation marks all over the place.

352
00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:32.650
Surely this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes.

353
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:35.500
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

354
00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.670
<v 0>and she goes on and on and on.</v>

355
00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:41.320
All kinds of biblical cadences to talk about the sense of jubilation she sees in

356
00:26:41.321 --> 00:26:45.360
the streets of her Massachusetts.
And then five days later,

357
00:26:45.361 --> 00:26:50.220
April 15 comes this entry and it's the longest entry in her diary,

358
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.390
several pages and all around the outside of the pages.

359
00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:56.100
She blocking the edges.

360
00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:01.770
She writes the darkest day I ever remember this morning,

361
00:27:01.771 --> 00:27:04.800
the sun rose upon a nation jubilant with victory,

362
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.460
but it sets upon one plunged into deepest sorrow.

363
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.400
Her longest of all diary entries.

364
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:16.670
She talked about the shocking intelligence of Lincoln's murder and then says,

365
00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:23.520
where will Theresa never in the rapidity with which events crowd upon woman one

366
00:27:23.761 --> 00:27:26.880
another now is perfectly bewildering

367
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.870
indeed.
It was
now,

368
00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:40.910
as was so often the case in this war though Abraham Lincoln left one of the best

369
00:27:40.921 --> 00:27:45.921
descriptions of what the Ward Ben about and the greatest speech ever delivered

370
00:27:46.141 --> 00:27:49.890
by an American president.
I would venture that we could get up a debate on it,

371
00:27:49.891 --> 00:27:50.724
I'm sure,

372
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:55.050
but what are you going to put up against the second inaugural for an economy of

373
00:27:55.051 --> 00:27:58.230
language and the music of words and an honesty of meaning.

374
00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:02.370
Read the second inaugural and it takes about three minutes.

375
00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:07.270
He's been reelected.

376
00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:12.730
This is march 65 war's almost over.
Not there yet.

377
00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.810
What does he say in that speech?
What had it been about?

378
00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:22.150
How does he explain all the death?
He doesn't find that easy,

379
00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:29.140
but in the second paragraph and the third paragraph came,

380
00:28:29.141 --> 00:28:34.000
a few phrases that we've been trying to answer through interpretation in our 65

381
00:28:34.001 --> 00:28:36.370
to 70,000 books on the civil war,

382
00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:39.190
more than one a day that we've written ever since.

383
00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:45.690
He's thinking back to his first inaugural and he says both parties deprecated

384
00:28:46.001 --> 00:28:46.834
war,

385
00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:52.230
but one of them would make war rather than let the nations survive

386
00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:58.540
and the other would except war rather than let it perish.

387
00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.490
That's his interpretation.
Of course.

388
00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:06.340
Just kind of get vast disagreement on that from southerners and then the famous

389
00:29:06.341 --> 00:29:08.800
rays and the war came.

390
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:14.260
There are more titles of books on the civil war taken from this speech than

391
00:29:14.261 --> 00:29:16.540
anything else ever done.
When in doubt,

392
00:29:16.541 --> 00:29:19.480
people just go to Lincoln second inaugural and find some little phrase.

393
00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:22.660
If I can find three words somebody else hasn't used before and it becomes the

394
00:29:22.661 --> 00:29:23.560
title of their book

395
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:28.270
can have stamp using the war came the book on succession.

396
00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:31.870
Jim Mcpherson has a new book of essays out.

397
00:29:31.871 --> 00:29:34.370
It's called mighty scourge of war comes out of here.

398
00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:39.580
Steven [inaudible] biography of Abraham Lincoln,
malice toward none.

399
00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:43.600
I mean it's just endless.
But then in that next paragraph,

400
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:49.180
one eighth of the whole population were colored slaves

401
00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:55.980
three weeks ago when Barack Obama used the word slave slavery or slaves seven

402
00:29:56.261 --> 00:30:01.261
times in that remarkable speech is remarkable because it's been all together

403
00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:08.401
rare that presidents or presidential candidates have ever mouthed the word slave

404
00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:12.190
in American political rhetoric.

405
00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:14.890
<v 2>But Lincoln did</v>

406
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:18.450
<v 0>one eighth of the whole population were colored slaves,</v>

407
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:21.240
not distributed generally over the knee,
over the union,

408
00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:25.200
but localized in the southern part.
No kidding.

409
00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.930
And here it is.

410
00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:33.620
The slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest.

411
00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:39.150
Hello,
all new says,
Lincoln,

412
00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:44.340
that there's interest was somehow the cause of the war.

413
00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:50.900
Somehow that's the greatest somehow in American letters,

414
00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.250
we've been trying to explain the somehow

415
00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:55.673
<v 2>ever since</v>

416
00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:58.420
<v 0>we never quite pin it down,</v>

417
00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:02.320
and before that paragraphs over,

418
00:31:02.321 --> 00:31:05.350
you've been treated to some of the most beautiful rhetoric ever written,

419
00:31:05.351 --> 00:31:08.590
at least by an American president.
He says,

420
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:12.430
everybody wished for a result less fundamental and astounding.

421
00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:16.810
They didn't want all this revolution,
but that's what we got

422
00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.760
and then comes that line

423
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:24.900
for every drop of blood shed by the lash.

424
00:31:24.901 --> 00:31:27.810
It shall be paid by the sword.

425
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:34.710
You can't hear it or read it and not know what the war had been about.

426
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:40.263
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

427
00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:46.650
<v 0>we're going to deal in the next several lectures about the extended question of</v>

428
00:31:46.651 --> 00:31:51.651
results of this war and consequences short and long term and there are many

429
00:31:51.991 --> 00:31:56.991
things we can put on that list to say the least and let me just give you a short

430
00:31:57.871 --> 00:32:00.540
list to begin with and we're going to come back to so much of this

431
00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.750
quick list.
Just keep it handy

432
00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:13.480
and some of them are actually signaled and that second inaugural,
I mean one is,

433
00:32:13.481 --> 00:32:16.600
it's a session was killed

434
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:19.540
almost forever.

435
00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.210
I mean now and then you hear about the upper peninsula of Michigan wanting to

436
00:32:23.211 --> 00:32:24.280
succeed or something.

437
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:30.160
Texas once in a while gets back on its heels and says,

438
00:32:30.161 --> 00:32:34.630
don't mess with Texas and says they're going to succeed in some parts of the

439
00:32:34.631 --> 00:32:35.830
country.
Say Go ahead.

440
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:44.980
It was a fundamental change in the nature of American nationalism and the

441
00:32:45.711 --> 00:32:48.800
centralization of government that will come out of this war.

442
00:32:55.060 --> 00:33:00.060
11 of the first 12 amendments to the u s constitution had been written to limit

443
00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:02.020
national power.

444
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:03.000
<v 2>Okay.</v>

445
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.110
<v 0>It's just fundamental.</v>

446
00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:08.820
It's one of Lincoln's less fundamental than astounding results.

447
00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:14.140
Six is the next seven constitutional amendments will be directly to increase

448
00:33:14.491 --> 00:33:19.290
federal power.
More on that as we do reconstruction.

449
00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:25.110
Power itself was shift from south to north at least for a while.

450
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:27.540
In American political culture.

451
00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:33.750
Nativism will be put on the run at least for a while.

452
00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:37.200
Quite a while.
I mean the old native,

453
00:33:37.201 --> 00:33:40.620
his party and all that nativism of antebellum America and what are you going to

454
00:33:40.621 --> 00:33:43.270
do with all that xenophobia?

455
00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:47.790
Nativism in the wake of a war where one of every four union soldiers was foreign

456
00:33:47.791 --> 00:33:48.624
born

457
00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:54.490
and now they're US citizens claiming pensions on the u s government for saving

458
00:33:54.491 --> 00:33:56.050
the union.
Thank you very much.

459
00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:57.080
<v 2>Okay.</v>

460
00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:02.080
<v 0>What native is party's going to get any traction with union veterans in the 1870</v>

461
00:34:02.181 --> 00:34:03.014
[inaudible]

462
00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:04.053
<v 2>none.</v>

463
00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:11.600
<v 0>The labor movement and the women's rights movements on the other hand are going</v>

464
00:34:11.601 --> 00:34:14.530
to be crippled,
not ruined,

465
00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:18.220
but crippled by the civil war,

466
00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.790
by the authoritarianism of war all it's centralization

467
00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:29.260
and emancipation,
of course,
ushered into national life,

468
00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:34.510
all sorts of new challenges and new ideas,
new meanings,

469
00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:40.380
and this most difficult American idea of all racially quality.

470
00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:47.230
God,
what are you going to do with that?
Now?
It's been taken out of his barn,

471
00:34:47.231 --> 00:34:50.140
shuck from its shell,
but war,

472
00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:56.420
oh,
there'd be a thousand meetings.
We'll come on,

473
00:34:56.450 --> 00:34:57.980
come back to six or seven of them.

474
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:00.883
<v 2>No,</v>

475
00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:10.020
<v 0>I want to introduce reconstruction plans here in just one moment,</v>

476
00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:16.040
but at this particular moment in time of all the possible meanings,

477
00:35:18.091 --> 00:35:19.800
people are taking some of this war,

478
00:35:19.801 --> 00:35:21.750
and of course they're very different meanings.

479
00:35:21.751 --> 00:35:24.780
If you're one of those white Georgians who had to face Sherman's army,

480
00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:26.850
or if you're Kate stone out in Texas.

481
00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:29.140
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

482
00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:33.760
<v 0>Or if you're a widow of of your husband and four of your sons who've died in the</v>

483
00:35:33.761 --> 00:35:37.530
war.
I mean they're,
they're,
you know,
many,
many,

484
00:35:37.531 --> 00:35:39.210
many different individual stories.

485
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:43.740
But think back to what Lincoln had just said and the second inaugural about what

486
00:35:43.741 --> 00:35:48.000
the war had been about and the goodest chastening that it brought the country.

487
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:55.640
One of the most remarkable documents left from this massive documentation of

488
00:35:56.641 --> 00:36:00.810
this war and of emancipation is this letter.

489
00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:05.520
Perhaps you've seen it before.
It's getting reprinted now.

490
00:36:05.521 --> 00:36:10.521
And then it's a letter written by a former slave whose name was Jordan Anderson.

491
00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:17.020
How many of you have read Jordan Anderson's letter before?
Good.

492
00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:21.090
The Grad students have better?
Yes.
Well,

493
00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:23.010
this isn't in the summer of 65

494
00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:29.640
what are the war met Jordan Anderson had been a slave in Tennessee.

495
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:34.650
He's living in Ohio now.
The war's over.

496
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:40.670
He gets a letter from his old master who's name was Colonel Ph Anderson.

497
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.410
Jordan's living in Dayton,
Ohio,
and he writes back,
Colonel Anderson.

498
00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:50.460
So thank you very much for your letter.
Anderson wants me to come back

499
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.060
dear sir,

500
00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:59.810
I got your letter and was glad to find you had not forgotten old Jordan and that

501
00:37:00.451 --> 00:37:02.730
you wanted me to come back and live with you again.

502
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.570
Promising to do better for me then anybody else can.

503
00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.500
I have often felt uneasy about you.

504
00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:15.690
I thought the Yankees would have hung you long before this for harboring ribs

505
00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:19.620
they found at your house.
I suppose they never heard about.

506
00:37:19.621 --> 00:37:23.490
You're going to colonel Martins to kill the union soldier that was left by his

507
00:37:23.491 --> 00:37:24.840
company in their stable.

508
00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:30.750
Although you shot at me twice before I left you.
I did not want to hear.

509
00:37:30.751 --> 00:37:34.200
If you're being hurt and I'm glad you are still living,

510
00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:44.310
it would do me good to go back to the dear old home again.
See Ms Marin,

511
00:37:44.311 --> 00:37:47.370
Ms Martha,
and Alan and aster and green and Lee.

512
00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:52.920
Give my love to the mall and tell them I hope we will meet in the better world.

513
00:37:52.921 --> 00:37:54.030
If not in this,

514
00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:59.880
I would've gone back to see you all when I was working in the Nashville
hospital,

515
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:05.070
but one of the neighbors told me Henry intended to shoot me if he ever got a

516
00:38:05.071 --> 00:38:05.904
chance.

517
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:10.980
I want to know particularly what the good chance is you propose to give me.

518
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:12.780
I'm doing tolerably.

519
00:38:12.781 --> 00:38:17.150
Well here I get $25 a month with victuals and clothing.

520
00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.070
Have a comfortable home for Mandy is his wife.

521
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.210
The folks here at color and Mrs. Anderson and the children.

522
00:38:24.211 --> 00:38:28.320
Millie Jane in Grundy go to school and are learning.

523
00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:32.550
The teacher says Grundy has it had to be a preacher.

524
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:37.660
They go to Sunday school and Mandy and me attend church regularly.

525
00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:41.890
We are kindly treated.
Sometimes we over here,

526
00:38:41.891 --> 00:38:46.330
others saying them colored people were slaves down in Tennessee.

527
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:50.260
The children feel hurt when they hear such remarks,

528
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:53.710
but I will tell them it was no disgrace.

529
00:38:53.711 --> 00:38:55.840
In Tennessee to belong to Colonel Anderson.

530
00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:01.320
Many darkies would have been proud as I used to was to call you master.

531
00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:07.590
Now if you will write and say what wages you will give me,

532
00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:12.630
I will be better able to decide whether it would be to my advantage to make,
uh,

533
00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.980
to move back again as to my freedom,

534
00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:17.870
which you say I can have.

535
00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:23.110
There's nothing to be gained on that score is that got my free papers in 1864

536
00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:26.380
from the provost Marshal General of the Department of Nashville.

537
00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:31.750
Mandy says she would be afraid to go back without some proof that you are

538
00:39:31.751 --> 00:39:36.751
sincerely disposed to treat us justly and we have concluded to test your

539
00:39:37.661 --> 00:39:42.661
sincerity by asking you to send us our wages for the time we served you.

540
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:51.870
This will make us forget and forgive old scores and rely on your justice and

541
00:39:53.111 --> 00:39:55.000
friendship in the future.

542
00:39:56.050 --> 00:40:00.370
I served you faithfully for 32 years and Mandy,

543
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:05.790
20 years at $25 a month for me and $2 a week for Mandy.

544
00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:12.060
Our earnings would amount to $11,680 add to this the interest

545
00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:22.130
for the time our wages has been kept back and deduct what you paid for our

546
00:40:22.131 --> 00:40:25.730
clothing.
And three doctors visits for me and pulling a tooth for Mandy.

547
00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:30.200
And the balance will show what we are injustice entitled to.

548
00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:35.970
Please send the money by Adam's express care of the winters,
Esquire,
Dayton,
Ohio.

549
00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:41.400
It goes on another paragraph and then as a ps,

550
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:46.590
say howdy to George Carter and thank him for taking the pistol from you.

551
00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:48.150
When you were shooting at me,

552
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.770
what does freedom mean?
What are the war meant?

553
00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:59.670
Wages with interest according to Jordan Anderson.

554
00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:05.950
Well,
we'll see whether the United States would

555
00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.770
help out old Jordan.
All right.

556
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:17.390
Now reconstruction is of course that 10 or 11 year period of American history

557
00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.040
that sometimes too often,

558
00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:29.190
I dunno how I was taught to you,
but sometimes too often we skirt through.

559
00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:34.940
It's complicated and not as much glory to go is there is during the war,

560
00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:40.580
it's fraught with some skulduggery and corruption on an unprecedented scale and

561
00:41:40.581 --> 00:41:41.780
all kinds of sides.

562
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:48.310
It's a time of enormous imagination and experimentation and politics and law.

563
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:55.510
It's also the time in American history when we had by far our largest level of

564
00:41:56.781 --> 00:42:00.410
domestic terrorism and violence.
Good deal.

565
00:42:00.411 --> 00:42:02.240
More on that in the weeks to come.

566
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:04.200
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

567
00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:09.000
<v 0>The reconstruction policy of course began during the war.
The debate's over.</v>

568
00:42:09.001 --> 00:42:14.001
Reconstruction policy began during the war and it is

569
00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:19.490
<v 2>one second.
Excuse me.</v>

570
00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:31.340
Don't you hate that?
No.
What did I do?

571
00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:44.490
<v 0>Well,
sorry.
I had Herman Melville's poem here,</v>

572
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:47.850
but what did I do with Herman Melville?
Forgive me.
Check that.

573
00:42:47.851 --> 00:42:49.270
As the old sports announcer use design,

574
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:57.370
the policies on reconstruction took two paths and those paths begin as early as

575
00:42:58.431 --> 00:43:03.431
late 1863 and there especially being debated in the federal government in 1864

576
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:10.400
and they are ripe by the end of the war in 1865

577
00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:12.230
<v 2>yeah.</v>

578
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:17.230
<v 0>Lincoln's basic approach to reconstruction when and if they could end the war</v>

579
00:43:17.841 --> 00:43:20.630
when the war and stop it

580
00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:25.310
was to make reconstruction as fast as possible,

581
00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:29.210
as lenient as possible.
Remember these three things.

582
00:43:29.211 --> 00:43:33.860
You're going to hear it again as fast as possible,
as lenient as possible,

583
00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:38.240
and as much as possible under presidential authority,

584
00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:41.720
not congress is going to,

585
00:43:41.721 --> 00:43:44.330
fashion is so called 10% plan,

586
00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.820
which I'll explain next time,

587
00:43:46.821 --> 00:43:51.630
but in essence meant that he wanted 10% of the voting pump,

588
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:56.650
the white voting population of a former confederate state to take a loyalty oath

589
00:43:56.931 --> 00:44:00.440
to the Union to redraw a new constitution,

590
00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:03.920
denounce the session except emancipation,

591
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:08.240
and they would be readmitted to the union under presidential authority and he

592
00:44:08.241 --> 00:44:13.070
wanted to do as much of it as possible during the war because when the war ends,

593
00:44:13.071 --> 00:44:15.110
he could lose his presidential war powers

594
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:19.980
in Congress,
in his own party,

595
00:44:19.981 --> 00:44:23.640
led by Thaddeus Stevens in the house and Charles Sumner and the Senate and

596
00:44:23.641 --> 00:44:27.090
you'll learn a good deal more about them two weeks to come.

597
00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:29.020
<v 2>Okay.</v>

598
00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:32.490
<v 0>There's a very different approach to reconstruction.
The Cook,</v>

599
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.040
the congressional radicals,
as they become known,

600
00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:40.850
Republicans all want to reconstruction that is longer harsher

601
00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:47.010
and under congressional control.

602
00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:51.170
Oh Lincoln won't be around of course,

603
00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:55.580
to engage in this battle after the war is over.

604
00:44:55.970 --> 00:45:00.970
But he was there during the war and they had quite a tussle over imagining how

605
00:45:01.971 --> 00:45:06.920
reconstruction,
what happened.
No.

606
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:10.490
If you want to get a sense of Lincoln's approach to reconstruction

607
00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:15.500
now you can read the last paragraph is the second inaugural about malice toward

608
00:45:15.501 --> 00:45:19.310
none charity for all and binding up the nation's wounds and so forth.

609
00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:23.240
But there's also the statement he made in his last cabinet meeting,

610
00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:27.680
the last meeting and have his cabinet before he went to Ford's theatre.

611
00:45:27.681 --> 00:45:32.090
Literally that night
he said to his cabinet,

612
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:37.420
and I'm quoting,
I hope that there will be no persecutions,

613
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:40.190
no bloody work after the war is over.

614
00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:45.530
No one knew you'd expect me to take any part in hanging or killing these men.

615
00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:50.570
Even the worst of them frightened them out of the country,
open the gates,

616
00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:53.360
let down the bars,
scare them off,

617
00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:55.940
but enough lives had been sacrificed.

618
00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:58.820
That's one approach,

619
00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:04.160
but that is not the approach or the leaders of the congressional Republicans.

620
00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:09.290
Some of them would have wished for there to be some trees and trials and

621
00:46:09.291 --> 00:46:13.490
executions,
but short of that they want to reconstruction.

622
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:16.940
It's going to reshape the American polity.

623
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:20.120
Rewrite the u s constitution

624
00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:27.030
and remake southern society.
Hey,

625
00:46:27.031 --> 00:46:30.930
when I ever run into says reconstruction is too complicated and not interesting,

626
00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:37.150
I don't understand it because how can you have that kind of thing happening and

627
00:46:37.151 --> 00:46:41.920
then not be interesting but fun.
Melville,

628
00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:45.520
sorry,
I'll leave you with this.

629
00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:47.950
Spare the poets.

630
00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:53.020
Melville wrote this little poem after Lincoln was murdered.

631
00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:55.030
Listen to what he says.

632
00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:04.720
Good Friday was the day of the prodigy in crime when they killed him in his

633
00:47:05.061 --> 00:47:05.894
pity,

634
00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:11.170
when they killed him in his prime of clemency and calm.

635
00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:12.831
When we're the yearning,

636
00:47:12.831 --> 00:47:17.831
he was filled to redeem the evil willed and though conqueror be kind,

637
00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:25.100
but they killed him in his kindness,
in their madness,
in their blindness,

638
00:47:25.101 --> 00:47:26.690
and they killed him from behind.

639
00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:32.430
There is of the strong and appall upon the land,

640
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:37.260
but the people in there weeping,
bear and iron hand.

641
00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:42.180
Beware of the people weeping when they bear the iron hand.

642
00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:47.740
He lives in his blood,
the father and his face,
they have killed him.

643
00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:51.340
The forgiver.
The avenger now takes his place.

644
00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:54.070
The Avenger Wisely Stern,

645
00:47:54.071 --> 00:47:57.820
who in righteousness shall do what the heavens call him too,

646
00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:02.050
and the parasites remand for they killed him in his kindness,

647
00:48:02.051 --> 00:48:06.550
in their madness and their blindness and his blood is on their hand.

648
00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:12.570
Okay.
There is sobbing of the strong and appall upon the land,

649
00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:14.730
but the people in there weeping,

650
00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:20.330
bear the iron hand be where the people weeping when they bear an iron hand.

651
00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:27.150
The whole history of reconstruction has always been a debate really,

652
00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:32.850
or how iron the hand should have been.
Thank you.

653
00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:33.570
See you next week.
