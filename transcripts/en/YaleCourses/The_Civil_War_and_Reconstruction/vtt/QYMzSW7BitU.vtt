00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.180
This week,
you're reading hospitals,
sketches,
the short

2
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.120
and in some ways extraordinary little novel written by Louisa May Alcott based

3
00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:27.520
upon her.
Well,

4
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.200
Lisa May Alcott of little women fame if you happen to have grown up on that
book.

5
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.170
Daughter of Bronson Alcott,

6
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.190
a famous and extremely eccentric new England reformer and utopian,

7
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.230
but she went to war as a young nurse,

8
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.410
couldn't stay away,

9
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.270
and she kept her sketches about her experiences of a young woman confronting the

10
00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:04.460
horror of civil war hospitals.

11
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.330
This is a photograph of,
it is not.

12
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.470
Louisa may Alcott.

13
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.500
I don't think I have one of those young nurses sitting on a civil war hospital

14
00:01:18.231 --> 00:01:19.610
in 1863

15
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.050
probably a writing a letter.

16
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.370
They spend a lot of their time writing letters for sick or dying or wounded

17
00:01:32.151 --> 00:01:32.990
soldiers.

18
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.013
<v 1>Okay.</v>

19
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.520
<v 0>I think what you can find an Alcott's novel among other things,</v>

20
00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:43.670
it's almost like a descriptive documentary novel.

21
00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:46.610
It's almost like she summed up or diary

22
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.350
is the human encounter,
particularly a woman's,

23
00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:56.351
a young woman's encounter with what war does to the human body,

24
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.570
the human psyche,
to human beings

25
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.350
now,
good Lord.
It is.
18 years ago,

26
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.080
Ken Burns produced,

27
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.740
can it really be a series on public television called the civil war?

28
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.090
As every opening of it says,
brought to you by General Motors,

29
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.830
nine episodes in 11 hours garnered the largest public television audience ever.

30
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.260
Um,

31
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.460
the estimate was that the first time through about 30 million Americans watched

32
00:02:37.461 --> 00:02:40.790
it then it's been rerun many,
many times.

33
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.050
I went to Germany to teach for a year in 1992 and 93 and when I arrived in the

34
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.830
fall of 1992 on German national television,

35
00:02:51.831 --> 00:02:53.870
they were running the Ken Burns film series,

36
00:02:53.871 --> 00:02:57.140
all 11 hours of it dubbed into German

37
00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:59.800
and was weird

38
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.140
because there was one male voice and one female voice for all the voices.

39
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.490
Of course,
one of the tricks or one of the techniques,

40
00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:11.880
one of the quite brilliant techniques of burns,

41
00:03:11.881 --> 00:03:16.881
his film was the many different voices he used garrison Keillor for Walt

42
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.220
Whitman,
Sam Waterston for Abraham Lincoln,
et Cetera,

43
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.010
voices that you,

44
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.700
in many ways they're Americans in any ways we're comfortable with in their

45
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:28.534
living room.

46
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.100
They knew Sam Waterston didn't him as well as I know him now from law and order,

47
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.340
but they knew garrison Keillor's voice.

48
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:39.400
And when garrison Keillor came on every night,
it was Walt Whitman.

49
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:43.623
At any rate,

50
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.860
I was Spanish at the reaction in Germany.

51
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:51.790
There were articles in the paper,
editorials and so on and so on.

52
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.180
I had one German student come up to me one day after watching an episode of it

53
00:03:57.761 --> 00:04:00.820
and listening to one of my lectures and he said,

54
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.610
why were there so many sunsets and moonrises and that documentary film?

55
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.470
I said,
wow.
He caught me off guard.
It's a watch.

56
00:04:12.471 --> 00:04:17.471
A good question probably because burns is a sentimental film maker

57
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.280
and as a great deal of sentiment in the structure and the music and in the mode

58
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.440
of that film series.

59
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.380
And I defy you to watch one or two hours and not be harming the show.

60
00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:36.750
Can farewell and the shower the next morning.

61
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.400
<v 1>Uh,
da Da da Da.</v>

62
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.940
<v 0>Um,
uh,</v>

63
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.200
uh,
it is a haunting violin.

64
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.240
It wasn't as some people say,
written for that film series.
It's much older.

65
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.330
At any rate it is assigned in the course,
at least major parts of it.

66
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.000
You can access it.

67
00:05:06.001 --> 00:05:10.620
I'm actually going to assign you episodes two through nine.

68
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.160
That's eight out of the nine.
If you skip one or two,
only the gods will,
no,

69
00:05:17.161 --> 00:05:19.290
I'm sure.
Yeah.
But they will know

70
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.520
it is all available on the Internet at Yale to the film archive.

71
00:05:29.991 --> 00:05:33.930
And perhaps you,
how many of you have done this before for courses?
Fabulous.

72
00:05:33.931 --> 00:05:38.280
You've done this.
All right.
I checked this morning.
The Url,

73
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.520
if you can read this,
I don't know if you can read this.
Can you read this?
Yes,

74
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.560
yes.
In the front.
In the back.
No.

75
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.060
How about now?
Whoa.

76
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.760
yale.edu/collabs see labs.

77
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:02.690
I don't know what the something that stands for that's for MACs.

78
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.530
They tell me that this is better on pcs,

79
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.560
the easier on pcs and macs and you might have to download a patch to do it on a

80
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:13.004
Mac.

81
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.430
<v 1>True,
false.
Don't know</v>

82
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.020
<v 0>anybody.
Done it recently and of course</v>

83
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.153
<v 1>help</v>

84
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.090
<v 0>you all raised your hands.
You've done this before.
Don't remember.
It's also easy.</v>

85
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.780
Okay,
good.
Uh,
over the next five,

86
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:34.490
including spring break week.
You're in Jamaica spring break week.

87
00:06:34.491 --> 00:06:37.550
You can access Ken Burns film,

88
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.630
you can be humming and the shogun farewell in the shower with somebody in

89
00:06:41.631 --> 00:06:42.464
Jamaica.

90
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.170
That's terrible.
The best laugh I've had in this course.

91
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.300
You're just like everybody else.
At any rate,
that's the Url,

92
00:06:57.301 --> 00:06:58.880
ladies and gentlemen,
and then you,

93
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.170
you know you need use your net id to access it.

94
00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:05.160
If you have any problem with this,
let us know immediately and we will help you.

95
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.170
It is assigned and we're going to discuss it.

96
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.390
I love a final exam question.
Don't always use it.

97
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.540
That actually draws upon him as a source.

98
00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.990
<v 1>Just thought I'd say that.
Okay.</v>

99
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.690
<v 0>There also is in the syllabus this week.
Of course,
a very vague reading.</v>

100
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.060
You're reading hospital sketches which is short,

101
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.000
but then it says selective choices.

102
00:07:35.001 --> 00:07:40.001
There's select select selections from about 50 pages of documents and the gap

103
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:45.340
book and about 40 pages of dispatchers and documents and letters by Lincoln and

104
00:07:45.681 --> 00:07:46.514
the Lincoln reader.

105
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.480
We're going to pin that down for you at our lunch today and you'll be fired.

106
00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:54.830
An email before this afternoon,
uh,
perhaps,
uh,
in May,

107
00:07:54.831 --> 00:07:58.520
may be individualized by your teaching assistant as to which of those documents

108
00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:00.260
you might especially want to concentrate on.

109
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.890
But in those two sections of Ganapathy and,
and Johnson,

110
00:08:03.891 --> 00:08:07.910
if you haven't looked yet and you should,
you get link a day by day.

111
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:12.260
In some cases you get Lincoln's orders and dispatches to his generals,

112
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.780
his attempt to become the war president,

113
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.650
including that first document in that section where Lincoln Lazy right after the

114
00:08:18.651 --> 00:08:20.090
disaster at bull run,

115
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:25.210
he lays out nine or 10 very direct orders all beginning with the word.

116
00:08:26.361 --> 00:08:30.620
Let,
let that be this letter,
be that let to be this,
let there be that.

117
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.020
And you also find in these documents,
specially in the Ganapathy reader,

118
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:41.230
some of those incredibly megalomaniac letters by George Be Mcclellan.

119
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:49.070
If ever there was a more vain character in American military history and

120
00:08:49.081 --> 00:08:50.130
political history,

121
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.190
well there've been a lot thing characters in American political history,

122
00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:57.600
God knows.
But if ever anybody left,

123
00:08:57.601 --> 00:09:00.780
more egregiously vein,

124
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.780
utterly self serving,

125
00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:05.763
<v 1>okay.</v>

126
00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:11.910
<v 0>Letters and dispatch is about his own sense of self glory.</v>

127
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
It is Mcclellan who by all rights probably should have been court martialed

128
00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.680
but wasn't.
That's another story.
We'll come back to

129
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.620
mine.
Eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.

130
00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:37.390
He has loose the fateful lightning with his terrible swift sword.

131
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:44.330
He is trampling out the vintage where the Grapes of Wrath are stored.

132
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.930
It's possibly the most famous poetry in American music.

133
00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.790
It's also apocalyptic.

134
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.870
Some would say purple

135
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.820
and it's blood.
Hey Julia Ward.

136
00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:07.821
How wrote the famous battle hymn of the republic in early 1862 while overlooking

137
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:14.070
I going camp money,
huge encampment of the Union army near Washington

138
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.440
and she stayed until sunset and saw the fires,

139
00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:21.630
which she called the watch fires

140
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:27.480
and she wrote the great apocalyptic pay on of the civil war.

141
00:10:27.481 --> 00:10:32.060
We will come back to this question especially next week when we deal with the,

142
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.750
the story.
The problem with emancipation at the beginning of this war,

143
00:10:36.751 --> 00:10:41.160
as we'll see in a moment,
most people expected something short,

144
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.090
might've been just beer,
a lot of fun.

145
00:10:45.091 --> 00:10:48.960
The summer outing and adventure chance to whip some Yankees.

146
00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.750
Maybe shoot a rebel too.

147
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:52.943
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

148
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.330
<v 0>But if it became very long at all,
and that's the point,</v>

149
00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:01.590
it became very long at all.
It's aims,
its goals,

150
00:11:01.591 --> 00:11:05.040
its strategies,
it's purposes would have to chain.

151
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:11.390
It's why the thinking people of 1861 feared along war Lincoln most definitely

152
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:19.790
and most prominently he feared what as he said in his,

153
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.790
uh,
Mommy said it in the second inaugural.

154
00:11:23.791 --> 00:11:28.791
He set it also earlier in his annual message at the end of 1861 he feared a long

155
00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:34.820
quote remorseless revolutionary struggle because a long remorseless

156
00:11:35.851 --> 00:11:40.851
revolutionary struggle would have very different fundamental results in that

157
00:11:42.391 --> 00:11:46.530
second inaugural.
Again,
one of those famous passages from that speech,

158
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:51.090
Lincoln said,
all had hoped that was at the end of it all had hoped.

159
00:11:51.091 --> 00:11:55.990
He said for quote,
a result,
less fundamental and astounding,

160
00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.300
but because of this war will not be short.

161
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.920
It will become all out and total depending on whose interpretation and argument

162
00:12:07.351 --> 00:12:10.440
you accept the terms of what is modern total war.

163
00:12:10.441 --> 00:12:15.310
And we'll come back to that question.
The results would become fundamental

164
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:21.820
<v 1>and transform it to
now.</v>

165
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:30.330
Oops.
Sorry.
Okay.

166
00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.550
<v 0>We always still titles from</v>

167
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.780
Julia Ward.
How,
just like we do from Lincoln,

168
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:49.800
that's actually a photograph of
bull run creek.
I don't know.

169
00:12:49.801 --> 00:12:53.250
It could be a creek anywhere.
I know,
but trust me,
that's bull run creek.

170
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.620
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

171
00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:00.620
<v 0>There were 523 west point graduates who fought in the Mexican war</v>

172
00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:06.050
and that war back in 1846 to 48 it'd become a kind of,

173
00:13:06.051 --> 00:13:08.780
if you like military primer for so many of them

174
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:15.420
and the vast majority of those would end up in the civil war on both sides.

175
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.860
Ulysses grant,
class of 43 William Tecumseh Sherman,

176
00:13:20.861 --> 00:13:24.160
class of 40 Williams one winfield Scott Hancock,

177
00:13:24.161 --> 00:13:26.200
class of 44 George Thomas,

178
00:13:26.201 --> 00:13:31.201
class of 40 George has made class of 35 Joseph Hooker,

179
00:13:31.721 --> 00:13:36.670
class of 30 John Sedgwick,
class of 37 Joseph,
he Johnston,

180
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:39.430
most notably Robert E.
Lee,

181
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.030
class of 1829 versus business class

182
00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.130
later commandant of West Point.

183
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.480
They'd all learned to kind of warrior culture if you like.

184
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:55.890
They're all taking a very deep and abiding oath.

185
00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:01.050
It was a very difficult thing to do for west point graduates on the southern

186
00:14:01.051 --> 00:14:05.010
side to abandon that oath and go with their states.

187
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:10.100
But of course many,
many,
many of them did.

188
00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:14.940
As Oliver Otis Howard,

189
00:14:14.941 --> 00:14:19.941
well West Point graduate later Union Corps commander lost his arm in the

190
00:14:20.611 --> 00:14:25.611
Petersburg campaign and later first leader head of the Freedmen's bureau after

191
00:14:26.521 --> 00:14:28.980
the civil war and for whom Howard University is named

192
00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:32.200
said quote,

193
00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:37.000
probably no other place existed where men grappled more sensitively with the

194
00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:41.550
troublesome problems of succession.
No kidding.

195
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:44.973
<v 1>Now</v>

196
00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:48.490
<v 0>the numbers of this,
um,</v>

197
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:54.360
there was a kind of a stampede of west point cadets back to the south at least

198
00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.580
to a certain degree.

199
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:04.780
And Ohio Cadet named Tali McCray wrote to his sweetheart is 18,

200
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.830
April,
1861.

201
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.220
This has been an eventful week in the history of West Point.

202
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:14.420
There has been such a stampede of cadets as was never known before.

203
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.750
30 to resign and were relieved from duty on Monday,

204
00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:19.850
April 22 and since then,

205
00:15:19.851 --> 00:15:24.770
enough to increase the number to more than 40.
All right now,

206
00:15:24.771 --> 00:15:27.650
few cadets from any southern state left here

207
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:35.630
in all 74 southern cadets resigned and were dismissed for refusing to take the

208
00:15:35.761 --> 00:15:37.950
oath of allegiance to the United States,

209
00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:43.910
but 21 southern cadets from slave states remained and would eventually fight for

210
00:15:46.831 --> 00:15:47.664
the union.

211
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:53.870
This was a far higher proportion of loyalist then southern students at Harvard,

212
00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:00.630
Yale,
or Columbia at Princeton,

213
00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.290
not one southern student remained at the college,

214
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:09.180
so the old southern tradition at Princeton make no mistake.

215
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:14.620
There are many extraordinary witnesses to these breakups,
that west point.

216
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.370
Here's just one of them.

217
00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:19.170
<v 1>Okay.</v>

218
00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:24.170
<v 0>The Cadet George Armstrong Custer class of 1861 that Custer recalled walking</v>

219
00:16:26.221 --> 00:16:31.221
sentinel duty in June of 61 and seeing 15 defecting southern cadets marching

220
00:16:35.371 --> 00:16:37.410
toward a steamboat landing on the Hudson.

221
00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:39.410
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

222
00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:43.720
<v 0>I quote him too far off to exchange verbal ado.</v>

223
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.670
Even if military discipline had permitted,

224
00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:49.940
they caught sight of me a step by step.

225
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:54.020
I reluctantly paid the penalty of offended regulations.

226
00:16:54.021 --> 00:16:59.021
That's why he's doing this guard duty and raise their hats and token farewell to

227
00:17:00.951 --> 00:17:05.330
which first casting my eyes about to see that no watchful,

228
00:17:05.331 --> 00:17:06.770
superior wasn't view.

229
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:12.500
I responded by bringing my musket to a present.

230
00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:17.973
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

231
00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:22.100
<v 0>Customer would later be proud of how many southerners he had killed.</v>

232
00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.040
Yeah.
The next whole section of this course,

233
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:33.110
I want to suggest some questions that we want to hope that you will leave you

234
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:34.900
with the answers for

235
00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:38.870
and you can write these down and hold me to it if you want.

236
00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:40.760
We can disagree about those answers,

237
00:17:40.761 --> 00:17:44.750
but that's what history is ultimately for one.

238
00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.110
Why did the north wind this war?

239
00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:51.393
<v 1>Two,</v>

240
00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:54.110
<v 0>why did the south lose it?</v>

241
00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:57.083
<v 1>Three,</v>

242
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:05.480
<v 0>what did making war and experiencing it mean to common soldiers,</v>

243
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:09.450
to officers,
to their families,

244
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.810
to the women left at home and the women who went to the front.

245
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:16.850
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

246
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:18.440
<v 0>How did the war for,</v>

247
00:18:18.441 --> 00:18:23.441
how did the war on leash or reinforce or reshape 19th century values and

248
00:18:25.431 --> 00:18:30.431
attitudes on Americans of the 1860s confronted war on this scale?

249
00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:37.090
80% of all white males in the American south between the age of 16 and 45 will

250
00:18:40.431 --> 00:18:44.870
be in the army.
80% in the northern states,

251
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:49.930
50% much higher population of all white males between 18 and 45 will be in the

252
00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:53.300
army or the navy.

253
00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.620
You imagine if we had 50% of the American,
let's just,

254
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:03.680
let's just count the white males in the United States today under arms,

255
00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:08.540
through a draft.
Whole lot of you wouldn't be here.

256
00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:15.280
What did five what did the war itself mean?
On both sides?

257
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.280
It's cars.
It's purpose.

258
00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:23.850
That developing sense of the reason people fight.

259
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:27.390
What was it about

260
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:31.303
<v 1>six?</v>

261
00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:37.300
<v 0>What were the wars results?
What were its consequences</v>

262
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.990
towards have meanings that we are obliged to discern?

263
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:49.790
<v 1>Uh,
yeah.
Seven.</v>

264
00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:53.560
<v 0>Why were the slaves free?</v>

265
00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.480
How did emancipation come when it came the way it came?

266
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:01.903
<v 1>Eight</v>

267
00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:09.270
<v 0>was it the American civil war?
A second American revolution?
Yes.</v>

268
00:20:09.271 --> 00:20:12.570
No,
maybe in between.
Is it the wrong term?
Is there a better one?

269
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:16.223
<v 1>Nine.</v>

270
00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.860
<v 0>What is it?
The place of this pivotal transformative event</v>

271
00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:27.930
<v 1>in America's national memory
and 10</v>

272
00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:35.450
<v 0>God,
I hope we can answer some of these.
Was the civil war a just war.</v>

273
00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:42.640
<v 1>Okay.
When the war came</v>

274
00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:47.980
back to that

275
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.490
<v 0>little picture of bull run in a moment,
but when the war came,
of course</v>

276
00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:03.910
Americans had to now decide how to fight a war they had never mobilized for like

277
00:21:04.551 --> 00:21:07.070
they're gonna mobilize in this war.
Although at the beginning,

278
00:21:07.071 --> 00:21:12.071
no one really had any clue of the scale of the mobilization in industry and

279
00:21:13.221 --> 00:21:18.170
resources and transportation and in human power that the war would would bring.

280
00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:24.370
Let's examine just for a moment this question of union advantages and southern

281
00:21:24.771 --> 00:21:25.370
advantages,

282
00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:29.720
strengths and weaknesses on both sides at the outset of the war and even through

283
00:21:29.721 --> 00:21:30.554
it,

284
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:35.270
it has a great deal to do with ultimately explaining union victory and

285
00:21:35.271 --> 00:21:39.260
confederate defeat,
although it is not by itself and explanation,

286
00:21:39.261 --> 00:21:42.860
the north didn't just win the war because it had more industrial capacity.

287
00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:45.680
Or as Ken Burns has Shelby Foote say at one point,

288
00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:50.750
a star of his film has Shelby Foote.
Say at one point in the film,

289
00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.320
the north fought that war with one hand behind his back.

290
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.390
Bullshit Shelby.

291
00:21:57.391 --> 00:22:01.610
They really did not fight that war with one hand behind their back.
Uh,

292
00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:07.190
but it helps make a nice explanation or the beginnings of a nice explanation for

293
00:22:08.701 --> 00:22:12.330
southern defeat and were many union advantages.

294
00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:14.520
Let me just tick off several.

295
00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:20.180
First in finances were the north had and most of this in New York City and a

296
00:22:20.941 --> 00:22:25.590
couple other cities had four times the bank deposits as the southern states.

297
00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:29.820
Even though most of the southern states had their bank deposits in northern

298
00:22:29.821 --> 00:22:32.700
banks in manufacturing,

299
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:38.600
there were 110,000 manufacturing establishments in the northern states with 1.2

300
00:22:40.741 --> 00:22:45.741
million industrial workers in 1860 the north had four times.

301
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.233
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

302
00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.320
<v 0>Oh,
I already said that.
The bank deposits for give me the north had</v>

303
00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:57.500
the north,
excuse me.

304
00:22:57.501 --> 00:23:02.501
There were as many factories in the north as there were industrial workers in

305
00:23:03.081 --> 00:23:03.914
the south

306
00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:10.530
and the neighborhood of a hundred and a hundred thousand or so small

307
00:23:11.201 --> 00:23:15.040
manufacturing industrial workers of one kind and another in southern towns and

308
00:23:15.041 --> 00:23:19.660
cities.
The northern states had that many manufacturing establishments.

309
00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:25.440
80% of all industrial capacity in the United States.
We're in the free stage

310
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:33.690
one Connecticut County,
new Haven County,

311
00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:34.793
this town,

312
00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:40.010
and it's county produced firearms valued at 10 times the entire,

313
00:23:42.121 --> 00:23:46.800
the entire southern capacity to produce in 1860 now,

314
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:50.360
the sound's going to improve that greatly through the tredegar ironworks in

315
00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:52.190
Richmond in particular and other places,

316
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:55.520
but new haven,

317
00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:59.870
Connecticut produce 10 times the firearms is an entire south put together in

318
00:23:59.871 --> 00:24:04.790
1860 those shelves of some of those old factories in this town that are no

319
00:24:04.791 --> 00:24:09.240
longer factories were gun factories.
Man,

320
00:24:09.241 --> 00:24:11.070
did they get rich during the civil war?

321
00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:13.043
<v 1>Okay,</v>

322
00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:18.100
<v 0>and transportation.
80% of all railroad miles in the United States,</v>

323
00:24:18.101 --> 00:24:19.570
the former United States,

324
00:24:19.571 --> 00:24:24.571
we're in the northern states of the 470 locomotives made in the United States by

325
00:24:25.661 --> 00:24:30.661
1860 only 19 of them had been made in the south.

326
00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:35.670
North had the vast,

327
00:24:35.671 --> 00:24:39.690
vast majority of skilled mechanics who worked on railroads.

328
00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:44.850
The North tended to have uniform gauges to their railroads three or four feet

329
00:24:44.851 --> 00:24:49.440
wide to the track.
In the south.
They had this ridiculous problem,
frankly,

330
00:24:49.441 --> 00:24:52.080
and they will not solve it very quickly.

331
00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:56.610
That the south build is railroads haphazardly,
state by state,
by state,
by state,

332
00:24:56.611 --> 00:24:59.280
and all kinds of different gauges.
Three and a half feet here,

333
00:24:59.281 --> 00:25:01.380
four feet therefore and a half feet there.

334
00:25:01.381 --> 00:25:04.320
You'd go into one town with a railroad gauge.
This one width,

335
00:25:04.321 --> 00:25:07.170
but it goes out the other side of town of the gauges,
another width.

336
00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:08.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

337
00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:10.490
<v 0>You had the switch silica motors and switch trains.</v>

338
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:12.590
<v 1>Okay.</v>

339
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:15.950
<v 0>As ridiculous as that sounds.
If I'm not in a hurry.</v>

340
00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:21.470
What a misery that would cause another northern advantage was simply in

341
00:25:21.471 --> 00:25:23.930
manpower.
Just to look at the population numbers,

342
00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:29.620
the population of the North was approximately 22 and a half million people in

343
00:25:29.661 --> 00:25:30.580
1860

344
00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:36.530
the population of the south was slightly over 9 million white people.

345
00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:37.980
<v 1>Okay.</v>

346
00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:41.550
<v 0>And about four and a half million black people.</v>

347
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.920
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

348
00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.170
<v 0>about 4.2 million of whom were slaves.</v>

349
00:25:45.171 --> 00:25:48.440
The other 250 to 300,000 who were free blacks.

350
00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:59.070
Northern states produced 94% of all cloth in the United States in 1860,

351
00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:03.840
93% of all pig iron and on and on and on boats,
ships,

352
00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.620
it's all 80,
90,
95% in favor of the north.

353
00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:11.610
William Tecumseh Sherman,
uh,

354
00:26:11.611 --> 00:26:15.960
was sitting in New Orleans where he was stationed when succession occurred in

355
00:26:15.961 --> 00:26:20.160
the war broke out and they prolate 1861 and according to his testimony,

356
00:26:20.161 --> 00:26:24.060
he said to his friend who had actually been at west point,
buddy of his,

357
00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.550
he warned him and he said,
quote,

358
00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:31.730
no nation of agriculturalists ever made war on a nation of mechanics and

359
00:26:31.831 --> 00:26:35.970
survived.
Yeah,
it's very prescient.

360
00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:39.590
But I don't want you to think that you,
the north,

361
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:44.630
the confederate success or victory was somehow that the outset because of all

362
00:26:46.141 --> 00:26:50.130
these economic,
financial,
industrial advantages,

363
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:52.733
<v 1>okay,</v>

364
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.080
<v 0>the north had certain political advantages.</v>

365
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:58.650
It did not have to create a government.
You'd already had one

366
00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.630
at a function in government.
Now 11 of those states are no longer be represented.

367
00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.790
There going to be gone.
But there a function in US federal government,

368
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.350
the south has to create that government overnight.

369
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.930
And it has to create it out of a political culture rooted in states' rights and

370
00:27:15.931 --> 00:27:20.400
localism.
And furthermore,

371
00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.650
and I,
this is a very important point.

372
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:25.890
The North had a functioning political party system.

373
00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:31.140
There were still functioning Democrats and the north very strong in certain

374
00:27:31.141 --> 00:27:32.130
pockets of the norm.

375
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:36.990
They will be a genuine opposition party to Lincoln's Republicans during the war.

376
00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:42.110
They will make a comeback in the congress in 80 62,
they got clobbered in 1860.

377
00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:50.060
The South doesn't have a party system.
South has a one party system.

378
00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:51.710
They appointed Jefferson Davis.

379
00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:58.050
The south will not hold the general election for the presidency and vice

380
00:27:58.051 --> 00:28:01.770
presidency during this war.
Why is that important?

381
00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:05.250
Why wouldn't you have a functioning political party system you way?

382
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.310
You have a way of organizing power in organizing patronage,

383
00:28:08.311 --> 00:28:12.900
in organizing a loyalty.
When a Jefferson date will see this soon.

384
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:17.640
Thursday want to Jefferson Davis is greatest problems and biggest crises

385
00:28:17.641 --> 00:28:22.641
throughout the war is trying to get the southern states to go along with various

386
00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:28.210
confederate federal policies,
knee and uh,

387
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:29.760
he will fail it much of that

388
00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.570
now south was not without advantages.
Look at a map.

389
00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:40.420
You could argue that the south had a great advantage of geography if the user

390
00:28:40.421 --> 00:28:44.680
didn't.
Well,
the south is a huge expanse of territory.

391
00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:50.050
Huge.
Thousands of,
what is it?
A almost a 2000 mile coastline,

392
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:53.950
a 1500 mile coastline,
I believe if you add up,
you know,

393
00:28:53.951 --> 00:28:55.990
Florida all the way up to Virginia.

394
00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:01.880
And when Lincoln announced the call coffers for 75,000 volunteers in April of

395
00:29:01.881 --> 00:29:06.320
[inaudible] 61 he also announced a naval blockade of the entire south.

396
00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:07.760
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

397
00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:12.500
<v 0>Oh,
this will forever be a tricky legal story and an interesting constitutional</v>

398
00:29:12.501 --> 00:29:13.820
problem.
Lincoln says,

399
00:29:13.821 --> 00:29:16.940
the southern states could not constitutionally secede from the union.

400
00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.940
They were not there for legitimate belligerent.

401
00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.550
He was not in any way recognize the thing,

402
00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:27.410
recognizing them as a legitimate government,
but oh,
by the way,

403
00:29:27.411 --> 00:29:30.140
he was gonna put a total naval blockade on them.

404
00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:31.710
<v 1>Nevertheless.</v>

405
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:37.070
<v 0>Now foreign countries,
especially the Great Britain will look at this and say,</v>

406
00:29:37.071 --> 00:29:37.251
well,

407
00:29:37.251 --> 00:29:40.850
you may not do the session you may not think is constitutional and your country

408
00:29:40.851 --> 00:29:43.030
and may not call the confederacy of belligerent,

409
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:45.190
but you sure as hell a treating them like one.

410
00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:46.620
<v 1>Okay.</v>

411
00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:50.850
<v 0>At any rate,
a blockade around that entire coastline will never be easy.</v>

412
00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:55.020
And we know that it was a very porous and the first year,

413
00:29:55.021 --> 00:29:58.740
even in the second year of the war through 1862 very porous,

414
00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:04.370
but the naval blockade eventually was relatively successful by 1864 and into

415
00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:06.180
early 1865

416
00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:08.210
<v 1>okay.</v>

417
00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:10.220
<v 0>What is a huge expanse of territory?</v>

418
00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:17.370
The south had rivers that could use and it will use them effectively of course.

419
00:30:17.371 --> 00:30:19.800
So the north,
once they invade the sound.

420
00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:21.390
<v 1>Okay.</v>

421
00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:24.870
<v 0>Geography was an advantage to the southern cause.</v>

422
00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:30.440
As many military historians have argued ever since if and when they stayed on

423
00:30:30.691 --> 00:30:31.620
the defensive,

424
00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:39.050
when they chose to invade the north,
as Lee will twice to fateful invasions,

425
00:30:39.051 --> 00:30:43.290
the one resulting it emptied them in September of 62 and the other get his

426
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:48.300
Bergen July of 63 he was giving up that advantage of the defensive position,

427
00:30:50.361 --> 00:30:55.361
forcing the larger armies of the north to come to them and attack on southern

428
00:30:56.451 --> 00:30:58.250
ground on the southern soil.

429
00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:02.940
This has always been a debate.

430
00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.990
Had the south remained utterly defensive in this war.

431
00:31:06.991 --> 00:31:10.830
Could the north of stood it hell out long enough?

432
00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:13.621
Thirdly,

433
00:31:13.621 --> 00:31:17.280
you could argue that in the south has an advantage and its cause or its purpose

434
00:31:17.281 --> 00:31:18.660
and perhaps it first,

435
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:23.720
maybe they did or even later after a terrible degree of war weariness.

436
00:31:24.631 --> 00:31:29.220
It said in the argument is simply that the south didn't have to win the war.

437
00:31:29.221 --> 00:31:31.050
They didn't have to conquer the north.

438
00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:35.100
They simply had to fight long enough as an insurgent.
They were the insurgent,

439
00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:38.760
they w the confederacy.
It was an insurgency.
Let's use that term.

440
00:31:38.761 --> 00:31:39.990
It's exactly what they were.

441
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:45.950
If they could hold out long enough and force the North into a a degree of war

442
00:31:46.741 --> 00:31:49.710
weariness and to some kind of economic trauma,

443
00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:51.750
<v 1>yeah,</v>

444
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:53.520
<v 0>they might just sue for peace.
After all.</v>

445
00:31:53.521 --> 00:31:57.990
The goal of the confederacy was national independence.

446
00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:04.490
Some,
some have said their cars was clearer,
less abstract.

447
00:32:04.491 --> 00:32:05.480
Defense of the homeland.

448
00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:10.800
Defense of hearth is in some ways less abstract then defense of the union or the

449
00:32:13.611 --> 00:32:16.280
constitution or the social order.

450
00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:21.110
How many of you want your sons to die for the social order?

451
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:24.650
Maybe you do a lot for me to say.

452
00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:30.020
If they'd stayed on the defensive,
they and they know this,
uh,

453
00:32:30.021 --> 00:32:33.860
this is one of those tests.
The questions about Robert E.
Lee is legacy.

454
00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:39.260
They had an advantage here.
Now have this new relatively new invention.
Thousands,

455
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.140
thousands upon thousands of which were made in this town.

456
00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:47.070
And I was the rifle musket
until the 18,

457
00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:50.880
late 1840 [inaudible] into the 1850s almost all firearms,

458
00:32:50.881 --> 00:32:52.740
all muskets were smooth bore

459
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:59.330
the shell or the bullet or the [inaudible] ball that came out of them came out

460
00:32:59.331 --> 00:33:01.340
of just a barrel.

461
00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:05.720
It was flat on the inside and it would only go a hundred to 200 yards,

462
00:33:05.721 --> 00:33:06.860
200 yards maximum.

463
00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:11.750
But with the creation of the rifled must get an eventually rifled cannon.

464
00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:16.230
A rifled muskets could hit something as far as 800 yards away.

465
00:33:16.231 --> 00:33:18.110
It doesn't mean you could see what you were shooting at,

466
00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:22.700
but it was extremely deadly at two to 300 yards now.

467
00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:24.000
<v 1>Okay.</v>

468
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:24.420
<v 0>And Award.</v>

469
00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:28.590
It's still going to be fought with these hideous old Napoleonic tactics of

470
00:33:28.591 --> 00:33:32.910
lining up men by the thousands arm to arm,
elbow to elbow,

471
00:33:32.911 --> 00:33:34.530
and simply moving across fields.

472
00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:40.710
The defensive position with the rifle musket was a huge advantage if used

473
00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:47.900
many have said over and over the south head and superior general ship and the

474
00:33:47.901 --> 00:33:49.970
first,
especially two years of the war,

475
00:33:49.971 --> 00:33:52.280
and I don't think there's much question that they did.

476
00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:55.501
And then of course,

477
00:33:55.501 --> 00:33:59.220
some have argued that the south simply had the Yeoman soldier.

478
00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.020
Better soldiers.

479
00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:02.400
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

480
00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.070
<v 0>Better men.
So cold.</v>

481
00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:10.920
Now they thought they did.
And let me give you a couple of illustrations of that

482
00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:17.670
they'd thought they did in their rhetoric and in their war fever

483
00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:20.830
of 1861

484
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:37.070
one young confederate officer rode home from the summer of 1861 he said,

485
00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:40.870
just throw three or four shows among those blue belt,

486
00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:43.760
the Yankees and they'll scatter like sheep,

487
00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:46.570
so it was the theory.

488
00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:54.150
It was not the improved arm but the improved man wrote Governor Henry Wise of

489
00:34:54.671 --> 00:34:57.010
Virginia which would win the day.

490
00:34:57.011 --> 00:35:01.750
He's writing this in 1861 let brave men advance with Flint locks and old

491
00:35:01.751 --> 00:35:06.751
fashioned bayonets on the pop and Jay's of northern cities and he would answer

492
00:35:06.881 --> 00:35:10.840
forward with his life at the Yankees,
the Yankees,
he says,

493
00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:12.430
we'll break and run.

494
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:17.480
Yankees won't fight or so was the theory.

495
00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:24.750
Now I don't know times,
I suppose that was an advantage.
There were,

496
00:35:24.751 --> 00:35:27.480
it was a certain warrior culture in the south.

497
00:35:27.481 --> 00:35:31.830
There were perhaps more hunters per capita in the south and maybe in the north,

498
00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:34.740
but don't make much of that one.

499
00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.670
The south had awesome problems,
low to fight this war as well,

500
00:35:39.671 --> 00:35:44.670
and let me tick them off quickly.
They all have a tremendous problem of supply.

501
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:47.850
As the war gets bigger,

502
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:53.850
Johnny Reb will never be very well clad,
never very well fed,

503
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:59.720
always relying on captured blankets and captured boots and captured food.

504
00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:01.850
<v 1>Okay.</v>

505
00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:06.850
<v 0>And even captured and medical supplies at times in the south.</v>

506
00:36:07.121 --> 00:36:11.980
They will truly,
in a biblical sense,
after make plow shares into swords.

507
00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:14.050
<v 1>Okay.</v>

508
00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:18.340
<v 0>They actually accomplished amazing things in the creation of weapons of</v>

509
00:36:18.341 --> 00:36:22.630
ordinance,
of gunpowder,
of shells by the thousands,

510
00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:25.000
almost overnight.

511
00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:30.190
They will also buy a lot from Great Britain from French to some extent.

512
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.560
And much of that we'll get in through the blockade and the first two years they

513
00:36:35.561 --> 00:36:37.870
had a huge disadvantage of not having a navy.

514
00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:41.950
They had then somehow create a navy,
and we'll come back to this later.

515
00:36:41.951 --> 00:36:44.080
When we look at the role of Europe in this,

516
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:50.190
they will go to Britain and try to buy ships and they will ironclads

517
00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:58.470
rims and ultimately battleships that will prey upon and destroyed hundreds of

518
00:37:00.971 --> 00:37:01.900
union ships.

519
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:08.100
And then you might say that they had a real political disadvantage,

520
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:13.190
I guess I've already mentioned it and that they were born of a state's rights

521
00:37:13.681 --> 00:37:18.681
impulse and overnight now they have to try to centralize the government to fight

522
00:37:21.031 --> 00:37:26.031
a highly centralized coordinated war over a vast thousand mile front.

523
00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:28.523
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

524
00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:32.180
<v 0>and Georgians are supposed to cooperate with Virginians are supposed to</v>

525
00:37:32.181 --> 00:37:35.900
cooperate with Tennesseans,
are supposed to cooperate with our Kansans,

526
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:41.090
didn't always work,
and last but not least,

527
00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:47.200
would slavery being an advantage or a disadvantage in the south wharf?

528
00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:57.540
To some degree it wasn't advantage and thousands upon thousands of American

529
00:37:57.541 --> 00:38:02.510
slaves will be put to work for the confederate military for the confederate and

530
00:38:02.511 --> 00:38:07.410
industry.
If you visited the confederate army from 1861 on,

531
00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.780
if it was above a thousand men,

532
00:38:09.781 --> 00:38:13.470
you would see plenty of black guys and some black women.

533
00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:18.690
If you were on a a southern train by 1863 you'd see plenty of black workers on

534
00:38:18.691 --> 00:38:20.910
that train.
Most of them slaves.

535
00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:26.210
If you were in a field hospital in Georgia by 63 and 64 during Sherman's march,

536
00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:30.930
if you were in a confederate hospital,
you'd see plenty of black nurses.

537
00:38:30.931 --> 00:38:35.931
About 40% of all the nurses and confederate hospitals from 63 and Georgia were

538
00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:37.533
slave women.

539
00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:39.280
<v 1>Okay.</v>

540
00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:44.280
<v 0>They were impressed into confederate service by the thousands.</v>

541
00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.740
So there's an advantage in that.
But I think as we'll see next week,

542
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:52.840
slavery ultimately

543
00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:59.850
was the Achilles heel of the confederate war effort because once the union

544
00:39:00.401 --> 00:39:04.420
leadership,
and that's going to happen,
it's going to take a year into the war,

545
00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:09.460
but that's going to happen by 1862 and certainly 63 will come to see you that

546
00:39:09.701 --> 00:39:14.170
the only way they can truly win the war is by destroying slavery.

547
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:20.910
And once the union war effort becomes an effort to destroy the social structure

548
00:39:22.061 --> 00:39:24.820
of the south,
including its labor system and a in a,

549
00:39:24.821 --> 00:39:26.800
in an effort to destroy slavery,

550
00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:32.550
it becomes an all out and total war of conquest.

551
00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:40.200
Now quickly to the extent there was an opening grand strategy,

552
00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:44.250
uh,
soon to be abandoned.
It was this

553
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:50.370
winfield Scott,
the old rough and ready as he was known,

554
00:39:50.371 --> 00:39:54.690
the old general,
the Mexican war.
He's very ancient by now.
He's 80 years old.

555
00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:57.000
He's begging,
he's fat and he's in mobile,

556
00:39:57.270 --> 00:40:01.230
but he was the general of the army and he came up with what he called the

557
00:40:01.231 --> 00:40:02.640
Anaconda plan.

558
00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:07.940
The Anaconda plan was basically to envelop the south surrounded by a naval

559
00:40:09.631 --> 00:40:14.460
blockade,
use gunboats to penetrate the rivers down the Ohio,

560
00:40:14.461 --> 00:40:15.510
the Mississippi,

561
00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:20.900
the Missouri of necessary from the West and up those rivers of Virginia and down

562
00:40:21.601 --> 00:40:24.720
the coast of the Carolinas and in effect,

563
00:40:24.721 --> 00:40:28.020
suffocate the south from outside.

564
00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:29.500
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

565
00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.230
<v 0>Over time,
my ticket year,</v>

566
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:35.080
I'd even take two years.

567
00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:39.340
The idea here was to surround the south

568
00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:44.650
and to force them.
Ultimately tonight,

569
00:40:44.651 --> 00:40:46.480
he's not just see the error of their ways,

570
00:40:46.481 --> 00:40:49.390
but to see that they had no chance to win.

571
00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:51.580
This was a plan.

572
00:40:51.581 --> 00:40:56.581
Now that would not invade the south with major armies and seek major battlefield

573
00:40:58.361 --> 00:40:59.194
victories.

574
00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:03.400
It was almost a kind of in an economic plan to win a war.

575
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:08.410
It would take time,
patience,
and ever growing navy,

576
00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:13.720
but the American people wouldn't have it.
The northern people wouldn't have it.

577
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:18.340
They want an army forming around Washington DC in April,

578
00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:22.270
May and June 861 to move to act.
Horace Greeley,

579
00:41:22.271 --> 00:41:24.700
most important editor of most important newspaper in the United States,

580
00:41:24.701 --> 00:41:28.870
New York Herald Tribune and New York publish the famous headline onto Richmond

581
00:41:28.871 --> 00:41:33.860
or forward to Richmond.
It said,
attack that confederate army,

582
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:38.030
stop the insurgency,
whipped them once and the rebellion,

583
00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:41.690
punish his leaders and get this thing over before the end of summer.

584
00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:51.050
Now,
the problem here is not unlike,
think about it,

585
00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.530
the problem in the American revolution,

586
00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:59.480
if the British could have ended that American insurgency in the American

587
00:41:59.481 --> 00:42:02.000
revolution quickly in the first year or two,

588
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:06.350
instead of letting these American armies under George Washington and others keep

589
00:42:06.351 --> 00:42:10.370
retreating away from them and not engaging in any real pitched battles and

590
00:42:10.371 --> 00:42:14.270
continuing to give up their cities and retreat,
England and England and England,

591
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:19.370
the British or the Americans would not have won their revolution.

592
00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:23.883
<v 1>Okay?</v>

593
00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:28.670
<v 0>As long as the confederate armies could exist,</v>

594
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:34.030
the confederacy could exist if indeed we interpreted as a revolutionary

595
00:42:35.781 --> 00:42:36.650
insurgency.

596
00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:41.240
And ultimately that is virtually how they will interpret themselves.

597
00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:47.100
And hence we can see that if this war last very long,

598
00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:51.270
it lasted frankly beyond one year,

599
00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:57.020
it had all the potential of becoming a war of conquest all out in total,

600
00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:03.770
requiring the destruction of the southern infrastructure and southern society.

601
00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:12.440
Now,
both sides in this war now get around a bull run,

602
00:43:12.441 --> 00:43:15.860
and when the war broke out in the west and a moment,

603
00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:22.090
both sides in this war will engage in conscription.

604
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:28.820
They will create the draft.
For the first time in American history,

605
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:32.540
the confederates were first to do it.

606
00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:38.060
The first conscription act in American history has passed in April of 1862 by

607
00:43:38.061 --> 00:43:42.200
the confederate government.
It said that all able bodied men,

608
00:43:42.201 --> 00:43:47.201
18 to 35 later raised to 45 would be conscripted into three years of service.

609
00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:54.580
They allowed the hiring of a substitute which led to the charge of Elitism,

610
00:43:54.651 --> 00:43:55.550
which was accurate.

611
00:43:56.990 --> 00:44:00.740
There were brokers and all kinds of dishonest substitutes.

612
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:06.110
One man is alleged to have sold himself 20 times for the bounty that he got paid

613
00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:07.633
to get out.

614
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:13.760
There were exemptions in the confederate conscription,
public servants,
ministers,

615
00:44:13.761 --> 00:44:16.790
teachers,
editors,
nurses,
factory in railroad workers,

616
00:44:16.791 --> 00:44:18.800
miners and telegraph operators.

617
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:22.040
Among the confederate troops out at the front,

618
00:44:22.041 --> 00:44:25.340
they called these people bomb proof positions

619
00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:28.280
and then worst of all,

620
00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:32.640
and the confederate conscription law in 1863 they what was known as the 20 Negro

621
00:44:32.641 --> 00:44:35.670
Law.
If you own 20 or more slaves,

622
00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:37.860
you were exempt from service.

623
00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:43.700
The reason for that was the deep fear setting in an 1862 across the south that

624
00:44:43.801 --> 00:44:48.750
have all these white men,
80% of white males in the south will be in the army.

625
00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:52.110
If you look,
if all these white men left the plantations,

626
00:44:52.111 --> 00:44:55.140
that would be black men left on the plantations running the place.

627
00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:02.050
Any man who had 20 more 20 or more slaves was exempt if he chose to be.

628
00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:07.420
This will cause tremendous resentment and the confederate armies and ultimately

629
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.850
one of become one of the causes of desertion.

630
00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:12.560
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

631
00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:16.490
<v 0>The union conscription law came later.
It didn't come until early 63</v>

632
00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:23.060
it drafted every able bodied man 20 years of age to 45 years of age.

633
00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:25.580
It had its exemptions were more limited.

634
00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:32.130
You could escape if you could find a substitute and pay $300

635
00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:38.880
hence the charge,
not inaccurate.
That in the north,

636
00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:40.660
this people's wars,

637
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:45.690
Lincoln called it this war to save democracy became a rich man's war and a poor

638
00:45:45.691 --> 00:45:46.560
man's fight.

639
00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:53.160
Generous bounties were paid if you enlisted in Indian,

640
00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:57.180
only about 6% of all the union forces in the civil war.

641
00:45:58.310 --> 00:45:59.143
<v 1>We're drafting</v>

642
00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:05.930
<v 0>the social pressure in some communities since regiments were formed locally was</v>

643
00:46:07.441 --> 00:46:09.690
tremendous,
especially in the first two years.

644
00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:11.750
<v 1>Okay.</v>

645
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:16.370
<v 0>Approximately 20% of all confederates were draftees.
Only 6%</v>

646
00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:18.590
<v 1>of union troops.</v>

647
00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:22.843
Now,

648
00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:30.390
<v 0>I only have a few minutes left and I'm sorry for that,</v>

649
00:46:30.391 --> 00:46:33.570
but I wanted to lay out our aims and goals here,

650
00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:39.330
but let me leave you with how this first battle of the war actually came and

651
00:46:39.331 --> 00:46:42.540
we'll pick it up.
They're thirsty.
Makes as much sense.

652
00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:46.440
Thursday along that creek.
You can see the picture here

653
00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:53.120
and extraordinary photograph taken actually taken an 1862

654
00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:58.740
<v 1>of four children.
Two of them were in</v>

655
00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:01.340
<v 0>what are probably the union copies,</v>

656
00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:03.723
<v 1>hats</v>

657
00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:09.290
<v 0>and seven union cavalryman cross the creek.</v>

658
00:47:09.610 --> 00:47:12.020
I was though there at attention for the photographer.

659
00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:18.280
It's a remarkable picture of,

660
00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.520
it seems to me the influence of war on the young,

661
00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:27.040
but it was along that creek on the 21st of July,

662
00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:32.040
1861 a Sunday afternoon at the collision of amateur armies occurred in the first

663
00:47:32.381 --> 00:47:34.000
major battle of the civil war.

664
00:47:34.001 --> 00:47:38.810
Came about Lincoln under the pressure of public opinion,
forced his command.

665
00:47:38.811 --> 00:47:42.880
Erwin Mcdonnell to move this army that was not very well trained.

666
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:47.140
It wasn't prepared to fight.
They hadn't even been taught how to retreat,

667
00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:49.180
which they're about to demonstrate.

668
00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:54.060
Mcdowell complained to Lincoln.
He says,
people can't fight that,

669
00:47:54.061 --> 00:47:57.190
that that we don't have.
We have.
We have learned this.
We haven't learned that.

670
00:47:57.191 --> 00:48:00.820
We're not ready.
Don't make us move.
And Lincoln said,
I have no choice.

671
00:48:00.821 --> 00:48:04.550
You must move.
And he wrote to Mcdowell and he said,
quote,

672
00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:08.590
you are green.
It is true,
but they are agreeing.

673
00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:13.210
You are all green.
I like,
oh thanks a lot.

674
00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:18.100
Mcdonald probably said an offy marched about 20 miles south and west of

675
00:48:18.101 --> 00:48:21.790
Washington to collide with this confederate army that had been forming off for

676
00:48:21.791 --> 00:48:25.060
three months in northern Virginia,
threatening us capital.

677
00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.030
It was a summer outing,

678
00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:33.490
a couple hundred civilians and carriage as many of them congressmen and their

679
00:48:33.491 --> 00:48:35.830
wives and families,
God encourages peck.

680
00:48:35.831 --> 00:48:38.720
Picnic lunches went down to watch the battle.
They,

681
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:42.580
they sat on hillsides to watch this spectacle.

682
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:46.180
Let me just stay far enough away.
You wouldn't see any blood.

683
00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:49.960
You're going to be some casualties,
but that's they're supposed to be.

684
00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:52.570
<v 1>They took picnics</v>

685
00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:58.000
<v 0>to yes to US Congress from Roland up captured and spend the next year in a</v>

686
00:48:58.001 --> 00:48:58.990
Richmond prison.

687
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:01.110
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

688
00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:02.820
<v 0>it was a,
it was a crazy battle.</v>

689
00:49:02.821 --> 00:49:07.821
It lasted only three hours and both commanding generals Beauregard on the

690
00:49:08.881 --> 00:49:12.780
confederate side and Mcdonald on the union side had the same plan,

691
00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:18.780
a fake to the right and a move to the left.
This was old fashioned stuff.

692
00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:22.320
Now that they both had managed to pull it off and they're men have known what

693
00:49:22.321 --> 00:49:26.820
they were doing that it's simply moved each other around and the confederate

694
00:49:26.821 --> 00:49:30.270
army could have walked up into Washington,
but nothing came off as planned.

695
00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:33.221
At first,

696
00:49:33.221 --> 00:49:37.420
the Union forces took oh several hundred yards of the field that looked like in

697
00:49:37.421 --> 00:49:40.750
these field glasses people were using.
This is going to be another union victory.

698
00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:44.590
First clashed with the Union victory,
send a confederate army,

699
00:49:44.591 --> 00:49:46.660
retreating back into Virginia and the rebellion.

700
00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:53.320
Then as fast as that happened,
it turned around and the counter attack came.

701
00:49:53.321 --> 00:49:57.060
It was led by a general named Thomas Jackson,
who gets his name at bull run,

702
00:49:57.061 --> 00:49:59.230
stonewall Jackson.
More on him later

703
00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:05.410
and suddenly these union soldiers knew nothing of retreat.

704
00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:07.690
They threw down rifles,

705
00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:13.300
they ran through creeks and found the first road they could.
They broke ranks

706
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:16.980
and they retreated.

707
00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:22.010
Many of them running the rest of that afternoon and through into the evening

708
00:50:22.411 --> 00:50:25.890
back to Washington DC in utter defeat and retreat.

709
00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:31.400
It was so that the wagons and the case ons of the artillery started running over

710
00:50:31.911 --> 00:50:34.140
men Albin tours.

711
00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:38.810
J later to become the most important novelist and writer of the reconstruction

712
00:50:38.811 --> 00:50:41.750
era was badly wounded.

713
00:50:41.751 --> 00:50:45.620
He had a shoulder smashed and broken by the wheel of a case on and the retreat

714
00:50:45.621 --> 00:50:49.880
from bull run and it would have to leave the war for a year.
He'll return to it,

715
00:50:49.881 --> 00:50:53.030
but he'd never be able to use one of his shoulders very effectively.

716
00:50:55.040 --> 00:51:00.040
Bull run first bull run was a complete confederate victory.

717
00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:04.970
A union defeat.
A union army retreated into the national capitol,

718
00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:06.440
a shock to the country.

719
00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:11.570
The casualties were this 460 killed on the union side.

720
00:51:11.571 --> 00:51:16.571
Over 1100 wounded and 1300 men missing for the next month

721
00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:24.830
total of almost 2,900 casualties and the confederate side,

722
00:51:24.831 --> 00:51:26.240
387 killed,

723
00:51:26.241 --> 00:51:31.241
1500 wounded and only 13 missing about 1900 total casualties

724
00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:39.740
in the wake of bull run.
Lincoln brings George Beam McClellan,

725
00:51:40.410 --> 00:51:41.201
this vain,

726
00:51:41.201 --> 00:51:46.201
glorious but handsome is hell smart west point graduate of 34 years old to the

727
00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:52.250
White House.
He'd had a couple small little victories out in western Virginia,

728
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:54.550
whether it'd been a couple of clashes with the,

729
00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:59.620
with southern troops a brought this gold sash wearing young officer to the White

730
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:05.630
House and gave him command of this army that they then name the army of the

731
00:52:05.631 --> 00:52:06.464
Potomac

732
00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:12.440
and the army was being increased daily now with hundreds and hundreds and

733
00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:14.870
thousands of troops from the north and Mcclellan,

734
00:52:14.871 --> 00:52:17.720
put him into camp camp Brightwood among others.

735
00:52:17.721 --> 00:52:19.850
Huge camp bill outside of Washington,

736
00:52:20.890 --> 00:52:25.890
and he'll start training them for months and months and months,

737
00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:34.400
and the civil war got longer and longer and longer,

738
00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:39.500
and is not going to move that army for another 10 months,

739
00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:45.280
nine months until the late spring of 1862 meanwhile,

740
00:52:46.611 --> 00:52:51.350
the war is going to break out in the West too,
and we'll return to that Thursday.
