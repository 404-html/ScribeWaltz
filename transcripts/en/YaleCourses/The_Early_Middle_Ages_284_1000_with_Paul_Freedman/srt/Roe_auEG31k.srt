1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,330
Today we're going to talk about Ireland
and England, predominantly England.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,490
It's not because Ireland isn't important,

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,120
but because we know less about Ireland,

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,810
the reason we know relatively more
about England in its post Roman period,

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,580
that is to say after, um, uh,

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,920
four 20 is uh,

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,040
because of the historian bead
writing in the early 18th century,

8
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:39,370
a monk at a gyro which was a part
of a twin monastery in North Umbria,

9
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,980
can see on your map the northeastern
port part of England before you get to

10
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,250
what's now Scotland Bead
wrote among other things,

11
00:00:55,621 --> 00:01:00,621
a history of the English church and
people which is full of miracles and very,

12
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:06,240
very here, no pro Christian
as much as Gregory of tour,

13
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,240
but is a much more um,

14
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,640
easy to follow narrative and a
narrative with a certain kind of point.

15
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:18,120
It's about the conversion of England
and the establishment of the church.

16
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,440
The other advantage for
England over Ireland in terms
of evidence is archeology.

17
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,920
A lot more has been done
with excavating sites in, um,

18
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,950
England and by England we
mean literally England.

19
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:39,420
The part that is not whales,
not Scotland, uh, not Ireland.

20
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:42,210
The part of the British Isles,
the ensemble,

21
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,280
essentially the two islands are
referred to as the British eyes.

22
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,630
Britain is England,
Scotland and Wales.

23
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,280
Ireland is Ireland. Uh,
the Britains, however, B r,

24
00:01:56,281 --> 00:02:01,281
I t o n s are the collective
term for the Celtic population.

25
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,860
Celtic is both a linguistic group
and a somewhat vague ethnic term.

26
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,760
It means the people who were there in
the British isles before the Romans came

27
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,930
and who were there afterwards
fighting invaders from Europe.

28
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:29,030
These invaders who come in the four
forties, known as the Anglo Saxons.

29
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,650
Bead tells us it's the Anglo Saxon.

30
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,560
The Saxons excusing the angles,

31
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,870
the Saxons and the jutes.

32
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,850
The angles give their name
to England angle land.

33
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,070
The jutes we know nothing
about. So, you know,

34
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,160
certain kind of medievalist uh,

35
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:55,140
we'll go on about founding a
journal of Jute Studies, uh,

36
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:59,010
and inviting contributors to something
that we really have absolutely no idea.

37
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,570
It would be, you know, in that League
of smallest, thinnest Vanya items. Um,

38
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,350
at least in terms of three
dimensional box, uh, the Saxons,

39
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,580
uh, come from, there is still a very
large part of Germany called Saxony.

40
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,820
Uh,
what the nature of these peoples are,

41
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:20,821
how they were differentiated
among themselves is a
source of a lot of Rio or at

42
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:26,920
least looks real scholarship as
opposed to studying the glutes.

43
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,030
But we don't have to go into that,
can need to get the cast of characters,

44
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,450
Celts angle Anglo Saxons

45
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,000
and the Anglo Saxons
conquer much of the island,

46
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,290
more or less what would become England.
But not all.

47
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,210
They do not conquer Scotland.

48
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,710
They do not conquer whales and
they don't really conquer cornball.

49
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,850
So the western part of
Britain remains Celtic.

50
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,740
And to this day,

51
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:01,480
whales and Scotland considered themselves
different from England can get into a

52
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:04,960
lot of trouble by calling that,
uh,

53
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:09,160
area England with the people there.
And um,

54
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,840
particularly in Scotland
there's a possibility that
they may separate from the

55
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:15,640
United Kingdom at some point.

56
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,560
Ireland Ireland was never
occupied by the Romans.

57
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,710
Ireland, um, was,

58
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:27,340
caltech was in contact
with the Roman Empire

59
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,400
but was not part of it.

60
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,710
This makes some difference and we'll
talk about it when we come to talk about

61
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,544
conversion,

62
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,090
but it doesn't make as much difference
as it sounds because the thing about

63
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,120
England or Britain is that the Roman
impressed there would be almost wiped out

64
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,130
once the Romans withdrew.

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And so in contrast to what we saw with
Gregory of tour and Merovingian Gall

66
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,450
Merovingian, uh, Frankish kingdom,

67
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,730
the Roman influence in
Britain is almost wiped out.

68
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,200
Recall what we saw as persistence of
Roman practices in the mirror of kingdom

69
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,040
bishops,
cities,

70
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,560
the Latin language

71
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,660
tax records,
written legal codes.

72
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,460
That is not to say that the mirror
of engines weren't, as I said before,

73
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:36,330
to be described by technical terms
like thugs or that this was a sleek,

74
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,180
well-functioning kingdom. You know,
you landed at the airport and, uh,

75
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,511
you know,

76
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:48,460
got the train immediately and everything
was sleek and nice like Amsterdam or

77
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:53,080
some place like that as
opposed to Kennedy. But, uh,

78
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,730
that,
um,

79
00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:00,270
the Roman inheritance was visible and
influential in Britain when the Roman

80
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:06,950
troops withdrew to fight, uh, the, um,

81
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,520
uh,
invaders in Gaul,

82
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,720
this ended Roman society and Britain.

83
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:18,170
And the reason for this is partly the
Britain was a frontier viewed from the

84
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:21,920
point of view of the Mediterranean,
the center of gravity of the Roman empire.

85
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,083
The

86
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:32,050
frontier symbolized bumps
dramatically by walls,

87
00:06:32,051 --> 00:06:34,810
the most famous of
which is Hadrian's wall,

88
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,380
a wall that separated out the barbarians.

89
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:42,100
But since you didn't have a river
like the Daniel Board, the Rhine,

90
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,620
there seems to be no natural frontier.

91
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,940
Remanence of Hadrian's
wall are the largest,

92
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,980
um,
souvenir of the Roman era.

93
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,250
A wall to keep out the barbarians
from the north because in fact,

94
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,110
the Romans didn't conquer
the entire island.

95
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,370
They conquered the parts they thought
were worthwhile and they did think it was

96
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:05,200
worthwhile frontier or not.

97
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:10,060
We know that the Romans built
villas might be a little cold,

98
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:14,290
the somewhat open Air Mediterranean
plan things, but, uh, you know,

99
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:18,420
mosaic court yards, uh,
drank a lot of wine,

100
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,480
but to have it imported, uh, built cities,

101
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,320
walls,
other fortifications,

102
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,270
cultivated land.

103
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,720
So it's not as if there wasn't a Roman
serious Roman province of Britain from

104
00:07:33,941 --> 00:07:38,941
its conquest in the late first century
until it's abandonment in the early fifth

105
00:07:40,691 --> 00:07:41,524
century.

106
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,460
But here the invaders tended to obliterate
much of what had been there in Roman

107
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:54,910
times and the Celtic population
who had been romanized,

108
00:07:54,911 --> 00:07:56,470
at least at the elite levels.

109
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:01,710
The Celtic population didn't really
save very much from the Roman empire.

110
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,040
The Celts, uh, might remain Christian,

111
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,260
whereas the invaders were pagan.

112
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,310
But the Celts tended not to have
cities or at least large centers

113
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,620
and they tended not to have or
retain Roman forms of government.

114
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,340
The one kind of,
if not literally interesting,

115
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:34,341
at least weird aspect of Celtic Roman
resistance is the figure of King Arthur.

116
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,950
I'm going to bring them up now
and then I'm going to drop him.

117
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:43,610
King Arthur belongs properly to the
continuation of this course because his,

118
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:45,900
uh,

119
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,900
legendary status starts in the
really in the world of romance,

120
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,690
of French Romance and then of
Romance Chevelle Rick Literature.

121
00:08:57,691 --> 00:09:02,490
By romance we mean not, it not only
loves stories but novels of Chivalry,

122
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,740
of nights of battles.

123
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:10,530
He is a figure who is 99.9% legend.

124
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:16,020
Uh,
whatever the remainder of that 0.1% real.

125
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,430
And so far as he's real,

126
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:22,320
he may be identified with Celtic
resistance to the Anglo Saxon invaders,

127
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,660
Celtic Roman resistance in the late fifth,
early sixth centuries.

128
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,160
But the proportion of art to
history in this is if not 99.9,

129
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,100
at least. Very, very substantial.

130
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:45,630
So the original setting of the Arthurian
stories is that of the resistance to

131
00:09:47,681 --> 00:09:51,170
the Anglo Saxon invaders. The, uh,

132
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,660
Arthurian romances do have
a kind of Celtic begin,

133
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,620
well not a kind of,

134
00:09:56,621 --> 00:10:01,240
they have a Celtic beginning and then
they are our appropriated by people in the

135
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,990
romance language tradition French,
first of all.

136
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,620
So as what comes says on page one 51,

137
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,680
nowhere else in the Roman empire
was the collapse of culture,

138
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,990
economy and urbanization.
So complete.

139
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,530
He uses that wonderful phrase again.
Uh,

140
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,570
radical economic simplification.
I,

141
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:32,890
he, uh, you know, there's no
more plumbing. There was no more,

142
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,120
uh, there's no more sort of a what
we would consider to be affluent,

143
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,680
civilized society. The ceramics
don't come from Africa anymore.

144
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:46,650
The wine doesn't come from France
anymore. People are uh, um,

145
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:51,190
reduced to a kind of subsistence or at
least most people because as we'll see,

146
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,710
some of these kings actually
are able to get, uh,

147
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,560
some luxury goods from abroad.

148
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,330
If it were just a story
of Barbara's aviation,

149
00:11:02,331 --> 00:11:04,670
it would be less interesting then in fact,

150
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,810
the peculiar nature of
England in this period,

151
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:13,930
which goes from being a
contested territory between
the Germanic invaders and

152
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:20,471
the Celtic population to a kingdom slowly
converted in the course of the seventh

153
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,310
century to Christianity from paganism

154
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,840
to the leading center of Culture in
Europe feed who lived from six 73 to seven

155
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:39,971
35 was the most cultivated scholar in
Europe of the early eighth century.

156
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:47,470
And the most cultivated scholar in Europe
of the late 18th century was also from

157
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,420
England,
uh,

158
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,940
eloquent counselor and
advisor to Charlemagne.

159
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,710
How do you go from being a,

160
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:02,723
uh,

161
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,200
well,
I don't like to use the word primitive,

162
00:12:06,201 --> 00:12:11,201
but certainly barbarian enough area
to having the largest libraries,

163
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,670
the, uh, most cultivated a scholars now.

164
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,980
It is true.
As I think I've said before,

165
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:24,130
that any time you can say that such and
such a person was the smartest person in

166
00:12:25,731 --> 00:12:30,160
Europe has got to be a fairly bad time,
right?

167
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,340
In the 19th century,

168
00:12:31,341 --> 00:12:35,630
you have your choice from all
sorts of scientific literary,

169
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,590
uh, um, other kinds of intellectual
experts who, who, you know,

170
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:43,760
who would even dare to say, but, um,

171
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,100
you know,
we know that,

172
00:12:46,101 --> 00:12:49,910
but we theists and Casio doors are the
smartest guys in Europe in the sixth

173
00:12:49,911 --> 00:12:54,020
century because have access to stuff
that almost no one else does because

174
00:12:54,021 --> 00:12:58,310
they're writing about a classical authors
that almost no one else has in their

175
00:12:58,311 --> 00:12:59,150
libraries.

176
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:04,520
And we know that Isidore of Seville is
probably the smartest guy of the early

177
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,440
seventh century. And visit Gothic
Spain, um, because we have his works,

178
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:14,060
we have an idea of what he's read,
we know his sources. And again,

179
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:15,680
he's got the biggest library.

180
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,120
Biggest library may mean a hundred books,

181
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:25,190
but a hundred books in 780 is a
serious collection of knowledge.

182
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,940
Now, this is not easy knowledge.
This is not, you know,

183
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:32,480
as if everything were,
um,

184
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,470
uh, well I don't want to
say Wikipedia either. Uh,

185
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:43,610
everything, we're kind of like
Wikipedia five years ago, um,

186
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,380
elementary and often wrong.

187
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:51,770
These aren't very different kinds of
works from what might interest us.

188
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,280
Certainly a lot of biblical
stuff, but also, for example,

189
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:56,870
a lot of computing of time

190
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:02,450
bead would be remembered for the history
of the English church and people,

191
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,600
but also for a lot of his
works on figuring out time.

192
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,870
He is credited,
although not uniquely credited,

193
00:14:11,871 --> 00:14:15,290
but is an important person
in the development of the BC,

194
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,980
a d scheme.
Believe it or not,

195
00:14:18,981 --> 00:14:23,750
people are not born into the world
calculating according to BC a day,

196
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,360
lots of people calculate
according to other systems.

197
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,850
How did they come up with this?
And Moreover,

198
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:31,970
how do they then fit the calendar into it?

199
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:38,710
How do you keep time when you don't have
electric or battery operated clocks?

200
00:14:39,561 --> 00:14:42,140
How do you know what the seasonal changes?

201
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,453
Okay.

202
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,700
But in fact,
that most troublesome problem,

203
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:52,701
which had been particularly controversial
to the conversion of England in the

204
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:58,121
generation before bead in the early
seventh and mid seventh century was the

205
00:14:59,271 --> 00:15:04,160
calculation of Easter.
Easter is a real problem.

206
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:07,790
Now, naturally, it's not a
problem if someone else tells you,

207
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,433
if you know,

208
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,440
in 1970 you open up a little
pocket book calendar and you know,

209
00:15:14,901 --> 00:15:18,890
it says, okay, Easter is
this day. You trust them.

210
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,410
Or now,
you know,

211
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:26,411
if you have some feature on your iPhone
that gives you Easter for the next 3000

212
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:32,030
years in case you want to know
when Easter is in, uh, you know,

213
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:36,120
3,500, uh, a d, uh,

214
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,100
no problem.

215
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:42,410
But if you're out there in north
Umbria or anywhere for that matter in a

216
00:15:42,411 --> 00:15:47,411
monastery somewhere where it's really
crucial to celebrate it on the right day.

217
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,830
Remember what I said about
Dogma and religious observation?

218
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,100
God doesn't want you to
say something like, dude,

219
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:57,590
I don't really know any Easter is,
but I think I'm going to celebrate it.

220
00:15:57,591 --> 00:16:01,790
Now you can't do that.
You can't just decide.

221
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,920
I know it's sort of in the spring,
uh,

222
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,790
nobody around here for miles and miles
and miles, and it was how to calculate it.

223
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,160
So what the heck?

224
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:13,970
We'll do it on a Tuesday because I'm
busy out in the thumb on what I think is

225
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:16,790
east or something.
That's not the way monasticism works.

226
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:20,900
And we'll talk about that next week. The
schedule is really, really important,

227
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:24,350
but it's also difficult to figure
out and people disagree about it.

228
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,270
To this day,

229
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:31,300
the eastern Orthodox churches celebrate
a different date for Easter than the

230
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:36,080
western because they operate according
to a different calendar. All right, well,

231
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,820
so,
um,

232
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,930
I'm not saying that this is the kind
of knowledge that you want to drop

233
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:43,280
everything else to pursue,

234
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,600
but it is a kind of knowledge
that requires a sort of
observation that in fact,

235
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:51,920
we do not have, um, most of us,
unless we're astronomy majors,

236
00:16:51,921 --> 00:16:55,330
have no idea what the sky
looks like at night. Uh,

237
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,750
a because we can't see it because of
artificial light and be because we're not

238
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:00,680
very curious.

239
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,500
We cannot track animals,
most of us.

240
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,920
And those of you who
can, uh, um, you know,

241
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,840
I'm interested in your knowledge.

242
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:17,530
Most of us haven't the faintest idea how
things grow except because we've been

243
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:22,580
to the Yale farm and oh my gosh,
look at this stuff. Um, you know,

244
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:27,581
that's part of the reason for it
because we're not very close to nature.

245
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,680
Uh, I think that environmental
concerns, not withstanding,

246
00:17:33,681 --> 00:17:38,681
most of us have a huge investment
in not being too close to nature,

247
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:44,830
but the observation of
phenomena is something that
is much superior in so-called

248
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,770
indigenous primitive,

249
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,460
traditional or historical societies.

250
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:01,870
So the story of England and
Ireland centers on conversion.

251
00:18:01,871 --> 00:18:06,871
And the reason this is a so is because
conversion represents a change in

252
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:10,210
orientation,

253
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:15,820
a change in orientation towards a larger
world instead of a kind of tribal and

254
00:18:16,811 --> 00:18:21,550
fragmented identity.
It's not making,

255
00:18:21,551 --> 00:18:25,270
I'm not making a statement about the
truth or non truth of Christianity,

256
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:30,870
but about the sense of belonging to a
larger world whose purposes encompass not

257
00:18:31,931 --> 00:18:36,130
only your group,
but a larger group of people out there.

258
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And I think we can get a feeling for
this from a famous passage of beads,

259
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,360
ecclesiastical history written in seven
31 and he is describing events of about

260
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,250
a century earlier when
King Edwin of North Umbria,

261
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:59,650
someone to council to decide whether or
not to accept the Christian God and the

262
00:19:01,931 --> 00:19:06,931
chief of the Pagan priests speaks in favor
of embracing Christianity even though

263
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,830
you would think that he would be
the defender of the old faith.

264
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,980
He in fact speaks to this assembly
according to bead in favor of

265
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:24,040
Christianity on the grounds that it tells
us what went before us and what will

266
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,180
come after us.

267
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,730
And the passage goes like this and one
of the kings chief men presently said,

268
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,730
thus seems that to me,
Oh king,

269
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,600
the present life of Man on
earth against that time,

270
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:43,601
which is unknown to us is as if you were
sitting at a feast with your chief men

271
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,960
and your things, your nobles
in wintertime, t, h, a. N, e.

272
00:19:50,961 --> 00:19:51,794
S

273
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,990
the fire burns and the hole is warm

274
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,420
and outside it rains and snows and storms.

275
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:07,330
There comes a sparrow and
swiftly flies through the house.

276
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,150
The insulation is not great
in these halls, right?

277
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,920
It comes through one door and it goes out
another low in the time in which he is

278
00:20:19,181 --> 00:20:23,230
within.
He has not touched by the winter storm,

279
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:28,120
but that time is the flash of
an eye and the least of times.

280
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:32,830
And he soon passes from
winter out to winter again.

281
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:37,240
So is the life of man
revealed for a brief space,

282
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,580
but what went before and what
follows after? We do not know.

283
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,810
Therefore, if this teaching can
reveal any more certain knowledge,

284
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:51,460
it seems only right. We
should follow it. Now,

285
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:56,461
this is not why people necessarily
converted because not everybody's really

286
00:20:56,981 --> 00:21:01,830
bothered by that. But most people
figure, wow, I'm in the hall.

287
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,170
It's warm, it's great. I'm
having such a good time.

288
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,190
And when I have to leave brief though,
it will be, I'll deal with that.

289
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:10,960
Uh,

290
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,960
but it does explain some of the appeal
of Christianity and why the invaders who

291
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:20,580
were, uh, um,

292
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:25,620
quote pagan converted and indeed why
people tend to convert to world religions

293
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:30,220
like Christianity and Islam.
To this day,

294
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:35,460
a local religion come calling tribal
only because by that I mean confined to a

295
00:21:37,331 --> 00:21:41,500
people whose identity is
caught up in their religion.

296
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,950
A tribal people are a tribal religion
has trouble surviving extensive contact

297
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:48,130
with other people,

298
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,773
okay?

299
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,440
Because,
um,

300
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:56,790
it's uniqueness is threatened by the
realization that there's a huge world out

301
00:21:56,791 --> 00:22:00,390
there of lots of other people.
And when you start interacting with them,

302
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,390
that is when you're no
longer isolated, uh, eh,

303
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,680
you will tend to seek an explanation for
things that is grander than just these

304
00:22:10,891 --> 00:22:14,170
gods protect my sphere.
This God protects my hearth.

305
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,910
This God protects against
accidents in childbirth,

306
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,693
okay?

307
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:25,590
There are exceptions.
Judaism is one of the most obvious.

308
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:29,970
Here is a religion of a small group
of people that survives, uh, um,

309
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,390
over the centuries.
Uh,

310
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:38,540
but it is not exactly a tribal religion
in the sense that it's monotheistic and

311
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:43,080
historical sense is very strong.
And this is what the priest means.

312
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,360
Uh,
or at least this is what I mean,

313
00:22:45,361 --> 00:22:48,510
and interpreting the priests
words as reported by bead,

314
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:54,080
by historical sense, a sense that God, uh,

315
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:59,070
rules of the world. Even if I'm not in
it, that there is something to come,

316
00:22:59,071 --> 00:23:02,160
not necessarily that
there is an afterlife,

317
00:23:02,161 --> 00:23:04,860
although that obviously is part
of the teachings of Christianity,

318
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,850
but that there is a kind
of a purpose to life.

319
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,320
So conversion, the conversions of, um,

320
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:18,780
Ireland and England are different.
Um,

321
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:24,620
the process of converting England begins
in five 97 with a missionary known.

322
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,760
Uh, unfortunately his name is
Augustine, Augustine of Canterbury,

323
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,580
not Augustine of hippo,
the confessions, Augustine,

324
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:38,450
he is sent by the Roman Pope Gregory the
first Gregory the great bead tells us

325
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:47,060
that he was motivated to do this.

326
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,100
It's a very strange thing to do.

327
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:53,280
There had not been missionaries
sent by the pope before, uh,

328
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:58,700
that he was motivated to do this by
seeing British boys for sale in the slave

329
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:02,870
market in Rome and asking who they were.

330
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,150
He was told they were angles.

331
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,630
A Anglos as an Anglo Saxon Aang les,

332
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:13,360
and he is reputed to have said, uh, uh,

333
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:18,770
we should make them angels, not
angles. Uh, [inaudible], uh,

334
00:24:18,771 --> 00:24:21,740
known, uh, uh, uh,

335
00:24:21,741 --> 00:24:26,220
on glee or um, uh, Angel's not ankles.

336
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:29,390
Okay.

337
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:32,690
Whatever the story.
Augustine

338
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:39,250
arrived around five 97 at an island
that had some remanence of Celtic

339
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,290
Christianity,
but is basically a pagan and barbarian.

340
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,980
He landed in Kent in the
southeast corner of the island,

341
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,690
closest to the continent. And on
this map, what I'd like you to know,

342
00:24:58,691 --> 00:25:03,691
particularly our Kent with Canterbury as
its capital and the south east west six

343
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,430
in the west.

344
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:11,470
So I think I've helpfully underlined
Murcia towards the center,

345
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,180
North Umbria, northeast, uh,

346
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,140
the most important kingdoms in England.
And,

347
00:25:19,141 --> 00:25:22,360
and what come has emphasized how
fragmented this territory was?

348
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,030
The most important kingdoms
would be at different times,

349
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,300
Northumbria show and west sex.

350
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:33,160
But the first place to convert is Kent.
It faces the continent.

351
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:37,360
The Pagan Ruler of Kant had actually
married a Christian princess from

352
00:25:37,361 --> 00:25:42,361
Merovingian Gall and Augustine established
the first bishop Rick in Kent at

353
00:25:43,061 --> 00:25:43,780
Canterbury,

354
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:48,780
which would be henceforth the major
ecclesiastical center of Britain.

355
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,000
It's Archbishop Prek

356
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:57,980
bead tells us about this, but he also
tells us a lot more about North Umbria,

357
00:25:57,981 --> 00:26:00,050
which is where he lived.

358
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,550
And here you can see the off again
on again, pace of conversion.

359
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,630
Yeah,

360
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:11,550
the pious King Edwin who had that council
that we just described converted his

361
00:26:11,551 --> 00:26:16,050
people after a vision.
But after his death and six 33,

362
00:26:16,051 --> 00:26:20,490
his successor went back to
the old traditional religion,

363
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,440
renouncing Christianity,
and then the successor to that king,

364
00:26:25,441 --> 00:26:28,500
a man named Oswald
reestablished Christianity.

365
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,710
But he was killed in battle by the
Pagan King of Mercer. And six 42

366
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:41,750
only in the six 66,

367
00:26:41,751 --> 00:26:46,751
seven days is England pretty
definitively converted to Christianity.

368
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:54,450
We can see this kind of transition,
uh,

369
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,100
in,
uh,

370
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:00,150
two of the most famous sources
of information about this world.

371
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,930
The Poem Beowulf, how many
people have read this? Yeah,

372
00:27:03,931 --> 00:27:05,970
everybody's read this
at one time or another.

373
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:11,210
Beowulf does have some little Christian
themes and there is some debate as to

374
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:18,690
what extent the poem is to be
understood in Christian terms.

375
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:22,740
But it's atmosphere.
It's rituals,

376
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,450
the burial and the ship, the
burning of the body, the devotion,

377
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:32,250
not only to war,
but to feasting and two gold ring giving,

378
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:36,990
uh, it evokes, not merely evokes, it is,

379
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:37,650
uh,

380
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:42,650
a description of a
warrior society in which,

381
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,620
although it is written in old English,

382
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:50,130
remember that it actually
takes place in Denmark.

383
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:55,430
This is a North Sea world in which the
communications patterns are such that you

384
00:27:56,521 --> 00:27:59,440
could write an English poem about,
uh,

385
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,140
someone who goes over to
the mainland for adventure.

386
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:11,810
The other source is one of the
great archeological triumphs of,

387
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:16,710
uh, the last hundred years. The
so called Sutton who treasure,

388
00:28:16,711 --> 00:28:20,700
which is in the British
Museum, uh, in East Anglia,

389
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,320
uh, close to the water,
actually close to the sea.

390
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:31,160
A burial ship was found in 1939 probably,

391
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,340
uh,

392
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:37,240
the king buried here was,
um,

393
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,220
uh, red Wald, king of East Anglia, um,

394
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,130
uh,
who died in six 27.

395
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,370
Now it's a pagan burial, uh, because
of all the grave goods. You know,

396
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:57,360
all this stuff is in there.
Uh, or so it would seem,

397
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:02,040
but it's hard to tell just as in
Beowulf, is it pagan? As a Christian,

398
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:07,160
it's hard to tell about this burial scene
because he's got a lot of stuff from

399
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:14,310
what might be called foreign gifts
or maybe plunder foreign gifts.

400
00:29:14,311 --> 00:29:17,010
He's got two Byzantines silver spoons,

401
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:22,790
so two silver spoons made in
Constantinople or thereabouts.

402
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,850
He's got gold coins.

403
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,420
They're mostly from the
Merovingian kingdom. And they,
they're, they're different.

404
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:38,610
They're all different.
This is not an economic thing.

405
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:40,140
This is a treasure thing,
right?

406
00:29:40,141 --> 00:29:43,600
The difference between economy and
treasure is that treasure is just for

407
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:48,400
hoarding and economy is
fluid and transactional.

408
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,660
The hoarding, of course we see in
Beowulf most obviously with the Dragon,

409
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:57,460
the dragon is not accumulating
the treasure in order to
safeguard his retirement

410
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:03,240
know or, or a trade up in caves. Um,

411
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,750
he just sleeps on this tracer. And
the point of that is, of course,

412
00:30:07,751 --> 00:30:11,410
the people accumulate treasure
for noneconomic reasons,

413
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,850
uh,

414
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,880
for reasons that have to do with
their own satisfaction or their own,

415
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,470
uh,
anxieties.

416
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:26,010
And the utility of treasure
is generally overestimated.

417
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,560
Nevertheless, of course, at the same time,

418
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:34,561
this is a world in which gold
treasure accumulation is what men do.

419
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,713
Okay.

420
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,740
Uh, so what else is at Sutton
who a wonderful helmet,

421
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:48,160
a unique in because these,
these things tend to disintegrate a,

422
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,250
a sword.

423
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,560
Okay.

424
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:55,340
A male shirt.
Um,

425
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,190
and then all sorts of
little paraphernalia.

426
00:30:58,191 --> 00:31:02,180
Some of it with Christian symbols
like crosses some of it very much, uh,

427
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,050
in the pagan kind of a, um, world.

428
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,530
Beowulf and Sutton who go together,

429
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:14,670
they both show us a world
of treasure of weapons,

430
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:20,100
uh,
of drinking halls of palaces,

431
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,420
sort of isolated.

432
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,730
The drinking hall is important as
you know from Beowulf. It is, uh,

433
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,010
the manifestation of civilization.

434
00:31:29,011 --> 00:31:33,540
It is that protection from outside that
bade just be described in the little

435
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:34,620
sparrow anecdote,

436
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,780
but it is also the center of government.

437
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:44,810
We're back to the ruler and his
entourage or come and talk to us,

438
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,680
his gang,

439
00:31:46,681 --> 00:31:50,520
if you want to put a more
cynical coloration on it.

440
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,700
So the conversion of England is
completed by the late seventh century,

441
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:07,130
but it is a more complicated story than
just monolithic Christianity versus

442
00:32:07,651 --> 00:32:08,910
monolithic paganism.

443
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,100
Because there are two
kinds of Christianity that
seek to convert and Glen,

444
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:18,000
one from Ireland and one from Rome,

445
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,033
Ireland.

446
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:27,450
Let's just pause over Ireland never
part of the Roman empire as I said,

447
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:33,620
but it's also the first place outside
the Roman world to have been converted to

448
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,630
Christianity.
The first place in Europe,

449
00:32:36,631 --> 00:32:39,180
actually the first place
period is Ethiopia.

450
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:45,490
Ethiopia of course in North Eastern
Africa would be converted to Christianity.

451
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,970
Uh, very early fourth
century. Hey d probably,

452
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,820
but within Europe, Ireland was
converted to Christianity. Um,

453
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,340
uh, by, um,

454
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:07,700
the British or English missionary
Saint Patrick. Um, this is,

455
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:11,040
uh, a little embarrassing,
but in fact the,

456
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,550
the apostle to Ireland is a
one of those British Celtic,

457
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,570
Roman fourth century figures,
Patrick.

458
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:26,780
So in 600 a d Ireland was
largely Catholic. Well,

459
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,640
England was mostly pagan.

460
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:35,990
Irish Christianity had
certain peculiarities,

461
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:40,100
some of them related to its lack
of a Roman past. Thus, for example,

462
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,720
it did not have bishops really,

463
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:46,610
or the bishops were weak because there
had not been cities in Ireland on the

464
00:33:46,611 --> 00:33:51,500
Roman model. And therefore, Christianity
didn't have an urban background,

465
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:54,590
but rather a very decentralized
and rural background.

466
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:00,280
The most powerful institutions in Ireland
were monasteries because these were

467
00:34:01,281 --> 00:34:05,870
great rural centers. And also the monks
ruled over the bishops. Generally,

468
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:11,960
Irish monasticism was very austere.

469
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:15,970
The Irish monks were more aesthetic.
Van Amongst,

470
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:20,980
we'll be meeting next week from the
Benedictine tradition started in Italy,

471
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:26,960
and they also were less
fixed in one place.

472
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,083
Okay?

473
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,030
In Benedictine Monasticism,
you're not supposed to move.

474
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:34,170
You're supposed to be stable.

475
00:34:34,171 --> 00:34:36,810
You're supposed to go through
the same routine every day.

476
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,800
The Irish favored a more wandering
existence and the establishment of little

477
00:34:43,441 --> 00:34:46,830
communities or colonies,
far away,

478
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,820
the Irish form of piety emphasizes exile.

479
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:53,130
And it might be exile,

480
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,440
too scary and almost
unimaginable kind of environment.

481
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,660
There are,
for example,

482
00:35:00,661 --> 00:35:05,040
lots of little islands in the Irish Sea,

483
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:08,880
uh, that seem to be
uninhabitable. That is,

484
00:35:08,881 --> 00:35:11,910
if you look at them from the,
the tour boat,

485
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:16,980
you see a lot of birds and you know,
it's birder's paradise. But you know,

486
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:22,080
in the middle of July it's overcast
and raining and the sea is pounding.

487
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:27,510
And then you notice the little
remanence of houses. Yup.

488
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,260
Uh,
question Oh,

489
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,950
a little caves.
Uh,

490
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:40,010
where people in the sixth and
seventh lived or the island is tiny,

491
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:43,830
you know, a smaller than this
building and there, you know,

492
00:35:43,831 --> 00:35:46,920
it looks like 20 people were living there.
What are they living on?

493
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,940
Well, poultry I guess, but, uh, um, uh,

494
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:56,250
this is a very severe form
of a sudden as Satta system.

495
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:01,550
And the wondering also can mean just
holing up on some island or wandering

496
00:36:04,441 --> 00:36:07,410
around the European con
continent and converting people.

497
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:12,860
The Irish were great missionaries
both to England and to the continent.

498
00:36:13,441 --> 00:36:17,280
And we'll be talking about that
some more. What about the, um,

499
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:21,600
the Irish as the saviors of civilization?
A book published about eight,

500
00:36:21,601 --> 00:36:26,490
nine years ago, uh, how the Irish saved
civilization is like all such, well,

501
00:36:26,491 --> 00:36:28,770
most sucky popular books,
um,

502
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,500
kind of overdone and reductionist.
Um,

503
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:37,410
it's not literally exactly true,
but here again, as with England,

504
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:42,530
we have a society that had no
Roman influence and yet had a,

505
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,630
a highly developed tradition of learning,

506
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:50,280
preservation of Latin in part very good
knowledge of Latin because they didn't

507
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:54,330
think they spoke it. Remember we said
the PM people in the former Roman empire,

508
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,420
it's hard to date the point
at which someone in Spain, uh,

509
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,820
is no longer speaking Latin,

510
00:36:59,821 --> 00:37:04,230
but it's speaking something that we
can start to call Spanish and Ireland.

511
00:37:04,231 --> 00:37:08,610
The distinction was quite clear.
You had to learn Latin in lessons.

512
00:37:08,611 --> 00:37:11,310
You had to go to class,
you had to be taught Latin.

513
00:37:11,311 --> 00:37:15,450
And so the Latin that was taught
was bookish. Uh, but for that,

514
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,780
um, uh, in many respects correct.

515
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,510
Finally, the, uh,

516
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:31,580
Irish celebrated Easter according
to a different calendar. Um,

517
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:35,660
and so we refer to the
Irish or the Celtic church.

518
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,540
We mean this more decentralized church,

519
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:42,740
there's somewhat more
wandering missionary church,

520
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,560
uh,
a,

521
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:50,620
a church that was less hierarchical and
less organized around bishops than that

522
00:37:51,651 --> 00:37:52,970
of its rival Rome.

523
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:58,700
The story of the seventh century in
England is therefore partly the story of

524
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,760
competition between paganism
and Christianity and flip
flopping between them and

525
00:38:03,831 --> 00:38:08,390
competition between Irish Christianity
represented by, for example,

526
00:38:08,391 --> 00:38:12,200
the monastery of Iona
in what's now Scotland.

527
00:38:12,201 --> 00:38:16,490
I o n a a the missions of Saint Iden,

528
00:38:16,491 --> 00:38:21,491
a I d a n whom bead describes with great
sympathy even though he doesn't agree

529
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:22,334
with him,

530
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:27,980
but the controversy really
centered ultimately or at least,

531
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:32,540
um,
in an immediate sense over Easter

532
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,880
at the Senate of in six 64.

533
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,553
Okay.

534
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:53,820
It was decided to embrace
the Roman calculation of
Easter and we're that bishops

535
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,610
hierarchy,
a more organized church.

536
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,970
I have a lot of trouble with
this Easter problem. I mean,

537
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:04,450
you will have noticed that I've evaded
telling you exactly what the calculations

538
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:09,100
are. Some of you may know
much better than me, but um,

539
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,610
the Jewish Passover is
established by lunar months.

540
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:18,810
Christians wanted to break with Jewish
tradition and celebrating east year, uh,

541
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,880
uh, uh, according to a
somewhat different calendar.

542
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,570
So it combined lunar and
solar methods of calculation,

543
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,140
very complex operation.
Therefore,

544
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:34,380
in a year for 55, Rome, that is to
say the papacy under our friendly,

545
00:39:34,381 --> 00:39:38,920
over the first, uh,
mission to the huns, um,

546
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:43,600
definition of the two natures
of Christ. Leo The first, uh,

547
00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:48,250
and Rome opted for a 19 year
cycle of calculating Easter,

548
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,350
but the Celtic churches cut off from
the continent. Remember, we're in this,

549
00:39:53,351 --> 00:39:57,280
uh, uh, post Roman world
have very little contact,

550
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,340
kept an 84 year cycle.

551
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So in the seventh century when the
Roman missionaries had arrived again,

552
00:40:06,341 --> 00:40:11,050
you have two conflicting dates
for Easter every year. I mean,

553
00:40:11,051 --> 00:40:15,490
occasionally just as with the Orthodox
and Catholic Easters, they come together.

554
00:40:15,491 --> 00:40:17,800
So every so often I will
actually be the same Sunday,

555
00:40:17,801 --> 00:40:18,940
but generally speaking different.

556
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,150
And so you get these
ludicrous scenes like king us,

557
00:40:22,151 --> 00:40:27,151
we have North Umbria celebrating Easter
according to the Celtic tradition.

558
00:40:27,881 --> 00:40:32,881
And his wife who was from Kent celebrated
according to the Roman tradition.

559
00:40:34,361 --> 00:40:39,361
So one Sunday was Celtic Easter and
then the next Sunday was Roman eastern.

560
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,430
Okay.

561
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:45,370
So it's not so much that Easter
is so important intrinsically,

562
00:40:45,371 --> 00:40:49,810
but it is a symbol of the
embrace of the Roman, uh,

563
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:54,520
form of Christianity and the bringing
of England into an orientation more

564
00:40:54,521 --> 00:40:58,480
towards the continent.
Then towards the Celtic West.

565
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:05,690
What is amazing, as I said before, is how
quickly once the conversion takes place,

566
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:10,170
England becomes not only integrated
into the continent, but a place of, uh,

567
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,170
a great cultural accomplishment.

568
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:20,130
The Great Archbishop of Canterbury
of this post with B era Theodore,

569
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,470
archbishop of Canterbury,

570
00:41:22,471 --> 00:41:26,070
six 69 to six 90 established bishoprics

571
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,830
monasteries

572
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:35,780
and endowed them with books.
Theodore is an interesting character.

573
00:41:35,781 --> 00:41:37,040
He's actually from Syria.

574
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,460
Okay.

575
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:44,350
And how somebody from Syria
becomes Archbishop of Canterbury,

576
00:41:44,351 --> 00:41:47,800
something that would be very
unlikely now in the seventh century,

577
00:41:47,801 --> 00:41:52,801
a d a is an aspect of some preservation
of the outlines of the cosmopolitan

578
00:41:55,151 --> 00:41:57,400
Roman world that we began the course web.

579
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,580
There are a lot of Syrian
pope's at this time,

580
00:42:00,581 --> 00:42:04,120
two Syrian and Greek popes
from the eastern Mediterranean.

581
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:10,763
The

582
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:15,400
first manuscript we have of the
Bible as a single manuscript.

583
00:42:15,401 --> 00:42:16,091
In other words,
we're,

584
00:42:16,091 --> 00:42:21,091
all of the books of the Bible are
contained in the same volume is from this

585
00:42:22,001 --> 00:42:26,230
place and this era, the so
called Codex Amiya, Tina's,

586
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:29,703
okay.

587
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,320
A magnificently decorated by ball.

588
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:42,210
Okay.

589
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:47,210
Sent to the pope in seven
16 written at beads,

590
00:42:48,031 --> 00:42:49,950
monastery of Gero.

591
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:55,310
Now in Florence at the metallurgy
Lorencia and library of Florence.

592
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,300
Yeah,

593
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:04,220
it is decorated in this very distinctive
style, but you all know of if not,

594
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:08,270
uh, um, from courses from
Christmas cards and stuff.

595
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:11,720
The book of Kells is the
most famous example of this.

596
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:16,580
This is the so called enchilada style
because it's shared by both Celtic Ireland

597
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:21,170
and Anglo Saxon England.
Lots of intricate curlicues,

598
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,630
complicated animals,

599
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:27,200
a magnificent contracts of color,

600
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:31,570
a kind of abstraction.
When you first look at it,

601
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:34,280
it looks like an oriental carpet,
but in fact,

602
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:35,830
if you look at it a little more closely,

603
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:40,580
you can see that there are all sorts
of little intertwining, uh, animals,

604
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,260
uh, or, uh,

605
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:45,650
fantastic shapes and colors within it.

606
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:53,070
Questions,
problems.

607
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,780
We could spend an entire semester
on, uh, England. But, uh,

608
00:43:57,781 --> 00:44:01,920
I think we've had at least a
taste of it's significance,

609
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:07,130
both in its own right and as one more
and rather different aspect of the post

610
00:44:08,431 --> 00:44:13,050
Roman world that we've been occupied with.
I'll see you for the exam on Monday.
