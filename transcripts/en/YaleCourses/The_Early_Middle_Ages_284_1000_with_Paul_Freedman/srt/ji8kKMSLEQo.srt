1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,980
Okay.
In seven 43 Oh,

2
00:00:05,981 --> 00:00:08,050
civil war started among,

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,650
within the [inaudible] had family over,
uh,

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,500
the Khalif for succession.

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,710
This war broke out in Persia,

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,400
which is a little unusual
because until this point,

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:26,700
the subversive discontented prodo
Shiite region had been what,

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:27,940
uh,

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,770
is called Kufa Kuf a basically
southern Iraq as an owl is,

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:34,480
uh,

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,480
it's thought that this revolt against
the Umayyads had the support of the

12
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:43,570
[inaudible] and it makes sense
that if it was in Persia,

13
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,830
the largest non Arab Muslim country,

14
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:53,070
it makes sense that you would have the
most concentration of non Arab Muslims.

15
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:59,740
That is to say converts or the descendants
of converts who might feel that the

16
00:00:59,741 --> 00:01:03,010
egalitarian promises of
Islam had been betrayed.

17
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,690
And that in fact the, uh,
religion was an Arab, uh,

18
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:12,750
one in which non Arabs were
in a subordinate position.

19
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,820
The non Arab Muslims of Persia had
converted some from Christianity.

20
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:25,930
Most from Zoroastrianism, a, uh, uh,

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,860
religion of Central Asia,
uh,

22
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:34,720
Wickham takes issue with this. Uh, if
you go back to your reading pages to 92,

23
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:39,220
to two 94, he says, um, uh, that,

24
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,340
uh, he doesn't think that, uh,

25
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,540
the discontent was related to somehow
the Omi is being an excessively Arab

26
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,320
rather than Muslim dynasty. Um, uh,

27
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,320
or that they provoke discontent
among recent converts.

28
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,650
So this is an open question.

29
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,910
I think there's gotta be
some Awali a discontent.

30
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,580
But as we've seen already,
there's plenty of discontent.

31
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:08,581
Shiite Sunni being the most obvious
intertribal regional problems of holding

32
00:02:09,131 --> 00:02:12,790
this empire together at any way rate.
Um,

33
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:19,410
uh, the, uh, um, uh,

34
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,150
in seven 49, seven 50, uh,

35
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:27,180
the [inaudible] had Colloff was deposed
by a member of another family known as

36
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:29,290
the Abbasids.

37
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,820
This new column,

38
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,050
a boy out about us.

39
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,230
I boss the,
the opposites,

40
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,280
the opposites.
We're early followers of Mohammed,

41
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:57,590
although not particularly heroic ones.

42
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,620
Oh, I'm the family had been supporters
but hadn't taken very many risks.

43
00:03:04,621 --> 00:03:07,770
So the Bostons or not eeros though,
they were an old family.

44
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,623
Okay.

45
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,730
The Abbasids came to power
with support from the Shiites.

46
00:03:14,731 --> 00:03:19,731
This is what Wickham means by what
he calls their salvationist theology.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,770
Salvationist meaning that they were,
uh,

48
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,360
going to restore the religious fervor
that the Umayyads had dissipated so that

49
00:03:31,471 --> 00:03:36,471
they were originally supposed
to represent a return.

50
00:03:36,751 --> 00:03:39,600
I reformation of Islam too.

51
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:44,601
It's austere routes in which the college
was a modest clean living austere

52
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,880
figure. They very quickly, if
that was the hope of the Shiites,

53
00:03:53,881 --> 00:03:58,590
the opposite is very, very
quickly to trade this. They,

54
00:03:58,591 --> 00:03:59,424
um,

55
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,930
they moved their capital from Damascus,

56
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:08,990
the Umayyad capital to a new city
that they constructed in the desert.

57
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,170
Baghdad.

58
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,920
A city built in concentric circles
as a planned round fortress city,

59
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:25,500
but also commercial city and of course
predominantly city of administration.

60
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,140
It was located 30 miles from
the old Persian capitol.

61
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,930
Persian empire

62
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,700
was ruled from Tessa Fon.

63
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,650
Relocating the capital of the caliphate
to Baghdad has a number of obvious

64
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:51,430
implications.

65
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,040
While most historians would not be
quite as confident as Peter Brown,

66
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,450
whom you're reading for Wednesday,

67
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:01,810
is that this represents the
Persian ization of the caliphate.

68
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:08,670
It is certainly true that moving
the Capitol to modern Iran, uh,

69
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:13,830
modern Iraq to the Mesopotamian part of
the former Persian empire orients the

70
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:17,830
califate further to the east.

71
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,490
It changes the center of gravity of the
caliphate from the Mediterranean as in

72
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:28,510
Damascus to um,
uh,

73
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,360
basically to Persia,
India,

74
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,190
the lands between them,
modern Afghanistan, Pakistan,

75
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,010
at least those are as important if not
more so now than the Mediterranean.

76
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,360
Even though the empire stretches
from the Indus River to the Atlantic,

77
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,090
it's center of gravity
has clearly shifted.

78
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,970
This has implications also for culture
as we'll talk about in a moment.

79
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:08,690
The accomplishment of the opposite
caliphate in terms of culture is to bring

80
00:06:10,381 --> 00:06:13,500
together realms that had not been

81
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:14,740
okay

82
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,460
in very much contact with each other.
Certainly not in terms of ideas,

83
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,450
namely India,

84
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,400
Persia and the Roman empire
or the former medic. Uh,

85
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,440
empire of the Mediterranean east

86
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,770
purchase stands in the middle
between India and the West.

87
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,960
To the extent that Persia is not
a isolated empire of its own,

88
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,520
but a crossroads.

89
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,410
This means that there's all this
exchange of information, techniques,

90
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,810
science,
art and culture.

91
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,571
But most of all,

92
00:06:48,571 --> 00:06:51,840
the establishment of Baghdad clearly
means a different kind of rulership.

93
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,940
One that it does not break with the
[inaudible] but rather to some extent, um,

94
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,350
uh, elaborates on it. This is an empire.

95
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,860
It is not a kind of sacred
kingdom of people living in tents.

96
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,163
Okay.

97
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,660
This is an empire more
open to eastern influences.

98
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,090
That is to say somewhat more Persian
in its style, less Mediterranean.

99
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,110
Um,
and originally more Shiite.

100
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,003
Yeah.

101
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,630
So the significance of the opposite
takeover is really basically two fold.

102
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,480
One is this move east to
Baghdad with all that,

103
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:41,190
it symbolizes that I just got through
saying the influence of non Muslim,

104
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,870
uh, non Arab Muslims and the creation of
a complex administration and even more

105
00:07:45,871 --> 00:07:48,930
complex administration than that
of the Mayans. And then two,

106
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:54,300
it shows the influence of the Shiites.
This begins is a Shiite victory. But uh,

107
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,760
very quickly the Shiites, as
I said, are disillusioned.

108
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,270
And so it also shows the
limitations of the Shiites.

109
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:04,860
The Shiites don't just want a
non Arab dominated Islamic world.

110
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,470
They want what we called last week,

111
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,500
a Republican administration
on non monarchical polity.

112
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:17,870
And the opposites are
monarchical if there anything

113
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,680
until the early 10th century when the
opposite Caliphate starts to break up. Uh,

114
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,820
the, uh, uh, world of Islam was splendid,

115
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,500
rich,
cultivated and scientifically,

116
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,090
uh,
progressive.

117
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,220
There would be no more great conquests,
particularly in the West,

118
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,460
all ready before the opposites took power.

119
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,640
We've pointed to two moments in which
the Arab expansion or the Islamic

120
00:08:52,551 --> 00:08:55,530
expansion was stopped.
One in seven,

121
00:08:55,531 --> 00:09:00,531
17 before the walls of Constantinople
in the failed siege of Constantinople to

122
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,870
the battle of Poitier,

123
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:09,120
not that far from Paris in
northern France in seven 33.

124
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:14,380
A battle at which the Merovingians
or really their high servants,

125
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:19,200
um, so called mayors of the
palace defeated Arab Raiders,

126
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,970
um, who then retreated
basically back to Spain.

127
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,880
To some extent,
these defeats in the West.

128
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:34,881
We're not so much defeats from the Caliphs
point of view as a reorientation in

129
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:39,120
seven 50.
Moving the capital back to Baghdad.

130
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,400
The capital to Baghdad from Damascus
also means less interest in the west.

131
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:48,150
Less interest in trying to take over
France if that was ever a serious goal,

132
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,790
less interest in besieging Constantinople.

133
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:59,660
The opposites begin by inviting all
of the Umayyad survivors to a banquet,

134
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:04,590
supposed to be a banquet
of reconciliation,

135
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:10,370
and instead they had their servitors
kill all of the [inaudible] at the dinner

136
00:10:10,891 --> 00:10:14,870
table, spread a leather
cloth over the, um,

137
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,570
some of them were already dead,
some of them merely wounded. Um,

138
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,680
and with the leather cloth over them, a
set the table again and banquet on there,

139
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,280
a dead and dying,
uh,

140
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:31,260
enemies satisfying. Definitely. Um,

141
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,110
one whom I had escaped,
uh, not from the banquet,

142
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:38,570
but he had had the foresight
to say he was busy, uh,

143
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,630
and he escaped as far as he could go
in the Muslim world, namely Spain.

144
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,270
The last [inaudible] then,
um,

145
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:51,770
Abdur Rahman came to Spain
and was a claimed by the
population or got himself to

146
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:59,751
be a claimed by the population and ruled
in Spain as the first Islamic ruler to

147
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:04,590
defy the califate.
Thus,

148
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:08,670
the first independent Islamic kingdom,

149
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,340
we can call it,
although they don't use that term,

150
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:15,690
the first independent Islamic kingdom
independent of the caliphate would be

151
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:16,524
Spain.

152
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,280
The Omi had ruler actually
recognized by Dodd.

153
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,430
He did not proclaim
himself arrival caliph.

154
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:30,431
It was easy for him to recognize Baghdad
3000 miles away or whatever it is.

155
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,270
Uh, they weren't going to come and
get him. He took the title of Emea.

156
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,960
Emi are, uh, a ruler who is,

157
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,940
um, it's more like a title of
a governor than that of a king.

158
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,190
Nevertheless, as I said, um,

159
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:52,310
Islamic Spain represents the first piece
of the Cali Fall Empire to break off

160
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:02,850
when the opposite califit ran into
trouble in the early 10th century.

161
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:07,960
Then the Umayyad ruler of Spain
proclaimed himself college

162
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,860
in nine 29,

163
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:16,400
he proclaimed himself caliph of Cordoba
Cordova was the capital of [inaudible]

164
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:22,470
Spain.
And so at this point,

165
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,230
Spain becomes the most splendid,

166
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,840
most cultivated part of the Islamic world.

167
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,680
So if the period of the maximum power and
splendor of the opposite caliphate was

168
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,220
roughly seven 50 to nine,
10,

169
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:43,730
the period of maximum splendor of the
caliphate of Cordoba in all under loose or

170
00:12:44,311 --> 00:12:48,000
Spain was about eight 52,

171
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:51,630
it's sudden collapse in 1009.

172
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,660
Okay.

173
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:01,010
Questions? Problems? A
lot of names here. No,

174
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,990
you don't have a final exam. So what
do you care? But I realize it is,

175
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,840
um, uh, a dramatic story,

176
00:13:08,841 --> 00:13:13,100
but one with a large cast of characters
by now you're used to this in history.

177
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,130
Um,
whether these are good cat names or not,

178
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:21,260
I'm not as sure as I am with the
barbarians, uh, but worth experiments

179
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,260
as Wickham has described,

180
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:27,860
the Abbasid Caliphate was based on
tax collection and administration.

181
00:13:27,861 --> 00:13:32,150
And your response to that may
be, uh, yeah, well, so what,

182
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,610
um, but that's not true of all the
states that we've been studying.

183
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,010
If you take something
like mirror eventual goal,

184
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,650
even though in the early period
they're still collecting taxes.

185
00:13:42,651 --> 00:13:46,670
Remember Fred or gun tells chill Peric
let's burn these tax records and maybe

186
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,470
our sons will be cured
of their disease by God.

187
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,610
Uh,

188
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,840
but you'll have seen in Gregory a tour
that basically the mirror of engines are

189
00:13:56,841 --> 00:13:58,280
rich because of plunder,

190
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:04,090
military expeditions and land land
above all is the source of wealth in the

191
00:14:07,131 --> 00:14:12,131
kingdoms of Western Europe land and the
peasants to till it obviously it's no

192
00:14:14,031 --> 00:14:17,270
good if it's just empty land,
usually not least.

193
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,200
It's productive land and this is
the source of wealth. Therefore,

194
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:25,790
the state gains its wealth on the basis
of things like land, military power,

195
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:31,180
and not on the basis of taxing
and economy that is more sluggish,

196
00:14:33,231 --> 00:14:34,340
has less trade,

197
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:39,400
less income than in the uh,

198
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,190
uh,
cities of the Muslim world.

199
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,133
Okay.

200
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:50,970
The Caliphate was a tax paying
state with a central army.

201
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,270
Therefore,

202
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,470
the nobility as such as it was,

203
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:02,150
was not a group of local potentates
as they had been under the late Roman

204
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,910
empire.
Great landowners for example.

205
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:10,540
Nor was it a military elite cuase I
independent whose loyalty to the ruler was

206
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:16,940
conditional on their own interest.
As we've seen with the Merovingian,

207
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,980
um, uh, nights rather,

208
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:26,981
it was a complicated administration
served as a structure of a vast empire and

209
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:35,540
the tax revenue came into the
college whose administration,

210
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:39,620
who's civilian administration,
was supreme over army,

211
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,530
over local elites,
over great land owners.

212
00:15:45,531 --> 00:15:46,640
At least for a time.

213
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,940
The opposite empire was the greatest
state in the world at that time.

214
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,570
It's only rival,
might've been Tang China,

215
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,550
but this is the period of the decline
of that empire bogged Dodd was the

216
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:06,070
wealthiest and largest city in the world.

217
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:08,970
Okay.

218
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:13,970
Among the programs of the Abbasids in
addition to building this plan city,

219
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,020
uh, um, creating a certain
kind of military structure,

220
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:24,320
consolidating their conquest among
their plans was a cultural program.

221
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,800
The cultural flowering of the Abbasid
Caliphate is in part a planned flowering,

222
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,020
not just a spontaneous one.

223
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:40,340
The Caliphs funded translations into
Arabic of Greek and Persian texts dealing

224
00:16:43,321 --> 00:16:46,980
with science,
geography,

225
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:53,280
mathematics, philosophy,
and medicine in particular

226
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,010
in eight 30,
one of the columns established in Baghdad,

227
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:04,660
a kind of combination of library and
Research Institute called the House of

228
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,893
Wisdom.

229
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,610
Okay.

230
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,950
The House of wisdom in the first place,

231
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,850
paid for and sponsored translations,

232
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,230
but it also conducted research activities,

233
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:26,000
things like an effort to measure
the circumference of the earth.

234
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:28,990
Okay.

235
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,940
Kind of thing that,
you know,

236
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,890
how do you actually do that
without modern instrumentation?

237
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:43,080
A lot of the material that they,
um,

238
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:48,270
translated was from
Greek scientific works.

239
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:58,570
Where did they get these? In some
cases they got them from Byzantium,

240
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,070
from Constantinople itself.

241
00:18:00,071 --> 00:18:05,071
It said that one treaty between
Constantinople and Baghdad cold for,

242
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,680
among other things,
um,

243
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:12,280
the Byzantine emperor to lend to Baghdad,

244
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:16,600
a copy of Ptolemies
geography. Ptolemy, the,

245
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:21,220
uh, one of the great geographers
of the ancient world,

246
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,500
a author of a book called the
great geography known in the West.

247
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,360
Later on when it was translated into
Latin from the Arabic as the Alma guest,

248
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,310
which is a Arab garb,

249
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,750
Latin garbling of an Arab garbling of
the original Greek title of the work.

250
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,580
So this was known in the West even when
it was translated into Latin as the Alma

251
00:18:48,581 --> 00:18:49,240
guest.

252
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,920
And it was just one of many works that
when they finally reached Western Europe

253
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,080
in translations from the Arabic kept a
kind of version of their Arabic name.

254
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:04,390
But the idea that as part of a treaty, one
of the things was you lend us this, uh,

255
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:09,040
uh, copy of Ptolemy so that we can
translate it into Arabic shows,

256
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:14,160
the commitment of the rulers to the
expansion of practical knowledge.

257
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,830
What Islamic scholars,

258
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,860
scientists and policymakers were most
interested in from the classical world

259
00:19:23,141 --> 00:19:28,141
that is from the world of the Greek
and Roman civilization was science,

260
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:34,420
broadly speaking, science. They were
less concerned with Greek plays,

261
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,420
Greek poetry,
Greek literature in general.

262
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,980
This is partly because they had their
own poetic tradition in Arabic and partly

263
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:46,600
because they're real source of inspiration
for literature would be Persia.

264
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,820
Uh, the stories as in
the Arabian Nights, uh,

265
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:56,020
and the kind of lyrical poetry,
uh,

266
00:19:56,021 --> 00:20:00,470
of the Arabs like love poetry
or sensuous poetry, uh,

267
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,250
is either homegrown or Persian.

268
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,913
Okay.

269
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,940
So they translated things like Euclid on
geometry or the physician Daya score at

270
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:17,550
ease, uh, who wrote,

271
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:22,680
not the only,
but the leading pharmaceutical manual,

272
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,490
pharmaceutical manual list of drugs,
their properties, what they come from,

273
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:27,330
what they can cure.

274
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,090
However,
although they concentrated on science,

275
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:38,030
they also were interested in philosophy.

276
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:42,590
They were also interested in propositions.

277
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,760
The Lenten nature of reality,
metaphysics.

278
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:52,990
And the major project in this realm
was the translation of Aristotle.

279
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,640
Aristotle is someone
who wrote on everything

280
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:08,340
on drama, poetry, politics,

281
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,370
metaphysics, ethics, animals,

282
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,103
physics.

283
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,680
And so his influence would be tremendous
in all three religions that we are

284
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:29,510
concerned with, Islam,
Christianity and Judaism.

285
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,290
His influence tends to be interrelated.

286
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,580
Realms are factors.
One is its comprehensiveness.

287
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,980
They didn't translate
everything of Aristotle's,

288
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:48,460
but all three civilizations were aware
of Aristotle as a universal thinker.

289
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,810
That somewhere in the work of Aristotle,

290
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:53,090
there's something about
everything that's worth studying.

291
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:58,430
He has then an encyclopedic thinker
in a way that Plato is not right.

292
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,860
Plato is not interested
in the natural world.

293
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:04,610
If you go to Plato for information
about animals or plants,

294
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:08,330
you're going to be out of luck because
Plato despises things like that.

295
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,840
Plato's very interested in ethics
in how to live life in reality,

296
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,920
in the relationship between
matter and spirit. Um,

297
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,420
but he's not a scientist. Um, he, uh, uh,

298
00:22:23,421 --> 00:22:26,780
to put it mildly,
he's not interested in the material world,

299
00:22:26,781 --> 00:22:30,080
whereas Aristotle believes
that the material world,

300
00:22:30,081 --> 00:22:34,760
although not necessarily the be all
and end all of everything is reliable,

301
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,490
that our senses can give
us decent information.

302
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:42,530
But observation of the natural world
leads to more than merely practical

303
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:46,810
knowledge, if you know, say how to
plow or how to plant things. Uh,

304
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:51,340
but leads to knowledge of what
creation, what nature. Uh,

305
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:56,260
yes. So Aristotle, his encyclopedic,

306
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:01,120
and he's also rational. This is the
second contribution that Aristotle makes.

307
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:06,500
Rationality that anything from plays to,
uh,

308
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:11,550
rocks can be understood in
terms of a logical analysis.

309
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:19,060
This is fine when it comes to plays
and rocks, but what about metaphysics?

310
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,820
What about the world of religion?

311
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:26,590
Aristotle has a profound influence here,
again,

312
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:31,650
not only on Islam but on Judaism and
Christianity because he essentially

313
00:23:32,531 --> 00:23:37,420
encourages a rational view of God.
Now,

314
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,860
Aristotle is himself not much of a theist.

315
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,900
That is to say Aristotle doesn't go on
about God very much and whatever God

316
00:23:47,061 --> 00:23:52,061
there is an Aristotle is not a personal
God to who you would prey on the

317
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:57,590
assumption or in the belief that he
was interested in your wellbeing.

318
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:03,430
The closest Aristotle gets to God is
the notion of a kind of great mechanic,

319
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,730
the prime mover as he would be
called in western philosophy.

320
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,910
The guy who makes the mechanism,

321
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:19,250
sets it going and maybe
every so often maintains it.

322
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:25,190
Maybe little oil here,
a little bit of timing there,

323
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:29,870
but he's not the god of Gregory of tour.

324
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:35,600
He's not the God who is inspiring saints
to get revenge when their powers or

325
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:38,510
questioned or when somebody
steals. Hey, from there,

326
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:43,970
this is not Aristotle's God.
Aristotle's God is

327
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,930
not concerned with our
little petty squabbles. Uh,

328
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:56,000
it's not Mohammed's God exactly either.
A,

329
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:59,630
it's not a god who
brings victory in battle,

330
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:04,631
who's interested in a new prophecy that
will seal all the previous profits.

331
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,800
It's a somewhat mechanistic God.

332
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:12,350
It's an 18th century God.

333
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,900
Even a sort of deist God.

334
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:19,370
For those of you who have studied
that, the notion, you know, uh,

335
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,340
uh, that, um, uh,

336
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,940
the world must've been created by God
because it has a lot of design in it.

337
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,020
It works. You know, it has a, uh,

338
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,550
one animal gives birth to another
animal just like it. You know,

339
00:25:31,551 --> 00:25:35,870
the tides go in and out. The
weather is usually rational. Uh,

340
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:40,390
winter is usually cold.
Halloween is usually crisp. Um,

341
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,410
uh, that's imposed by some
kind of original order.

342
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:50,480
Just like if you went and found
a watch on a deserted pathway,

343
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,390
you wouldn't assume that nature
had constructed the watch,

344
00:25:53,391 --> 00:25:54,650
that it just was growing there,

345
00:25:54,651 --> 00:25:58,670
the way the ferns were growing by the
path you would assume some artificer had

346
00:25:58,671 --> 00:26:03,110
been. But that doesn't mean that
the artifice or is still alive,

347
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,690
still interested in the watch,
uh,

348
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,630
inclined to take care of you.

349
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:15,520
I go on this detour or seeming detour
about Aristotle because he's important to

350
00:26:15,831 --> 00:26:19,910
everything in the period
that we're discussing.

351
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:24,911
And also in the period of
that is concerned for the
West in the continuation of

352
00:26:25,281 --> 00:26:27,680
this course in history to 11,

353
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:32,780
there are three thinkers
just to take examples.

354
00:26:32,781 --> 00:26:35,570
The most famous thinkers
in each of the Jewish,

355
00:26:35,571 --> 00:26:40,430
Christian and Islamic traditions
who embrace Aristotle.

356
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:45,420
And in doing so, embrace the
idea of as a rational, um,

357
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,250
companion to ma'am,

358
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,600
these are the Arab philosopher
known in the West as a Vero,

359
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:56,460
as cure.
Again,

360
00:26:56,461 --> 00:27:01,461
as with all my guests were using his
sort of Latin garbled name of fairways

361
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:08,130
active in Spain,
1126 to 1198.

362
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,890
My monities,

363
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:17,370
perhaps the greatest Jewish philosopher,
a rabbi,

364
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,660
a physician accordia and a philosopher,

365
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,320
also active in Spain.
Uh, but also in Egypt,

366
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:29,430
1135 to 1204

367
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,270
and Thomas Aquinas.

368
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,023
Okay.

369
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:40,410
You spent most of his career
teaching at the University of Paris

370
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,850
1225 to 1274.

371
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:49,470
All of these thinkers embraced Aristotle,
the Latin ones,

372
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,700
um, uh, like Aquinas, uh,

373
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,200
via translations from the Arabic.

374
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,640
Aristotle was known in the medieval west,
not from the Greek originals,

375
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:03,090
but from translations made
from Arabic into Latin.

376
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,800
All believed that reason
and faith are compatible

377
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,990
all base, their outlook not
only on nature, but on God,

378
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:18,770
on an heiress cotillion form of knowledge.

379
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,953
Interesting

380
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,830
in that Aristotle knew
nothing about Judaism,

381
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,230
Christianity or Islam.

382
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,153
Huh?

383
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:40,950
So what is the,
in about Aristotle,

384
00:28:40,951 --> 00:28:43,510
what is it about dive securities?
What is it about Tommy?

385
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,450
All of these scientists and philosophers
that is of such fascination to the

386
00:28:48,451 --> 00:28:49,284
Islamic world.

387
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,550
All of this emphasis that we've made
on Islamic culture and its openness to

388
00:28:56,551 --> 00:28:59,880
other influences may seem strange to you.

389
00:28:59,881 --> 00:29:03,480
In light of the reputation
Islam has in modern America,

390
00:29:03,481 --> 00:29:08,160
or at least in many circles of modern
America and Europe as being obscure,

391
00:29:08,161 --> 00:29:12,960
ramp test or anti modern or
religiously inflexible. Uh,

392
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,440
I teach, uh, a group of, uh,

393
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,800
retired people in where I
live in just outside New York.

394
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,960
Uh, and we're studying, um,

395
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:30,080
Islamic Spain and they're like astounded
at w what I've just described at the

396
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,930
openness of Islam to other
civilizations at its tolerance at,

397
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,960
it's a curiosity about
classical and Persian science.

398
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,650
And I was surprised because
this is not new information.

399
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:55,600
This is not something that historians have
just come up with and just discovered.

400
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:00,070
If you read medieval history
textbooks of 100 years ago,

401
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,691
it's in there.

402
00:30:01,691 --> 00:30:06,340
Everybody knows that Aristotle was
translated from Arabic into Latin.

403
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,390
Everybody knows everybody who
studied the of the Middle Ages knows.

404
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:16,090
And I said to them, because you know,
you can't say to older people, oh, well,

405
00:30:16,091 --> 00:30:20,470
you know, your education
is, uh, is uh, uh,

406
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,850
actually not very good.

407
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,350
The way we say to you right all the time
or your attention span is not very good

408
00:30:26,351 --> 00:30:30,130
because all, you know, all,
all you're doing is you're,
you're plugged into uh, uh,

409
00:30:30,131 --> 00:30:32,530
your, uh, your social world. No,

410
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:36,700
these people went to college and the tough
old days I'd legitly and they're like,

411
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,800
God,
I thought Islam was just,

412
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:43,120
I thought it was just like this sort of
frozen religion that had never changed.

413
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,290
And so, um, you don't
have that disadvantage.

414
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:48,640
You don't have that idea.

415
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:53,020
And so I'm not going to brow beat you
with it on the basis of the experience of

416
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:57,870
teaching 70 year olds.
Uh, but there it is. Um,

417
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:03,070
I do not accept the notion well with one
exception, with one honorable exception.

418
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:08,080
Um, right. Right. Me Too. So,

419
00:31:08,081 --> 00:31:10,070
um,
uh,

420
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,370
I don't want to go into a long
discussion about, you know,

421
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,190
Islam right or wrong or Islam
progressive or regressive.

422
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,390
I will say this.
Uh,

423
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,100
there are those who believe
wrongly in my opinion,

424
00:31:24,101 --> 00:31:27,220
that there's always been this clash of
civilization as it's sometimes called

425
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:31,020
between the Progressive
Christian West and the, uh,

426
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,550
obscurantist Islamic East.

427
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,610
I don't accept that in part
for reasons you've just heard.

428
00:31:36,611 --> 00:31:41,470
There is no a consistent
Islamic tradition, uh,

429
00:31:41,471 --> 00:31:42,940
of,
um,

430
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:49,260
of the maintenance of Dogma
or the conversion of the
world by force in so far as

431
00:31:49,901 --> 00:31:53,440
that exists now. Uh, it is, in my opinion,

432
00:31:53,441 --> 00:31:55,600
a modern phenomenon.

433
00:31:55,630 --> 00:32:00,340
It is a phenomenon that results from an
encounter with the West beginning around

434
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:04,660
the time of Napoleon's conquest of Egypt.
Perhaps it's about two centuries old.

435
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:11,130
There's another kind of belief
that at some point things changed.

436
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,380
And there's a book by Bernard Lewis,

437
00:32:14,381 --> 00:32:19,381
the most eminent western scholar of
Islamic culture called what went wrong.

438
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,330
And so Louis's assumption is that
the world that I'm describing,

439
00:32:25,331 --> 00:32:29,800
the opposite caliphate is an open society.
And at some point,

440
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:33,790
and for some reasons, uh, the
Islamic world closed itself,

441
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:38,260
became less susceptible to outside
influence, more suspicious of it,

442
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:41,510
more dogmatic,
more anti modern,

443
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:47,630
more fixated on literalism what in the
West during the question traditionally be

444
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:51,830
called fundamentalism. Uh,
and, uh, on, uh, tradition.

445
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,141
Uh,

446
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:59,141
I don't really like this either because
it sees all progress as the property of

447
00:32:59,781 --> 00:33:01,820
Western civilization.
Uh,

448
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:06,920
and it's not that I am not
interested in western civilization.

449
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:10,780
I've taught it, I taught
it because I liked it. Uh,

450
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:16,100
I'm not somebody who, you
know, uh, believes that it's
all a tale of oppression.

451
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:16,741
Uh,

452
00:33:16,741 --> 00:33:21,741
but I don't think that anybody who diverts
from the path of Western civilization

453
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:25,670
at some point is, you know, um, uh,

454
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,360
going off the cliff or off
the trail and into the woods,

455
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:31,880
there are a lot of different
civilizations out there.

456
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,910
There's a third related idea that the
Arabs are just intermediaries. Yeah,

457
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,511
it's great.

458
00:33:38,511 --> 00:33:43,010
They translate Aristotle so that the
real guys who can really use Aristotle,

459
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,990
Thomas Aquinas, that all
can, can get started.

460
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:50,300
And I don't accept that either because,
uh, uh, they do more than that.

461
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:55,330
They do an awful lot of original
research and medicine in mathematics,

462
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,410
in philosophy.

463
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:04,900
But within all of this, to my
mind, fruitless speculation,

464
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:08,050
there is a kernel of what
is an interesting problem.

465
00:34:08,051 --> 00:34:12,670
And the interesting problem is why were
the Arabs so much more successful in

466
00:34:12,671 --> 00:34:17,671
assimilating conquered cultures
than other invaders were?

467
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:20,650
Say for example,
the Germans,

468
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:28,020
you don't get this kind of a efflorescence
of culture under the barbarian

469
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:31,720
occupants of the former Roman empire.

470
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:36,280
We're talking not just about
cultural survival, keep in mind,

471
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:41,460
but about uh, um, a,

472
00:34:41,461 --> 00:34:46,240
an expansion of science and uh,
allied arts.

473
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:52,530
I'd say there are maybe four factors that
encourage the Arab conquest to absorb

474
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:58,690
these new influences and they're
not in themselves explanations,

475
00:34:58,691 --> 00:35:01,060
but they're certainly background factors.

476
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:06,100
The fact that the conquest was
quick and relatively painless

477
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,070
and then it was not
really a religious war.

478
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,570
Two and I think here,
very important,

479
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,220
the elimination of frontiers.
I mentioned this briefly before,

480
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:26,810
you get Persian as well as
Greek astronomy from India.

481
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:30,150
You get things like chess,

482
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:35,460
so-called Arabic numerals,
[inaudible] we all know come from India.

483
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:41,660
These come into the Arab and Persian
worlds from India and eventually to Europe

484
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:43,434
as well.

485
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:48,590
In a world in which there are no
frontiers between India and uh,

486
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,740
North Africa, you can go, uh,

487
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:55,050
these thousands of miles peacefully.

488
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:05,200
The elimination of linguistic boundaries,
Arab [inaudible],

489
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:08,470
the language of learning
much as Latin would be, uh,

490
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,280
in the European Middle Ages,

491
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:14,540
much as English has tended
to become in our era.

492
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:16,660
Okay.

493
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:21,070
So my monities, the great Jewish
philosopher wrote largely in Arabic,

494
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:29,000
the Christians of Spain, so
called Mozarabic Christians, uh,

495
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:33,790
studied Arabic, fought in
Arabic, wrote in Arabic.

496
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,450
And finally,
number four,

497
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:42,600
the attitude of the conquerors and the
conquered the attitude of the conquerors

498
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:49,390
was, um, what Peter Brown and
the reading for Wednesday,

499
00:36:49,391 --> 00:36:52,450
we'll call a garden
protected by our spirit.

500
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,350
Since this is a quote
from one of the concours,

501
00:36:56,590 --> 00:37:01,590
the Arab concours considered these to be
wonderful civilizations that they were

502
00:37:02,771 --> 00:37:04,930
not going to pillage or destroy,

503
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:08,740
but rather protect a garden
protected by our spears.

504
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:12,610
But they were planning
on enjoying the garden,

505
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,640
not merely standing on the outside
defending it for other people to enjoy

506
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,960
the conquerors. We're confident
in their religion, so confident,

507
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:29,040
but they didn't need for others
to recognize it or convert.

508
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:35,540
It also gave them the confidence to
accept new ideas from Greek civilization,

509
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,560
from Persian civilization,
from India.

510
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,610
But there's also the
attitude of the conquered.

511
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:51,090
Brown says that as the storm of the
Arab armies rolled over the horizon,

512
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,320
the population of the Near East
sat back to enjoy the sunshine.

513
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,720
The Islamic conquest was of benefit and
perceived as of benefit by most of the

514
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:06,390
people who were conquered.

515
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:13,680
A kind of counter example
in a way explains this.

516
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:19,590
In Cordova, the Capitol of
the Umayyad Caliphate of uh,

517
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:24,120
or soon to be colorful of um, uh, Spain.

518
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:30,290
A group of Christians around
eight 50 were so upset at the,

519
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,333
um,

520
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:37,580
contented attitude of the Christians
of Islamic Spain who were,

521
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:42,550
if not a majority, probably about
50%, close to 50% of this time,

522
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,120
these more fanatical,

523
00:38:46,121 --> 00:38:51,121
or at least more serious Christians were
so angry that all of their compatriots

524
00:38:51,521 --> 00:38:53,920
seem to be just fine with Islamic rule.

525
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:57,970
That they got up in the marketplace
of Cordova and denounced Mohammed as a

526
00:38:57,971 --> 00:39:01,030
charlatan,
as a false god,

527
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:06,190
and as not a prophet.
And while Islam is tolerant,

528
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:10,480
that is something that you couldn't
do a, so they did, you know,

529
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:12,700
the thing that was most
defiant of the regime,

530
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:17,080
really the moral equivalent of like
burning yourself, uh, in the marketplace.

531
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,730
And indeed they were imprisoned, told
to recant. And when they didn't recant,

532
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,470
they were executed.
Uh,

533
00:39:23,471 --> 00:39:27,070
there are about 50 of these martyrs
of Cordova as they're called,

534
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:32,560
but they have to seek martyrdom
because they have to look for it.

535
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:37,770
They have to create it because almost
all the rest of their compatriots are

536
00:39:38,261 --> 00:39:41,950
perfectly happy to be most Arabic
Christians practicing the freedom of their

537
00:39:41,951 --> 00:39:46,180
religion under a beneficence regime,

538
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:51,160
beneficence in the eyes of these martyr
Christians. But nevertheless, uh, uh,

539
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,950
you know, uh, the, uh,
a regime of the devil.

540
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:59,500
This shows you something about the nature
of the Arab conquest and occupation.

541
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:01,660
Uh,

542
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:06,660
let me just speak briefly about
a couple of aspects of what the,

543
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,100
uh, Islamic world was
interested in studying. Uh,

544
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,330
and we may continue over into next time,
uh,

545
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:18,990
since the lecture on the seventh
centuries actually rather short. Uh,

546
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,470
let's start with mathematics.

547
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:27,360
The great accomplishment of this time
is the introduction of Arabic numbers,

548
00:40:28,451 --> 00:40:32,590
which if you've ever tried to multiply
or divide with Roman numerals are

549
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:36,640
superior Arabic numbers come from India.

550
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:41,710
And along with this system of numerals,
they imported zero,

551
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:45,730
both of the number or the
non number and the concept,

552
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:50,560
the concept of zero allows for
things like decimal places,

553
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,290
which are also developed at this time

554
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,970
from India.

555
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:03,030
The Arabs get the kind of very
basic ideas of trigonometry,

556
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,950
the sine function,
but it is their own researches,

557
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:15,510
their own progress that leads to the
call it discovery or development of the

558
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:18,190
five other functions.

559
00:41:18,191 --> 00:41:23,191
And here I'm on kind of tricky ground
because despite what they tell you about

560
00:41:23,321 --> 00:41:27,400
math literacy and how important it is,
I haven't used this since 10th grade,

561
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,420
but I do remember the co-sign,
the tangent,

562
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,810
the Cotangent, the sea
Canton, the Cosi camp, right?

563
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:41,240
All of these are discovered by the Arabs.
Hey, they are, they built on an edifice,

564
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:44,300
uh,
whose foundation is Indian mathematics

565
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,090
in the early ninth century,

566
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:55,510
a scholar attached to that house of
wisdom in Baghdad named all a quorum.

567
00:41:57,191 --> 00:42:00,170
Zane inquiries me around there.

568
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,003
Okay.

569
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:09,550
Quarries mean in the early ninth century,
Alcor reads me,

570
00:42:09,551 --> 00:42:13,990
writes a book with the title that can
be translated as something like the book

571
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:18,190
of addition and subtraction
according to the Hindu calculation.

572
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:22,180
And this is what it incorporates,
zero and decimal places.

573
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,350
And interestingly enough,

574
00:42:23,351 --> 00:42:27,220
this book is known only from
its translation into Latin.

575
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:32,350
The Latin version survives where's
the original Arabic does not.

576
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:35,703
Yeah.

577
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,750
Within a century of the
publication of this book,

578
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,620
a decimal fractions had been developed.
Square roots.

579
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:46,970
The value of Pi to 16 decimal
places had been calculated

580
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:53,600
at quarries. Me is also the
author of a treatise on Algebra.

581
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:58,550
The word Algebra comes from Al Jabbar,
uh,

582
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:05,380
which is sort of restoring,

583
00:43:05,381 --> 00:43:08,770
restoring something that has been in
balance and that you're now going to

584
00:43:08,771 --> 00:43:12,760
balance with of courses in a way,
the visual nature of Algebra

585
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:17,020
all Cory's me,
it was also an astronomer.

586
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:22,530
He developed star tables that allowed
one to locate the planets and stars at

587
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:26,800
different times of year
and at different latitudes.

588
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:32,250
This is what allows the making of
things like astrolabs or later sexton's.

589
00:43:34,901 --> 00:43:39,901
These are things that describe the sky
at a particular time that allow you then

590
00:43:40,091 --> 00:43:44,290
to keep time and also, um, to navigate,

591
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:46,570
okay.

592
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:50,620
To calculate time for things
like prayers or feasts,

593
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,620
celebrations,
also to cast horoscopes.

594
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:02,050
I'll work a little more with you
on geography, medicine, and then,

595
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:06,930
um, summer runs the Abbasids at the
beginning of our next class. Uh,

596
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,070
so I'll let you go for now.
Thanks.
