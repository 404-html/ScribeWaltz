1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,580
But,
uh,

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,970
the advantage of talking to you even
on an inconvenient day is Diocletian.

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,023
Uh,

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,860
we don't use terms in the professional
world of history like awesome,

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,120
very much,
but the guys certainly deserves that.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,180
He rescued the Roman empire and we'll
begin by saying what he rescued it from a,

7
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:32,610
as a preliminary,
the sections are meeting this week.

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,960
If you're wait listed for a
session section, just go to it. Um,

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,020
we will have enough sections for however
many people take this course, right?

10
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:48,021
So they're currently for the additional
ones were that were added since last

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,940
week, uh, are, um,

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,530
Wednesday at two 30 and Thursday at seven.

13
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,090
And again, if you're
waitlisted, just go, we'll,

14
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:04,470
we'll figure this out there. There
will be enough sections for everybody.

15
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,050
So,
um,

16
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,650
I referred last time to
the third century crisis,

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,600
the crisis of the Roman Empire that
proceeded the accession of Diocletian from

18
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:20,601
two 35 to two 84 and we mentioned several
interrelated weaknesses of the empire

19
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:28,641
that might be seen as longterm
causes of this crisis.

20
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,270
Um,
a the size of the empire,

21
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,230
it's sheer massive size.

22
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,660
The problem of succession.

23
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,060
That is, it was never quite clear and
we'll talk about this in more detail.

24
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,290
Um,
how one emperor succeeded another,

25
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,440
the urban rural imbalance.
This was a,

26
00:01:58,441 --> 00:02:03,441
an empire built on cities
and to some extent,

27
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,350
although heavily debated among
historians to what extent,

28
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,590
but to some extent the cities may be said
to have drained off the energy or been

29
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,110
parasites on the productivity
of the countryside.

30
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,750
Uh,
it was an empire that was um,

31
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:25,950
according to one point of view,

32
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:29,190
more cosmopolitan than it had been
according to another point of view.

33
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,320
More barbarian.
In other words,

34
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:36,321
this was an empire who's Roman
population was less dominant,

35
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,380
partly through its own success
in coopting other peoples,

36
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,270
some of the peoples that had co-opted,

37
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,580
we're not actually originally inhabitants
of the empire particularly this is

38
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:55,390
visible in the army's which
tended to be staffed by uh,

39
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,040
uh,
so called barbarian tribes,

40
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,670
so called by the Romans who
refer to them as barbarians.

41
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,540
Okay.

42
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,540
Another problem is the east West imbalance
where the east tends to do better

43
00:03:12,211 --> 00:03:17,211
economically and demographically
them the west demographically meaning

44
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,530
population.

45
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,930
We live in a world when one of the
great threats is overpopulation.

46
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,350
It is therefore not self evident,

47
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:34,130
although true that for most of the time
historically most places have trouble

48
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,570
reproducing their population.

49
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,930
And indeed we are starting to enter into
a period of great demographic decline.

50
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,320
Okay.

51
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,150
The infant mortality,
the low life expectancy,

52
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,280
the death of women in childbirth,

53
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,470
the prevalence of disease and to some
extent military threats of invasion,

54
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,620
uh, or not threats. The reality, um,

55
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:08,830
made it hard for one generation to
produce children to replace itself.

56
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,890
And this is true up until
the dawn of Moderna team.

57
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,970
So these are fundamental
problems of the Roman empire.

58
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:22,420
The real question is why do they
explode in the third century?

59
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,320
And this is a question as I think I
said last week with any great empire,

60
00:04:29,871 --> 00:04:33,590
it's easy to point to the flaws in,
uh,

61
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,440
a a complicated system.

62
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,850
Often size is one of them.
Often bureaucracy,

63
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:45,350
often overspending on the military.
But uh,

64
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,120
some of these go on for a very long time,
more or less successive successfully.

65
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,860
Despite the flaws in the Roman
empire went on longer than most.

66
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,030
As we said,

67
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,140
the immediate problems

68
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,800
that explode in the third century are
invasions and succession invasions.

69
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,730
By first of all,
Persia.

70
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,950
Persia is the old enemy of
the Roman Empire. Indeed,

71
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,540
as many of you know,
uh,

72
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,600
the old enemy of the Greek city states
that proceed the Roman empire as far back

73
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:32,110
as a, the first historian
of the western tradition.

74
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,170
Hurghada tests,
first week of directed studies.

75
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:38,860
For those of you who are
nostalgic for that experience,

76
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,540
Persia is the enemy.
Now,

77
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:45,400
we never study persh as kind
of like offstage all the time.

78
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,390
And that's the great benefit of the
Department of Near Eastern Languages and

79
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,250
cultures. Uh, um,

80
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:56,060
if you want to learn about Persia
really from within, instead of as,

81
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,260
oh my God, the, and you know,
oh my God, the Persians in, uh,

82
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,700
three 70 BC and it's going to be a,

83
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:05,660
it's going to come to an end.

84
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,070
It is going to come to an end
in the seventh century. Uh,

85
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,030
but that's because of
Islam just to anticipate.

86
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,490
But in the third century,
Persian, it becomes research.

87
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:18,560
And having been rather passive,

88
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:21,960
it has this frontier with the
Roman Empire in the east. Um,

89
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,820
more or less buffer states
are Mesopotamia present day,

90
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:27,680
Iraq and Armenia.

91
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,710
It was not exactly the same as
the present day state of Armenia,

92
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:32,840
but more like eastern Turkey.

93
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,120
The dynasty that the controls Persia
and that is more aggressive than its

94
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:44,700
predecessor are the assassinations.

95
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:52,430
And this appears in your
reading, the assassin had
dynasty, the rulers of Persia,

96
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,430
just more aggressive and more adventurous
beginning in two 24. Uh, they,

97
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,320
um,
uh,

98
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:05,350
start to probe that frontier along the
Armenian and Mesopotamian border and

99
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:11,231
eventually cross it and start to wreak
havoc in some of the eastern provinces of

100
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:12,260
the Roman Empire.

101
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:17,120
The climax of this is
the emperor of Valerian,

102
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:18,560
um,

103
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,560
was captured by the Persians into 60
Valerian actually one of the longer a

104
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,590
reigning emperors of this chaotic
period. Two 53 to two 60. Um,

105
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,700
they kept him for a little while,
displayed him in chains,

106
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,940
maybe flayed him. Anyway, he
died in captivity and they, they,

107
00:07:39,941 --> 00:07:43,910
they did a kind of a job on him.
I think he may be.

108
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:47,510
He was flayed after he died, just
to be, just not to be too gruesome,

109
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:51,890
but I think they displayed the skin. Uh,
as I said, I'm not a Persian specialist,

110
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:53,630
but, um, uh,

111
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,670
the second invasion is across the Danube,

112
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,650
Ryan frontier,
the Danube,

113
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,270
the Rhine form what the Romans thought
of as a natural frontier with the

114
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:09,620
barbarian states. That didn't mean
that they didn't cross them. In fact,

115
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,120
uh, many of their great, uh, uh, uh,

116
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,320
fortresses and establishment,
we're on the eastern side of the Rhine,

117
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:23,150
but they considered those as bulwarks
against a Germanic invasion across the

118
00:08:23,151 --> 00:08:23,840
Rhine.

119
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,840
The Rhine and the Danube almost meet the
Ryan going from modern Netherlands down

120
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:32,630
to Switzerland.

121
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,240
And the Danube going also from Germany,
eventually Austria,

122
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:41,750
Hungary into the Black
Sea. Um, as we'll see,

123
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:46,730
Charlemagne in the early ninth century
tried to build a canal between the two of

124
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:46,941
them.

125
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:51,941
And there are actually traces of this
immense and completely unsuccessful

126
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,350
project and there now
is a canal between them.

127
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,290
So this is sort of the
frontier of the Roman Empire.

128
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:02,220
And this is the line above which
no wine grapes are grown, uh,

129
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:07,050
know olive oil is a pressed and,
uh, it's gotta be protected,

130
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,390
but, um, not worth conquering.

131
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,460
So we have pressure on the Rhine,
Danube frontiers in the third century,

132
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:19,790
and another emperor dcs
died fighting the goths in,

133
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,110
uh,

134
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:27,110
two 51 dcs and Valerian dyes into 60.

135
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:32,010
So the emperors are certainly
out there as leaders. Uh,

136
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,050
but that actually has to do with
the fact that their military guys,

137
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:38,970
and that is part of the problem.

138
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,920
The major problem besides
the invasions was succession.

139
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,150
There were, I mean, it depends
on how you count, you know,

140
00:09:50,151 --> 00:09:53,660
is is someone a real emperor
or is he merely a pretender?

141
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:58,661
There are at least 30 emperors
between two 35 and two 85.

142
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:04,190
Many of them ruling four months.
Most of them being killed.

143
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:10,230
There were assassinated by the Praetorian
guard that is by their own, uh,

144
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,070
uh, troops. Uh,

145
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,540
they're killed in battle against
foreign enemies like dcs and Valerian.

146
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,740
They're killed in battle against
other people claiming to be emperors.

147
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,360
But the most common thing is they're
assassinated by their own troops.

148
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,590
How had Roman emperor
succeeded each other.

149
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:41,290
There were several ways. One is what
you would expect and that is dynastic,

150
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,770
but that's not all that common dynastic,
in other words,

151
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:50,130
families rule and the
family has recognized as a
ruling family and therefore,

152
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,730
um, uh, they, uh, uh,

153
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,290
echoes from father to son or if
there's no sun father to person,

154
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,680
daughter marries or father to nephew,
something like that.

155
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,540
But that was not actually so common.
Um,

156
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,120
sometimes, uh, the um, uh,

157
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:16,450
the next emperor was
chosen by his predecessor.

158
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,890
This is characteristic of the century,
second century ID,

159
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,550
the era of the so called good emperors.
In theory,

160
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:28,210
this is a great system.
You have no family prejudice.

161
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,000
You simply as a good emperor pic,

162
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:35,290
someone who looks to you like
he's going to be a good emperor.

163
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:36,930
Yeah.

164
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,120
So that is another possibility.

165
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,623
Um,

166
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:48,690
another possibility is some guy is
powerful and uses his troops to take over.

167
00:11:50,411 --> 00:11:52,270
And that's what we see
in the third century.

168
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,400
We see only the militarization
of the empire, but the,

169
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,293
uh,

170
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:03,540
interference of the army in
succeed in raising a successors,

171
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,690
in raising a new emperors.

172
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:14,070
The army was able to make and unmake
emperors just as in some countries with

173
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,230
unstable political structures,

174
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,310
the military is able to
make and unmake rulers.

175
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:25,810
What is interesting about the third
century is that they're able to do it far

176
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:28,930
from Rome.
Some of these armies are in North Africa,

177
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,020
some of them are on the
frontier fighting the Persians.

178
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,440
Rome is becoming less and less relevant
as the dominant city of the empire.

179
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,580
And I mentioned that now
because we'll see on Wednesday,

180
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,930
the result of this is will be the
establishment of another capital,

181
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:52,080
a second capitol in the east in
what would be called Constantinople.

182
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,800
Modern Istanbul.

183
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,810
Rome is four to five for the first time.

184
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:02,800
There is a wall that you can still
see in many parts of Rome built by the

185
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:06,400
emperor or religion in two 71.

186
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:13,510
And this is a significant thing because
until [inaudible] 71, four centuries,

187
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:16,570
Rome had not been walled
because it was not threatened.

188
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,920
Fortification of two 71 starts to
indicate things to come or at least things

189
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:28,720
that we know are to come.
Namely Barbarian Invasions.

190
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:33,760
Just as the
marginalization of Rome,

191
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,010
uh,
begins at this time.

192
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,980
Rome in the third century is ruled,

193
00:13:41,981 --> 00:13:45,790
if one can call it that by
a succession of generals,

194
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,150
not members of an upper class elite,

195
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,600
but men who have come from the provinces,

196
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,690
men who are not
particularly well educated,

197
00:13:55,691 --> 00:14:00,430
who would have trouble recognizing
a tag, uh, from Horace.

198
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:05,200
Uh, there being no internet
just to look these quotes up.

199
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:10,450
Um, they hold the traditional
Roman elite in contempt.

200
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:15,310
The Senate of Rome is the
embodiment of that elite.

201
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,520
The Roman Senate is a collection of
extremely wealthy people with from good

202
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:24,040
families,

203
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,240
extensive property and very,

204
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:29,650
very fine education.

205
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:35,700
The people leading in the third century
now our generals raised by their troops.

206
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:41,080
One of the reasons that the troops both
raised up generals and then killed them

207
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,070
was that they tend to, to get a
kind of reward from the new emperor.

208
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:50,230
A thing called a donative donative is
money that you get when there's a new

209
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:51,064
emperor,

210
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:57,080
a bad idea from the point of view of
the emperor's because it encourages, um,

211
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,610
you know, double dipping or
triple dipping, you know, okay,

212
00:15:01,611 --> 00:15:03,110
now we've gotten our money from this guy,

213
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,450
let's kill him and get
money from another guy.

214
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:09,410
That's don't think that's too cynical to
say that that is some of what is going

215
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:13,580
on now of all the crises
of the third century.

216
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:16,700
This is the one that leaves
the most visible impression.

217
00:15:16,701 --> 00:15:21,170
There's absolutely no doubt that there
are all of these different emperors and

218
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,660
that the top of the
government is unstable.

219
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,840
The question is how much does that carry
over into the lives of ordinary people?

220
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:35,770
One measure of the effectiveness of a
civilization is that it survives and even

221
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:41,540
people don't comment very
much on political instability.

222
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,650
Uh, in a way, uh,

223
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:49,250
we are testing that now for many people.

224
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:52,010
The fact that the government is polarized,

225
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:55,070
it doesn't really matter in
terms of their everyday life.

226
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,430
How long can that go on?

227
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,290
That's partly because all courts
sorts of institutions, uh,

228
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,980
are functioning perfectly fine. Here
we are, we're meeting, you know,

229
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:08,320
there's a,

230
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:13,120
there's no a problem of the
supply of water suddenly or, um,

231
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,390
uh, you know, scarce
provisioning or, uh, you know,

232
00:16:17,391 --> 00:16:22,391
barbarians mast outside and we'd have
to sort of protect against during our

233
00:16:22,551 --> 00:16:26,260
class. It hasn't come to that, uh, uh,

234
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,810
yet. Uh, but, um,

235
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,170
if you look at the lives of ordinary
people in the third century,

236
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:38,120
they are not saying,
uh, not another emperor.

237
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:39,590
I can't take it anymore.

238
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,220
They're just the philosopher
Plotinus for example,

239
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:46,400
one of the great intellectual
figures of this time. Now it's true.

240
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,430
He has a very other worldly
way of thinking about things.

241
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:54,431
He is a follower of Plato is the leading
so called neoplatonist philosopher

242
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,250
flourishes during the third
century, travels a bit. Uh,

243
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,920
but we never hear of any difficulty,

244
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,450
any kind of problems raised
by these unstable conditions.

245
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:10,930
The one that might have affected more
people than the instability is inflation.

246
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,920
Roman coinage was silver and bronze.

247
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,340
And based on ratios of
these metals to gold,

248
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:24,470
ultimate standard of value was gold,

249
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,630
but bronze and silver had attributed
values in relation to gold.

250
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:35,890
Been need to reward the army with those
donative and the dislocations of the

251
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:40,490
invasions led to tremendous
government expenditures.

252
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,800
And this was a society that
did not have debt financing.

253
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,700
There are no bonds, there are
no ways of the government, uh,

254
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,810
anticipating future revenues and
borrowing money against them.

255
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,450
That is actually an invention of the
middle ages was an example of something

256
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:05,451
that the Romans didn't have that
medieval cities in Italy pioneered debt

257
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:06,894
financing.

258
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,700
I don't have to tell you what that is
and it's a great advantage up to a point,

259
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:13,830
great up advantage because
it gives you leverage,

260
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,220
allows you to do things now.

261
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,570
So,
um,

262
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,940
how does a government deal with problems
like this? If it can't borrow money,

263
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,300
it does what is called debasing.
The coin it

264
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,020
okay

265
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:38,020
to debase that is degrade the coin and
means that you just don't put in as much

266
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,510
silver or bronze,

267
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,360
let alone cold and try to get
people to accept it for its value.

268
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:52,360
Anyway.
So up until the 1970s,

269
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:57,370
the American currency was based on gold
and dollar bills were called silver

270
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:58,311
certificates.

271
00:18:58,311 --> 00:19:03,311
They said that you could hand this
bill in for a dollar's worth of silver.

272
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,980
It was technically speaking,
not currency.

273
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:15,460
It was merely a representative of
currency which you could trade in.

274
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,090
And before that,

275
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:22,091
of course the coins were metal dollars
were both silver and paper with the

276
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:27,560
silver one being in some
sense the more real, um,

277
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:32,120
it is in the nature of modern government
financing that at some point the

278
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:33,770
government could just say forget about it.

279
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:37,440
And even long before the 19 seven days,
uh,

280
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:42,450
of course the government
didn't have enough silver
for everyone to trade them in

281
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:48,490
just as it doesn't have enough gold in
Fort Knox to float the entire world's

282
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:52,910
currency. It has a law and
that's important, you know,

283
00:19:52,911 --> 00:19:57,911
that there'd be some real kind
of value or bullion or you know,

284
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,480
bottom line kind of gold
bars. But, uh, uh, uh,

285
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:07,430
the fact that it's not enough
is not intrinsically a problem.

286
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,980
But here the government say the government
receives a thousand receives in the

287
00:20:12,981 --> 00:20:17,090
form of taxes. And stuff.
Uh, a thousand gold units,

288
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,860
uh,
and it issues 2000 units using that gold.

289
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,990
The coins say they're worth a,
a unit,

290
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:31,250
but they're actually in terms of
precious metal value worth a half.

291
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:35,000
So it pays its expenses
that way it pays the army,

292
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,190
it gets people to accept this money.

293
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:41,840
But when those people
go to buy stuff or uh,

294
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,910
they are going to find
that the stuff is 50% more

295
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,270
because their coins are
not actually very good.

296
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:57,670
But governments tend to do this gradually
hoping that people don't notice in the

297
00:20:57,671 --> 00:21:01,840
first place or that if
the inflation is say 10%,

298
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:06,610
it's not so bad. But once having embarked
on the debasement of the coinage,

299
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:11,290
this tends to get out of control because
of the famous Gresham's law in 18th

300
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:14,530
century economist that
bad money drives out good.

301
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,520
If I have good a sister ses or Roman
currency with the full measure of silver

302
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:29,611
that they say they have one full unit and
I've got other coins that say one full

303
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:32,830
unit but only have half,

304
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:38,130
I'm going to try to get rid of the bad
ones and horde the good ones and only

305
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:43,420
spend the good ones if I absolutely
have to or demand a premium on them.

306
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,840
So therefore there are all these crappy
coins circulating like mad and the good

307
00:21:50,471 --> 00:21:54,070
ones a retreat into people's,
uh,

308
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,320
well they don't really have
mattresses then, but you know,

309
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:01,380
into their store boxes or under their
beds creating in itself more and more

310
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:02,914
inflation.

311
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,260
So you have a fierce and
flesh and prices go up.

312
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:12,100
People don't know the value of
things. They start bartering. Uh,

313
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,230
and the Roman economy is very,

314
00:22:14,231 --> 00:22:17,380
very adversely effected as
hyperinflation tends to.

315
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,100
And um,
uh,

316
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,200
a final problem is the
ruin of the local elite,

317
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:30,190
um,
partly because of this economic chaos,

318
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:34,870
but partly from deeper causes.
The importance of,

319
00:22:34,871 --> 00:22:39,400
this is something that I alluded to last
time in that is that the emperor empire

320
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:42,340
could not be held together
really by the government.

321
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,950
However big the government was,

322
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,840
it required the cooperation of wealthy
people with ties to their native city.

323
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:57,190
It was these people who sponsored games,
civic improvements,

324
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:02,550
maintain the temples and
kept a kind of local order.

325
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:08,560
The third century crisis
undermines this elite.

326
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,090
This elite is undermined by
the militarization of society.

327
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:20,790
They are to some extent ruined by
taxation and increased taxation.

328
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:24,160
They're just powerful
enough to be well off,

329
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:28,180
but not powerful enough to evade taxation.

330
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:34,860
But they also tend to be undermined
by an empire that's more cosmopolitan,

331
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,360
where local elites don't matter
as much. Where, for example,

332
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:44,860
military people who move around
a lot are more important.

333
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:50,590
And I emphasize this not only because of
these elites themselves and their role

334
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:54,110
in holding the empire together,

335
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:58,760
but we're going to talk about this when
we talk about Christianity because when

336
00:23:58,761 --> 00:24:00,620
the local elites are ruined,

337
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:05,680
so his local religion and local
religion means polytheism.

338
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,930
If I am of a grand family of,
uh,

339
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,620
let's say the city of Sardis in Asia,
minor modern Turkey,

340
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:20,180
and I feel that my ancestors have always
been involved in the worship of the

341
00:24:20,181 --> 00:24:23,900
goddess Sibley,
and I am a voter re or you know,

342
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,450
officer or you know,

343
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:30,451
I come member of the governing board of
the club or society that runs the cult

344
00:24:32,811 --> 00:24:34,730
of Sibley.
I'm going to feel very local,

345
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,820
very loyal to that local deity.

346
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,640
But if I come from North Africa and I'm
in Sardis because that's where my army

347
00:24:43,641 --> 00:24:47,990
is a, I'm not going to care
about some local no more than,

348
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:53,030
uh, you know, you might
care about, um, uh,

349
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,310
you know,
a club that's important at Yale.

350
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:57,920
If you went to the University of Illinois,

351
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,150
no more important than you might feel,
uh,

352
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:06,260
about pizza in new
haven. If, uh, you know,

353
00:25:06,261 --> 00:25:08,780
you came from somewhere else and
didn't like the pizza. It's just,

354
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,290
it's just like this local cult and,
and you know,

355
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,270
you don't understand
it and you don't care.

356
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,020
So the kind of things you will care about,

357
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:23,750
we'll see religiously, but they will
tend to be religions that cross borders,

358
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,520
like Christianity,

359
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:30,550
religions that are not identified with
one place and one God in the sense of

360
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:35,780
local God, local temple. My people.

361
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,690
So into this mess Diocletian
you've got high cliche defeats.

362
00:25:41,691 --> 00:25:46,691
His predecessor Karina us in battle in
two 84 Diocletian as a general into 84 it

363
00:25:48,531 --> 00:25:50,870
would have seemed like more of the same,

364
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:56,110
but Diocletian rules until
three Oh five and he abdicates,

365
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,740
he passes the power to someone else.

366
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:05,780
He is, however, very typical of
the military class of the empire.

367
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:08,540
He came from nowhere socially.

368
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,890
He was the son of an
ex slave from Dalmatia,

369
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,630
modern coastal Croatia.

370
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,720
You can still see his palace in the
Croatian city of Split on the Adriatic.

371
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,100
His retirement palace,
actually

372
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:27,110
under his severe guidance,

373
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:32,170
the empire was reformed and the way it
was reformed was that it was ineffective.

374
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,100
Militarized Diocletian
was Donna, great general,

375
00:26:37,101 --> 00:26:42,101
but he was a brilliant manager and he
was a brilliant bureaucratic organizer.

376
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:48,780
I use the term bureaucracy,
not too mean inefficient,

377
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,410
useless administration,
but administration,

378
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,330
administration,

379
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:59,990
officers of the state who are capable
of doing their jobs or maybe not capable

380
00:27:00,061 --> 00:27:02,070
of doing their jobs,
but who are nevertheless,

381
00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:05,070
I'm not making a value judgment
with the term bureaucracy.

382
00:27:05,071 --> 00:27:10,020
I simply mean the proliferation of
government and government offices.

383
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,410
Diocletian is,
uh,

384
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:18,470
responsible for the militarization of
society that is building society around

385
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:21,570
the army in order to protect it.

386
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:26,930
And he is responsible for a more efficient
and ultimately burdened some form of

387
00:27:28,591 --> 00:27:33,150
taxation.
The two are linked because as we know,

388
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:38,750
you have to pay to have a
large and effective military.

389
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:46,390
Diocletian did not set out to be a
revolutionary. His aims were conservative.

390
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,660
He wanted to save,
preserve,

391
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:54,810
restore the Roman empire of the pre two 35

392
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:57,523
era.

393
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,840
His methods were radical.

394
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:06,560
He was willing to
undertake radical measures

395
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:11,010
and the debate among
historians now somewhat muted.

396
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,570
Many historians at one time felt that
he had basically destroyed the empire.

397
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,420
That by making it so bureaucratic,
so militarized,

398
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:21,950
so heavy handed in terms of government,
it no longer was the Roman empire.

399
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,810
It was something else.

400
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:26,860
Yeah.

401
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:31,860
The reason this is no longer exactly a
considered to be a big problem or a big

402
00:28:32,351 --> 00:28:35,020
controversy.
You'll see when we come to read Wickham,

403
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:39,190
the Empire has an impress on society.

404
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,010
There is what he calls
the burden of empire,

405
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:47,250
but it is at the same time
not a totalitarian empire
that controls everything.

406
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:53,170
Uh, society has an identity that's
different from the government.

407
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,590
Yeah.

408
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:59,550
So he has three goals.
One,

409
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,720
solving this problem of the imperial
succession to stabilizing the economy.

410
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,020
Three,
protecting the frontiers

411
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:15,180
of these three is actually only
really successful in the third,

412
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:16,500
protecting the frontiers.

413
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:22,020
He devises a system that we're going to
talk about in a moment of succession,

414
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,840
but it does not really
outlast him very long.

415
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:30,510
The economy does get fixed,
but not the way,

416
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,970
not exactly because of his policies.

417
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:40,130
What he's really successful at and
what changes most dramatically is what

418
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:41,830
rulership means.

419
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,760
That includes the figure of the emperor
who becomes more sacred and more

420
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,200
powerful in terms of imagery
as well as administration

421
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:58,990
changes in the administration
of taxes in particular,

422
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:04,170
and then that a goal of his to
change and grow the military.

423
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:12,180
The size of the army grew probably doubled
maybe just as a ballpark figure from

424
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:18,130
200,000 troops to 400,000 troops.

425
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,480
This is a major,

426
00:30:22,481 --> 00:30:27,481
major increase that had to be paid for
and it had to be paid for by taxation and

427
00:30:30,131 --> 00:30:34,570
from a population not particularly
eager to volunteer to pay more.

428
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:39,220
Ultimately it looks as if Diocletian
didn't so much increased taxation as

429
00:30:39,221 --> 00:30:41,290
increased the efficiency
of its collection.

430
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,520
In order to increase the
efficiency of his collection,

431
00:30:45,521 --> 00:30:50,440
he had to increase the bureaucracy
charged with monitoring the taxes and that

432
00:30:50,441 --> 00:30:55,441
means first making an
inventory of taxable resources.

433
00:30:55,810 --> 00:31:00,670
There is no income tax in this society
because it's an economy based more on

434
00:31:00,671 --> 00:31:02,890
land than on salaries,

435
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,970
so you have an income tax is easy

436
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:12,130
because you can keep records
of what people are earning.

437
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:18,300
The government to this day finds it much
easier to take a portion of your wages

438
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:23,320
because it knows from your
company what you're being paid.

439
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:28,030
If you're being paid in some
other form like you're a waiter

440
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:35,050
and a lot of your money is in tips,
that's harder for the government.

441
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:40,510
If your wealth is in property,

442
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,570
it's hard to put a value on that.
You own estates.

443
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,720
You have people who are free tenants who
rent land from you and pay you in money

444
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:58,490
or produce or labor. You
have some slaves. Uh,

445
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:01,960
you have a, uh, watermill um,

446
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,590
how do you pay taxes on all of this stuff?

447
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:08,110
The opportunities for evasion are greater.

448
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:12,670
So the first bureaucratic task was just
to have a lot of people who could value

449
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,530
things, who could come into
a territory and say, okay,

450
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:21,280
this farm is worth so much
and it has these many people.

451
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:27,750
They develop a system to evaluate
productive units of things like land and

452
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,820
population and to tax them
according to a formula.

453
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:38,860
So I have a lot of land,
but it's not very good land.

454
00:32:38,861 --> 00:32:41,540
I have a lot of people
making a living off it.

455
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,920
I will be taxed at a lower rate than
someone who has maybe half that land,

456
00:32:45,921 --> 00:32:50,540
but twice the people better soil,
uh, um, more clearance of forests,

457
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:54,320
whatever the reason
it changes.

458
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:00,040
So every 15 years the government
changes its estimation.

459
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:10,080
A second means once you have this
taxation system in place of bringing the

460
00:33:11,171 --> 00:33:16,171
empire together and dominating it more
is to have the army really have a first

461
00:33:19,001 --> 00:33:21,010
call on the resources of the state.

462
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,840
We now start to have a state
supply system for the army alone.

463
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:31,720
This allows the state to avoid
dealing with that debased currency.

464
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:32,890
So for example,

465
00:33:32,891 --> 00:33:37,720
the state just goes in and takes wind
and gives it to the army without taking

466
00:33:37,721 --> 00:33:40,720
money, buying weed,
giving that to the army.

467
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:48,510
Diocletian binds the empire together
also very effectively by a postal system

468
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:53,080
post in this case, meaning a
a system of riders, horses,

469
00:33:53,081 --> 00:33:58,081
communications that allows the emperor
to go faster than anyone else to have

470
00:33:58,211 --> 00:34:02,290
news quicker than anyone else to
send orders quicker than anyone else.

471
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:11,040
And also more punishment
for things like tax evasion.

472
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:17,190
It's not just that people get killed for
not paying their taxes or imprisoned or

473
00:34:17,441 --> 00:34:20,530
tortured,
but the groups are responsible.

474
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:24,610
It's not only that, if I don't
pay my taxes, I get punished,

475
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:29,320
but if you and I live in the same
village and you don't pay your taxes,

476
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:34,510
I get punished. Or at the very least
taxed for the part that you have aided.

477
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:39,523
Yeah,

478
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:44,350
but the most important change in
government is the establishment of what's

479
00:34:44,351 --> 00:34:45,490
called the tetrarchy.

480
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:50,780
Yeah.

481
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:55,770
The tetrarchy is the
rule of four four rulers.

482
00:34:55,790 --> 00:35:00,790
Diocletian divides the
empire first into East West,

483
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:06,010
a very significant move that will have
consequences for the next 1200 years.

484
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,590
He then

485
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,060
appoints a co emperor

486
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:20,570
to roll in the West
while he rolls in the east.

487
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,463
Okay.

488
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:29,680
Mh. Mh appoint a helper
number three and number four,

489
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,750
the emperors,
the two emperors are called Aqua sty.

490
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,480
Emperors and the helpers are Caesars.

491
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:44,820
So their subordinates to
their respective August time

492
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:53,130
and they're supposed to help them.
Why this system?

493
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:57,840
This is really to overcome the
problems of size, communication,

494
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,190
administration.

495
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:04,670
It's a statement that the empire
is too big for one man to rule.

496
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,213
Okay.

497
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:17,270
But the chief emperors are also exalted.

498
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:18,234
Now.

499
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:23,660
There is no longer a pretense that
they're just first citizens or princes.

500
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,020
They are clothed in purple.
They are,

501
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:32,370
don't move a lot in public audiences.

502
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:36,840
And we're familiar with this kind of
dichotomy between the political figure as

503
00:36:36,841 --> 00:36:39,450
distant authority versus
the political figure,

504
00:36:39,451 --> 00:36:43,710
at least pretending to be just like you
and me. We're in the era of the latter,

505
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:49,250
but Diocletian Yannick period ushers
in a period when the emperor is distant

506
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,760
glimpsed product of ceremonies
wearing a lot of very funny looking,

507
00:36:56,250 --> 00:37:01,030
but fancy clothes,
he doesn't appear a lot in public.

508
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:05,050
He's a god.
Uh,

509
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:10,300
you don't go up to him and shake hands
or say hi or you throw yourself at his

510
00:37:13,761 --> 00:37:17,000
feet and don't look at
him until he tells you to.

511
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,850
So the tetrarchy great idea.

512
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,420
It really doesn't work
because first of all,

513
00:37:26,421 --> 00:37:29,360
the emperors don't necessarily cooperate.

514
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:33,380
The seizures don't necessarily
cooperate with the emperors. Uh,

515
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,910
and um,

516
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:41,000
so in two 85 Diocletian nominates a,
um,

517
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,320
a uh,

518
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,520
Cesar and then makes them
into 86 a co Augustus.

519
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,420
And this man is named Max Simeon.

520
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,070
Okay.

521
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:04,690
In two 93 Diocletian and
Maximilian appoint to Caesar's.

522
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,890
I think I'm not going to burden
you with, uh, the personnel.

523
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,150
I will hand out something,
um,

524
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:15,220
on Wednesday that that gives
you some of this information.

525
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,330
Diocletian and Maximilian appoint
Gillary areas in the east,

526
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:22,150
in Constantia constantness in the west.
You don't have to remember who these are.

527
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:26,260
And each of them marries a daughter
of their respective Augusta.

528
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,940
This looks like a great system.

529
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:29,490
Okay.

530
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:33,000
In three Oh five,
Diocletian and Maximilian abdicate.

531
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:36,700
And then these two people become August,
died to Caesars,

532
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,880
rise up to be August time and they
appoint their own new Caesar's.

533
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:49,150
It breaks down beginning in three of six,
one of the sons of one of these,

534
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,510
Augusta is not appointed
and he's mad and he revolts.

535
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:57,950
And then the, um, August
I'd dunk get along, uh,

536
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:00,880
out of this chaos between
three Oh six and three,

537
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:05,881
12 emerges one emperor
and that is constant team.

538
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:10,840
And we'll be talking about
Constantine, uh, on Wednesday.

539
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,460
So the tetrarchy fails.

540
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:21,630
Diocletian's second big initiative was
over this question of the economy and

541
00:39:25,331 --> 00:39:26,920
ways of combating inflation.

542
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,180
Diocletian issued a so
called edict on prices.

543
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:37,470
The edict on prices attempted
to set a fixed price for goods.

544
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:44,530
And if you sold them for more than that,
you were to be severely punished.

545
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:50,640
This is the kind of the classic example
of the state trying to combat inflation

546
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,390
by dictating prices.

547
00:39:55,510 --> 00:40:00,510
Most of you are not familiar
with inflation but it is
because we have lived in

548
00:40:01,571 --> 00:40:06,571
an era of very low interest
and a fairly stable prices,

549
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:11,740
but if you think of those commodities
who's inflation you are familiar with like

550
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:15,010
petroleum,
it is very dislocating.

551
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:20,380
It starts to create panics and the
panics then feed into the inflation.

552
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:25,150
Just as if people keep on getting gas
because they think that it's going to go

553
00:40:25,151 --> 00:40:26,020
up in price.

554
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:30,310
Then there's a greater demand for
gasoline and it goes up further in price

555
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:34,360
eventually.
If the thing is really just speculative,

556
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,860
it deflates again and that's what's
happened with products that we're familiar

557
00:40:38,861 --> 00:40:40,030
with in recent times,

558
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,900
but there is also a kind
of structural long term,

559
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:47,140
longer term inflation such as
America experience. For example,

560
00:40:47,141 --> 00:40:52,141
in the 70s and in theory if you have
resource crises and things that are

561
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:58,260
becoming scarcer than you ought to have
more and more experience with inflation.

562
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:05,620
The government in the 1970s in the United
States tried also to have an edict on

563
00:41:05,621 --> 00:41:10,420
prices. Uh, under President
Ford, there was a, uh, kind of,

564
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:13,810
uh, uh, administration of maximum prices.

565
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:19,090
The problem with this is that it
creates a temptation for black markets.

566
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:22,870
Creates a version of what we were just
talking about with Gresham's law of

567
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,793
coinage.

568
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,820
If you say that tomatoes can only be
sold for a dollar a pound than those

569
00:41:31,571 --> 00:41:35,000
tomatoes that are being sold for a
dollar a pound in a climate of severe

570
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:39,110
inflation will be terrible,
will be rotten.

571
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,100
If you want to pay $2 a pound in secret,

572
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:47,870
we have some nice tomatoes for you.
And if you want to pay $5 a pound,

573
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:52,670
we have some really nice, you
know, uh, uh, locally grown, um,

574
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:56,030
uh, tomatoes for you, all
of which may be illegal,

575
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:59,060
but the legal market is empty.

576
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,940
And this is what happened in a response
to the edict of Pri with of prices.

577
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:08,450
This doesn't mean that the government
cannot still remains debatable,

578
00:42:08,451 --> 00:42:13,451
obviously the degree to which government
can or cannot intervene in such things.

579
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,910
But certainly in the case of
the Roman Empire, this failed.

580
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:22,600
What did bring back a measure of
economic stability is the reform of the

581
00:42:25,851 --> 00:42:26,540
taxation.

582
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:31,540
The fact that the state simply started
getting in more resources that les was

583
00:42:32,931 --> 00:42:35,690
being withheld by private people.

584
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:41,260
And so the state could actually pay for
its administrative and military costs.

585
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,150
Diocletian succeeded in
abdicating, peacefully spent, uh,

586
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:56,420
his retirement in split in his palace
and live to see the breakdown or the

587
00:42:59,161 --> 00:43:02,550
partial breakdown of the tetrarchy.
And in certain respects,

588
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,400
his policies clearly failed.

589
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:11,220
The edict on prices had to be
abandoned. The tetrarchy, uh,

590
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:12,210
did not work.

591
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:14,590
Okay.

592
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:18,460
And Diocletian failed in trying
to suppress Christianity.

593
00:43:18,461 --> 00:43:22,420
We'll talk about this some more, but
Diocletian in the late part of his reign,

594
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:28,000
you know, a couple of animals were split
open to see what the future would be.

595
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:33,400
Um, right. Isn't that what
we all do? Uh, uh, uh,

596
00:43:33,401 --> 00:43:36,340
you know, if you want to figure out
kind of what's going to happen, you,

597
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,240
you slaughter an animal, an animal,
and, and, and check out. It's liver.

598
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,370
Maybe it's kidneys and spleen too,

599
00:43:42,371 --> 00:43:45,760
but the liver is really which
you want to look at. And um,

600
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:49,270
I don't exactly know what the animal was,

601
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:54,370
what the organs were and why
they didn't splay out. Right.

602
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,110
But the liver told Diocletian that the
Christians were responsible for this and

603
00:43:59,111 --> 00:44:00,430
that he'd better go after them.

604
00:44:00,431 --> 00:44:04,420
So there is this big persecution of
Christians in the first part of the fourth

605
00:44:04,421 --> 00:44:09,100
century. Um, and uh, he
certainly didn't succeed in that.

606
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:12,610
Not only did the Christians not crumble,

607
00:44:12,611 --> 00:44:17,110
but of course Diocletian's most effective
successor six years after he abdicated

608
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:19,150
would convert to Christianity.

609
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:26,270
But Diocletian is extremely
important and in many respects,

610
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,490
extremely successful.

611
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:34,500
He did more than prop
up a tottering empire.

612
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:37,820
Okay.

613
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:42,820
He did more than just transform a
tottering empire into a kind of tottering

614
00:44:42,951 --> 00:44:47,180
tyranny.
He saved the Roman Empire.

615
00:44:47,181 --> 00:44:49,580
He saved the Roman Empire
for a hundred years.

616
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:54,470
When you take a course like this
that goes for 700, 800 years,

617
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:58,890
you start to hurl centuries around,
uh, and get confused above them.

618
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:04,150
But any polity that exists for a hundred
years is fairly impressive or a policy

619
00:45:05,631 --> 00:45:10,430
that looks like it's about to collapse
and then is restored for a hundred years.

620
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:11,860
Okay.

621
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,620
The Roman Empire,
conventionally speaking,

622
00:45:14,621 --> 00:45:17,950
is thought to have collapsed in
the West in the late fifth century

623
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:21,680
in the east.
However,

624
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:26,740
arguably Diocletian's reforms last
for more on the order of 1200 years.

625
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,690
The eastern empire,

626
00:45:29,691 --> 00:45:34,691
the Byzantine Empire would fall in 1453
and two its last day it was modeled on

627
00:45:39,591 --> 00:45:43,550
Diocletian panic,
administrative and military forms.

628
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:53,850
People at the time clearly thought
that they'd been saved from disaster.

629
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:57,670
If you look at fourth century artifacts,

630
00:45:57,671 --> 00:46:00,520
things like mosaics on the
floors of dining rooms,

631
00:46:00,521 --> 00:46:05,170
people often put mottos there and their
mottoes or things like joyful times

632
00:46:05,171 --> 00:46:08,710
everywhere or a world restored.

633
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:15,700
The fourth century is interpretable as
an era of increasing gloom because we

634
00:46:19,131 --> 00:46:22,250
know that in the fifth century
things are going to collapse,

635
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:26,090
but people in the fourth century
are not saying to each other,

636
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,450
I'm so glad I'm alive in the fourth
century cause I don't want to see what's

637
00:46:29,451 --> 00:46:31,040
going to happen in the fifth.

638
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:36,380
They're just happy that the barbarians
are back across the Danube and the Rhine.

639
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:41,090
The Persians are more or less
controlled along the frontier.

640
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,760
Yes, taxes are high. Yes,

641
00:46:43,761 --> 00:46:48,530
the elite is sort of a riff raff and
not as well educated and their military

642
00:46:48,531 --> 00:46:52,820
people.
Basically things are working.

643
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,650
Prosperity is restored to the people
who had been prosperous before.

644
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:00,460
You know, the local elites
have declined, but uh,

645
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:05,210
it's not so visible as it had been.
But there are some changes.

646
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:08,450
Changes that we can with the
proverbial benefit of hindsight.

647
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:10,850
See changes in the center of gravity.

648
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:16,040
The dominant places are now
places that are military basis.

649
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:20,570
They are great cities with
all the amenities of Rome.

650
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:23,720
That is stadiums,
gateways.

651
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:28,370
One of the best preserved of these
to this day is trickier in Germany.

652
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,740
On the Moselle.

653
00:47:32,741 --> 00:47:37,741
Behind the Rhine has a wonderful
collection of Roman ruins,

654
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:44,170
a gateway. The port and I grew up, uh, uh,

655
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,990
eight um,
theater,

656
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,340
a sports arena,
a basilica,

657
00:47:51,341 --> 00:47:53,410
a law court turned into a church.

658
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,880
The reason or was great was
because of the frontier.

659
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:01,660
There was one of the most important cities
in the empire because of the military,

660
00:48:01,661 --> 00:48:05,380
because its strategic importance. And
there are other cities that are like this.

661
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:06,790
Milan,
for example,

662
00:48:06,791 --> 00:48:11,020
becomes more important than Rome
because Milan is further north.

663
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:15,460
It's a good place to get to the
Daniel van to the Rhine quickly,

664
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:18,700
whereas Rome is buried
in the Mediterranean.

665
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:23,680
So we're in a new world.

666
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:27,790
We'll discuss more of the new world on
Wednesday and we will see the Constantine

667
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:31,180
in some cases,
completely revolutionizes things,

668
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:35,320
and in other cases
continues Diocletian's work.
