1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:06,140
So we had talked about the mathematical
researches of the Arabs combining

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,590
Persian Greek and Indian mathematics and
of course with contributions of their

3
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:17,460
own so that the, um, enumeration,

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,490
the use of zero are from
India. But the, uh, the, uh,

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,450
development of Algebra is a unique
contribution of this period and of these

6
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,270
people, oh, let's talk
briefly about geography.

7
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,090
Remember the chapter in Wickham opens
with the contemptuous description of

8
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:40,980
Palermo by the 10th century
geographer. Uh, it had been how call,

9
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,820
uh,
uh Ha Wqa al right.

10
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,880
And the point of that,
you know,

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,600
is not Palermo or anything like that,

12
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:59,601
but just the fascination that
the Muslim world had for travel,

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,720
for geography,
a geography,

14
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:07,230
both of a quantitative
kind measuring navigation,

15
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,380
figuring out how to get from place to
place and have a kind of curiosities of

16
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:17,610
the world, kind of, uh, different customs,

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,440
different peoples,
different products. So, uh,

18
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:27,150
these geographers were employed
by the Caliphs for example,

19
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:30,870
to figure out the
circumference of the world, uh,

20
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,550
to figure out the relationship
between land and water in the world.

21
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,530
This is a, uh, an interesting
form of speculation. Uh,

22
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,270
if you look at Christian maps
of the world up to 1300 or so,

23
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,630
they show almost no ocean.

24
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,630
It's all huge amounts of landmass.
Um,

25
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,900
this is partly,
it's thought,

26
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:58,430
an interpretation of something in,
um,

27
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,490
one of the apocryphal books of the
Bible that seems to suggest that seven

28
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:06,360
eighths of the world is land. Um, Ptolemy,

29
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,450
whom we spoke about last time.
The Greek geographer,

30
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:13,610
author of this book known as
the Auma guest or geography, uh,

31
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,110
translated into Arabic,

32
00:02:15,111 --> 00:02:18,560
has one of the first projects of
this house of wisdom and Baghdad, uh,

33
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:23,570
Ptolemy has a different
picture and Telemis the first
geographer received in the

34
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:29,031
medieval period to suggest that there's
an awful lot of water and that you can

35
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:33,510
get around much of the world by water.
Although crucially,

36
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,720
Ptolemy does not think that you can go
around Africa totally has it kind of

37
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,970
Antarctic landmass that
connects with Africa.

38
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,890
And it was only the Portuguese
at the end of the 15th century,

39
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,980
specifically in 1498, well,
really 1489, uh, who, uh,

40
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,160
demonstrated that you could go around
Africa and thus from the Atlantic Ocean

41
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:59,470
into the Indian Ocean. It
crucial, crucial discovery.

42
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,850
But this question of how much water is
there versus how much land is there a

43
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,940
sense of the entire world,
uh,

44
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,790
is a problem investigated
by these geographers.

45
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,740
Uh, many of these guys are
indefatigable travelers. So, uh,

46
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,810
um, there's, uh, this book, uh,

47
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,930
by a Mocha Darcy [inaudible] Q

48
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,443
and

49
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,420
a usually known in English as the best
division for knowledge of the regions,

50
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,060
completed a nine 85 after
20 years of traveling.

51
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,710
But the greatest traveler of the Islamic
premodern world was even cal doin

52
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,183
okay,

53
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,830
who is much later,
but worth at least mentioning here.

54
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:54,880
1332 to 1406.

55
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:59,881
And he started from his native Tunis and
traveled as far as China and Indonesia.

56
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,050
And then finally a scholar
named, I'll address, see

57
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,050
another one of these travelers.

58
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:18,910
Geographers was hired by the
Christian King of Sicily, Roger,

59
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:20,770
the second in 1138,

60
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:25,480
to put together a map of the world
with accompanying descriptive texts.

61
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,140
And it is, uh, an aspect,

62
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:34,170
both of the respect accorded to the
Arab geographers in the Christian world.

63
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,380
And the fact that despite our tendency
to see these two worlds as opposed after

64
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:44,890
all 1138 is the era of the Crusades.
Um,

65
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,710
there's quite a fair
amount of collaboration,

66
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,930
interchange of knowledge between the
Christian Kingdoms of Europe and the,

67
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,730
um, uh, Islamic world,
the Islamic Kingdoms of,

68
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,640
uh, the southern Mediterranean
and the Middle East. Finally, uh,

69
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,050
medicine. I, you know, we're not,

70
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,280
we're not exhausting the
subject study by the Arabs,

71
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:10,420
but I wanted to give you math,
geography and medicine as three examples.

72
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,920
The main authority for the Arabs and
the person that they translated with the

73
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:19,660
most acid, UNT and interest
was Galan, g, a, l, e, n,

74
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,250
a,
um,

75
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,210
a physician who wrote in Greek
at the time of the Roman Empire.

76
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:30,630
And Galen is the person who is
responsible for the transmission,

77
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,220
if not invention of the notion
of the four bodily humors,

78
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:42,330
this model of physiology dominated
medicine until the 18th century.

79
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:46,444
Let's say.

80
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:51,510
This is the notion that
within human beings there are
these four fluids that are

81
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:56,350
essential building blocks
of character and of health.

82
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,920
They are both mental and physical,
um,

83
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,120
uh,
factors in health or an illness.

84
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,450
And they correspond both
to the four elements,

85
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,640
the four basic things out of which the
world is built according to Greek science

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,020
and to uh,
the interaction of uh,

87
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:23,350
the corresponding for
climates or four tendencies.

88
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:29,300
So the four elements, earth,
air, fire and water, right?

89
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,470
These climates or tendencies are hot,

90
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,050
dry, moist, hot, hot,

91
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:42,050
dry, moist, cold, right,
hot, cold, moist, dry.

92
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,980
And the four humors,

93
00:06:46,981 --> 00:06:51,981
these are liquids that are inside
our bodies are bile or yellow bile

94
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:58,710
which corresponds to fire,
which is hot and dry.

95
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,013
Blood

96
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:09,060
which corresponds to the element
of air and is hot and wet.

97
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,383
Phlegm,

98
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,760
mucus, P, h, l, e, g, m,

99
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,750
which corresponds to water
and it's cold and wet.

100
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,410
And finally,
Black Bile,

101
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:30,090
which is earth
and cold and dry.

102
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,880
Key to this idea of the humors is
the notion of balance or equilibrium.

103
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,870
And in this it resembles Chinese medicine.
Uh,

104
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:47,300
Indian are you a vedic
medicine? Uh, and indeed, uh,

105
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,280
uh,

106
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,280
at least conceptually notions that
people have of their own bodies,

107
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:55,020
that the,
uh,

108
00:07:55,021 --> 00:08:00,021
experience of illness or of mental
distress is one of imbalance of the

109
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:04,200
predominance of one element over another.

110
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,720
So the healthy bottle body
is in a state of equilibrium.

111
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:16,310
While disease is part of a
fluctuation due to imbalance,

112
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,450
but people are never completely balanced,
at least not for long.

113
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:25,230
Everybody has some what's
called temperament.

114
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,940
A temperament is a favoring
of one of these humors.

115
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:30,931
So,

116
00:08:30,931 --> 00:08:35,931
and we still use these terms without
particularly being interested in their

117
00:08:36,121 --> 00:08:40,890
origins. So melancholia or
the melancholic temperament,

118
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,900
which is associated with
sadness, lethargy, uh,

119
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:49,930
what would be medicalized now as
depression is from a predominance of black

120
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:54,380
bile, my land, Black Kohler,

121
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,390
bile and Greek Melancholia.

122
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:59,683
Okay.

123
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:04,460
Um, there's the Kolarik temperament.
People who tend to be angry,

124
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:08,240
irritable.
And this is from regular or yellow bile,

125
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,090
predominance of that,
or sanguine

126
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:16,800
sort of more optimistic, more
risk-taking, predominance of blood.

127
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,180
The sanguinary humor.

128
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,703
Yeah.

129
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:27,770
This is the basis of an awful lot
of medical theory of physiology,

130
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,220
of understanding of disease
and its treatment as well
as its prevention through

131
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:37,230
things like diet.

132
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:39,330
Okay.

133
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,170
There are lots and lots of, uh, uh,

134
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,670
medical writings and doctors
in the Islamic world.

135
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:49,220
The most famous is known in
the West, uh, as Abba's center.

136
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,470
Um,
it had been sinner,

137
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,300
a nine 82,
10 37.

138
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:05,301
He is a Persian active in Persia and he,

139
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,480
like many of these doctors
was not just a physician,

140
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,200
but a musicologist and a philosopher.

141
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:16,980
He wrote in medical
writings on physiology,

142
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,380
diagnosis, treatment, and uh,

143
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,420
medication.
Uh,

144
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:29,370
his work was translated into Latin
and known in the West as the Canon.

145
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,060
The Canon of Abba Seanna was a,
you know,

146
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:38,061
was the standard work taught in
medical schools until a 17th,

147
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:39,240
18th century.

148
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,010
Again, I wouldn't say that, um,

149
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:52,240
I would be desperate to be alive in the
11th century in order to have better

150
00:10:52,241 --> 00:10:57,190
medical care. Uh, you
know, there, there is no,

151
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:02,540
um, I mean the humors don't really
work. It's not scientifically true. Uh,

152
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,340
but uh,

153
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:08,340
but so what we're interested in worldviews
in aspects of how people look at

154
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:13,240
things. Uh, certainly many
aspects of this medical care,

155
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,660
we're superior to what
was available elsewhere.

156
00:11:16,661 --> 00:11:18,490
It was based on observation.

157
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:23,410
The observation obviously
couldn't be Mris or cat scans.

158
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:28,390
The observation however, was
much closer than that. Uh,

159
00:11:28,391 --> 00:11:31,210
even undertaken by the Greeks.
Um,

160
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:36,490
an awful lot of people of what might be
learned of disease was through urine.

161
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,080
And the urinary examination
of the urine is a,

162
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:45,500
almost so much the symbol of
being a doctor that in some, uh,

163
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:50,380
western illustrations of medicine know
that the person is a doctor cause he's

164
00:11:50,381 --> 00:11:54,790
holding up this little, this little
flask and, and examining its, uh,

165
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,450
its properties. So a, again,

166
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,370
you weren't supposed to kick in,

167
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,820
some societies cut up
bodies for autopsies. Um,

168
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,930
we all know things like the
circulation of the blood,

169
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,470
the role of a heart in that were
not properly understood, uh,

170
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:16,300
for many centuries later.
But this is the most elaborate,

171
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,040
uh,

172
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,970
and successful model of
medicine and practice of
medicine in the civilized world

173
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,260
at this time.
So this is a splendid civilization.

174
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:29,980
I hope I've given you some,
uh, slight indication of that.

175
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,930
Why does it collapse?

176
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,590
This is partly a question of why
does any civilization collapse? Um,

177
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,870
time tends to ruin everything.
Uh,

178
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,900
the MMM Abbasids were victims
of the same divisive tendencies.

179
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,840
We've already seen it work within the
Islamic world, right from the beginning.

180
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,730
Religious strife,

181
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,210
okay.

182
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:56,931
Particularly,

183
00:12:56,931 --> 00:13:01,931
but not exclusively the
Sunni Shiite division

184
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:07,370
dynastic that is to say
internal or familial problems,

185
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,730
resentment at taxation

186
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,470
in the beginning, as we
said, the Islamic conquerors,

187
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:22,200
a taxed rather lightly,
but as the,

188
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,940
uh, ability to rely on
confiscated estates of nobles,

189
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:28,230
the church and the state

190
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,260
faded as the opposites became the state.
Like all states,

191
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,980
they started to run out of money.
They had a large army,

192
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:42,600
they have a large court. They had a large
administrative structure to maintain.

193
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,590
And then as now people tend,
uh,

194
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,870
rightly or wrongly not to appreciate the
role of government in everything and to

195
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,120
be resentful of having to pay for it.

196
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,220
But the fundamental problem is we can
points out is that the empire was too big.

197
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,730
And here we're back where we
started with the Roman Empire. Um,

198
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:08,340
empires tend to fall because they
are too big and being too big.

199
00:14:08,341 --> 00:14:12,540
They tend to overreach. In other words,
they're already big and they try,

200
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,830
if not to get bigger,

201
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,730
at least to deal with more enemies.

202
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:22,140
Because as you get bigger, you develop
more enemies and as you get bigger,

203
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:26,310
you also develop more
fears of external enemies.

204
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:34,030
So to say that the empire was too
big is not to say anything very,

205
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,050
uh,
innovative or unusual.

206
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:44,110
The real question is why does there come
a point at which this bigness is fatal?

207
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,331
In other words,

208
00:14:47,331 --> 00:14:51,870
the opposite califate does
fine from seven 50 to um,

209
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:56,840
uh, nine, 10, and then
it falls apart. Why it,

210
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,270
why does it fall apart when it does?
Um,

211
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:06,020
and I don't have a great answer for that
except to point to the other divisions

212
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,030
or to, um, you know,
misfortunate and having a poor,

213
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:15,890
uh, Caliphs having Caliphs who don't
last for long time in a rover throne.

214
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:21,170
Nevertheless, states start to
split off from the caliphate.

215
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,210
The first right from the
beginning is Mumbai had Spain

216
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,870
and Wickham talks a little bit about
the civilization of Mayan, Spain, Spain,

217
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,100
but you start to have, uh, uh,

218
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:41,300
the splitting of places like
Egypt under the Shiite dynasty,

219
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:45,620
the Fat Cummins right
by the 10th century.

220
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:53,620
What's interesting is that these societies
are run very much like the opposite

221
00:15:55,260 --> 00:16:00,260
califit although they are large,
they are more practical, compact,

222
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,360
and somewhat easier to hold together.

223
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:06,110
They have the same kind
of cultural efflorescence,

224
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,510
scientific curiosity,
uh,

225
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:13,850
sensuality of culture,
luxury products.

226
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:20,530
Indeed [inaudible] Spain would have the
reputation of the height of civilization

227
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:28,580
in Christian Europe of the 10th century.
Ain't none.

228
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,640
Writing from a German monastery in
the 10th century named Cross with her

229
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,110
cross with a of Ganders.
Hime

230
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,360
describes core, develop the
capital of Omani, had Spain,

231
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:58,070
the largest city in Europe,
excluding Constantinople,

232
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,060
the largest city in western Europe
at this time. She describes Cordoba,

233
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,930
has the ornament of the world.
She'd never visited it.

234
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:11,750
She's a cloistered nun in a
monastery in Germany. Nevertheless,

235
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:15,290
for her, this is the most
splendid place in the world.

236
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:20,330
Splendid. In terms of
wealth, population, culture,

237
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,780
learning and ornament to the world is
the title of a book by our colleague in

238
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:29,010
the Spanish department, Maria Menocal, uh,

239
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:33,110
written about 10 years ago
describing medieval Spain.

240
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:36,890
And it's, uh, uh, it's civilization.

241
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:43,190
Cordoba would be a center for
learning among Christians,

242
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,440
Jews,
and Muslims.

243
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:52,920
So this series of cultural accomplishments
by the Arabs, uh, as I said,

244
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,780
may come as a surprise,

245
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,183
uh,

246
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:03,090
but it should not be running.
The surprise element may be,

247
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:05,700
as we've said now,
more than once,

248
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:10,701
the ability of the Arabs to assimilate
other traditions and to remain as

249
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:16,080
conquerors that is, these two things
are related. They remain as conquerors,

250
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:20,670
even though the Califate,
uh, uh, does not survive.

251
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:26,010
The Arabs are still the, uh, um,

252
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:31,500
the dominant force in Egypt,
North Africa,

253
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:36,510
and much of the Middle East and
where they are not dominant.

254
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:41,910
Islam remains the dominant faith
of, uh, places like Persia,

255
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,520
modern Iran, uh, and further east.

256
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,780
So just because the caliphate falls does
not mean that Islam loses power and it

257
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:56,910
doesn't mean that the
civilization of Islam, uh,

258
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,640
fails,
at least not at this point.

259
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,810
I hope then we can see that
Islam is a thing in itself,

260
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,620
a historical force in itself
developed in our period,

261
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,070
but also to some extent an
heir to the Roman empire.

262
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,270
And Bryce said that there are
three heirs to the Roman empire,

263
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,110
the Byzantine or eastern Roman Empire,

264
00:19:20,111 --> 00:19:24,910
most obviously the Western kingdoms.
And when we come to Charlemagne next week,

265
00:19:24,911 --> 00:19:29,911
we'll be talking about this much more
aggressively and the Islamic world,

266
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,860
it's also however the air
to some other cultures,

267
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,820
it's the air to sustain Ian or
Persian culture, for example.

268
00:19:39,821 --> 00:19:44,710
So it is not exclusively to be understood
as a successor to the Roman Empire. Uh,

269
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,641
but then again,

270
00:19:45,641 --> 00:19:50,641
neither is the west of Europe
and neither is Byzantium.

271
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:55,950
Those are the things that we're going
to be discussing in the future. So, uh,

272
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,960
any observations thus far or
problems thus far Islamic world,

273
00:20:01,211 --> 00:20:02,110
these three lectures,

274
00:20:02,111 --> 00:20:06,280
clear as can be imprinted in your
mind like the seal of the prophets.

275
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:10,420
Okay.
So what about the seventh century?

276
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,340
Now we're backtracking a little cause
we're the Abbasids we'd gotten up as far

277
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:18,400
as the, uh, as the 10th century.

278
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:20,923
Okay.

279
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,890
I want to go back to the seventh century
because it's the crucial turning point

280
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:26,890
of the early Middle Ages. Even though
we're in the 10th week of this course,

281
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:31,750
isn't that right? Oh, here
we are at its hinge I think,

282
00:20:31,751 --> 00:20:36,070
or at least we can,
we can get the lay of the land.

283
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:38,680
This is a little bit like
approaching a shoreline,

284
00:20:38,681 --> 00:20:43,420
which you see very vaguely and men
suddenly actually you can start to see the

285
00:20:43,421 --> 00:20:47,530
houses and see which are the mountains
that are far away and which are hills

286
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:51,280
that are in the harbor and so
forth and so on. So I hope that,

287
00:20:51,281 --> 00:20:55,990
I mean the course differs from
many other history courses in that,

288
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,350
uh,
beyond just the fall of the Roman empire.

289
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,340
You don't have an instinctive feel
for what this course is about,

290
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,800
what its contours are.

291
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:10,570
So what I'm trying to do
is not just point to, um,

292
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,750
a, uh, turning in the road,

293
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:19,000
but I'm trying to show you the road itself
through the proverbial forest and the

294
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:21,790
trees. Okay. Um,

295
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,250
partly what we're concerned
with is periodization. Now,

296
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:31,300
what are the time periods?
Is it the classical world
and then the medieval world?

297
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:35,830
Is it something called the classical
world on intermediate period called late

298
00:21:35,831 --> 00:21:39,610
antiquity, and then the Middle
Ages? What does the course title,

299
00:21:39,611 --> 00:21:44,611
the early Middle Ages mean when its
successor is called the birth of Europe.

300
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,010
And we're going to change that, by the
way. I think we're just gonna call it a,

301
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:51,640
maybe we're going to combine these into
one course called the Middle Ages, but,

302
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,470
uh, that's, uh, that's for the future. Uh,

303
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,620
so periodization and then,
you know,

304
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:04,540
when are we talking about as
the borders of these periods?

305
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:10,680
It's a murky period that
covered by this course,

306
00:22:10,681 --> 00:22:15,681
roughly two 84 to 1000 or Diocletian to
the year 1000 murky but important as I

307
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:23,541
hope you see already the development
of such absolutely fundamental world

308
00:22:23,731 --> 00:22:27,600
historic things as state
sponsored Christianity,

309
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,730
Islam,

310
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:36,050
the ideas of political power in Europe
as nations as opposed to the uh,

311
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,990
universal Roman Empire. All of these
things take shape in hour period.

312
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:51,140
The traditional periodization concentrated
on the fall of the Roman empire

313
00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:00,660
and while everybody admitted this was
somewhat of an arbitrary date and indeed

314
00:23:01,181 --> 00:23:06,130
its origins and consequences in Gibbons'
decline and fall of the Roman Empire

315
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,280
extend to the second century ID and go
on to the fall of Constantinople in this

316
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,900
15th century.
Nevertheless,

317
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:18,901
for 76 the deposition of the last Roman
emperor ruling from Ravenna by the

318
00:23:20,411 --> 00:23:25,411
barbarian chieftain Odoacer who then
proclaims Italy to be part of the eastern

319
00:23:26,891 --> 00:23:31,180
Roman Empire or at least loyal to the
eastern Roman Empire. That loyalty,

320
00:23:31,181 --> 00:23:32,200
largely affection

321
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,200
in the traditional periodization for 76
is then followed by something called the

322
00:23:44,481 --> 00:23:48,170
dark
and the dark ages end,

323
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:53,200
depending on your point of view with the
growth of the European economy and the

324
00:23:53,631 --> 00:23:58,631
10th or 11th century with the rediscovery
of a Latin classical culture in the

325
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:05,831
12th century or with the Italian
renaissance in the 15th century,

326
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:11,471
certainly the renaissance artists regarded
everything that came before them as

327
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,810
the dark ages.

328
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:19,870
And it is they who called
medieval architecture gothic
by which they don't mean

329
00:24:21,321 --> 00:24:24,530
a complimentary term because
there's one thing, you know,

330
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,470
the cathedral of Notre
Dame in Paris is not,

331
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,780
it's not gothic in the literal sense.

332
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,290
It has nothing to do with the
Visigoths or the Ostrogoths.

333
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:38,240
We have a few little remanence of visit
gothic and Austra Gothic Ostrow gothic

334
00:24:38,241 --> 00:24:43,040
architecture. It's not like that at all.
But for Vasari and people like this,

335
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:44,450
a Italian renaissance writers,

336
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:48,070
all of this was just junk and it was
just junk of the past. It's just, uh,

337
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,400
the dark ages.

338
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:54,730
The Sun rose in Florence
sometime after Dante is the,

339
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,270
uh, is, is what most
people continue to believe.

340
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:04,810
And as a medievalist I long ago gave
up fighting this and embraced it.

341
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:09,080
The dark ages are cool. I'm,
no Halloween is over. But, uh,

342
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,210
nevertheless we all know that, uh, um,

343
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,550
the Middle Ages is far more
fun than the renaissance. Oh.

344
00:25:16,551 --> 00:25:21,551
Who wants proportion and logic and
severe classical lines when you can have

345
00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:25,760
gargoyles and weird stuff while
I'm preaching to the converted,

346
00:25:25,761 --> 00:25:30,761
why you're in this class of if you didn't
like a weirdness a you'd be taking,

347
00:25:31,161 --> 00:25:35,210
um, uh, you know, um, well,

348
00:25:35,211 --> 00:25:39,170
what would you be taking? I think
I'll, I'll just leave that, uh,

349
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,940
we're not in competition
in this department,

350
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,400
so I'm trying to argue that this period
is more than just a kind of a long nap.

351
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:49,660
Uh,

352
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:54,140
but poor people are just waiting for
something like the Italian renaissance

353
00:25:54,141 --> 00:25:54,351
there.

354
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:58,790
There is this book that is on the cutting
edge of scholarship of this period

355
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:03,180
that is called the long morning
of the early Middle Ages. Uh,

356
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,530
which I think is not a felicitous title.

357
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:10,550
Much as I admire the people who put this
together, who are at another university,

358
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,710
not all that different from
this one. Uh, they, um,

359
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,610
by long morning they don't mean brunch.
That's what I would have called it.

360
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,130
The long run, the long brunch of
the early Middle Ages, you know,

361
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:27,080
people enjoy an eggs benedict
on the smoldering ruins of the,

362
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,070
of the empire eggs benedict

363
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,570
benedict in rule.

364
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:43,160
Why does seventh century seriously,
it has a better claim.

365
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:47,220
The status has pivot for
this roughly 700 year period.

366
00:26:47,221 --> 00:26:52,110
Then for 76. It is in some sense
the end of the classical world.

367
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,060
It is in some sense,
uh,

368
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,870
the end of whatever we wanna
call this late antiquity.

369
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,470
Uh, this is for basically,
uh, four reasons.

370
00:27:04,471 --> 00:27:07,770
One and the most obvious
is the rise of Islam,

371
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:11,280
the rise of Islam and its consequences,

372
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,640
the breaking apart of the
Mediterranean into different regions.

373
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:19,590
So although I've stressed
the ties between Islam,

374
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:23,110
Greece, Persia, uh,

375
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,290
between the northern and
the southern Mediterranean,

376
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,220
between Islamic Spain and Christian Spain,
nevertheless,

377
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:33,030
the conquests of the Arabs in the
seventh century and in the early eighth

378
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:38,031
century create some what of a breakup
of what had been a United Mediterranean

379
00:27:38,671 --> 00:27:41,670
under the Romans.
There are different religious,

380
00:27:41,671 --> 00:27:45,420
cultural and trade zones under the Romans.

381
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:50,130
North Africa and Italy
had been, uh, really, uh,

382
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,910
a very close together, had much more
in common with each other than say,

383
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,330
Italy and northern gall or Britain.

384
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:04,310
Well, Gustin sales between North Africa
and Italy all the time. They really,

385
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,930
they're quite close.

386
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,100
But we think of them as being far away
because in the modern world and indeed

387
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:15,280
since the Islamic conquest and they've
been culturally and economically very

388
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:16,694
different.

389
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:24,710
So this breaking up of
the Mediterranean creates,

390
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:28,580
and I'll elaborate on this in a moment,
creates a,

391
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,180
it doesn't create the
birth of Europe exactly,

392
00:28:32,181 --> 00:28:35,750
but it creates Europe as
a kind of separate region.

393
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,650
Naturally from the
geographical point of view,

394
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:43,550
Europe has always existed as a continent.

395
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,650
But here we have the beginning
of the distinction between Europe

396
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:55,350
and Asia and Africa without the kinds
of close ties that we've seen connected

397
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:00,310
the Mediterranean,
the two shores of the Mediterranean,

398
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:04,510
which merely because they're different
contents that continents and indeed the

399
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,900
third shore of the Mediterranean
and the East, technically in Asia.

400
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:12,730
Now these start to fall into different
cultural and political realms.

401
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:19,110
So the first aspect of the seventh
century is this breakup of Ben,

402
00:29:20,121 --> 00:29:24,850
a trainee in unity, the break up
of this aspect of the Roman legacy.

403
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,720
And if I've emphasized that there
are three heirs to the Roman empire,

404
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,790
the fact that there are three years to
one fortune shows that they are distinct.

405
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:38,170
Second and related to this,
the rise of northern Europe,

406
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:43,120
what had been peripheral in the Roman
Empire starts become much more central.

407
00:29:43,121 --> 00:29:47,680
And when we come to Charlemagne,
you'll see this round 800,

408
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:53,280
well 800 exactly as the
urine with Charlemagne is
crowned Roman emperor in Rome

409
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:58,840
itself by the pope as it turns out.

410
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:04,710
But already this importance of northern
Europe is evident in some things we've

411
00:30:07,331 --> 00:30:10,450
been talking about. The Irish
missionaries, for example,

412
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:15,490
the role of Ireland in preserving
knowledge. And in diffusing Christianity,

413
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:19,120
the role of Britain,
the fact that as I said,

414
00:30:19,121 --> 00:30:22,870
Britain at the time of bead
was the most cultivated,

415
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,480
uh, heir to the Latin
learning of the Roman Empire.

416
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:37,030
And the um, um, you know,

417
00:30:37,031 --> 00:30:40,840
the fact that this should be true in
the eighth century shows some kind of

418
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:44,530
difference, some kind of change
since in the Roman empire,

419
00:30:44,531 --> 00:30:47,440
these had been peripheral areas.
The further north you went,

420
00:30:47,441 --> 00:30:51,410
the further away from the
Mediterranean, the less civil laws. Uh,

421
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,540
the society was

422
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,370
the third aspect of this turning point.

423
00:30:57,371 --> 00:31:02,371
The third way in which we
have a kind of shift is the,

424
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,350
um, uh, crisis and reshaping
of the Byzantine Empire,

425
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,300
the loss of Egypt, North
Africa, Palestine and Syria,

426
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,610
which take place in the seventh century.

427
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,810
And we'll talk about this more next week,

428
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,780
but the decline of the cities
of the Byzantine Empire,

429
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:27,130
the militarization of society and
the Byzantine Empire. In fact,

430
00:31:27,131 --> 00:31:32,131
the seventh century is the era of the
Byzantine Empire that most resembles the

431
00:31:32,741 --> 00:31:36,400
fifth century for the
western Roman Empire.

432
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:42,700
If we preserve the term
Dark Ages, reluctantly, uh,

433
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:47,730
the West goes into a period of what
Wickham calls radical simplification of

434
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:51,490
material culture.

435
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:57,120
That is to say people become poorer and
less in contact with the wider world.

436
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,580
And this happens in Byzantium
in the seventh century.

437
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,500
So it's not that the eastern
empire survives completely intact,

438
00:32:05,501 --> 00:32:10,330
but that its collapse is later
than that of the western empire.

439
00:32:10,331 --> 00:32:14,290
But crucially, again, as we will
see, that collapses, not total.

440
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,260
It's not as complete as that of the West.

441
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:22,680
The Byzantine Empire would just barely
survived the seventh and eighth centuries

442
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:29,040
and by the ninth century enter into a
period of a fluorescence that we will be

443
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,903
describing.

444
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:37,560
But this society is not really Roman
anymore on some fundamental level,

445
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:45,110
some fundamental level including
control of Rome and Italy.

446
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:47,810
Okay?

447
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:51,440
The basis of the Byzantine
Empire will be Anatolia.

448
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,110
That is Asiatic Turkey and the Balkans.

449
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:55,523
It's

450
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,810
we're modern Romania,
Bulgaria, Greece, Albania,

451
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:04,470
Croatia, Serbia, and so forth.

452
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:11,490
Constants. The second Byzantine Emperor,

453
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,610
well from six 52 to six 68

454
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,870
leaves Constantinople

455
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:32,050
after the first Muslim Sikh, um, uh,

456
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,970
intent on creating a new capital in
the west because Constantinople is too

457
00:33:36,971 --> 00:33:41,740
vulnerable. In other words, he
envisages a eastern Roman empire,

458
00:33:41,741 --> 00:33:43,570
but with its capital in Sicily,

459
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,160
he moves his capital
eventually to Syracuse,

460
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,980
Coosa and modern Cecily.

461
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:58,750
He's the last emperor to visit Rome while
the last eastern Roman Empire Emperor.

462
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:04,280
Actually to put in an appearance in Rome,
as I've said,

463
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:09,020
these emperors would call themselves the
Roman emperor until the day the Turks

464
00:34:09,021 --> 00:34:14,021
penetrated the walls of
Constantinople in 1453

465
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:21,590
but they weren't really emperors of Rome
in the sense of control over the city

466
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:25,260
of Rome.
After six 64,

467
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,840
the last visit of an emperor to rum,

468
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:32,010
and then four years later he
was murdered in Syracuse. Well,

469
00:34:32,011 --> 00:34:36,360
the fact that the emperor is
murdered is not all that unusual. Um,

470
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:41,400
a lot of these emperors that murdered
get their noses cutoff in lieu of murder.

471
00:34:41,401 --> 00:34:44,880
The notion being that if you're mutilated,
you can't be an emperor again.

472
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:48,970
And then one of these emperors as
we'll get, and we'll discuss this a,

473
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:52,500
comes back even though his nose is gone.
Um,

474
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:54,380
okay.

475
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:59,380
But what this means is the end of this
experiment in moving the seat of the

476
00:34:59,421 --> 00:35:04,040
empire moves back to Constantinople
in Constantinople for better or worse,

477
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:07,460
and surprisingly a lot for better,
uh,

478
00:35:07,461 --> 00:35:12,461
remains the capital of this
powerful if limited empire,

479
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,860
the seventh century.
However,

480
00:35:15,861 --> 00:35:20,861
it should not be seen as a time when
these realms are completely isolated from

481
00:35:22,701 --> 00:35:26,900
each other. The Islamic,
the eastern, the western,

482
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,840
it is still possible to travel.

483
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:35,690
And Indeed Brown emphasizes this.
The Archbishop of Canterbury,

484
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:40,380
uh, in, uh, the end of
the seventh century,

485
00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:45,270
Theodore, uh, came from,
uh, tarsus in Anatolia,

486
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:49,140
Syria,
many of the popes of this era,

487
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,950
we're of Syriac or Greek origin.

488
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:56,763
Okay,

489
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,070
this starts to fade.
However,

490
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,520
as Islam takes control over more and
more of the former eastern Roman empire.

491
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:13,330
So not only do you get a diminution in
communication and cultural exchange of

492
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:21,050
between the Islamic world now is
it is and the Christian world,

493
00:36:21,051 --> 00:36:24,740
you get less between east and west.
In the west,

494
00:36:24,741 --> 00:36:28,670
people no longer tend to know Greek
outside of Rome and the papacy.

495
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:34,400
And by the eighth century, even in
Rome, uh, this knowledge is a much,

496
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:35,234
much diminished.

497
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,600
And then the reorientation of Persia,

498
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:47,040
it's no accident that Brown begins
the chapter that you've read with a

499
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:48,390
discussion of Persia.

500
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:53,340
And actually we hear more about Persian
now in this reading than in any other

501
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:55,410
single reading for the course.

502
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,980
And this is not just because
of the Islamic conquest

503
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:04,920
part of it is purchased or
erect modern Iran's position.

504
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,083
It's monitored year,

505
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:11,120
but it's also modern Iraq capital of
Persia is in what is now Iraq in the more

506
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:15,810
fertile part of the former Persian empire.

507
00:37:15,811 --> 00:37:19,920
That is to say the west, what is known
in the ancient world as Mesopotamia.

508
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:26,820
So Persia could be oriented towards
Mesopotamia or could be oriented more

509
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:31,690
towards the east, towards
India ultimately. And a,

510
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,230
this is partly for extraneous reasons,

511
00:37:34,231 --> 00:37:38,790
the what the rise of these people
called the white hands, uh, who uh,

512
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:42,390
Press Persia, uh, from uh, uh,

513
00:37:42,391 --> 00:37:47,391
of the east and who take over modern
Afghanistan and even what's now eastern

514
00:37:47,761 --> 00:37:48,594
Iran.

515
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:55,790
Persian has been a kind of
offstage presence in this course.

516
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,100
But in terms of trade,

517
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:04,960
there had been a great deal of
interaction, trade and culture,

518
00:38:04,961 --> 00:38:08,710
the Silk Road traffic and spices.

519
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:13,630
There've been a tremendous traffic
in religious ideas as well.

520
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:18,730
Nestorianism eh,
becomes strong in Persia.

521
00:38:18,731 --> 00:38:20,530
The heresy of the Fifth Century

522
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:27,820
Mannequin Ism, which we discussed in
relation to all Gustin comes from Persia,

523
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:32,560
a lot of apocalyptic
thinking in both Islam.

524
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:37,150
And in Christianity if the focus on
the end of the world and what God has

525
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:42,070
planned for centers and for the
justified comes from Persia as well.

526
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:47,410
Now, however, in the seventh
century, in the 18th century,

527
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:50,080
start to see a hardening
of the boundaries.

528
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:55,180
Western Europe is less
in contact with the east.

529
00:38:55,270 --> 00:39:00,270
It's less in contact with Byzantium with
which it has religious disputes and it

530
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:07,270
is out of contact with these influences
coming from the east from as far as

531
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:12,271
Persia that characterized the period
that we began with an up to now,

532
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:22,710
and this is reflected in the changing
of the center of gravity of the Califit

533
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,090
that we alluded to last time.

534
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:30,330
The move from Damascus to Baghdad is not
only a strategic decision or a cultural

535
00:39:30,941 --> 00:39:31,774
decision,

536
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,040
but it's a d Mediterranean Ising of Islam.

537
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:40,960
It's capital is now within
the former Persian empire,

538
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,360
and if it doesn't mean a Persian
ization of the caliphate,

539
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:48,570
it certainly means that Islam is
not really a Mediterranean religion,

540
00:39:48,911 --> 00:39:50,350
certainly not exclusively.

541
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,180
And then finally in the West,

542
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:02,670
the seventh century sees
the end of a secular elite.

543
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,410
When we began this course,

544
00:40:04,411 --> 00:40:09,411
we talked about the Roman Empire as
characterized by a civilian or senatorial

545
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,500
elite of wealthy people of cultivation

546
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:20,700
who are not only literate but who are
scholarly and artistically inclined.

547
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:26,330
These people are gone by the seventh
century in their place is a smaller and

548
00:40:27,061 --> 00:40:28,860
somewhat different elite,

549
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,880
at least elite understood
by learning of clergy.

550
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:38,940
It's at this point that monasteries and
churches become the repository of the

551
00:40:38,941 --> 00:40:43,941
classical legacy and are run by the
almost soul literate people in society.

552
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,333
Okay.

553
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,680
So,
um,

554
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:59,930
how do we put these things together,
these phenomena together?

555
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:05,660
One way of doing this that was very
popular in the Mid 20th, 20th century,

556
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:06,530
uh,

557
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:11,530
was what was known as the prn thesis
named after the Great Belgium historian

558
00:41:11,811 --> 00:41:16,160
only Perrin
who was active in the,

559
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:19,110
um, the teens twenties, uh,

560
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:24,120
of the 20th century on repairing the
parenthesis in the parenthesis goes like

561
00:41:24,201 --> 00:41:26,510
this.
Um,

562
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:31,820
the Roman Empire did not fall enforced 76.
It continued,

563
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
if not a political entity as a socio
cultural and most especially economic

564
00:41:38,751 --> 00:41:42,530
entity because the Mediterranean
and Mediterranean unity where,

565
00:41:42,531 --> 00:41:45,350
what characterize the Roman
Empire from the start.

566
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:48,470
And this was not disrupted
by the barbarians.

567
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:53,360
Mediterranean trade continued to exist,
gold coin and continue to exist.

568
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,930
What ended them was not the
collapse of the empire in the West,

569
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:02,320
but Islam that the Arab invasions
cut off the different pieces of the

570
00:42:04,251 --> 00:42:09,251
Mediterranean and ended Mediterranean
trade and with the end of the

571
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:14,591
Mediterranean as this key entre Entreposto
or economic heartland new centers

572
00:42:18,051 --> 00:42:21,170
were created,
particularly northern Europe.

573
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:26,710
The rise of northern Europe
that I mentioned here was
most obvious in the ascent

574
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,090
of Charlemagne,

575
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:34,540
Charlemagne crowned emperor in Rome and
800 was by no means from Rome or Italy,

576
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:41,240
but it was from the Frankish realm.

577
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:46,960
The lands of his family
were in what is now Belgium,

578
00:42:47,091 --> 00:42:51,380
western Germany,
the Netherlands and northeastern France.

579
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,540
His capital was not Rome.
He went there to be crowned,

580
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:59,300
but his capital was rather in Aachen,

581
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,230
a city that is in Germany but only barely.

582
00:43:03,231 --> 00:43:07,430
It's very close to the Dutch
border or close to Belgium as well,

583
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:10,610
very close to Luxembourg
and quite close to France.

584
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:15,260
He is a representative
then of northern Europe.

585
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:20,390
Aachen had been known to the Romans
because it has hot baths and that's why

586
00:43:20,391 --> 00:43:24,580
Charlemagne shows it also
natural hot springs of,

587
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:29,590
but it is not part of the olive
oil and wine growing regions of the

588
00:43:31,641 --> 00:43:34,920
Mediterranean that we saw were the um,

589
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,280
what the Romans loved and what they
considered to be civilization for prn.

590
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:45,310
Then the rise of Charlemagne is made
possible by Mohammed and indeed his master

591
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:49,070
work was called Mohammed and Charlemagne.

592
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:54,440
Here the periodization
is definitely Islam.

593
00:43:55,010 --> 00:44:00,010
Islam creates Europe because Europe is
the antithesis to the world created by

594
00:44:01,671 --> 00:44:02,480
Islam.

595
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,830
Present had no ideological opposition
to Islam for him as long as simply a

596
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:11,810
facilitating factor in destroying the
ancient world and by ancient world he

597
00:44:11,811 --> 00:44:12,890
means the Mediterranean.

598
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,780
Well this is one of those elegant
theories that has been disproven.

599
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,480
It's been disproven
largely by archaeology,

600
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,030
which has shown that there's lots
of trade in the Mediterranean,

601
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:28,450
that the arrival of Islam by no means
disrupted trade by no means disrupted

602
00:44:28,821 --> 00:44:29,840
these contacts.

603
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:35,740
But it is true and I'm just sad or
emphasize that beginning with Islam,

604
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:39,900
beginning with the seventh century,

605
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,220
there is a drifting apart of
cultural and political realms.

606
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:49,370
We can start to identify three different
civilizations and next week we're going

607
00:44:50,651 --> 00:44:54,180
to talk about the flowering of Byzantium.

608
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:59,090
That is the height of this eastern
Roman Empire in terms of its political

609
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,090
military power.

610
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:05,220
And then we're going to
come to Charlemagne and try
to see what this landscape

611
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:10,400
of the development of something other
than mere barbarian post Robin successor

612
00:45:11,101 --> 00:45:15,480
states means for the West. Okay.
It's been a lot of fun. Thanks.
