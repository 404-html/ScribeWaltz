1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,800
I've put these names on the board
because today we're talking about the

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,870
so-called Carolingian renaissance,

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,010
the revival of learning under
Charlemagne and his successors,

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,210
but the figures of this renaissance,
the intellectuals of Charlemagne,

5
00:00:16,211 --> 00:00:18,900
his court of the court of Louis,
the pious,

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,490
the court of Charles the
bald are not household names.

7
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:25,470
And I just want to give you a sample.

8
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:28,860
And it is no more than
a sample of these men.

9
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:33,790
And I'm afraid they all were
men. Uh, and most of them, um,

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,670
monks, uh, uh, or other kinds of clerics.

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,560
And what I want to do today is
reminds you for the first to start,

12
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,240
we said last time that Charlemagne's
rule was based on a combination of

13
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:52,710
traditional war leadership similar
to that of the mirror of engines,

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,170
an alliance with the church similar
to the Merovingians, but much closer,

15
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,970
much closer in the sense of seeing the,
um,

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,180
legitimation of rule up to
the point of emperor as a,

17
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,770
a product of what later would be
called sacred monarchy. In other words,

18
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:18,771
that the kingship was not just rulership
over the populous or over warriors.

19
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:20,970
It was that.

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,440
But it was also a
responsibility and ministry,

21
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,660
the word that's used,
uh,

22
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,780
to see to the salvation of the public
good and not just the secular benefit of

23
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:35,340
the public good as in a modern state,

24
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:40,020
but to the salvation of the people
that God would hold the emperor,

25
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,000
the king responsible for this. And
then the third element was, uh,

26
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,610
to revive the Roman Empire.

27
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:51,600
And not just as a political entity,

28
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,290
but the Roman empire as a state,

29
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,350
as a form of rulership for the
benefit of a diverse population,

30
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:05,760
not just one nation like the Franks
or the lombards or the Saxons,

31
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:08,850
but of a kind of imperial confederation.

32
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,640
Uh,

33
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,230
the Carolingian renaissance
is a planned one,

34
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,160
unlike the regular old
Italian renaissance,

35
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:24,870
which is a spontaneous revival of learning
in several different cities on the

36
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:28,200
parts of intellectuals.
The Italian renaissance,

37
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,820
like most revivals of learning might've
been patronized by secular rulers,

38
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,060
but it's impetus was not
the state in this case.

39
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:39,204
However,

40
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:44,210
we have a program of reviving Latin,

41
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,570
reviving the classical
literature and texts,

42
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,323
teaching

43
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,800
these subjects and all of this not
in aid of what we would call a purely

44
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:03,460
educational program,

45
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,990
but to help the state
and to help its mission,

46
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,270
which as we've just said is both
a Christian and a Roman one.

47
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,670
The revival of letters was intended then
to restore and deepen the piety of the

48
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:24,430
population,
the understanding of Christianity,

49
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,150
the restoration of the church
as an intellectual force,

50
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:33,450
the preservation of learning from both
Roman secular and religious texts.

51
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:40,140
So that Charlemagne's cultural program
is the culmination of a longer period of

52
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:46,021
trying to save something from the
wreckage of classical civilization.

53
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,490
And thus as a Christian
ruler and as a Roman emperor,

54
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,470
Charlemagne surrounded himself
with these and other intellectuals,

55
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,780
monks and scholars,

56
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,720
in order to understand this mission.
However, beyond just saying, oh,

57
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:08,110
Christianity or classical culture,

58
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,130
we have to go back to some topics we
touched on very lightly when we were

59
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:17,131
talking about monasticism and
that have cropped up now and then.

60
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,540
So I want to start out
with the preservation of
learning up to the point that

61
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:26,390
Charlemagne really starts putting
together this program, uh,

62
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,420
around seven 80 a day
you'll remember.

63
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,280
And you love a scene from Augustine's
confessions among other things that the

64
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:41,281
ideal of Roman culture at the time of the
empire was a cultivated leisure on the

65
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:51,070
part of wealthy,
well educated lay people.

66
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,920
That is to say even after
Constantine's conversion,

67
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,760
the intellectuals of the
empire tended to be not clergy,

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,440
but wealthy people who
could afford the leisure,

69
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,460
the time,

70
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:08,230
and the expense of procuring
books and of discussing them.

71
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,740
These were the people who represented
the continuation of the literary and

72
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:18,640
philosophical traditions of
classical Greece and Rome.

73
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,740
And this also had a practical benefit
just as a rather than a different way it

74
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:30,820
does now in order to enter
Roman governmental service,

75
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:35,821
which was the most successful career path
of the time of Saint Augustine and had

76
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:37,270
been for some centuries,

77
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:42,420
you needed to have an education of
a certain rather rarefied hire sort.

78
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:48,430
And this is not unique to
the Roman empire. It was
true of imperial China. Most,

79
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:52,750
obviously in China,
you had to pass a very tough exam,

80
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,080
a very selective examine,

81
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:59,390
order to be a part of the highest
level of the imperial service.

82
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,450
And the exam was not a political
science exam or you know,

83
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,760
a business decisions kind of exam.
It wasn't a, you know, like, uh,

84
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,710
you have, um, uh,

85
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,740
a certain kind of budget and you've
got to allocate resources or, you know,

86
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:17,470
it's not a, it's not a problem
set. Uh, it was poetry, uh,

87
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,570
was, uh, uh, a ancient culture.

88
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,100
And the same thing is true of the British
empire in the 19th century. You know,

89
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,600
in order to enter its
highest, uh, levels, uh,

90
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:33,620
you needed to know Greek and Roman, not
because in fact you were Greek and Latin,

91
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:37,650
not because you were
going to use them, uh, uh,

92
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,600
governing some colony, uh, in
Southeast Asia for example.

93
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,530
But because that was what
made you an educated person.

94
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,470
So,
um,

95
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,700
the centers of learning in the
ancient world included Athens,

96
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,040
the platonic and Athenian Academies,
uh,

97
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,650
Pergamum in Asia Minor, uh, who's, uh,

98
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,450
the name of which city gave its
name to parchment, uh, Alexandria,

99
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,160
which had an entity called the museum,
which was not what we now call a museum,

100
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:14,090
but rather a kind of library
and research center. Uh,

101
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,250
Constantinople later

102
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,480
Alexandria is the most famous because it
had this magnificent library as part of

103
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:28,430
the museum and the mystery of
what happened to this library, um,

104
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,420
allegedly burned by the
Muslims in the seventh,

105
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:36,170
eighth century on the
grounds that, uh, uh,

106
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,470
you didn't need to know anything
except what's in the Koran. And, um,

107
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,680
this is not true now.

108
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,730
The library had disappeared long before
the eighth century and probably was the

109
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:51,731
victim of the kinds of disorders that
began in the third century when we began

110
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:52,251
the course.

111
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:56,750
That kind of disruptions of local
society opportunities for plunder,

112
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,430
neglect, and, um, uh,

113
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:04,080
the museum was actually closed
by the Emperor Caracalla, uh,

114
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,010
in the third century.

115
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,770
So the major problem of the
Roman Empire in terms of the, uh,

116
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,910
diminution of learning is not a,

117
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,510
the burning of Alexandria
or such dramatic events.

118
00:08:20,511 --> 00:08:23,210
It's a much more gradual process.

119
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:28,420
And this gradual process involves what
we have at various times using Wickham's

120
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,890
language called the radical
simplification of material culture,

121
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,610
which means not only a
lack of imported goods,

122
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,040
more primitive accommodations,
uh, fewer kinds of, um,

123
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,440
uh,
less trade and commerce,

124
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:49,040
but also much less than the
way of books and learning.

125
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,360
This is also related to the
disappearance of lay literacy.

126
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,760
The people who were capable of reading
and writing in Latin as of let's say the

127
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:05,250
sixth century,

128
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,640
are overwhelmingly clerics and not all
that many of them either the last grand

129
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:18,200
figures of Roman classical culture,
our,

130
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,700
but we theists and Casio Doris,

131
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,060
and we've mentioned them
already, but a big bear,

132
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,010
but we feel this

133
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,350
for 80 to five, 24. And Casio Doris

134
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,130
four 92,
five 85,

135
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:52,910
Casio Doris was a monk and it is his
accomplishment to join monasticism to the

136
00:09:54,871 --> 00:09:58,800
preservation of learning. And he had
a very long life to do it as well.

137
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:04,020
Reminding us that not everybody just
kicked off at the age of 35 in the

138
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,890
preindustrial world of,

139
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,900
but we theist didn't have a particularly
long life because he was executed by

140
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:14,901
the Ostrogoths at King Theodoric
suspected of treason and plotting with

141
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,953
Byzantium.

142
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,043
Okay.

143
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:19,930
But we,

144
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:24,930
this could still work in his personal
library in Rome where the light filtered

145
00:10:25,101 --> 00:10:29,630
in through alabaster windows,
the Beinecke library idea

146
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,420
onto cupboard stacked with Greek
and Roman [inaudible] books.

147
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:41,390
But, but we theists was among the last
secular intellectuals in the West and

148
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,170
particularly one of the last
to know Greek as well as Latin.

149
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,720
He conceived a project of translating
the great works of Greek philosophy into

150
00:10:50,721 --> 00:10:51,554
Latin,

151
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,560
which would have include included
all of Plato and Aristotle,

152
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,140
but he was cut off by his arrest,

153
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:05,620
torture and execution after just having
done some introductory textbooks and

154
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:09,380
just a smattering of Plato and Aristotle

155
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,530
after him and the just any
antic invasion of Italy,

156
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,620
Italy was devastated. And even though
we're main of repository of manuscripts,

157
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,360
it's learning was preserved as a guttering
flame by monks like Casio Doris and

158
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:35,780
almost accidentally by the monks who
followed the rule of Saint Benedict.

159
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:40,310
St Benedict does, as you'll
recall, require reading,

160
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,060
but it's usually during lent
and it's a kind of penance.

161
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:52,010
The contribution of Casio Doris is the
organization of a more library like kind

162
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:57,171
of monastery and the notion that classical
culture is not just a collection of

163
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,200
texts about a discredited religion,

164
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,960
but necessary for Christian interpretation
of the Bible and Christian learning.

165
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,930
At his monastery of
vivarium in southern Italy,

166
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,260
Casio,
Doris developed a notion

167
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:25,090
of the liberal arts as an
aid to religious truth.

168
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,880
The liberal arts is not his invention,

169
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:33,450
but the notion of the
liberal arts culminating in
a program that has a purpose

170
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:39,450
in which classical culture is fused
with Christian culture is his doing.

171
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:45,250
He was not so much interested
in the aesthetic pleasure
of these classical texts

172
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,730
as in their use for
interpreting the Bible.

173
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,840
The Bible according to his Augustine's
and virtually everybody's understanding

174
00:12:55,631 --> 00:13:00,631
of the time is not a text that makes
perfect sense in every respect.

175
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:01,594
Literally,

176
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:06,580
it is the book of life
that God has set up for us,

177
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,190
but it requires interpretation.

178
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,480
Okay?

179
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,030
It is not just a literal text.

180
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,170
It is a figurative and
prophetic one as well.

181
00:13:18,171 --> 00:13:21,590
And in order to get at
what it really means,

182
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,840
what its real messages are,
you have to know things like mathematics,

183
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,030
astronomy, geometry, even music. Uh,

184
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,320
these, uh, and certainly
grammar, rhetoric and logic.

185
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:41,120
These are the seven liberal
arts of Casio Doris Curriculum,

186
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,250
right?
They're arranged in the three basic,

187
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:50,930
the trivium as it came to be called
the three, not because of trivial,

188
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:55,670
although that's where the word comes
from. The trivium I. U m T, R, I v, a,

189
00:13:55,671 --> 00:14:00,560
u m logic, grammar, rhetoric.
Now I'm in this sort of, um,

190
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:06,200
Rick Perry moment, the quadrivium.
There are four of them. Okay?

191
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:11,180
Arithmetic, astronomy, geometry and
music. Okay? So I got all of them.

192
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,390
The quadrivium are the sciences.
You don't think music is a science,

193
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:21,230
uh, in the, uh, late Roman
medieval imagination.

194
00:14:21,231 --> 00:14:26,180
It was the science of intervals
and of pleasing forms and of modes.

195
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:29,990
Okay.

196
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:34,990
The replication of this plan of Casio
Doris is the accomplishment of this period

197
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,510
in which classical learning
and it's texts were endangered.

198
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:47,450
The Benedictine monks of Italy.
Question and something I missed

199
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,910
the, for the quadrivium Quad, Q. U. A. D.

200
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,390
R. I. V. I. E. U. M. Sorry,
what were they? Oh God.

201
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,650
And you're putting me on the spot again.

202
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,110
It's y'all do y'all geometry,
geometry,

203
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,020
music, um, arithmetic and astronomy,

204
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,163
right?

205
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,480
This is the period in which the Irish
are critical to the preservation of

206
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:17,080
learning.

207
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,440
There was a book that was popular a few
years ago called how the Irish saved

208
00:15:20,441 --> 00:15:23,260
civilization. Um, like many popular books,

209
00:15:23,261 --> 00:15:27,640
this is a little bit reducing
things to a kind of easy formula,

210
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,880
but it is a Irish as well as Italian and
very much English monasticism under the

211
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:39,070
influence of both Italy and Ireland
that has a program of establishing

212
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:43,990
monasteries,
correcting and preserving Latin,

213
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:48,460
which has become increasingly distant
from what people actually speak.

214
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:52,300
And of course in Ireland,
not part of the Roman empire,

215
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,930
they had no tradition of
speaking Latin amongst,

216
00:15:55,931 --> 00:15:59,890
had to learn Latin as an artificial or
a completely foreign language and in a

217
00:15:59,891 --> 00:16:04,600
way that made their Latin better
because they didn't think that they,

218
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,260
uh,

219
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,820
kind of on the way to French or on the
way to spend it's language that was being

220
00:16:09,821 --> 00:16:13,260
spoken in general, uh,
could be confused with Latin

221
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,650
in the critical period.

222
00:16:17,651 --> 00:16:21,250
Five 50 and of the gothic wars in Italy,

223
00:16:21,251 --> 00:16:25,780
devastation of Italy to seven 50
beginning of the Carolingian ascent.

224
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:27,740
Okay.

225
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,460
There are only 264 books that survive.

226
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,640
It is 264 manuscripts

227
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:40,100
and all but 26 of them deal
with religious subjects

228
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,850
of this,
26 of them,

229
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,420
eight deal with law eight with medicine,

230
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,490
six with grammar.

231
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,500
Now one reason that very little survives
is that these were mostly written on

232
00:16:56,691 --> 00:17:00,140
Papaya Iris Scrolls,
which is not very durable.

233
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,440
Though there is a change underway
from about 402 writing on parchment,

234
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,270
which is very durable.

235
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,820
And accordingly,

236
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:20,460
along with this change to parchment is
a change from the scroll to the Codex.

237
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:27,780
So the triumph of the Codex
is roughly 400 a d two,

238
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,710
2010. Right? We're going
back to the scroll.

239
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:40,770
Actually we even use the word for the
process of going through a document on um,

240
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,240
uh, a, a, um, a computer or a kindle.

241
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,193
MMM.

242
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:59,860
How big are these libraries? How, how
many, how many texts do they have?

243
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:07,620
The largest library before Charlemagne
scent would have been the two libraries

244
00:18:08,231 --> 00:18:12,530
associated with bead in
the north of England. Um,

245
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,850
and um,
perhaps a hundred bucks,

246
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,540
620.

247
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,350
But it's at this

248
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,650
setting,
the England of bead,

249
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,680
the early eighth century that we start
to have the monasteries that really

250
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:35,030
conform to our image of monks
diligently copying manuscripts,

251
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:40,630
the invention of what's called the
monastic scriptorium of place for writing.

252
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,160
So there are monks who not
only read but copy other books,

253
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:02,450
maybe borrowed from other
monasteries for too.

254
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,860
This is a laborious process and one that
we can follow because we tend to know

255
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:16,681
where our texts of classical learning
come from and by how slender a thread they

256
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:23,530
arrive. Um, uh, for us,

257
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,590
the monks would copy these documents,

258
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,860
they would be preserved in the library,
but again,

259
00:19:36,861 --> 00:19:41,660
these monasteries close are plundered.
The,

260
00:19:41,661 --> 00:19:42,650
uh,
uh,

261
00:19:42,651 --> 00:19:47,651
wanderings of these manuscripts
then increase the fragility of,

262
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,720
uh,
what exists and what

263
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,410
we know yeah.

264
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,300
Mainly from libraries and extra.
Yeah.

265
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,400
The question is how do these monks in far
off north eastern England get ahold of

266
00:20:03,621 --> 00:20:08,621
the classical texts they're brought
up with the missionaries there,

267
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:13,430
evidence of constant
communication with, uh, Italy,

268
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,980
which is probably the
source of most of them.

269
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,690
And they learned very quickly.
Remember I said that there's this, uh,

270
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:25,730
a magnificent codex of the Bible that's
now in Florence that was a gift of the

271
00:20:25,731 --> 00:20:30,110
English to the pope in the
eighth century. So, um,

272
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:35,240
uh, there is traffic in these
extremely precious objects,

273
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:46,250
but it's very small scale and
very fragile as I've said,

274
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,240
until Charlemagne does,

275
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:54,241
is not so much innovate or
invent a program as make it
into something that's not

276
00:20:56,441 --> 00:21:01,441
just an artisinal enterprise dependent
on a few monks in a few monasteries.

277
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:08,100
And it's part of what we've said is a
campaign to salvage a classical learning.

278
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,200
This, uh, um,

279
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:23,070
is encapsulated in one of Charlemagne's
governing instructions to his

280
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,830
administrative cadres.
He says,

281
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:30,400
we are concerned to
restore with diligence,

282
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:33,160
zeal the workshops of knowledge,

283
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:39,060
which through the negligence of
our ancestors have been well nigh,

284
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,083
deserted.

285
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:45,990
We invite others by our own example as
much as lies within our power to learn to

286
00:21:48,581 --> 00:21:50,950
practice the liberal arts

287
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,870
as Wickham points out.

288
00:21:55,871 --> 00:22:00,871
This is an unusual period of intellectuals
participating in and even to some

289
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:05,710
extent directing government.

290
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:11,200
It's always necessary for governments
to have some, uh, you know,

291
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,940
economists or a foreign
policy specialists,

292
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:21,630
but intellectuals in the sense of
promoting a program of liberal arts is

293
00:22:21,851 --> 00:22:25,180
unusual. Or intellectuals
who are not just, you know,

294
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,540
decorators or an a
mentors of people who do.

295
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,530
Nice illuminated manuscripts
or beautiful, uh, you know,

296
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,570
fountains out of silver
with chirping birds. Um, uh,

297
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:41,700
the court of Charlemagne is a moment
of intense intellectual effort and

298
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:47,560
Charlemagne and his successors were
rulers who gave tremendous power,

299
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,770
privileges, even wealth, um,

300
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:54,310
to people who knew something
about classical learning.

301
00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:00,750
The purpose of this is to standardize
education in the church and to make sure

302
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:06,840
that the church ran in a,
uh,

303
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:11,890
an effective manner and also to make
sure that the government ran in an

304
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,470
effective manner.
By effective,

305
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,500
I mean uniformity and discipline so
that you could go into a church in

306
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:21,940
Barcelona,

307
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:27,400
the south western corner of
Charlemagne's realm or um,

308
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:31,150
uh, in, uh, ochin at the, um,

309
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:36,510
court of Charlemagne or in Rome itself
and hear the same kind of liturgy or

310
00:23:39,581 --> 00:23:44,581
ceremony or ritual that from one
corner of the Empire to the other,

311
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,020
the church laws would be the same,

312
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:54,490
that the discipline mete it out to a
misbehaving priests would be the same.

313
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,730
That preaching and missionary work
would be coordinated and uniform.

314
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,360
Even that spelling and the shape of
the letters might be standardized.

315
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,110
It is to Charlemagne and these
intellectuals that we owe.

316
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:16,070
The very beautiful way that we write,
as you can see,

317
00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:19,670
my miniscule a print is um,

318
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,800
uh, you know, the product
of a monastic education. Uh,

319
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:29,690
these little letters write these
minuscule letters are Carolingian.

320
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,640
This is how, uh, uh, they
write in the Roman era,

321
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:38,270
they tend to write in a different fashion.
Um,

322
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:43,470
and in the, uh, mirror of engine
court visit golf courts, uh,

323
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:48,110
in a still different and quite difficult
to read, at least for us now fashion.

324
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:52,010
Uh, the spelling of Latin
is regularized at this time.

325
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,290
Okay.

326
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:58,460
The notion is that the
people would receive,

327
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:00,160
okay,

328
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,160
basic education and of course there's
some debate as to how wide a spectrum of

329
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:11,371
the populace this involves how much
education ordinary people were to receive,

330
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,720
but from the point of view of the
intellectuals fashioning this,

331
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:21,970
what was really important was
that the clergy receive a, um,

332
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,590
a good Latin education.

333
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:29,110
The problem of clerical literacy is a
persistent problem of the Middle Ages.

334
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,650
Clergy who may know
some formula to recite,

335
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:37,450
who don't actually know how to read or
who don't actually know what the Latin

336
00:25:37,451 --> 00:25:38,710
words mean.

337
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,990
So this is a program
not just to save texts,

338
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,580
but to, um, uh,

339
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,170
to,
uh,

340
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,200
use them to apply them and also to
apply them to a level below that of

341
00:25:57,011 --> 00:26:01,750
intellectuals sitting around
and discussing the ancient world

342
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,930
at the highest level.

343
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,080
Monastic centers collected and
copied Latin classical manuscripts

344
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:19,530
collected, commented,
collated. This is not a,

345
00:26:19,531 --> 00:26:24,531
an intellectual program that
aims at entrepreneurship
or intellectual reality in

346
00:26:26,071 --> 00:26:28,950
the sense of, um, innovation.

347
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:34,890
Wickham talks about Ama of mets.
Uh,

348
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,580
one of the people I didn't
put on here mlrs remember,

349
00:26:38,581 --> 00:26:41,350
is condemned for, uh, um,

350
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:46,690
certain liturgical innovations and
he's astounded at being accused of

351
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:53,310
innovating. Uh, uh, he acknowledges
that this is not his job,

352
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:57,000
although he makes it worse
by saying that, um, uh,

353
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:02,010
he had found truth within
his own spirit saying,

354
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:05,040
I have found truth within
my own spirit. In, uh,

355
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:10,100
eight 48 d is not a proper answer because
that makes it sound as if your spirit

356
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,680
determines what truth is,

357
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:18,630
where its truth is determined by a much
longer biblical classical tradition and

358
00:27:18,631 --> 00:27:19,980
that's what orthodoxy is.

359
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:24,810
So he sort of had to accept
his not incredibly severe
punishment but punishment

360
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:25,644
nonetheless.

361
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,953
Okay.

362
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:36,400
The Carolingian renaissance was organized
by a group of people who are from all

363
00:27:37,851 --> 00:27:42,590
over. The place they had off from
Orlando is probably a visit golf.

364
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:47,240
Paul the Deacon is probably a
yard. Uh, Einhard is a frank,

365
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,570
the greatest of these figures.
Al Cohen,

366
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:56,510
who was more specifically
commissioned by Charlemagne too. Um,

367
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:56,831
and,

368
00:27:56,831 --> 00:28:01,831
and alkynes dates are seven 30 to eight
oh four alk winners from North Umbria.

369
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:08,210
Now Quinn is from the
school established by bead.

370
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,810
These scholars, as you can see how
different areas of specialization

371
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:21,820
there enterprises or their duties
were to regularize liturgy,

372
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,910
to revive rhetoric,

373
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:32,630
moral theology,
logical argumentation,

374
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,203
poetry,

375
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:40,490
and to argue against
theological unorthodoxy.

376
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:47,910
The two theological problems of the
Carolingian empire were iconoclasm debates

377
00:28:49,341 --> 00:28:49,881
about that,

378
00:28:49,881 --> 00:28:53,810
which we've already seen in the byzantine
empire and inherit to see called

379
00:28:53,811 --> 00:28:57,950
adoptionism.
Adoptionism

380
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:05,020
is the notion that Christ was a human
who was essentially adopted by God to

381
00:29:07,101 --> 00:29:07,970
become his son.

382
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:12,860
It's a heresy that at the time of
Charlemagne was strong in Spain,

383
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:17,360
or at least defined as a
heresy, uh, and, uh, wiped out.

384
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:24,740
We said, uh, uh,

385
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,760
that they're 26 nonreligious manuscripts
from between five 50 and seven 54.

386
00:29:32,911 --> 00:29:34,140
The ninth century.

387
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,950
There are 290 classical manuscripts,

388
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,040
154 the 10th.

389
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,760
So you can see the benign century
is kind of a golden age of this,

390
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:49,990
although again, we're not talking
about an incredible number of things,

391
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:55,420
not an incredible number, but
they're very, very important. Uh,

392
00:29:55,510 --> 00:30:00,510
many of you have taken directed studies
the first year freshmen liberal arts,

393
00:30:01,571 --> 00:30:03,520
great books program.
Well,

394
00:30:03,521 --> 00:30:07,630
of course a ds doesn't like the
Middle Ages for a number of reasons.

395
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:09,910
So it's not as if ds decided that Lupus,

396
00:30:09,911 --> 00:30:14,380
a fairy air is up there with
Plato and, um, through acidities.

397
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:20,280
But the things that you do read
in ds include, Olivia says,

398
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:24,610
a history of the Roman Empire,
Libby's history of the Roman empire,

399
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,890
tacit of the Roman republic.

400
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:32,130
Tacitus Bolivia's Libyan Tacitus are
authors who depend basically on one

401
00:30:33,851 --> 00:30:38,830
manuscript and that manuscript is a
Carolingian manuscripts for Livy for

402
00:30:38,831 --> 00:30:39,430
example,

403
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:43,810
there's a lot of his incredibly long
history that we don't have the so called

404
00:30:43,811 --> 00:30:46,570
lost decades of Livy.

405
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,350
His work is divided into
a book's called decades.

406
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:56,400
The fact that we have as much of Livy as
we do is due to the Carolingian copying

407
00:30:56,831 --> 00:30:57,664
programs.

408
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:03,300
The fact that we have Tacitus at all
is due basically to one manuscript.

409
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,880
CICERO's republic rediscovered in the
19th century is a palimpsest and you'll

410
00:31:14,681 --> 00:31:19,450
have a herd in section. Um, and in,

411
00:31:19,451 --> 00:31:20,230
uh,
uh,

412
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:25,230
the Beinecke he tour Palimpsest
is a manuscript that has
been scraped of its old

413
00:31:25,241 --> 00:31:27,160
text,
a new text put on,

414
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:32,190
but the old text is usually
more interesting to us
than the new one and, uh,

415
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:34,930
uh,
can be restored and read.

416
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:41,200
Most of these are regarded as
discoveries of the renaissance.

417
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:47,460
But where the renaissance scholars found
them was in northern monasteries where

418
00:31:48,191 --> 00:31:50,620
they had been copied and kept,
uh,

419
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:55,650
since Carolingian Times where then did
the Carolingian get their manuscripts,

420
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,550
where'd they get the things to copy?
Which, uh, is really a version of the,

421
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:07,060
a very perceptive question.
Um, uh, that was asked before.

422
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,380
Um, Italy for the most
part, especially Ravenna,

423
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:14,680
Monte Cassino and Rome itself.

424
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,830
So for example,
the German monastery of Laura Bush,

425
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,690
uh,
obtained from Italy,

426
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,810
an ancient manuscript
of Virgil and copied it.

427
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:34,560
They also have or copied Libby's fifth
decade that is part of living Roman

428
00:32:37,721 --> 00:32:38,440
history.

429
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:43,440
The unique manuscript of the fifth
decade found in the renaissance at Loris,

430
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:49,030
copied it [inaudible] in the ninth century
from some papyruses Italian original

431
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,540
long since lost.

432
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,493
Okay.

433
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:58,410
In addition to Laura Bush, the centers
of learning include Aachen itself,

434
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:00,570
the court of Charlemagne,

435
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:05,160
Corby, Corb, I e

436
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,030
tour, t. O. U. R. S.

437
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:10,970
Okay.

438
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:15,870
Sang Gol, st s t and gall, g a, l. L.

439
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,540
And these libraries,

440
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:25,950
we can see their growth
during this period. So,

441
00:33:25,951 --> 00:33:30,420
for example, uh, the monastery

442
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:37,870
of right now on an island
in lake cone stones

443
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,700
in 800 the year that Charlemagne
was crowned as Emperor
Ryka now had 50 bucks in

444
00:33:48,011 --> 00:33:50,050
eight 46 it had a thousand.

445
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,191
Well,

446
00:33:57,191 --> 00:34:01,180
all of this emphasis on education and
classical learning is extremely important

447
00:34:01,181 --> 00:34:05,230
and indeed it merits those
kinds of, um, you know,

448
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:11,010
how blank saved blank how the Carolingian
saved classical civilization in this

449
00:34:12,311 --> 00:34:13,144
case.

450
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:18,360
But it does not mark a break with the
piety and spirituality of the era.

451
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,330
And that's part of the point
of the Einhard reading.

452
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:28,410
Einhard is a critical figure in the court
of Charlemagne and of his son Louis,

453
00:34:29,171 --> 00:34:32,890
the pious about whom you'll be
reading shortly or have been rating.

454
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:40,230
And in Einhard we see an example of an
intellectual of this period and of this

455
00:34:41,231 --> 00:34:42,064
place.

456
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:52,483
Yeah.

457
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:57,840
Einhard is active in the court
of Charlemagne. He would be,

458
00:34:57,841 --> 00:35:01,860
Charlemagne is one of Charlemagne. His
biographers, as we know, having read him,

459
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,700
he's also a monastic entrepreneur.

460
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:10,860
I did say that this society
doesn't incur intellectual,

461
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,910
doesn't encourage intellectual
entrepreneurship in the
sense of coming up with

462
00:35:14,911 --> 00:35:15,744
new ideas.

463
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:20,810
But it's a very entrepreneurial
society in the sense of getting saints,

464
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:26,070
getting relics, establishing
monasteries, becoming popular.

465
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:31,100
It's a very competitive business
environment and Einhard as you've seen,

466
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,550
was very good at this.

467
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:37,260
He had several monasteries and
churches under his jurisdiction,

468
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,940
but his pet project,

469
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:44,500
not that far from Frankfurt on
the mine river is elegant stop.

470
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,240
Okay.

471
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,410
And it's an elegant stop that
eventually those relics of Saint Marcel,

472
00:35:52,411 --> 00:35:55,650
Linus and Peter come to rest.

473
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:57,903
Yeah,

474
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,160
nope. That the saints, Marcel,

475
00:36:00,161 --> 00:36:03,190
Linus and Peter were acquired from Italy,

476
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:08,790
just like the manuscripts because Italy
is where there are an awful lot of

477
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:12,700
saints from the Roman martyr period.

478
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:16,780
There are even more saints actually
in places like North Africa or Egypt,

479
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,220
but they're tough to get at cause
it's a long trip and they're Muslim.

480
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:22,871
Nevertheless,

481
00:36:22,871 --> 00:36:27,871
we know that lots of relics were liberated
to use a rather 19 seventy's term

482
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:34,840
from Muslim captivity liberated.

483
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:39,700
And of course it's not as if Einhard
in talking about what is called the

484
00:36:39,701 --> 00:36:43,840
translation of relics says,
uh,

485
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:48,340
that he bought them or that, you
know, he came by them quote honestly,

486
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:51,490
translation meaning here,
the movement,

487
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:54,670
the moving of the relics
from one place to another.

488
00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:00,820
Marcel,
Linus and Peter were buried in Rome,

489
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:05,560
uh, and uh, in a church

490
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,440
and Einhard's agents negotiate with this
dubious kind of character who maybe can

491
00:37:15,311 --> 00:37:17,080
get them some relics and maybe not,

492
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:21,700
and maybe it will require more money or
he's got to talk to a couple of guys.

493
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,380
And uh,
you know,

494
00:37:23,381 --> 00:37:27,010
it's this intrigue and
that's part of the story.

495
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,360
The implication is that Marcel,

496
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:32,590
Linus and Peter want to move.

497
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:36,310
They let their tombs be found.

498
00:37:36,311 --> 00:37:41,230
Remember that in looking for st to
it's too heavy to lift the altar up.

499
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:45,370
They can't do it. On the other
hand, with these saints, no problem.

500
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:49,910
And once they come to is elegance stop,

501
00:37:49,911 --> 00:37:54,070
they perform all these miracles
which shows they're happy.

502
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:58,150
They're sure they were stolen.
And in fact,

503
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,920
as Wickham remarks,

504
00:37:59,921 --> 00:38:04,921
and as you've read hell Dwin a competitor
of Einhard's had stolen some of Saint

505
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,100
Marcy Allina's and Einhard
got him to return it,

506
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:16,240
pressured him to return it,
and eventually healed when was disgraced.

507
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:19,600
And I can't remember if he's
executed or merely exiled,

508
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,660
but this is a tough business.

509
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,450
So in a 27, these relics, uh, um,

510
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:34,660
uh, get, uh, moved. Uh, let me
read you since this is in, uh,

511
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:39,550
in a part of the heart book that,
uh, um, that we didn't assign.

512
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,260
Let me just,
uh,

513
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:45,700
okay.

514
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,340
Yeah, it begins on page 70, 69 if
you're interested in following this.

515
00:38:49,341 --> 00:38:54,340
And they even have the itinerary of the
relics. So after a fast of three days,

516
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,031
they,

517
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:59,920
his emissaries traveled by night to
that place without any Roman citizens

518
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:03,630
noticing them.
Once in the Church of Saint Bertie's,

519
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:07,540
they first tried to open the altar under
which it was believed his holy body was

520
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:11,530
located, but the strenuous nature
of the job they had started foiled.

521
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:15,970
Their plan for the monument
was constructed of extremely
hard marble and easily

522
00:39:15,971 --> 00:39:19,330
resisted the bare hands of those.
Trying to open it. Therefore,

523
00:39:19,331 --> 00:39:23,050
they abandoned the tomb of that martyr
and descended to the tomb of the blessing.

524
00:39:23,051 --> 00:39:25,540
Marsal,
Linus and Peter there.

525
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:30,430
Once they had called on our Lord Jesus
Christ and adored the holy martyrs,

526
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:33,790
they were able to lift the
tombstone from its place,

527
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:38,510
covering the top of the [inaudible].
Then they take it,

528
00:39:38,511 --> 00:39:42,620
they wrap him in a, clean them
in a clean linen shroud. Uh,

529
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,990
um,
oh,

530
00:39:44,991 --> 00:39:49,100
they take just St Marsa [inaudible] and
they wrap him in a shroud and then they

531
00:39:49,101 --> 00:39:53,300
put the tombstone back in place quotes
so that no trace of the body's removal

532
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,560
would remain. But then just as
they're about to make their escape,

533
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:02,060
the Deacon one of this group
says, oh my God, we can't,

534
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:06,170
we can't leave without saying, Peter.
These two were companions in life.

535
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:08,230
We can't just take one
of these bodies were,

536
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:12,110
if we go back and take the other ones,
they go back and they,

537
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,300
they get the buses and adventure store.

538
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:19,310
But it's a sacred adventure. Uh, and, uh,

539
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:24,340
it involves the relics of people who
still have some say in where they want to

540
00:40:26,811 --> 00:40:31,010
be. The very special dead as
Peter Brown refers to them.

541
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:34,310
And what's very special about them is
that they're not exactly what you would

542
00:40:34,311 --> 00:40:38,950
normally call dead. They're
relics are very much, uh,

543
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:42,110
active.
Now.

544
00:40:42,111 --> 00:40:47,111
We read in the series of miracles
performed by the saints along with another

545
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:52,160
sank. They picked up Hermes,
uh, various medical cures.

546
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:55,760
Notice that these miracles,
unlike Gregory of tour,

547
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:59,360
are pretty exclusively in one
category. Greg, you have tour,

548
00:40:59,361 --> 00:41:03,290
has a lot of what might be called
scoffers punished miracles.

549
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,680
Somebody either tries to fake a miracle
and then as the victim of a real one or

550
00:41:09,171 --> 00:41:14,171
somebody tries to defy the
bishop or somebody doubts
the efficacy of the saints.

551
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:17,970
In this case,
most of these miracles,

552
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:22,520
almost all of them are
people with paralysis.

553
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:27,590
A disease of the bowels
are horrible sores. Um,

554
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:32,810
blindness. Um, you know, where to,

555
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:38,330
how great are these? I know you
could not put this down. Um, and,

556
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,800
and I hope you read it to your

557
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,263
mmm.

558
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,190
Molecular biology roommates,
uh,

559
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,810
just to show how great this is.

560
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:56,140
Yeah. This, uh,

561
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:01,660
I think I have this in the
wrong place anyway. Remember
the, uh, the curing of the,

562
00:42:01,661 --> 00:42:05,190
uh, uh, the angry humpback, uh, the,

563
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:10,210
these guys are carrying the relics two's
elegant star and they stopped to rest

564
00:42:10,871 --> 00:42:15,871
in a field and this angry peasant with
a pitchfork wants to taste them away.

565
00:42:16,091 --> 00:42:21,091
He also has a a humpback and they show
him the relics and say what they're doing

566
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:26,500
and he falls to his face in adoration.

567
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:31,710
He is cured of his afflictions and the
people of the village insist that the,

568
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:38,710
uh, emissaries stay with them,
have a kind of party all night,

569
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,800
bring other villagers in.
Um,

570
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,400
this is an interesting moment and I
mentioned it because here the piety of a

571
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:53,710
person like Einhard is the same
as the piety of the villagers.

572
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:59,550
The Carolingian renaissance is mostly
about an elite program to try to preserve

573
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:06,220
elite forms of knowledge. True. It
is an effort to educate the populace,

574
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:10,920
but that is probably the
least successful aspect of it.

575
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:16,040
Hands illiteracy rate in eight 75 was
hardly any greater than it had been in

576
00:43:16,331 --> 00:43:19,300
seven 75.
If you just do a statistical,

577
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:23,230
if you could do a statistical study,
and it wasn't very high,

578
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:28,420
but when it comes to the saints and
to the meaning of the supernatural,

579
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:30,000
okay.

580
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,250
In regular life,
uh,

581
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:35,520
the most learned,

582
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,500
people have the same attitude
as the villagers, uh,

583
00:43:40,501 --> 00:43:42,720
of this, uh, of this little story.

584
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:47,171
Okay?

585
00:43:47,171 --> 00:43:52,120
So we've reached the height of the
Carolingian Empire in two days,

586
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:55,300
and then, uh, our next
discussion will be about,

587
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,290
it's a precipitous and in many respects,
on fortunate decline.

588
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,670
That's what we'll talk about on Wednesday.
