1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,350
Good morning questions or problems.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,150
So today,

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,210
this week we begin to talk
more seriously about religion.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,940
And I remind you, we're talking
about Christianity in particular.

5
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:24,090
Uh, not because of, uh,
it's spiritual teachings.

6
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:24,924
Exactly.

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,230
But we're interested in the church as a
power and as a power dealing with allied

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,120
to,
but different from the Roman empire.

9
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,530
Everything changes with the
conversion of Constantine.

10
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,090
The church becomes first
tolerated than official.

11
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,100
And then finally,

12
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,230
the sole legal religion,
except for Judaism,

13
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,060
by order of the emperor
Theodosius the great in three 93.

14
00:00:59,220 --> 00:00:59,971
On the other hand,

15
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:04,971
in order to understand the church as a
power or the politics of this period,

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,640
we do have to understand the doctrine
because people fought over doctrine.

17
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:17,130
And as you've seen in the Jones reading,
they invoked the emperor's intervention.

18
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,550
This is not a question as might be what
you would expect today of a religion

19
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,320
split about various problems of Dogma
solving those problems itself or splitting

20
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:34,830
off into two factions.

21
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,850
The questions over the
relationship between the
persons of the Trinity Arianism

22
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,910
or the nature of priestly office.

23
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,980
Donatism provoked right from the
year of Constantine's conversion,

24
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:55,860
three 12 diversive fights.

25
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,230
And they're only the first.

26
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,240
I urge you to have fun with heresies.
Heresies are neat.

27
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,290
Professor Carlos Air is
teaching a freshman seminar.

28
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:10,650
I believe it's not called Basic Harris.
What is it?

29
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,950
Essential heresies. Yes. Even better. Um,

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and I don't know of any quiz shows where
you can demonstrate expertise on this,

31
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:23,400
but there ought to be,

32
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,790
or there ought to be sites on
the Internet where you know,

33
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,560
you can get a perfect score.
We're only touching the surface,

34
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,330
the proverbial tip of the
iceberg to use a cliche.

35
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:41,750
Um, there are lots of heresies, there's
a lot of division in the church. Um,

36
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,160
why not just say,
hey,

37
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,460
you believe that the father is superior
to the sun and I believe that they're

38
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,010
coequal. So what? Um,

39
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,920
that's so 2011, uh, or actually,

40
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,970
so 2000,

41
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,360
because we ought to be used to religious
doctrines having military or other

42
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:10,930
kinds of violent effects.

43
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,670
So I'm not going to have to justify for
you the fact that we're spending some

44
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:19,060
time on religion, I hope. But
if you do want me to just,

45
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:21,580
just remind me what the rationale is.

46
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:25,930
If your roommates are bothering you
because you're quizzing them about the

47
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:29,600
relation between the
persons of the Trinity, uh,

48
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,670
have them email me or set up an
appointment and I'll explain why,

49
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,470
why it's important. I, I'd be glad to
do this as a, as a public service, uh,

50
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:41,050
or you know, my Facebook page, whatever.

51
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:48,330
This is a situation created by Constantine
and we've seen Constantine's have

52
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:53,500
fairly long reign, uh,
transform the Roman Empire.

53
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,980
We emphasize the creation of the city of
Constantinople as a second capitol and

54
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,750
the favor shown towards the church so
that when Constantine died in three 37,

55
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,880
40%, 50%, a large
percentage of the empire,

56
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,310
its population was Christian
when he died,

57
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:22,630
the Roman empire seemed to have
been restored to its former glory.

58
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,670
That chapter that begins the reading
for today in Brown's world of late

59
00:04:27,671 --> 00:04:31,390
antiquity is entitled a world restored.

60
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:36,400
And he emphasizes this because
traditionally historians
saw the fourth century

61
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:41,730
through the lens of the sack of Rome in
for 10 as a period of decline in for 10

62
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,990
as we will discuss next week,

63
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:52,410
the city of Rome was pillaged and
partly burned by the Visigoths a,

64
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,070
I hate to use the word tribe,
but don't tell anybody.

65
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,610
A tribe of barbarians who had entered
the empire across the Danube in the

66
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:08,680
Balkans.
This was a cataclysmic event

67
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,230
and it ushered in successive
crises in the western empire,

68
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:17,230
the western empire that
would lead to its collapse.

69
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,940
This weakness of the western
empire is partly military,

70
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,140
partly political and partly internal,

71
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:31,141
a result of weaknesses of
instability culture and the economy.

72
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:37,111
It's always hard to say why empires
fall in some absolute sense,

73
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:42,730
even though we can see in retrospect
the signs of their decline.

74
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,020
One of the signs brown talks about in
the reading for today fairly extensively,

75
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:52,021
and that is the inequality
among the rich and poor grows.

76
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,990
On the other hand,
this is a period of inequality,

77
00:05:59,991 --> 00:06:02,330
but also social mobility.

78
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:07,820
There are a lot of paths
open to barbarians.

79
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,410
Even in this period.

80
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:14,411
Barbarians become important figures in
the Roman army and indeed the army is a

81
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,230
path of social upward social mobility,
a very important one.

82
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,153
Okay.

83
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,160
In general,
as I've said,

84
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:32,190
between three 37 and four 10 between
the death of Constantine and the sack of

85
00:06:32,471 --> 00:06:36,880
Rome, people did not see themselves
as living in a period of decline.

86
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:43,170
They did see themselves as living
in a period of real change,

87
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:49,200
the most dramatic of which was
the movement towards Christianity.

88
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,720
And the most dramatic example of that
movement is the reign of the emperor.

89
00:06:55,721 --> 00:07:00,100
Julian, I've given you a
handout that shows the emperors,

90
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,590
um,
of this period.

91
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:07,840
Notice that some of them rain in the east,
some in the west,

92
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,310
and then some usually
briefly reunify the empire.

93
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:18,030
We're in a transitional period ushered
in by Diocletian when the empire is

94
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:23,790
sometimes divided and sometimes not with
the death of Theodosius in three 95.

95
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,200
The second, third to last of
those emperors on the list.

96
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:35,560
He had been sole emperor for three years
with his death and the division of the

97
00:07:35,561 --> 00:07:40,240
empire between his son Oh
Noria ruling from Ravana,

98
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:45,300
the western capital now in what's now
northern Italy and Arcadia's ruling from

99
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,940
Constantinople.
From that point on,

100
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:53,941
we can really speak of two different
emperors and almost always there were two

101
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,900
emperors until the collapse of the
western empire in the late fifth century.

102
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,473
Okay.

103
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:10,260
Questions this point? Okay. So,

104
00:08:10,261 --> 00:08:15,120
um,
the reign of Julian the apostate

105
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:22,010
apostate because he was born
as a Christian and tried
to restore the traditional

106
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,230
Roman religion, three 62, three 63.

107
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,160
His failure shows the weakness of what
we can call paganism or tradition Roman

108
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,660
traditional Roman religion.
By this time,

109
00:08:39,661 --> 00:08:43,560
Christianity was too big to rollback.

110
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,940
Julian tried,
he tried to reestablish the temples.

111
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:52,980
He tried to reestablish the
vigor of the cults of the Gods.

112
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,990
He was an worshiper of
many different gods,

113
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,980
but he also was a philosopher.
He is a wonderful,

114
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:06,780
if sad example of an
intellectual in power.

115
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,950
Very few of these emperors were,
um,

116
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,830
what would be called intellectual
in the sense, I mean,

117
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,870
many of them were cultivated,
you know,

118
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,490
they liked the equivalent of
classical music and art. But,

119
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,500
um,
Marcus,

120
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:25,980
so realias is a philosopher and Julian
at least as a would be philosopher.

121
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,650
He had a beard. He studied in Athens. Um,

122
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:36,350
he was very unsuccessful though
people did not follow his doctrines.

123
00:09:36,351 --> 00:09:39,090
He was a very good military leader.
His troops,

124
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,420
when he was on the Orion frontier
in what's now France and Germany,

125
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,580
uh, were extremely loyal
to him. But as emperor, uh,

126
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:54,180
not only did the church oppose him,
but, uh, many of his own followers did.

127
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:58,690
He died in an unsuccessful
campaign against the Persians, uh,

128
00:09:58,691 --> 00:10:03,660
perhaps murdered, uh,
unclear, but with his defeat,

129
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,430
uh, the, um,

130
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:12,260
the end of civic polytheism
of that traditional urban
upper class worship of the

131
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:18,060
Olympian gods was in permanent.
It clips

132
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:25,250
the decree of the Emperor Theodosius
that I referred to already have three 93

133
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,000
proclaiming Christianity.

134
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:32,010
The only legal religion except for a
small space allowed for Judaism did not

135
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:37,821
really mean that everybody in the
empire was a practicing Christian.

136
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,160
The two groups that would be outside of
that definition are the people of the

137
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:45,960
country side,

138
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:51,530
the very large number of people who
would either continue their traditional

139
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:52,710
polytheistic,

140
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:57,711
local wardship of local gods or
assimilate that worship to Christianity.

141
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:04,200
We're going to be talking a lot about
saints in a couple of weeks on some

142
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:08,550
obvious level, which I don't
want to exaggerate, but
which is nevertheless there.

143
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,900
The saints, and there are many
of them. They are holy figures.

144
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:16,800
They're not gods, but they're
more powerful than human beings.

145
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,920
That saints are a kind of substitute
for polytheism and we'll talk about why

146
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,110
that and how that works.

147
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:30,470
The other class that tended to resist
Christianity to the last was the very

148
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,780
upper stratum of the
Roman senatorial elite.

149
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:38,990
The people who were the most cultivated
adherence of the traditional religion

150
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,370
and philosophers, people who
followed Plato, for example,

151
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,630
known as the Platonists,

152
00:11:45,631 --> 00:11:49,800
and we're going to come to them because
they're very important for Augustine's

153
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,880
confessions.

154
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,040
Constantine was succeeded by his
sons after the two of the sons died.

155
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:02,440
Constantness ruled alone.
Uh,

156
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,250
constantness assured that he would rule
alone by massacring most of his family.

157
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:08,110
Julian was one of only two,

158
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:12,910
but he allowed to survive and he shouldn't
have because Julian overthrew him. Um,

159
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,840
you know, this is, um, this
is brass knuckle politics.

160
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:21,841
I guess the chief preoccupations of these
rulers of the fourth century were the

161
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:28,321
same as we when we started out the
Persian threat on the eastern frontier,

162
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,740
the barbarian threat on the Rhine,

163
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,613
Deb,
Danube frontier.

164
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:40,830
But there are also other problems that
the third century emperor had not faced.

165
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,870
And knees are religious problems.
Uh,

166
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:52,050
they are in particular
Arianism and donatism.

167
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:57,610
And we've seen a little bit about these
from the reading about Constantine,

168
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,330
uh, for the first assignment.
But let's go over this.

169
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,930
Arianism please remember that with a,

170
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:08,770
why this has it takes on a
completely different meaning. Okay.

171
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:13,771
Arian is this discredited racial
theory identified but not invented by,

172
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:15,310
uh,

173
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:20,260
Nazi-ism Arion with an I
is a follower of areas.

174
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,320
Areas was a priest from Alexandria
influenced by ideas from Plato about the

175
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,360
absolute and unknowable nature of God.

176
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,980
Any religion, but Christianity
in particular has a problem.

177
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:41,010
If you make God to absolute
and unapproachable than
why does he care about us?

178
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,460
If you make him too approachable,

179
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:51,040
then how is he powerful
enough to transcend the world?

180
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,920
Platonism

181
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,800
that is the philosophy of followers of
Plato emphasizes the absolute emphasizes

182
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:09,540
the inferiority of what we
can understand with our eyes,

183
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:14,380
with our other senses,
and the superiority of the spiritual.

184
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:20,860
The reason the spiritual is superior
to the material in Platonism and in

185
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:26,490
Buddhism and in many other philosophies
is that the material is more mortal,

186
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:32,350
rots, dies, passes away.

187
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:38,410
The problem for many people,
not just people in the modern world,

188
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,440
is that the material is right here
and the spiritual is kind of hard to

189
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,080
apprehend or prove.

190
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:53,550
But most people who think about it most
of the time in history of great that the

191
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:57,320
spiritual is superior
because it is in mortal.

192
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,440
Therefore,

193
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:05,470
those who emphasize the spiritual
emphasize this kind of unknowability,

194
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,740
the uh,
mystery,

195
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:15,100
the not easy to apprehend
ness of the super natural

196
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:21,140
for Platonists and for Ariens.

197
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,950
God was placed infinitely high above us.
Now,

198
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:28,820
Christianity has as its great
strength in many respects.

199
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:31,190
Just speaking of kind
of the power of ideas,

200
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,520
the fact that God becomes
man Christ is incarnated,

201
00:15:36,861 --> 00:15:39,410
that means he becomes flesh.

202
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:44,630
This is not a common religious idea.

203
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:49,160
Mohammed is not gone.
He is a messenger.

204
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,400
In Judaism,
there are profits,

205
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:57,350
but they are not made of
the same substance as God.

206
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:02,830
There are religions in which a holy
man becomes kind of supernatural,

207
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,630
a lot of religions of the east,
but in Christianity,

208
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,330
Christ is God.

209
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:16,730
God is manifested in three forms.
The Trinity,

210
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,390
the father, the son, and the Holy Ghost.

211
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,200
Arianism says that Christ is essentially
different from God the father in some

212
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:35,290
fundamental way that Christ was created
by God as a way of interacting with the

213
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:39,134
world.

214
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:44,890
If you have studied Plato or were in ds
and remember some of those key concepts

215
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,900
in Platonism, there's the one
and then there's the demiurge.

216
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,680
The demiurge is this hard
working guy or hardworking force,

217
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:58,670
whatever you want to call
it, who interacts between
the divine and the material.

218
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:03,470
He's divine. All right, but he creates
things. He's the one who is out there.

219
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,160
Uh,

220
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,160
I'm creating the spirit as well as matter
creating the world and the universe.

221
00:17:10,131 --> 00:17:13,670
Indeed, as we know it
well, the one is at rest.

222
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,580
So similarly in Arianism,

223
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:20,300
Christ is the one who's
intervening on earth,

224
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:24,350
indeed sacrificing himself
for humanity. Um, God,

225
00:17:24,351 --> 00:17:28,010
the father remains in heaven.
This is not what Christianity,

226
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,750
most of the time teachers,

227
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,680
Christianity or the Orthodox or Catholic
view is that Christ and God are of the

228
00:17:38,241 --> 00:17:40,250
same substance.

229
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,170
The Aryans,
therefore,

230
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,530
our subordination lists they
subordinate Christ to God.

231
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,550
Oh, convenient way of remembering
them is their tag line.

232
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,420
There was a time when Christ was not

233
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,110
okay.

234
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,840
It's a kind of supernatural
metaphysical time,

235
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,270
but God made Christ.

236
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:09,620
This goes against the
creed enacted at Nicea,

237
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:14,650
which to this day is the standard
confession of faith of Christian

238
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:20,750
denominations. The Nicene
creed as it is known, uh,

239
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:25,580
says that all persons of
the trinity are eternal.

240
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,840
Coeternal God did not create Christ.

241
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,300
Now,

242
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:37,160
Arianism appealed to people partly
because they worried about the trinity.

243
00:18:37,161 --> 00:18:41,720
The trinity could be denounced by Anti
Christians as actually three gods.

244
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:48,380
Um, how could God be both
one and three? Uh, also,

245
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,360
people who worried about
the physicality of Christ,

246
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,690
Christ becomes flesh, dies, suffers.

247
00:18:56,691 --> 00:19:00,530
How can God be God if he dies and suffers?

248
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:07,450
Arianism you have to take seriously as
something that is not just troubling.

249
00:19:08,301 --> 00:19:13,301
The intellectuals is not just something
for people with a lot of time and

250
00:19:13,551 --> 00:19:17,720
leisure on their hands.
It's a not for philosophy majors.

251
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,300
It's not even for
religious studies majors.

252
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,350
It's not even for the Roman
equivalent of college graduates.

253
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,290
The barbarians and I,
I,

254
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:31,430
I deliberately avoid calling
them the German barbarians.

255
00:19:31,431 --> 00:19:36,320
But the first barbarians to
convert to this religion were, um,

256
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:40,490
more or less. And as time goes
on, historians emphasize less,

257
00:19:40,491 --> 00:19:43,400
but more or less Germanic tribes,

258
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:48,890
the missionaries who converted them
work Ariens in the mid fourth century,

259
00:19:50,061 --> 00:19:53,630
which is the high tide of
Arianism in the Roman Empire.

260
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:59,260
When the German tribes or the barbarian
tribes entered the empire beginning in

261
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:02,610
the three,
seven days area,

262
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,140
aneurysm was all but
over within the empire,

263
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:12,800
the Council of Nicea in
the three twenties. And,

264
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,360
uh,
uh,

265
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,560
the council of Constantinople in 381,

266
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:23,270
pretty much a defined
area aneurysm as a heresy.

267
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:28,460
And by three 81,
it was on the run in the empire.

268
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,290
But ironically,

269
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:35,410
the new rulers of the West would be
mostly Ariens well into the fifth and in

270
00:20:38,241 --> 00:20:40,840
some cases,
sixth centuries.

271
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:46,820
Donatism or what the donotist,
the Donna tests here,

272
00:20:46,821 --> 00:20:50,380
we're not dealing with doctrine
or metaphysical questions
of the relationship of

273
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:53,320
the persons of the trinity.
We're dealing with

274
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,600
the nature of the priesthood,
hence the nature of the church.

275
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,520
Uh,
it's a question of the office or the man.

276
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:09,190
If it turns out that I do not have a phd
from University of California Berkeley

277
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:15,140
or indeed that I am an imposter,
that uh,

278
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,920
somehow I tricked the Yale computer,

279
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:23,130
haven't been showing up here teaching
history to 10 and I'm just some random

280
00:21:23,621 --> 00:21:24,910
guy,
you know,

281
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:29,940
like the guy who is obsessed with the
New York City transit and has gotten

282
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:33,040
various passes to get into, uh, you know,

283
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:37,840
drive trains and uh, um, maintenance
yards and stuff like that.

284
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:42,700
If I turn out to be like that, you will
nevertheless get credit for this course,

285
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,130
I assure you.
Um,

286
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:53,220
because Yale as a official body is the
one who grants your degree gives you

287
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:02,290
credits and they were
responsible for hiring me.

288
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:05,980
So if I've imposed a fraud on,
then you nevertheless received credit.

289
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,930
You don't have to do a background
search of me. You don't have to,

290
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:14,500
you know,
find out about how many pets I have or my,

291
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,640
my credit status or my mortgage
because you rely on Yale to do that.

292
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,740
Think of this then,
in terms of the priesthood,

293
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:30,090
if it turns out that the priest is
not a nice guy and alas that happens,

294
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:33,490
or a sinner

295
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:39,370
or what the donotist really cared about
was he had buckled under threat of

296
00:22:39,371 --> 00:22:44,230
torture or the reality of tortured during
the persecutions of Diocletian and had

297
00:22:44,231 --> 00:22:49,231
say a burn the scripture
or renounced Christianity.

298
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,410
If you're a priest is bad.

299
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,710
Is your baby baptized?
That's what donatism is about.

300
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:03,490
And donatism answers, no, no.

301
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,130
It depends on the virtue of the officiant.

302
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:11,460
You can't have a priest who was what they
called a Prady tour trolley tours and

303
00:23:12,611 --> 00:23:15,370
interesting Latin word,
Tra d I t.

304
00:23:15,371 --> 00:23:20,371
O r because it means both tradition or
it is the root of the word tradition,

305
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,790
but also of traitor.

306
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:26,860
It's the handing down or
handing over of something,

307
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,780
the giving up of something. So one
can speak of the handing down of, uh,

308
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,950
our family has cranberry sauce with
slivered almonds. That's our tradition.

309
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,370
Or handing over state secrets,

310
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,750
military strategy or the
scripture to the authorities.

311
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:49,170
But Donna tits accused priests who
had more, they believed had, uh,

312
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:54,710
capitulated to Roman persecute Toral
pressure in the last years of Diocletian,

313
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,760
they branded them as traders and they
said that they could not form legitimate

314
00:23:58,761 --> 00:24:03,080
sacraments. Therefore, you in North
Africa where the donotist were strong,

315
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:08,240
you as an ordinary Christian had better
do a background check on your priest

316
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,670
because your marriage is a legitimate,
your baby is going to hell. Uh,

317
00:24:13,671 --> 00:24:14,890
your,
uh,

318
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:19,910
whole participation in the church is as
it were short circuited by this defect.

319
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,730
Worse than that,
supposing your priest is just fine.

320
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:27,680
In fact,
supposing it's three 30,

321
00:24:27,681 --> 00:24:32,030
Aad and your priest wasn't even
born during the reign of Diocletian,

322
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,310
but the guy who consecrated him,

323
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:39,311
the Bishop who anointed him was a trolley
tour or maybe that bishop was not,

324
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:44,710
but he was anointed. It's like
Christmas tree lights. Um,

325
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:49,970
at least the Christmas tree lights that
I have, the kind of analog ones, uh,

326
00:24:49,971 --> 00:24:53,630
you know, their little bulbs and
if one of them goes, the whole,

327
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,170
um,
string goes.

328
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,930
If one is defective,

329
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,830
the proverbial bad apple
rotting out the entire barrel.

330
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:08,060
But the problem with that is that you
can't organize a church on that basis.

331
00:25:08,061 --> 00:25:13,061
You can't organize a body spread from
one corner of the world to another unless

332
00:25:13,941 --> 00:25:18,260
you believe that the church will
guarantee the sanctity of the individual

333
00:25:18,261 --> 00:25:20,150
minister,
the office.

334
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:24,950
The fact that the guy is a priest has to
be more important than the man or else

335
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:29,870
you can only have local communities.
You can only trust if you're a donotist,

336
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:34,930
somebody you grew up with and a community
stable enough for your confident of

337
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:36,800
the ancestry.

338
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:42,070
Donatism lends itself to
what we call sectarianism.

339
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,320
A sect is a small,

340
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,770
tightly a cohesive group.

341
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:53,900
It does not lend itself to a
church that is universal, big,

342
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,250
massive.

343
00:25:55,250 --> 00:26:00,250
And it also doubts that the church itself
has the power to overcome the defects

344
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:06,150
of its members.
Uh,

345
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:09,140
now mannequins are not exactly a heresy,

346
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,770
but they appear in the confessions
and they're very important.

347
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,070
So since we're doing a doctrinal ideas,

348
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:21,490
mannequin ism is a teaching about good
and evil that can be applied to other

349
00:26:22,011 --> 00:26:23,780
religions.
Besides Christianity.

350
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:31,060
Mannequin in basically says that
good and evil have a real existence.

351
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:37,850
There is a war in the universe
between a good God and an evil one,

352
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,320
and this may be applied
outside of Christianity.

353
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:47,040
We're within Christianity and quit
within Christianity, but evil.

354
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:52,041
God is the devil or according to the
mannequins of this period that Augustine

355
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:54,390
for a while joined,

356
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:55,870
okay.

357
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,340
The God of the Old Testament.

358
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,030
Jehovah is the evil God and
the God of the New Testament.

359
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:05,610
The Christian God is the good one to Hova.

360
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,370
Jehovah is the one who
smiles a lot of people.

361
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:14,150
Jehovah is the Creator God because the
mannequins believed that matter is evil

362
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,720
and is the source of evil.
Spirit is good.

363
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,660
The Christian God created spirit.

364
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,980
Human beings are imprisoned in the body
and they have to figure out a way to

365
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:28,380
liberate themselves from
the Dominion of the,

366
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,373
uh,

367
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,330
evil God.
Vegetarianism for a start,

368
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,850
avoiding flush.
MMM.

369
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,540
But Salvation means casting off the flush.

370
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,580
Okay.

371
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,410
How is this different from Christianity?
I'm,

372
00:27:47,411 --> 00:27:49,750
doesn't this sound to
you like regular old,

373
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,520
okay.

374
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,770
Christianity.
Mistrust of the flesh,

375
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,323
okay.

376
00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:01,430
The devil is identified with
sexual desire or physicality.

377
00:28:02,671 --> 00:28:07,610
Generally, mannequin ism is very
useful as an explanation of evil.

378
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,110
You know, this may not be something
that keeps you up at night,

379
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:15,140
but it will at some point a
intermittently where does evil come from?

380
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:18,150
Why is there so much evil in the world?

381
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,990
Why if God is good,
is there evil in the world?

382
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,030
Sure. Some of that may just be
to test you. You know, uh, uh,

383
00:28:30,031 --> 00:28:33,240
you lose your job or your business fails,
but you'll get a better one.

384
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:39,920
But that's not the same
as horrible infant birth,

385
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,820
uh,
uh,

386
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:47,330
disabilities or the death of people by
starvation in the thousands or any of the

387
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:51,570
payment, you know, choose your
evil thing. Why does this happen?

388
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,460
One explanation is that God didn't
cause it. There's another guy.

389
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,970
What's the problem with
that? I mean, why, why,

390
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:02,040
why is mannequin is I'm not a bigger,
I mean in a way it is, but you know,

391
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:05,730
you will travel far to meet anyone
who says they're a mannequin.

392
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,440
Yeah. First of all, then God's not
all powerful. There's the years. Uh,

393
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,610
and so then how is he gone?

394
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:24,320
And then instinctively, I mean, what's
another problem may be with him?

395
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,160
I could say so what? God is limited,
you know, he's, he's trying.

396
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,713
Okay.

397
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:38,350
Anybody else have a sense of the moral
problem of saying the devil made me do it

398
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,160
takes

399
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,690
away response, individual responsibility.
I didn't keep those investors.

400
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:50,740
The devil cheated them.
Alright, I didn't, uh, um,

401
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:54,970
mug that uh, uh, as style
student, the devil did.

402
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:00,970
Um, anyway, this is a debate
not asking you to take sides,

403
00:30:00,971 --> 00:30:03,110
but notice in the confessions,
uh,

404
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,690
the attitude of Augustine towards
his Manichaean experience. So,

405
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,833
uh,

406
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:13,920
the fourth century is a time of ideas
circulating around as Christianity starts

407
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:17,050
to define itself.

408
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:21,880
This would merely be a chapter
of the history of ideas where it,

409
00:30:21,881 --> 00:30:26,881
not that the Roman emperors had to
intervene to settle many of these issues.

410
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,820
So just forgive me if
I'm beating a dead horse,

411
00:30:33,821 --> 00:30:38,140
but heresy is important because of its
impact in shaping the church through

412
00:30:38,141 --> 00:30:43,141
controversy and because it fell to the
emperor to try to resolve heresy and bus

413
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:51,100
marks the beginning of a merger of church
and state in a way that will become

414
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:53,710
characteristic of the entire middle ages.

415
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:59,940
The other thing to remark is that the
emperor did not have a lot of success with

416
00:31:01,331 --> 00:31:02,680
this almost ever.

417
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:08,650
It's very frustrating for an emperor
who can get someone killed immediately.

418
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,170
All he's gotta do is say,
um,

419
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:16,700
you dropped that larks tongue pie,
uh,

420
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,980
take them away and kill him.

421
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:23,920
But he can't seem to do this with
heretics partly cause hair. It takes love,

422
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:28,060
persecution. It just
tough in this thing. Um,

423
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,390
so you have,
um,

424
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:36,870
the prefect of Africa writing to Jones
and saying that this bishop in North

425
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:38,160
Africa,

426
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:43,160
Kalien has been attacked as a trodded
tor and Constantine does what emperors

427
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,920
usually do. They appoint local
judges as experts. They say,

428
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:53,200
go and have a hearing and find out what's
going on and make a recommendation to

429
00:31:53,201 --> 00:31:55,540
me,
oh,

430
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:58,300
he makes a recommendation telling the
donnas just to go home and shut up.

431
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:02,170
They don't, they appeal to
the emperor. The emperor says,

432
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,590
go home and shut up.
And they don't,

433
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,710
they define the emperor himself.

434
00:32:08,711 --> 00:32:12,640
They go back to North Africa and they
continue preaching against traitors.

435
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:17,200
Constantine.
Why does he intervene?

436
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:22,180
Why didn't he just say the hell with you?
Pretty literally,

437
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:27,540
or it's a matter of opinion or this
doesn't get at the core of the faith.

438
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:33,250
Yeah.
He's afraid of upsetting God.

439
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:36,460
Remember we said that Constantine
was not much of a philosopher,

440
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:38,020
not much of a contemplative.

441
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,100
He had won a battle with the favor of
the Christian God. Now the Christian God,

442
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,290
he was the companion of the Christian God.
The Christian God has him by the hand.

443
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:53,420
If the church starts dissolving
into quarreling factions,

444
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,160
God is going to be angry
and his favor will cease.

445
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,480
We have to take the rulers anxiety
about religious unity seriously.

446
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:09,650
So he changes his policy several times.

447
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:14,420
Remember we're talking about a guy who
was able to feed defeat all his military

448
00:33:14,421 --> 00:33:18,860
rivals. Scentless sinneas, you know,
running through Asia minor, caught him,

449
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:23,000
executed him a man of tremendous
capabilities. Nevertheless,

450
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:27,740
dealing with these peasants
and poor towns people and just,

451
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:29,630
you know,
from his point of view,

452
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:33,260
riff Raff who were strong in north Africa.

453
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:37,130
He couldn't get them to obey him.

454
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,440
Sometimes he tried compromise,
then persecution,

455
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:48,110
then just saying, nobody can discuss
this and none of this worked.

456
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:54,530
Not only did this not work,
but now Arianism came to preoccupy him.

457
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:00,380
And you can see in his letters,
there's a kind of, oh, em, gee,

458
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:04,400
I didn't realize what I was
signing up for tone to it.

459
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:10,640
At first, he was anti Arion
pretty totally. He saw it
as a denial of Christianity.

460
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,080
If Christianity,
by its very name is that Christ is God,

461
00:34:15,081 --> 00:34:20,060
then Erin Ism would seem to be, uh,
antithetical to that fundamental thing.

462
00:34:20,061 --> 00:34:23,280
So after defeating, uh, listen,

463
00:34:23,281 --> 00:34:27,050
he says he learned more about Arianism,
which was strong in the east.

464
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,120
And his first reaction was kind of maybe
your reaction or certainly the reaction

465
00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:36,440
of anybody who is more interested
in, you know, power politics,

466
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,260
this world,
he considered it over subtle,

467
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:43,520
philosophical and ultimately trivial,

468
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:50,580
but he couldn't get rid of it.
He couldn't get rid of it.

469
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:53,250
And now instead of appointing judges,

470
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,270
he summoned a council of
the bishops of the empire,

471
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,840
what later would be called
an ecumenical council.

472
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,970
Ecumenical meaning worldwide,

473
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:08,290
a universal council which met
in the city of Nicea across the,

474
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:15,660
not right across the boss
for us, but more or less, um,

475
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:21,450
uh, uh, uh,

476
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:25,170
more or less in the
western part of Asia Minor.

477
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:32,330
And it met in three 25 at
this first ecumenical council.

478
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,620
The last Ecumenical Council, the Catholic
Church by the way, was in the 1960s.

479
00:35:37,621 --> 00:35:42,190
The early 1960s, um, under, uh,

480
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,073
Pope John.

481
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,740
Okay.

482
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:50,400
At this ecumenical council was summoned
by the emperor and the emperor,

483
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:51,943
uh,

484
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:57,120
was in the room and in a
certain respects presided,

485
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:01,530
intervened, took sides. He was
very deferential to the bishops.

486
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:05,940
He is not a bishop after all.
He is not a priest.

487
00:36:05,941 --> 00:36:10,860
He does not have the sacramental orders.
But nevertheless,

488
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:15,980
he was or attempted to be the boss of
this conference and it came up with a

489
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:21,060
formula,
a definition of the creed,

490
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,010
what every Christian must believe,

491
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:28,460
saying that God and Christ are of the
same essence but different persons,

492
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:36,060
God and Christ and the Holy
Ghost who is not really an issue.

493
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:39,900
Yet there will be a heresy
involving the holy ghost,

494
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,240
but not until the end of the course.

495
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:47,160
They are the same essence
but different persons. Haim,

496
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:51,990
same essence.
The Greek word is homoousios.

497
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:05,310
Christ was begun by the
father but not made by him.

498
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:14,210
That's a tough one.
That's a tough one.

499
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,900
He was begat and by the father,
but not in time.

500
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,060
There wasn't sort of like,

501
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,580
uh,
uh,

502
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,670
three minutes after creation.

503
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,970
The someone wants to go out
and see what that noise is

504
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,860
or is it coming from
outside and we're hopeless?

505
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:41,490
No, it's okay. Thank you.

506
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,570
Areas gave a kind of equivocal
acceptance of this arrangement,

507
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:56,610
but the bishop of Alexandria refused
to accept areas back into communion.

508
00:37:56,611 --> 00:38:01,230
In other words,
the Nicene creed defined orthodoxy,

509
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:06,740
but fighting raged for about 50 years
over the relationship between Christ and

510
00:38:08,101 --> 00:38:08,970
God.
The father,

511
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:13,110
Constantine kept on
changing his mind again.

512
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,970
The poor guy only wanted unity.

513
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,870
He wanted this to go away
so that God would favor him.

514
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,740
Uh, he died. I'm more or less an area.

515
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:31,130
He came to believe that the area
in moderate position was the best.

516
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:35,130
Uh, this is partly because of
the absolute and trends gents,

517
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:37,990
the Bishop of Alexandria,
the Archbishop of Alexandria.

518
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:42,790
Athanasius Athanasia's
would then later be a saint,

519
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,480
uh, uh, considered the upholder of

520
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,070
the Orthodox line.

521
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,390
So I'm a constant.

522
00:38:55,391 --> 00:39:00,391
Constantine was baptized just
before he died in this era.

523
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:05,750
Usually baptism was supposed to
mean that you embraced Christianity.

524
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:06,763
Totally.

525
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:15,010
It's Augustine particularly who's
responsible for infant baptism.

526
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,600
Infant baptism then means baptism.
You entered the Christian community,

527
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,460
but for sure you're going to sin.

528
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,880
The understanding in the three thirties
was more as a baptized Christian.

529
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,650
I am no longer a center.

530
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:36,800
So if you were in an office, like constant
team where you are shedding blood,

531
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,890
giving judgments,
leading troops,

532
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:45,440
you would wait until your deathbed
moment before getting baptized.

533
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:50,830
So he would be baptized on his
deathbed and by an area priest. Um,

534
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,370
what's the danger of this?

535
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:58,560
Paranthetically Diane?
Baptize,

536
00:39:58,570 --> 00:39:59,090
right?

537
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:04,090
The proverbial bus hitting you on the
street or sudden death of another sword.

538
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,820
And, um, we're going to talk,

539
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:12,860
I'm sure this is going to be one of the
things you will remember with pleasure,

540
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:17,870
but briefly about sin.
Why people sin.

541
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,870
Um, and, uh, the,

542
00:40:23,871 --> 00:40:28,790
um, uh, interaction of good
and evil in human beings.

543
00:40:28,791 --> 00:40:30,560
Indeed, we're going to start
very soon because it's,

544
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,380
it's all over the confessions.

545
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:39,460
Let me give you a little bit of
orientation towards the confessions. Uh,

546
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,970
uh, which we, uh, I hope you
will read as much as possible.

547
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,010
Why are we reading this very
personal and autobiographical work?

548
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,770
Um, first of all, it is, you know, it
is a classic. How many of you mask?

549
00:40:56,771 --> 00:41:01,330
I've already read it.
Okay. Certain number.

550
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:03,603
Um,

551
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,120
it is an autobiography
which makes it very unusual.

552
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:14,310
It's an intimate or about, it's not just
highlights of my career or my resume.

553
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:20,100
He talks about anxieties, desires, doubts.

554
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:25,610
It is therefore a portrait of the
mentality of a thinking person.

555
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:29,070
In the ancient world.

556
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:34,100
We get a better idea of the life
of the then from many other,

557
00:41:35,391 --> 00:41:38,240
most other,
almost any other source.

558
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:44,620
It shows the fluidity of the religious
scene and the late Roman empire.

559
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:49,700
His father is a pagan.
His mother is a Christian.

560
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:55,210
He is first a Platonist
sort of than a mannequin.

561
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:00,350
Been a Christian Platonist and
then a more fervent Christian.

562
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,920
So it shows some of the religious and
philosophical options of this era.

563
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,310
In doing so,

564
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:16,340
we do come across important and lasting
ideas of the Western tradition about

565
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,320
evil, sin, body and soul.

566
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:30,470
We also are looking at the impact of
Christianity on the Roman Empire and the

567
00:42:30,811 --> 00:42:34,500
relationship between Christianity
and classical culture.

568
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:38,183
Yeah,

569
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,000
some things to keep in mind
as you're reading this,

570
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:47,010
the book is uniquely self revealing
for its time. On the other hand,

571
00:42:47,011 --> 00:42:51,660
it doesn't tell us a lot of
stuff we'd like to know more.

572
00:42:51,661 --> 00:42:56,661
Time is spent going over a youthful
prank involving stealing pairs from an

573
00:42:57,781 --> 00:43:01,650
orchard.
Then on Augustine's concubine,

574
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,410
concubine, a woman that you're not
married to who some sort of like a,

575
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:11,400
a subordinate, uh, with whom you had
a sexual relation. And indeed, uh,

576
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,110
um, uh, he would have a child

577
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:18,050
pairs book too towards the end.

578
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:25,690
Uh, play a lot of attention to that.
Uh, the book has a lot of prayers,

579
00:43:25,691 --> 00:43:30,430
quotations from scriptures very biblically
and fuse dump would be be put off by

580
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:34,900
that because the book is a confession.
Confession has two meanings in this era.

581
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:39,940
One is it's meaning. Now that way
we usually use it confession of sin,

582
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:44,410
but it's also a confession of praise.
I confess God,

583
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:48,730
meaning I acknowledge God's
power and I praise him.

584
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:55,770
Uh, finally I just want to, uh,

585
00:43:55,970 --> 00:44:00,970
go over Platonists because he both admires
the Platonists fields that they saved

586
00:44:02,571 --> 00:44:06,750
him from the mannequins, uh, but
ultimately comes to doubt them.

587
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:12,050
This is described fairly well in Brown,
beginning on page 73.

588
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:12,950
Um,

589
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:17,810
but let me just take a few
minutes to discuss this.

590
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:21,890
Platonism or neoplatonism.
It's the same thing.

591
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:27,050
Neoplatonism is a kind
of religious Platonism.

592
00:44:27,051 --> 00:44:32,051
It differs from Plato and his dialogues
by a little bit more mystical in the

593
00:44:34,261 --> 00:44:39,261
sense of focused on the one trying to
apprehend the one and less interested in,

594
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,180
um, the city, the state,

595
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:49,290
or the kinds of worldly
problems that Plato dealt with.

596
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:55,910
Platonism asserts the superiority of the
spirit and the inferiority of matter.

597
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,120
But unlike Manichaean Isam,

598
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:05,840
which basically says that matter is evil
and spirit is good for the Platonists,

599
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:10,920
everything is good,
everything is good,

600
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,170
but there are inferior good.

601
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:19,490
So matter is not evil in itself.
It's just inferior.

602
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:25,770
We're evil comes from is the preference
of the inferior to the superior,

603
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,920
the preference of the material
manifestation to the spiritual.

604
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,320
So to take the most famous example,

605
00:45:36,321 --> 00:45:38,150
because we still have
this little funny vestige,

606
00:45:38,151 --> 00:45:40,940
you'll notion of so called platonic love,

607
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:47,810
love of a sexual sort is
not evil in Platonism.

608
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:54,310
What is evil is assuming that that's
all there is and not referring it to a

609
00:45:56,061 --> 00:46:01,010
higher spiritual nonmaterial kind of love.

610
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:07,400
Wealth is not bad,

611
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,690
but the preference of wealth
over spiritual things is bad.

612
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:18,530
Here again, as we spoke at
the beginning of the lecture,

613
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:23,060
it's important to emphasize
the superiority of the
spiritual over the material

614
00:46:23,061 --> 00:46:24,560
because the spiritual is eternal.

615
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,600
Evil comes from not realizing
the superiority of the
material, of the spiritual,

616
00:46:29,601 --> 00:46:33,890
excuse me, or not acting on it, acting
as if the material is all there is

617
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:37,710
in Platonism.

618
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:42,711
Evil is a kind of falling away or a
turning of your vision to evoke the cave

619
00:46:43,741 --> 00:46:44,574
metaphor.

620
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:49,440
It is a misperception and it's
the result of poor education.

621
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:55,440
If you educate people to the
superiority of the spiritual,

622
00:46:55,441 --> 00:47:00,240
they will throw off
their evil ways.

623
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:04,830
The reason people
misbehave kill each other,

624
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,260
oppress each other,

625
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,300
is that they don't know any better.
And if you teach them,

626
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:14,603
they'll reform.

627
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,530
Keep that in mind as we turn tow.
Augustine, see what he thinks about it.

628
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,740
He adores the Platonists
because they were intellectuals.

629
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,990
He admires them because rescued him from
the trap of Manichaean dualism that is

630
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,990
good versus evil.
Just simple forces.

631
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,570
Platonism is an explanation of evil,

632
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:41,590
but for all Guston it's not
a sufficient explanation.

633
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:45,940
And that will form part of the
subject matter of our next talk.

634
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,670
So I'll see you on Wednesday.
Oh,

635
00:47:48,671 --> 00:47:51,670
and Wednesday you'll get the
paper topics for the first paper,

636
00:47:51,671 --> 00:47:53,740
which is due October 10 19.
