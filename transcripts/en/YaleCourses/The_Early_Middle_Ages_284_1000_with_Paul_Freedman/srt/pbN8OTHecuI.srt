1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,790
We um,

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,270
are starting to use primary sources
for our understanding of the historical

3
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:14,340
periods under discussion,
primary sources,

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,160
writings by people who lived at the time.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,850
And as with all such sources,

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,960
the great advantage is vividness,
immediacy.

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,980
The people lived through it
and the problem is distance
from us and strangeness

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,630
Pro Copious and Gregory of tour who
will be starting out with next week are

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,150
varied. Different writers per copious, uh,

10
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,900
much more conscious of style.
A lay man,

11
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,570
somebody operating within
the classical tradition, uh,

12
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:58,680
Gregory of tour, certainly, uh,

13
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,880
uh,

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,880
a person for whom style is not paramount
or at least it's not the classical

15
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,200
notions of rhetoric, smoothness, uh,

16
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,360
and um, uh, vividness.
The per copious has,

17
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,800
he is a bishop.

18
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,460
He's very concerned with supernatural
events and the church or let's say

19
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,480
supernatural events controlled by the
church for copious as you've seen,

20
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,220
is not very concerned with Christianity
and the supernatural events that concern

21
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:32,790
him,

22
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,790
such as Justinian walking around the
palace with no head are not Christian

23
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:39,960
supernatural there.

24
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,170
They're from some other
older supernatural tradition,

25
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,680
but both Gregory of tour and per copious
require an effort to figure out why not

26
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:59,991
just read something by a writer historian
living now who may be easier to figure

27
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:06,561
out and who is writing with you and me
in mind because of the vividness and

28
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:13,080
because of the trickiness of trying
to reconstruct not only what happened,

29
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:14,160
which is hard enough,

30
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,320
but also what the mood of people
was and what the reaction was.

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,600
We're talking about Justinian
today. So, uh, a um,

32
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,693
uh,

33
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,540
emperor whose rule occupies most of the,
um,

34
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,980
sixth century five 27,
two five 65.

35
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,140
So we're concentrating on
the sixth century as part
of this overall survival and

36
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:50,220
crisis of the eastern Roman Empire,
his rain,

37
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:55,221
or more precisely the earlier part of
his reign until about five 40 is the

38
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:01,070
height apogee maximum
power of this empire,

39
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,080
which succeeds in,
shall we say,

40
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,270
reconquering or conquering,

41
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,540
taking back or adding the parts
of the western Roman empire,

42
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:17,851
many parts of the western Roman Empire
that had been lost effectively to the

43
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:20,770
barbarian invasions of the fifth century.

44
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:25,771
If you still can refer to your map or
if your memory of geography is okay.

45
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,533
Um,

46
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,840
the major areas of conquest of Justinian
beyond the borders of the old eastern

47
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:39,010
empire,
our first North Africa,

48
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,990
which is the coast of modern Libya,
Tunisia,

49
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,190
Algeria, uh, and even, uh, Morocco

50
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,890
held by the vandals
and seized by Justinian

51
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,070
parts of Spain, coastal
Spain, Mediterranean, Spain,

52
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,610
held by the Visigoths and
Italy held by the Ostrogoths.

53
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,320
This is the centerpiece
of Justinian's reign.

54
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:20,340
And for a time it looked
as if he had in effect,

55
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:26,170
recreated the empire of
Constantine and Diocletian.

56
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:32,350
But as we'll see, this is a, uh,

57
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,740
triumph with a terrible price,

58
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,570
the terrible price being
that we can Byzantium. Now,

59
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,930
when we say of paint figures in the
past or even figures in the recent past,

60
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,880
that, uh, their policies were a
mistake because it turned out that, uh,

61
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,300
uh, the, uh,

62
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,150
future enemy would be something
other than what they were fighting.

63
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,260
We can say that with the
advantage of being able to
see what was going to happen.

64
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,510
In other words,
you know,

65
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,230
there are people who argue that the
invasion of Iraq was a folly or that the

66
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:10,890
expenditures on the,
uh,

67
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,080
aggressive foreign policy of the first
years of the 20th first century was

68
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,080
foolish because as it turns out,
economic problems,

69
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,520
domestic problems, they, a mortgage a,

70
00:05:23,521 --> 00:05:27,190
a bubble was really the problem that
people should have been addressing or they

71
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:31,680
should have been addressing the deficits.
You know, you can say that it's, it's in,

72
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:33,490
it's in it's own way.
It's a fact,

73
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,760
but it doesn't necessarily tell you what
people at the time should have thought

74
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,450
of.
Thus,

75
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,770
we know from last lecture
that first of all,

76
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,710
Justinian should have
concentrated on the Persians,

77
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,730
the Persians on his eastern
frontier who didn't interest him,

78
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:57,060
whom he just wanted to sort of pacify in
order to go west and make his conquest.

79
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,310
The Persians would turn out to be his big,
the biggest enemy of the empire.

80
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:02,990
And so,
you know,

81
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:07,991
if you were plotting this out as a kind
of international political strategy,

82
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,360
you could say,
uh,

83
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,540
forget about the Ostrogoths.
Forget about the vandals.

84
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:22,130
Build up that frontier, invade
Persia. Uh, keep your army there.

85
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,350
And indeed with a little more
hindsight, we can say, oh my gosh,

86
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:32,150
in 80 years, the Muslims are going to
take the eastern part of your empire.

87
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:32,990
Well,

88
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,990
obviously there's no way he is going
to be expected reasonably to know that

89
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,690
except if you're looking at a
distance from over a thousand years,

90
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,600
I was in 500 years. Uh, then,
you know, we can say, sure,

91
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:51,960
the eastern frontier turns out to
be the point of vulnerability. Uh,

92
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:57,310
so a classic kind of historical
problem or early Middle Ages,

93
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:03,200
midterm question is,
you know, Justinian um,

94
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:08,290
uh, overreach or, or reasonable, uh,

95
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:13,530
a guy or the conquest of the
West folly or a grand jury.

96
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,080
And it's both.

97
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,800
It is a classic example of
overextension overextension of empires,

98
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:29,501
meaning that empires weakened themselves
at some point fatally by simply getting

99
00:07:30,531 --> 00:07:35,510
either too big or spending too
much money and the two are linked,

100
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,060
get too big. You have to spend
more money to defend your yourself,

101
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:43,420
not really having the resources to keep
what you have the British Empire to take

102
00:07:46,311 --> 00:07:50,600
a, uh, a reasonably clear
and neutral example.

103
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:55,380
At some point is simply to, uh, large, uh,

104
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,490
for the resources of a
weakened Great Britain.

105
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,480
And, uh, our colleague Paul
Kennedy has explored, uh, uh,

106
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,660
quite memorably empires that simply
could not maintain their commitments.

107
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,270
The Spanish empire,

108
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,200
the British Empire.

109
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:22,940
And as it turned out after Kennedy wrote
his book, the Russian Soviet Empire,

110
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,710
this is a, a pattern
in history that is, uh,

111
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:32,510
that repeats itself.
The question,

112
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:37,010
however, is under the circumstances and
assuming the existence of that empire,

113
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:41,720
what are reasonable policies
to preserve it or to extend it?

114
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:47,780
We know about Justinian's wars
of conquest and of defense.

115
00:08:47,781 --> 00:08:51,080
He did have some wars
against the Persians, uh,

116
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,320
his wars of conquest in defense,
largely,

117
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:56,520
although not exclusively
through pro copious,

118
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,200
but he is our best source in two works.

119
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:06,210
One, the secret history and
the other much more extensive,

120
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,880
a series of books called the wars.

121
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,250
And they're divided in Persian
wars, African wars, Italian wars

122
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,010
in the wars.

123
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,040
You can see that once the Italian
war starts to go badly per copious,

124
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:28,911
his opinion of Justinian and of the
great general Bellis areas tend to change

125
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,660
from a kind of admiration.
And Go kill,

126
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:40,890
get them spirit to,
um,

127
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,980
uneasiness to blaming to
a kind of finger pointing.

128
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,140
So we're dependent on pro copious.

129
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:57,490
And if when you first read the wars,
it seems very,

130
00:09:57,491 --> 00:09:59,260
very different from the secret history.

131
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:04,590
It seems like it's by facilities or some
other sensible objective Greek writer

132
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,820
and he indeed is writing
in that tradition.

133
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,910
Those of you who've read
through cities will remember,

134
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:17,860
he describes often folly and very
terrible events, but soberly,

135
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:23,290
factually in a fashion of Olympians,

136
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:28,291
sorrow at the folly of
policymakers in generals.

137
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,330
And to some extent per
copious has that tone,

138
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:36,331
which seems to contrast very much with
the vehemence of the secret history.

139
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:41,530
Leading some people to assume that he was
crazy when he wrote the secret history

140
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,320
or off balance,
let's say,

141
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,310
or a that the war's represented,

142
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,433
uh,

143
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:55,450
the real pro copious and this
represented kind of his evil twin.

144
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:00,730
Uh, the term evil twin doesn't
appear in Gibbon, but uh, it could,

145
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,740
it could.
Um,

146
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,680
what makes it more complicated is
a third work of his cold buildings.

147
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,450
Buildings is,
as the name implies,

148
00:11:10,451 --> 00:11:15,190
a book about Justinian's
building campaign,

149
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:20,220
which includes but is by no means limited
to the Church of Iso Fia in modern

150
00:11:21,521 --> 00:11:26,350
Istanbul, which is, Eh,
continues to be to this day,

151
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:31,860
an extraordinary building
of such immensity and such
space in interior I dome

152
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,470
that sees unsupported by anything.

153
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,300
And that seems to cover half
the earth when you're inside it,

154
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,300
both splendid and an
extraordinary engineering fee.

155
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,920
And then, uh, interesting
Ian Built Churches, uh, uh,

156
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,620
he built churches.

157
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:56,890
That's a stand in Ravenna with
unbelievably beautiful mosaics,

158
00:11:56,891 --> 00:11:58,090
Ravenna in Italy.

159
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:03,100
And these are important because Ravenna
was outside the zone of territory

160
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,400
controlled by the iconoclast.
And therefore,

161
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:11,730
while the icon of class tended to take
down or whitewash representations of

162
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:16,960
anything divine, uh, they're reached,
did not extend as far as Ravenna.

163
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:18,250
So in a way,
the best,

164
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:23,260
the best examples of Byzantine
Mosaic Art of the, uh,

165
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:27,460
earliest period, not in a way, but
absolutely are, uh, outside of the,

166
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,900
um, uh, the eastern
Mediterranean and in Italy.

167
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:34,790
Yeah.

168
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:39,790
Buildings though is not just an account
of Justinian's architectural essays,

169
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,400
but a Pennage lyric,

170
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:48,430
a praise of Justinian almost as slavish
Lee at Jula Tori as the secret history

171
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,870
is, um, a condemnation.

172
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,790
And as I suggested last time,

173
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:02,410
these actually go
together in a society of,

174
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,323
um,

175
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:10,400
were tremendous power is concentrated in
one person or one court or one setting.

176
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,930
The reactions of people
tend to be adulation,

177
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:21,580
which is to some extent forced
out of them or at least, uh,

178
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,690
invited by the ruler.
So again,

179
00:13:25,691 --> 00:13:27,160
to take an obvious analogy,

180
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:32,190
Stalin for his 70th birthday was pleased
that the greatest museum of Moscow,

181
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:37,630
all the permanent exhibit was sort of
set aside and warehouse and the whole

182
00:13:37,631 --> 00:13:42,400
museum was given over to gifts to Stalin
on his 70th birthday from a grateful

183
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:47,110
people. He didn't have to
order it. Somebody came up
with the idea and he said,

184
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,690
oh, uh, don't go to any trouble.

185
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,950
They had the thing that agile Latori,

186
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,140
this is what later would be called
the cult of personality is just one of

187
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,490
hundreds of examples of naming
cities after him. Uh, uh,

188
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:04,810
lauding him as the Great Gardner.
The friend of children, um,

189
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:09,220
the, uh, uh, a successor
of Lenin and so forth.

190
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:15,220
The other side of that is a
kind of hatred and diatribe,

191
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,930
more or less secret.

192
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,680
There were lots of jokes about Stalin
you could and people were sent to Siberia

193
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,990
or executed for telling these jokes,

194
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,540
but they were very good jokes
under the circumstances. Um,

195
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,970
this is some of the explanation for
how you can get at the same time,

196
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,360
adulation and demonization.

197
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,410
The interesting thing of course is
it's in the same guy for copious.

198
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,050
And although people at one time thought,
oh,

199
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:49,570
well he wrote the buildings earlier

200
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,080
and then became disillusioned,
he did become disillusioned.

201
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,520
Everybody became disillusioned because
after five 40 things started to go wrong,

202
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:03,290
there's a huge play getting five 42 that
kills off a third of the population for

203
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:07,370
starters. But it looks as if he's
writing this stuff more or less.

204
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:10,760
At the same time,
the secret history is not finished.

205
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,200
That's why it begins so oddly,
not with Justinian,

206
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,990
but with Bella's areas and Bella's areas
as wife being kicked around by his wife

207
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,810
Theodora and you knew some
don't know who these people are.

208
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:25,730
And then suddenly we're at Justinian.
Well, you know, the order, uh,

209
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,220
of this thing is not yet set.

210
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,040
He probably did not finish it.

211
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,050
Yeah,

212
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:36,950
he did, however, want it to
be published after his death.

213
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,450
It's called the secret history
or the, uh, neck Dota, um, uh,

214
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:46,190
sort of stories, uh, by later writers.

215
00:15:46,191 --> 00:15:49,370
It survives in only one
manuscript as I think I remarked.

216
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,230
Nevertheless,
because it has a highly rhetorical style,

217
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,080
it clearly was to be read by other people.

218
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:00,800
It's not just a set of jottings
for his own satisfaction.

219
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:05,801
It is a work that he hoped would be a
widely published when he was safely dead

220
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,550
and enacted.

221
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:15,550
Art Literally means not stories as it
would now anecdotes that false cognate.

222
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,830
It means, um, not to be published.

223
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:27,560
So in the secret history
just in Ian is a monster.

224
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:33,490
What's a set that aside for a moment
and talk about what a Justinian actually

225
00:16:35,121 --> 00:16:39,620
did? Justinian, uh,

226
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,480
was the power behind the
throne of his, um, uh,

227
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,200
uncle Justin the first.

228
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:46,620
Okay.

229
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:51,620
So in a way his rule goes back to
the five twenties to the five teens

230
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,480
Justinian's character as portrayed by
per copious in both the wars and in the

231
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:07,280
secret history is very smart,

232
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,700
hardworking.
A copy of says he almost never slept,

233
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,270
devoted to details,

234
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:24,560
capable of immersing himself in
many different things. Architecture,

235
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:26,990
Church ceremonies,

236
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,070
theology and law.

237
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,580
He was of humble birth.

238
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,120
His uncle,
his family were soldiers.

239
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:47,390
They were from modern.
Oh Croatia.

240
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,610
More or less the Balkan peninsula,

241
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:55,670
the former Yugoslavia Elyria as would
have been the term used at the time.

242
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,800
He grew up speaking some
form of Latin and he is,

243
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,960
as I said last time,

244
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:09,410
the last emperor whose native language
was Latin as opposed to Greek.

245
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,990
He dressed very simply
and he was approachable.

246
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:22,650
He did not have that or inspiring
splendor of Diocletian Constantine for

247
00:18:24,731 --> 00:18:25,564
example,

248
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,180
he was seldom angry,

249
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,960
but he was cold and seems to have
had no trace of mercy or kindness.

250
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,560
Reminds me of some professors of mine.

251
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:50,210
He was intolerant, he was
unforgiving, and he was merciless.

252
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:57,370
He had a grandiose conception of
the empire and he was willing to,

253
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,223
um,

254
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:06,220
tax his subjects heavily and to endanger
the security of the eastern frontier in

255
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,700
order to expand his
territory and his prestige.

256
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,910
I think that is a fair judgment to Mac.

257
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,740
He believed that his predecessors
had nick through neglect,

258
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,120
lost what the ancient
Romans had conquered.

259
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,310
And you believed that you couldn't call
it the Roman Empire if all it consisted

260
00:19:31,311 --> 00:19:35,330
of were possessions and
the eastern Mediterranean.

261
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,040
And as we've said,

262
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,000
he did indeed conquer at
great cost North Africa,

263
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,340
parts of Spain and Italy.

264
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,900
He had a, I think it's wrong
to use the term totalitarian,

265
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:57,260
but certainly a very strong
conception of imperial rulership.

266
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,920
He tried to impose doctrines on the
church in order to resolve the age old

267
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,360
Manasseh side question.

268
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,053
Okay.

269
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,960
He was no more successful than
Constantina Theodosius by the way.

270
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,690
But for example,
just to give you a sense of his methods,

271
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:20,520
he kidnapped the Pope in Rome,
tried to brow beat him, uh,

272
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:23,510
and exiled him to the Crimean peninsula.
He died

273
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:30,890
Theodora one of the most interesting
things about Justinian is,

274
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:36,280
uh, that he gave so much power and uh, uh,

275
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,360
respect to his consort Theodora who was
of even more humble birth then he was

276
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,313
now,

277
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:51,890
I don't think we have to believe per
copious on the details of the doors.

278
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,273
Youth.

279
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:59,110
He certainly reserves
his most are hysterical.

280
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,870
Diatribes for Theodora.

281
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:06,900
I think it's fair to say that for copious
was not a great admirer of a competent

282
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,450
women.
Uh,

283
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,930
the historian burry a JB Barry,

284
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:18,931
one of the great historians of Leighton
Rome and Byzantium who wrote it about a

285
00:21:19,451 --> 00:21:24,370
hundred 120 years ago, uh,
describes her youth as stormy.

286
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:28,870
Um, an adjective that I like
because it could be anything.

287
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,060
Her stormy youth,
probably her father was a bear keeper.

288
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,560
Somebody who kept bears for the
entertainment of people at the circus,

289
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:43,370
an animal trainer.
She was the mother of a legitimate child.

290
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:45,110
Uh,

291
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:50,110
she may have had a background of
amateur or cuase I professional semipro

292
00:21:50,331 --> 00:21:51,230
prostitution.

293
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,720
Notice that per copious condemns her
first for being a prostitute and then for

294
00:21:56,721 --> 00:22:00,890
suppressing prostitution
once you became empress. Uh,

295
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,670
there's a logic to that per copious
is not opposed to prostitution.

296
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:10,400
One has the sense that he's, if not
a connoisseur, at least a, um, uh,

297
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:14,090
you know, uh, uh, now and then a partaker.

298
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,880
But for prostitutes to be
anything other than this, uh,

299
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:25,070
firmly subordinated class that is for
prostitutes to have some sort of voice or

300
00:22:25,071 --> 00:22:29,020
opinion or, uh, for people to, um,

301
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:33,800
endeavored to help them or
respect them is, uh, in his mind,

302
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:37,040
uh,
ridiculous and scandalous

303
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,960
per copious is a conservative.

304
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:49,980
He doesn't like the weakening
of the senatorial classes.

305
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,610
He represents the land owning interests.

306
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,510
He doesn't like too much imperial power.

307
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:01,150
He's quite happy to respect the emperor,

308
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,350
but is angry when the emperor
seems to be taxing rich people.

309
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:14,150
He doesn't like upstarts.
Upstarts like Justinian,

310
00:23:14,151 --> 00:23:16,250
who is he? Who is he? Soldiers,

311
00:23:16,251 --> 00:23:21,140
child upstarts like Theodora
upstarts like a, um,

312
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:23,870
Antonio,

313
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:28,870
the wife of Bella's Iris Justinian
and Theodora ruled as a team.

314
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:36,380
They had very different personalities.
They're very interesting team.

315
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,350
Theodore loved sleep.
Luxury

316
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,180
us was sympathetic them an awful sites.

317
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:51,730
Justinian was completely the opposite and
insomniac when somebody who dressed in

318
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:56,870
a extremely ordinary clothing
and a firmly anti man officer,

319
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,130
they in fact supported different
factions in the circus. I mean,

320
00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:08,750
here's a, you know, uh, um, uh, giants,

321
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:12,140
jets, marriage, uh, the circus,

322
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,540
the circus was a arena,
uh,

323
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:21,541
attached to the palace where the emperor
would make his appearances at sporting

324
00:24:22,071 --> 00:24:26,930
events. Although we've said Justinian
was approachable. By that we mean that,

325
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:30,540
um, you know, people in
the government or, uh,

326
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:35,720
in high positions could see
him without too much ceremony.

327
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:40,810
That doesn't mean he's approachable just
to anybody in an absolute test state.

328
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,150
There's certain kinds of events at
which the ruler has to show himself or

329
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:51,950
traditionally shows himself.
So, uh, in the Soviet era,

330
00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:53,680
the May Day parades,

331
00:24:53,681 --> 00:24:58,490
and it was a reviewing stand in Moscow
at the tomb of Lennon and foreign

332
00:24:58,491 --> 00:25:00,170
correspondence and intelligence,

333
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:04,940
people would try to see who was in and
out of power by who appeared with the

334
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:09,950
leader, who wasn't there,
where they were standing. Uh,

335
00:25:09,951 --> 00:25:13,060
the hippodrome, the, um, um,

336
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,670
horse racing arena in
Constantinople was a bit like this.

337
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,760
The emperor had his own box and the
people could make sort of celebratory

338
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:26,510
gestures to him,
praise him.

339
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:31,070
And if they were in a rebellious mood,
criticized him as well.

340
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,420
There were circus factions,
as they're called.

341
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:40,450
That is people who were curing
for one side or another.

342
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:45,470
The most important of
which in Constantinople are
the blues and the Greens.

343
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:51,530
The Greens tended to be
somewhat probe an office site.

344
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,520
And Theodora was a partisan of the
grains of blues anti-money office site.

345
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,780
Justinian was a partisan
of there in five 32.

346
00:26:02,781 --> 00:26:04,970
These circus factions revolted.

347
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:11,210
Partly it's a tax revolt.
Partly it's,

348
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,970
uh, uh, factions fighting.

349
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,820
It doesn't do to try to probe what
these factions represented too much.

350
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,310
After a while,
they're simply factions.

351
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:27,080
There's simply people who liked to fight
or who like to root for one side or

352
00:26:27,081 --> 00:26:29,200
another, but they, um,

353
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:34,450
are rowdy and even criminal may
have very outlandish costumes.

354
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,310
Uh,

355
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:41,660
they expend all their money and all
their energy on sporting events and on

356
00:26:41,661 --> 00:26:45,780
rowdiness a sort of associated with them.
Uh, this is not completely unfamiliar.

357
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:47,730
Uh,

358
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:51,240
the prefect of the city arrested seven
people for rioting and condemned them to

359
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:55,230
death. Uh, two of them escaped.

360
00:26:55,231 --> 00:27:00,030
When the rope broke.
It always pays to maintain your,

361
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,360
I mean, this is a tip
from a historian, uh,

362
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:07,410
always pays to maintain
your coercive equipment. Uh,

363
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,600
once these guys escaped,

364
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:13,530
then they were heroes and they
were shielded from the crowd.

365
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:18,680
They were put in a monastery where they
had sanctuary and conveniently enough,

366
00:27:18,901 --> 00:27:21,270
one was a blue and one was a green.

367
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,180
So the blues and the Greens United,

368
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:29,100
they ran through the streets
demanding pardon for the, uh, escaped

369
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,580
the escapees. And when Justinian
refused a riot took place,

370
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,940
the battle cry of these
rioters was victory,

371
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:48,450
right? Nika, not to be confused.
What sporting equipment?

372
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,820
Nika victory. The crowds tried to
overthrow Justinian and Theodora.

373
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,820
And in the process they
burned down a lot of the city.

374
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,290
Um,

375
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:05,290
Justinian is reported by per
copious as being ready to flay,

376
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,630
but Theodora stiffened his resolve,

377
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,640
basically telling them she preferred to
die in the shroud of the imperial robes

378
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:20,800
rather than flee in
disguise and mobilized.

379
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:22,820
Uh,

380
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:27,820
the generals blows areas and narcis
we've met Bella's areas already

381
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:36,010
and they cracked down on the mob
and killed maybe 40,000 of them.

382
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:45,800
Right? How many people attend the
Yankee Games? About 80,000. So,

383
00:28:45,801 --> 00:28:46,634
um,

384
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,110
yeah,

385
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:51,380
30, 40,000 people. And
at that ended the riots,

386
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:56,570
Constantinople was partially burned.
Justinian loved building.

387
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:01,580
This was a great opportunity. He
couldn't have asked for a better, uh, um,

388
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:05,540
moment in a sense, a, of
course it required more taxes,

389
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:08,010
but people now I hadn't seen both

390
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,510
problems with resisting taxes.

391
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:17,230
And so this is where we start the building
of the new Iso Fia that we see today.

392
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,193
Okay.

393
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,460
Built in five years.
And I mean,

394
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:28,830
compare this to grand, uh,
projects like, you know, uh,

395
00:29:28,831 --> 00:29:33,590
an exit on the Connecticut Turnpike,
which take 15 years or so. Uh,

396
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,430
the way you build something in five years,

397
00:29:35,431 --> 00:29:39,390
it's by an incredible
number of workman, um, and,

398
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,640
uh,
lavish expenditure of money.

399
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:47,080
The patriarchs thrown in,
Aya Sophia was made of silver,

400
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,970
weighed 40,000 pounds.

401
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:55,330
The columns are porphyry,
many of them,

402
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:59,890
uh, it uses a lot of glass
in order to admit light.

403
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:04,930
And the light comes from so far away
that it forms these wonderful patterns

404
00:30:04,931 --> 00:30:06,160
depending on the time of day.

405
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:11,960
Justinian also rebuilt
the senate, the baths, uh,

406
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:16,090
the imperial palace and the
Church of Saint, uh, Irene,

407
00:30:16,091 --> 00:30:18,460
the Church of the apostles,
et Cetera, et cetera.

408
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,800
He started his wars against Persia
before the Nika revolt and the war with

409
00:30:29,351 --> 00:30:34,150
Persia is one episode of a
multisensory war in this case.

410
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,610
It's over influence in the caucuses,

411
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,920
but it's really about trying to protect
Byzantium from Persian invasion.

412
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:50,470
But as I said, Justinian's
interest was not really in Persia.

413
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,920
He was interested in,
uh,

414
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:58,990
peace with Persia and in securing enough
of the frontier so that the Persians

415
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:02,800
couldn't launch, uh, at least
not easily a surprise attack.

416
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,680
And in five 31,

417
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:11,590
the eastern Roman Empire and
Persia signed a perpetual peace

418
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:18,860
and Justinian then moved
his troops to the west.

419
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,730
The sight of his real ambitions,

420
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,880
the vandal war in North
Africa was a triumph.

421
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:34,300
What we're seeing is one of those cases
in which a policy seems to succeed

422
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,030
miraculously easy.
The vandals fell.

423
00:31:38,031 --> 00:31:40,580
It seemed without a fight here,

424
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:46,150
the people who had been the
terror of Rome 120 years earlier,

425
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:48,270
uh,

426
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:53,270
a hundred and a hundred years earlier
who had sacked Rome in four 55 who had

427
00:31:53,781 --> 00:31:58,220
seized the grainery of realm
in four 30, uh, fell almost.

428
00:31:58,221 --> 00:32:03,170
It seemed without a fight, true.
The native Berber population,

429
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,550
um, who were subordinate to
the vandals desert people, uh,

430
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:11,540
revolted, uh, and they, uh,

431
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:16,040
were able to raid the coast and to
undermine the position of the, uh,

432
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,690
the Byzantine occupiers.

433
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:25,420
The next stop was Italy in five 35,

434
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,530
five 33,
five 30 for the conquest of Africa.

435
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:34,810
But Italy would take 20 years,
not one. And in the process,

436
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:39,280
Italy itself would be devastated.
And with that devastation,

437
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,570
a lot of classical culture would be lost.

438
00:32:41,571 --> 00:32:44,600
What wasn't destroyed by
the fifth century invasions.

439
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:48,920
And remember we said the Ostrogoths,
we're pretty, uh, uh, reasonable.

440
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:49,880
Uh,

441
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,880
occupiers would be destroyed
by the Romans themselves.

442
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,993
Okay.

443
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,530
I will not, uh, uh,

444
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:03,600
tax you with the INS and outs and
ups and downs of this campaign.

445
00:33:03,601 --> 00:33:08,580
Suffice it to say that the General Bella's
areas at first was able to triumph in

446
00:33:08,581 --> 00:33:11,190
Italy. The Ostrogoths
pick resistance, however,

447
00:33:11,191 --> 00:33:15,150
proved to be much stronger
than he expected. And, um,

448
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,543
uh,

449
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,040
Justinian recalled Bella's areas,

450
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:29,730
almost all of Italy was reoccupied by
the Ostrogoths and it was only the second

451
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:35,450
general Narcisse who from five 52 to
five 55 is able to take over Italy.

452
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,323
Um,

453
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,360
five 40 is the year that Ravenna falls
to the Byzantines and it seems to be the

454
00:33:48,141 --> 00:33:51,020
zenith of Justinian's reign.

455
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,680
In that year,

456
00:33:55,220 --> 00:34:00,220
the Persians invaded that perpetual
peace had lasted nine years,

457
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:05,450
and the Persian invasion was,
uh,

458
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,650
quite successful.

459
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:15,950
It resulted in the sac of the largest
city of the empire after Constantinople

460
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,920
and Alexandria,
the city of Antioch

461
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,010
in the eastern Mediterranean.

462
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:31,190
And this was followed then by a plague,

463
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,800
the so called Justinian Anik plague,

464
00:34:33,801 --> 00:34:38,801
which seems to be related perhaps to
the plague of paraclese Athens or the

465
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:45,490
Athens of the Peloponnesian war and
maybe to the black death of 1348,

466
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,710
1349 hard to say. And in fact, uh,

467
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:56,711
research now being done
on the DNA in mass graves,

468
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:57,500
uh,

469
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:02,180
from that plague will perhaps tell
us what the disease really was.

470
00:35:02,181 --> 00:35:04,190
Although so far,
apparently it hasn't.

471
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,873
Okay.

472
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:11,780
So from five 40 to five 65,
the death of Justinian,

473
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:15,020
his policies are officially successful.

474
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:20,780
Five 55, the fall of Italy, the
plague eventually goes away,

475
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,590
or the Persians are pushed
out of Antioch at least.

476
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:30,460
But the empire in the later years of
Justinian is clearly staggering under the

477
00:35:31,161 --> 00:35:35,540
weight of taxation,
economic downturn,

478
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,440
declining population. And, uh,

479
00:35:40,441 --> 00:35:43,530
overextension they had conquered Italy,

480
00:35:43,531 --> 00:35:45,600
but the Italy they had
conquered was ruined.

481
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,393
Okay.

482
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:53,670
And this empire stretching now from
Sicily to the Persian frontier is,

483
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,480
um,
as clearly a too big to hold on to.

484
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:03,280
So this is some of what pro copious is.
Anger is about.

485
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,860
Uh,
but um,

486
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:10,643
yeah,

487
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,640
he is, uh, he's bitter and
disillusioned, he says,

488
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:20,380
but I grow dizzy when I write of such
suffering and pass onto future times.

489
00:36:20,381 --> 00:36:21,340
It's memories here.

490
00:36:21,341 --> 00:36:25,500
He's speaking about the Persian
invasion of Antioch for Canada.

491
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:30,510
Understand why it is the will of God to
exalt the fortunes of a man or place and

492
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,060
then cast them down for
no reason that we can see.

493
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,270
Okay.

494
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:40,230
Now, if you contrast him with what you've
read in Augustine and the confessions,

495
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:44,160
you can see that Augustine has
some reasons why this happens.

496
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:48,540
A pro copious resists the
Christian explanation here,

497
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:53,570
and this has led some observers to think
in general that he's not really somehow

498
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:57,120
a Christian.
He is,

499
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:02,180
but he's writing in a classical
tradition and he is also remember not an

500
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,230
elitist,
a conservative.

501
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:07,740
I use the term elitist in
a fairly neutral sentence.

502
00:37:07,741 --> 00:37:12,570
It's hard to expect someone who's writing
is come down to us all this length of

503
00:37:12,571 --> 00:37:15,990
time to be somehow an ordinary person.
Yes,

504
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:21,110
he represents a class but doesn't
really like religious controversy.

505
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:24,840
That doesn't really like all of the,
um,

506
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:30,150
fussing about the natures
or nature of Christ.

507
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,750
But there are other things that are
not in for copious that are somewhat

508
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:34,584
surprising.

509
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:39,980
Justinian is best known for
architectural monuments like Aya,

510
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:45,660
Sophia to historians for what we're
essentially talking about today,

511
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:50,661
the Western conquest at for his legal
reforms that just any antic law code,

512
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,690
which is the basis of all European law,

513
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:02,750
European that is as opposed to Anglo
American Anglo American law is a separate

514
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,223
tradition.

515
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:09,440
European law is based ultimately on
a reworking of Roman law precedents.

516
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,580
So I want to talk a little bit
about his legal accomplishment,

517
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:17,060
which per copia is a,

518
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,370
a man who would be familiar with
law courts, with legal systems, uh,

519
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:26,340
doesn't tell us anything about
in his works, virtually nothing.

520
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,243
Okay.

521
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,280
Justinian essentially
codified the Roman law.

522
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,070
And this is not

523
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,470
only because it's the
basis of European law,

524
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,070
but law is related to political
and administrative order.

525
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:46,300
However much we may hate bureaucracy
or denounce administration,

526
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:50,560
that is how governments, uh, uh,

527
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,760
provide whatever it is they're
providing for their citizens.

528
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:59,890
And the, since the alternative
to government is anarchy,

529
00:38:59,891 --> 00:39:03,850
and since they're examples before
our eyes of anarchic societies,

530
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:09,040
it won't do to underestimate
the benefits of law.

531
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:12,280
However cynical we may be
about its implementation.

532
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:18,760
Roman law at the time of
Justinian was as law tends to be,

533
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,700
um,
learned and unwieldy.

534
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,990
If you wanted to know how
to resolve a question,

535
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:31,740
you could go through the thousands and
thousands of what are called response.

536
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,600
Or You could look at legislation just
as in the Anglo American tradition.

537
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:43,030
And some of you will learn
this very soon in law school.

538
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:48,270
You can either look at statutes
passed by legislatures or court cases,

539
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:52,090
precedents, the equivalent
of a statute. You know,

540
00:39:52,091 --> 00:39:56,230
Connecticut passes a law saying that
you can't have a gun in your car.

541
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:57,161
Uh,

542
00:39:57,161 --> 00:40:02,080
whereas Texas has laws that say you can
have a gun in your car under such and

543
00:40:02,081 --> 00:40:07,000
such circumstances. Okay, so you
have a whole set of statute law,

544
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,850
which would be imperial
statutes in the Roman Empire,

545
00:40:12,851 --> 00:40:14,770
imperial legislation,

546
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,093
or

547
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:25,620
if the statutes don't cover a particular
situation or you want something that

548
00:40:26,921 --> 00:40:28,750
has the particularity,

549
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,240
uh,

550
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:39,200
my tree, a tree on my property
falls on my neighbors.

551
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,820
Did I mention this already? Yeah,
that one. Uh, on my neighbor's garage,

552
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:49,040
um, you know, who's, who's to
blame. Okay. You go and you say,

553
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:49,710
well,
you know,

554
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:54,710
at this case came up in a Cincinnati in
1949 and this is what the judge found in

555
00:40:59,571 --> 00:41:01,460
the absence of computers.

556
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,760
The search for this stuff is very
hard in a Anglo American law.

557
00:41:08,451 --> 00:41:11,810
This is called precedents.
In Roman law,

558
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:15,110
they're called response.
And interestingly enough,

559
00:41:15,111 --> 00:41:17,540
this term is also singular,

560
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,240
plural replied to Jewish law.

561
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:25,280
A response is a response.
A judge, an expert,

562
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,990
a law professor in effect,

563
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:32,050
is asked his opinion on something and
his response becomes preserved as a kind

564
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,574
of precedent.

565
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:42,150
These were voluminous and represented
centuries of law and even more.

566
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:47,200
Of course, the response of conflicted
one judge says, you have to pay,

567
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:52,300
uh, because it was your tree.
Another says, uh, um, uh,

568
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:56,230
it's an accident.
He's responsible for his own remedies.

569
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:00,100
What do you do if you have a
conflict of judges? What if you do,

570
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:03,310
if you have two kinds of
contradictory responses,

571
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:08,650
you've got to decide who takes who is
more authoritative, which one is better.

572
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:14,820
So the work of Justinian's compilers
was to sort out legislation,

573
00:42:15,191 --> 00:42:20,191
statutes and the responses and also
to decide among contradictory ones,

574
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,660
what is in this law.
Well,

575
00:42:25,661 --> 00:42:30,661
what's in any law we think of law as
having mostly to do with criminals and

576
00:42:30,911 --> 00:42:33,880
stuff like that.
But criminal law is actually very simple.

577
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:38,790
It's like the Burgundian code.
If you murder someone,

578
00:42:38,791 --> 00:42:40,140
this is what's going to happen to you.

579
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,310
There may be different kinds of killing
if you murder them with intent and

580
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:45,210
premeditation,

581
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:50,010
that's worse than if you murdered them
in a fight and spontaneous like, um,

582
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:53,880
it is, uh, man slaughter
is different from murder.

583
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:59,160
Manslaughter is where you didn't intend
to kill the person. Uh, but you did,

584
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:02,850
you punched him and you didn't know
that he had a weak heart and he died.

585
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:07,290
That's manslaughter. Um, you know, you
punched him, you intended to hurt him,

586
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:12,120
but you didn't intend to kill him, but
he died. Um, vehicular manslaughter,

587
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:16,260
you know, uh, what's the
difference between negligence?

588
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:19,740
You should have seen something and
you didn't versus criminal intent.

589
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,800
You did it deliberately.
Um,

590
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:24,843
okay.

591
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:26,940
But it's very simple.
The criminal law,

592
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:33,530
there aren't a whole lot of gray areas
and you can get through the criminal code

593
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:36,240
pretty quickly.
But what about contracts?

594
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,540
What about property? This
is endless. This is endless.

595
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:47,640
So, um, you know, in law
school, criminal law will be,

596
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:52,440
um, you know, the cream or the, um,

597
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:57,720
the tip of the proverbial iceberg
or some little side issue.

598
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:02,700
Most of your time is going to be spent
on those of you who go for this option

599
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,700
on, um, no property and contracts.

600
00:44:05,701 --> 00:44:09,060
And that's what the extend Ian law
is mostly property and contracts,

601
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:15,120
legal arrangements for buying and selling,
inheriting partnerships,

602
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:17,850
Guardian ships,
security,

603
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:21,510
surety obligations.

604
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:25,380
This is a very advanced
science in Roman law.

605
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,190
As advanced as it is anywhere at any time,

606
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:34,650
it's very different from,
you cut off one finger,

607
00:44:34,651 --> 00:44:37,920
you pay five solid day,
which we were looking at last week.

608
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,520
The work that ensued,

609
00:44:41,521 --> 00:44:46,521
the so called Justinian a code
or the Corpus Yoris civil is

610
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,870
the body of civil law,

611
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
uh, was drawn up in
five years. Here again,

612
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:02,010
is an example of unbelievable rapidity
compared with the length of time it takes.

613
00:45:02,011 --> 00:45:06,010
Now, uh, uh, you know, merely to, uh,

614
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:11,180
reform the Connecticut tax code or the
to den Connecticut Traffic Code for that

615
00:45:11,371 --> 00:45:15,450
matter. Um, it was
undertaken by a commission.

616
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,410
Yeah,

617
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:18,820
four books were issued.

618
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:20,840
Okay.

619
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,740
The first is a collection of
statutes and it's called the codex

620
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:31,990
collected laws of the Senate and
imperial laws of previous centuries.

621
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,630
The largest book is The d,

622
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:41,080
The digest or in Latin Digesta.

623
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:42,730
The digest is

624
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,090
the weeded out response.

625
00:45:47,091 --> 00:45:50,230
Sir organized by subject.

626
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:57,270
So this would be where you would go to
try and figure out what happens if a

627
00:45:58,421 --> 00:46:02,470
river changes its course
a little and your land,

628
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:07,090
uh, is it seems to be now
taken over by your neighbor.

629
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:12,640
Is the river the border or is align,
uh, on artificial line? The morning,

630
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:23,100
the third book is a kind of textbook or
a survey of the whole law and what it's

631
00:46:23,101 --> 00:46:25,830
supposed to mean called the institutes.

632
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:33,670
And the fourth is called the novella
or new laws because obviously new laws

633
00:46:33,671 --> 00:46:34,540
would have to be made.

634
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:37,440
Okay.

635
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,120
The Codex,
the digest,

636
00:46:39,121 --> 00:46:43,410
the institutes are in Latin because Latin
was the language of the Roman Empire.

637
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,300
But the novella are in Greek because
Greek was the language of the empire.

638
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:53,570
Now now being five 34 when
this work was finished,

639
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:01,860
the Justinian code is more however
than a rearrangement of old laws.

640
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:05,700
It displayed a consistent
philosophy of government

641
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:12,640
where law is more than precedent.
It is an active force in society.

642
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:18,880
The emperor is seen as the servant of
the law, the implementer of the law,

643
00:47:18,881 --> 00:47:22,660
but he's also the master of the law.
He is an absolute power.

644
00:47:22,661 --> 00:47:24,250
He is the embodiment of the law.

645
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:30,450
This is a well

646
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:34,420
run,
immense burden.

647
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:39,421
Some empire pro copious
gives us unreliable though
he may be as to Justinian

648
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:43,390
being a demon,
et cetera.

649
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:49,050
Copious gives us a vivid
picture of a highly governed,

650
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,760
even efficiently governed,

651
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:55,450
but oppressively governed
and very ambitious society.

652
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:03,570
Now for next week and a little bit after,
remember we have no class on Wednesday.

653
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:08,630
We have class on Monday and you're
going to read from Gregory of tour,

654
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:09,880
uh,

655
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,880
about Clovis and the Franks and it will
seem more violent and more primitive

656
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:21,100
than what we've been reading. But
violence in primitiveness, unfortunately,

657
00:48:21,101 --> 00:48:24,650
are part of history and
government at almost any time. Uh,

658
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,960
so enjoy the intrigue.
I'm not going to test you on the names.

659
00:48:28,961 --> 00:48:32,160
You'll see there lots of great cat names,
uh,

660
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:34,440
of the Frankish barbarians.
Uh,

661
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:39,450
but pay attention to the figure of
Clovis and to the attitude of Gregory,

662
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:43,060
because as with per copious,
we've got an interesting,

663
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:45,520
if not completely reliable source.
