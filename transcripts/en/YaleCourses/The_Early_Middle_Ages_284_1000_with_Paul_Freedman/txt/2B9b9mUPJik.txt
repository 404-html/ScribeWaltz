Speaker 1:          00:01          But, uh, the advantage of talking to you even on an inconvenient day is Diocletian. Uh, we don't use terms in the professional world of history like awesome, very much, but the guys certainly deserves that. He rescued the Roman empire and we'll begin by saying what he rescued it from a, as a preliminary, the sections are meeting this week. If you're wait listed for a session section, just go to it. Um, we will have enough sections for however many people take this course, right? So they're currently for the additional ones were that were added since last week, uh, are, um, Wednesday at two 30 and Thursday at seven. And again, if you're waitlisted, just go, we'll, we'll figure this out there. There will be enough sections for everybody. So, um, I referred last time to the third century crisis, the crisis of the Roman Empire that proceeded the accession of Diocletian from two 35 to two 84 and we mentioned several interrelated weaknesses of the empire that might be seen as longterm causes of this crisis. Um, a the size of the empire, it's sheer massive size.

Speaker 1:          01:39          The problem of succession. That is, it was never quite clear and we'll talk about this in more detail. Um, how one emperor succeeded another, the urban rural imbalance. This was a, an empire built on cities and to some extent, although heavily debated among historians to what extent, but to some extent the cities may be said to have drained off the energy or been parasites on the productivity of the countryside. Uh, it was an empire that was um, according to one point of view, more cosmopolitan than it had been according to another point of view. More barbarian. In other words, this was an empire who's Roman population was less dominant, partly through its own success in coopting other peoples, some of the peoples that had co-opted, we're not actually originally inhabitants of the empire particularly this is visible in the army's which tended to be staffed by uh, uh, so called barbarian tribes, so called by the Romans who refer to them as barbarians.

Speaker 2:          03:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:06          Another problem is the east West imbalance where the east tends to do better economically and demographically them the west demographically meaning population. We live in a world when one of the great threats is overpopulation. It is therefore not self evident, although true that for most of the time historically most places have trouble reproducing their population. And indeed we are starting to enter into a period of great demographic decline.

Speaker 2:          03:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:48          The infant mortality, the low life expectancy, the death of women in childbirth, the prevalence of disease and to some extent military threats of invasion, uh, or not threats. The reality, um, made it hard for one generation to produce children to replace itself. And this is true up until the dawn of Moderna team. So these are fundamental problems of the Roman empire. The real question is why do they explode in the third century? And this is a question as I think I said last week with any great empire, it's easy to point to the flaws in, uh, a a complicated system. Often size is one of them. Often bureaucracy, often overspending on the military. But uh, some of these go on for a very long time, more or less successive successfully. Despite the flaws in the Roman empire went on longer than most. As we said, the immediate problems

Speaker 1:          05:02          that explode in the third century are invasions and succession invasions. By first of all, Persia. Persia is the old enemy of the Roman Empire. Indeed, as many of you know, uh, the old enemy of the Greek city states that proceed the Roman empire as far back as a, the first historian of the western tradition. Hurghada tests, first week of directed studies. For those of you who are nostalgic for that experience, Persia is the enemy. Now, we never study persh as kind of like offstage all the time. And that's the great benefit of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and cultures. Uh, um, if you want to learn about Persia really from within, instead of as, oh my God, the, and you know, oh my God, the Persians in, uh, three 70 BC and it's going to be a, it's going to come to an end. It is going to come to an end in the seventh century. Uh, but that's because of Islam just to anticipate. But in the third century, Persian, it becomes research. And having been rather passive, it has this frontier with the Roman Empire in the east. Um, more or less buffer states are Mesopotamia present day, Iraq and Armenia. It was not exactly the same as the present day state of Armenia, but more like eastern Turkey.

Speaker 1:          06:35          The dynasty that the controls Persia and that is more aggressive than its predecessor are the assassinations. And this appears in your reading, the assassin had dynasty, the rulers of Persia, just more aggressive and more adventurous beginning in two 24. Uh, they, um, uh, start to probe that frontier along the Armenian and Mesopotamian border and eventually cross it and start to wreak havoc in some of the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire. The climax of this is the emperor of Valerian, um, was captured by the Persians into 60 Valerian actually one of the longer a reigning emperors of this chaotic period. Two 53 to two 60. Um, they kept him for a little while, displayed him in chains, maybe flayed him. Anyway, he died in captivity and they, they, they did a kind of a job on him. I think he may be. He was flayed after he died, just to be, just not to be too gruesome, but I think they displayed the skin.

Speaker 1:          07:49          Uh, as I said, I'm not a Persian specialist, but, um, uh, the second invasion is across the Danube, Ryan frontier, the Danube, the Rhine form what the Romans thought of as a natural frontier with the barbarian states. That didn't mean that they didn't cross them. In fact, uh, many of their great, uh, uh, uh, fortresses and establishment, we're on the eastern side of the Rhine, but they considered those as bulwarks against a Germanic invasion across the Rhine. The Rhine and the Danube almost meet the Ryan going from modern Netherlands down to Switzerland. And the Danube going also from Germany, eventually Austria, Hungary into the Black Sea. Um, as we'll see, Charlemagne in the early ninth century tried to build a canal between the two of them. And there are actually traces of this immense and completely unsuccessful project and there now is a canal between them. So this is sort of the frontier of the Roman Empire. And this is the line above which no wine grapes are grown, uh, know olive oil is a pressed and, uh, it's gotta be protected, but, um, not worth conquering. So we have pressure on the Rhine, Danube frontiers in the third century, and another emperor dcs died fighting the goths in, uh, two 51 dcs and Valerian dyes into 60. So the emperors are certainly out there as leaders. Uh, but that actually has to do with the fact that their military guys, and that is part of the problem. The major problem besides the invasions was succession.

Speaker 1:          09:46          There were, I mean, it depends on how you count, you know, is is someone a real emperor or is he merely a pretender? There are at least 30 emperors between two 35 and two 85. Many of them ruling four months. Most of them being killed. There were assassinated by the Praetorian guard that is by their own, uh, uh, troops. Uh, they're killed in battle against foreign enemies like dcs and Valerian. They're killed in battle against other people claiming to be emperors. But the most common thing is they're assassinated by their own troops.

Speaker 1:          10:32          How had Roman emperor succeeded each other. There were several ways. One is what you would expect and that is dynastic, but that's not all that common dynastic, in other words, families rule and the family has recognized as a ruling family and therefore, um, uh, they, uh, uh, echoes from father to son or if there's no sun father to person, daughter marries or father to nephew, something like that. But that was not actually so common. Um, sometimes, uh, the um, uh, the next emperor was chosen by his predecessor. This is characteristic of the century, second century ID, the era of the so called good emperors. In theory, this is a great system. You have no family prejudice. You simply as a good emperor pic, someone who looks to you like he's going to be a good emperor.

Speaker 2:          11:36          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:36          So that is another possibility.

Speaker 1:          11:42          Um, another possibility is some guy is powerful and uses his troops to take over. And that's what we see in the third century. We see only the militarization of the empire, but the, uh, interference of the army in succeed in raising a successors, in raising a new emperors. The army was able to make and unmake emperors just as in some countries with unstable political structures, the military is able to make and unmake rulers. What is interesting about the third century is that they're able to do it far from Rome. Some of these armies are in North Africa, some of them are on the frontier fighting the Persians. Rome is becoming less and less relevant as the dominant city of the empire. And I mentioned that now because we'll see on Wednesday, the result of this is will be the establishment of another capital, a second capitol in the east in what would be called Constantinople. Modern Istanbul. Rome is four to five for the first time. There is a wall that you can still see in many parts of Rome built by the emperor or religion in two 71.

Speaker 1:          13:08          And this is a significant thing because until [inaudible] 71, four centuries, Rome had not been walled because it was not threatened. Fortification of two 71 starts to indicate things to come or at least things that we know are to come. Namely Barbarian Invasions. Just as the marginalization of Rome, uh, begins at this time. Rome in the third century is ruled, if one can call it that by a succession of generals, not members of an upper class elite, but men who have come from the provinces, men who are not particularly well educated, who would have trouble recognizing a tag, uh, from Horace. Uh, there being no internet just to look these quotes up. Um, they hold the traditional Roman elite in contempt. The Senate of Rome is the embodiment of that elite. The Roman Senate is a collection of extremely wealthy people with from good families, extensive property and very, very fine education.

Speaker 1:          14:30          The people leading in the third century now our generals raised by their troops. One of the reasons that the troops both raised up generals and then killed them was that they tend to, to get a kind of reward from the new emperor. A thing called a donative donative is money that you get when there's a new emperor, a bad idea from the point of view of the emperor's because it encourages, um, you know, double dipping or triple dipping, you know, okay, now we've gotten our money from this guy, let's kill him and get money from another guy. That's don't think that's too cynical to say that that is some of what is going on now of all the crises of the third century. This is the one that leaves the most visible impression. There's absolutely no doubt that there are all of these different emperors and that the top of the government is unstable.

Speaker 1:          15:23          The question is how much does that carry over into the lives of ordinary people? One measure of the effectiveness of a civilization is that it survives and even people don't comment very much on political instability. Uh, in a way, uh, we are testing that now for many people. The fact that the government is polarized, it doesn't really matter in terms of their everyday life. How long can that go on? That's partly because all courts sorts of institutions, uh, are functioning perfectly fine. Here we are, we're meeting, you know, there's a, there's no a problem of the supply of water suddenly or, um, uh, you know, scarce provisioning or, uh, you know, barbarians mast outside and we'd have to sort of protect against during our class. It hasn't come to that, uh, uh, yet. Uh, but, um, if you look at the lives of ordinary people in the third century, they are not saying, uh, not another emperor. I can't take it anymore. They're just the philosopher Plotinus for example, one of the great intellectual figures of this time. Now it's true. He has a very other worldly way of thinking about things. He is a follower of Plato is the leading so called neoplatonist philosopher flourishes during the third century, travels a bit. Uh, but we never hear of any difficulty, any kind of problems raised by these unstable conditions. The one that might have affected more people than the instability is inflation.

Speaker 1:          17:13          Roman coinage was silver and bronze. And based on ratios of these metals to gold, ultimate standard of value was gold, but bronze and silver had attributed values in relation to gold. Been need to reward the army with those donative and the dislocations of the invasions led to tremendous government expenditures. And this was a society that did not have debt financing. There are no bonds, there are no ways of the government, uh, anticipating future revenues and borrowing money against them. That is actually an invention of the middle ages was an example of something that the Romans didn't have that medieval cities in Italy pioneered debt financing. I don't have to tell you what that is and it's a great advantage up to a point, great up advantage because it gives you leverage, allows you to do things now. So, um, how does a government deal with problems like this? If it can't borrow money, it does what is called debasing. The coin it

Speaker 2:          18:32          okay

Speaker 1:          18:33          to debase that is degrade the coin and means that you just don't put in as much silver or bronze, let alone cold and try to get people to accept it for its value. Anyway. So up until the 1970s, the American currency was based on gold and dollar bills were called silver certificates. They said that you could hand this bill in for a dollar's worth of silver. It was technically speaking, not currency. It was merely a representative of currency which you could trade in. And before that, of course the coins were metal dollars were both silver and paper with the silver one being in some sense the more real, um, it is in the nature of modern government financing that at some point the government could just say forget about it. And even long before the 19 seven days, uh, of course the government didn't have enough silver for everyone to trade them in just as it doesn't have enough gold in Fort Knox to float the entire world's currency.

Speaker 1:          19:49          It has a law and that's important, you know, that there'd be some real kind of value or bullion or you know, bottom line kind of gold bars. But, uh, uh, uh, the fact that it's not enough is not intrinsically a problem. But here the government say the government receives a thousand receives in the form of taxes. And stuff. Uh, a thousand gold units, uh, and it issues 2000 units using that gold. The coins say they're worth a, a unit, but they're actually in terms of precious metal value worth a half. So it pays its expenses that way it pays the army, it gets people to accept this money. But when those people go to buy stuff or uh, they are going to find that the stuff is 50% more because their coins are not actually very good. But governments tend to do this gradually hoping that people don't notice in the first place or that if the inflation is say 10%, it's not so bad.

Speaker 1:          21:03          But once having embarked on the debasement of the coinage, this tends to get out of control because of the famous Gresham's law in 18th century economist that bad money drives out good. If I have good a sister ses or Roman currency with the full measure of silver that they say they have one full unit and I've got other coins that say one full unit but only have half, I'm going to try to get rid of the bad ones and horde the good ones and only spend the good ones if I absolutely have to or demand a premium on them. So therefore there are all these crappy coins circulating like mad and the good ones a retreat into people's, uh, well they don't really have mattresses then, but you know, into their store boxes or under their beds creating in itself more and more inflation.

Speaker 1:          22:04          So you have a fierce and flesh and prices go up. People don't know the value of things. They start bartering. Uh, and the Roman economy is very, very adversely effected as hyperinflation tends to. And um, uh, a final problem is the ruin of the local elite, um, partly because of this economic chaos, but partly from deeper causes. The importance of, this is something that I alluded to last time in that is that the emperor empire could not be held together really by the government. However big the government was, it required the cooperation of wealthy people with ties to their native city. It was these people who sponsored games, civic improvements, maintain the temples and kept a kind of local order.

Speaker 1:          23:04          The third century crisis undermines this elite. This elite is undermined by the militarization of society. They are to some extent ruined by taxation and increased taxation. They're just powerful enough to be well off, but not powerful enough to evade taxation. But they also tend to be undermined by an empire that's more cosmopolitan, where local elites don't matter as much. Where, for example, military people who move around a lot are more important. And I emphasize this not only because of these elites themselves and their role in holding the empire together, but we're going to talk about this when we talk about Christianity because when the local elites are ruined, so his local religion and local religion means polytheism. If I am of a grand family of, uh, let's say the city of Sardis in Asia, minor modern Turkey, and I feel that my ancestors have always been involved in the worship of the goddess Sibley, and I am a voter re or you know, officer or you know, I come member of the governing board of the club or society that runs the cult of Sibley.

Speaker 1:          24:33          I'm going to feel very local, very loyal to that local deity. But if I come from North Africa and I'm in Sardis because that's where my army is a, I'm not going to care about some local no more than, uh, you know, you might care about, um, uh, you know, a club that's important at Yale. If you went to the University of Illinois, no more important than you might feel, uh, about pizza in new haven. If, uh, you know, you came from somewhere else and didn't like the pizza. It's just, it's just like this local cult and, and you know, you don't understand it and you don't care. So the kind of things you will care about, we'll see religiously, but they will tend to be religions that cross borders, like Christianity, religions that are not identified with one place and one God in the sense of local God, local temple. My people.

Speaker 1:          25:38          So into this mess Diocletian you've got high cliche defeats. His predecessor Karina us in battle in two 84 Diocletian as a general into 84 it would have seemed like more of the same, but Diocletian rules until three Oh five and he abdicates, he passes the power to someone else. He is, however, very typical of the military class of the empire. He came from nowhere socially. He was the son of an ex slave from Dalmatia, modern coastal Croatia. You can still see his palace in the Croatian city of Split on the Adriatic. His retirement palace, actually under his severe guidance, the empire was reformed and the way it was reformed was that it was ineffective. Militarized Diocletian was Donna, great general, but he was a brilliant manager and he was a brilliant bureaucratic organizer. I use the term bureaucracy, not too mean inefficient, useless administration, but administration, administration, officers of the state who are capable of doing their jobs or maybe not capable of doing their jobs, but who are nevertheless, I'm not making a value judgment with the term bureaucracy. I simply mean the proliferation of government and government offices. Diocletian is, uh, responsible for the militarization of society that is building society around the army in order to protect it. And he is responsible for a more efficient and ultimately burdened some form of taxation. The two are linked because as we know, you have to pay to have a large and effective military.

Speaker 1:          27:41          Diocletian did not set out to be a revolutionary. His aims were conservative. He wanted to save, preserve, restore the Roman empire of the pre two 35

Speaker 2:          27:56          era.

Speaker 1:          28:01          His methods were radical. He was willing to undertake radical measures and the debate among historians now somewhat muted. Many historians at one time felt that he had basically destroyed the empire. That by making it so bureaucratic, so militarized, so heavy handed in terms of government, it no longer was the Roman empire. It was something else.

Speaker 2:          28:26          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          28:26          The reason this is no longer exactly a considered to be a big problem or a big controversy. You'll see when we come to read Wickham, the Empire has an impress on society. There is what he calls the burden of empire, but it is at the same time not a totalitarian empire that controls everything. Uh, society has an identity that's different from the government.

Speaker 2:          28:54          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          28:55          So he has three goals. One, solving this problem of the imperial succession to stabilizing the economy. Three, protecting the frontiers of these three is actually only really successful in the third, protecting the frontiers. He devises a system that we're going to talk about in a moment of succession, but it does not really outlast him very long. The economy does get fixed, but not the way, not exactly because of his policies. What he's really successful at and what changes most dramatically is what rulership means. That includes the figure of the emperor who becomes more sacred and more powerful in terms of imagery as well as administration changes in the administration of taxes in particular, and then that a goal of his to change and grow the military. The size of the army grew probably doubled maybe just as a ballpark figure from 200,000 troops to 400,000 troops.

Speaker 1:          30:21          This is a major, major increase that had to be paid for and it had to be paid for by taxation and from a population not particularly eager to volunteer to pay more. Ultimately it looks as if Diocletian didn't so much increased taxation as increased the efficiency of its collection. In order to increase the efficiency of his collection, he had to increase the bureaucracy charged with monitoring the taxes and that means first making an inventory of taxable resources. There is no income tax in this society because it's an economy based more on land than on salaries, so you have an income tax is easy because you can keep records of what people are earning. The government to this day finds it much easier to take a portion of your wages because it knows from your company what you're being paid. If you're being paid in some other form like you're a waiter and a lot of your money is in tips, that's harder for the government.

Speaker 1:          31:37          If your wealth is in property, it's hard to put a value on that. You own estates. You have people who are free tenants who rent land from you and pay you in money or produce or labor. You have some slaves. Uh, you have a, uh, watermill um, how do you pay taxes on all of this stuff? The opportunities for evasion are greater. So the first bureaucratic task was just to have a lot of people who could value things, who could come into a territory and say, okay, this farm is worth so much and it has these many people. They develop a system to evaluate productive units of things like land and population and to tax them according to a formula. So I have a lot of land, but it's not very good land. I have a lot of people making a living off it. I will be taxed at a lower rate than someone who has maybe half that land, but twice the people better soil, uh, um, more clearance of forests, whatever the reason it changes. So every 15 years the government changes its estimation.

Speaker 1:          33:05          A second means once you have this taxation system in place of bringing the empire together and dominating it more is to have the army really have a first call on the resources of the state. We now start to have a state supply system for the army alone. This allows the state to avoid dealing with that debased currency. So for example, the state just goes in and takes wind and gives it to the army without taking money, buying weed, giving that to the army. Diocletian binds the empire together also very effectively by a postal system post in this case, meaning a a system of riders, horses, communications that allows the emperor to go faster than anyone else to have news quicker than anyone else to send orders quicker than anyone else. And also more punishment for things like tax evasion. It's not just that people get killed for not paying their taxes or imprisoned or tortured, but the groups are responsible. It's not only that, if I don't pay my taxes, I get punished, but if you and I live in the same village and you don't pay your taxes, I get punished. Or at the very least taxed for the part that you have aided.

Speaker 2:          34:38          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          34:40          but the most important change in government is the establishment of what's called the tetrarchy.

Speaker 2:          34:50          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          34:50          The tetrarchy is the rule of four four rulers. Diocletian divides the empire first into East West, a very significant move that will have consequences for the next 1200 years. He then appoints a co emperor to roll in the West while he rolls in the east.

Speaker 2:          35:23          Okay.

Speaker 1:          35:24          Mh. Mh appoint a helper number three and number four, the emperors, the two emperors are called Aqua sty. Emperors and the helpers are Caesars. So their subordinates to their respective August time and they're supposed to help them. Why this system? This is really to overcome the problems of size, communication, administration. It's a statement that the empire is too big for one man to rule.

Speaker 2:          36:09          Okay.

Speaker 1:          36:12          But the chief emperors are also exalted. Now. There is no longer a pretense that they're just first citizens or princes. They are clothed in purple. They are, don't move a lot in public audiences. And we're familiar with this kind of dichotomy between the political figure as distant authority versus the political figure, at least pretending to be just like you and me. We're in the era of the latter, but Diocletian Yannick period ushers in a period when the emperor is distant glimpsed product of ceremonies wearing a lot of very funny looking, but fancy clothes, he doesn't appear a lot in public. He's a god. Uh, you don't go up to him and shake hands or say hi or you throw yourself at his feet and don't look at him until he tells you to. So the tetrarchy great idea. It really doesn't work because first of all, the emperors don't necessarily cooperate. The seizures don't necessarily cooperate with the emperors. Uh, and um, so in two 85 Diocletian nominates a, um, a uh, Cesar and then makes them into 86 a co Augustus. And this man is named Max Simeon.

Speaker 2:          37:59          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:00          In two 93 Diocletian and Maximilian appoint to Caesar's. I think I'm not going to burden you with, uh, the personnel. I will hand out something, um, on Wednesday that that gives you some of this information. Diocletian and Maximilian appoint Gillary areas in the east, in Constantia constantness in the west. You don't have to remember who these are. And each of them marries a daughter of their respective Augusta. This looks like a great system.

Speaker 2:          38:29          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:29          In three Oh five, Diocletian and Maximilian abdicate. And then these two people become August, died to Caesars, rise up to be August time and they appoint their own new Caesar's. It breaks down beginning in three of six, one of the sons of one of these, Augusta is not appointed and he's mad and he revolts. And then the, um, August I'd dunk get along, uh, out of this chaos between three Oh six and three, 12 emerges one emperor and that is constant team. And we'll be talking about Constantine, uh, on Wednesday. So the tetrarchy fails. Diocletian's second big initiative was over this question of the economy and ways of combating inflation. Diocletian issued a so called edict on prices. The edict on prices attempted to set a fixed price for goods. And if you sold them for more than that, you were to be severely punished.

Speaker 1:          39:45          This is the kind of the classic example of the state trying to combat inflation by dictating prices. Most of you are not familiar with inflation but it is because we have lived in an era of very low interest and a fairly stable prices, but if you think of those commodities who's inflation you are familiar with like petroleum, it is very dislocating. It starts to create panics and the panics then feed into the inflation. Just as if people keep on getting gas because they think that it's going to go up in price. Then there's a greater demand for gasoline and it goes up further in price eventually. If the thing is really just speculative, it deflates again and that's what's happened with products that we're familiar with in recent times, but there is also a kind of structural long term, longer term inflation such as America experience.

Speaker 1:          40:46          For example, in the 70s and in theory if you have resource crises and things that are becoming scarcer than you ought to have more and more experience with inflation. The government in the 1970s in the United States tried also to have an edict on prices. Uh, under President Ford, there was a, uh, kind of, uh, uh, administration of maximum prices. The problem with this is that it creates a temptation for black markets. Creates a version of what we were just talking about with Gresham's law of coinage. If you say that tomatoes can only be sold for a dollar a pound than those tomatoes that are being sold for a dollar a pound in a climate of severe inflation will be terrible, will be rotten. If you want to pay $2 a pound in secret, we have some nice tomatoes for you. And if you want to pay $5 a pound, we have some really nice, you know, uh, uh, locally grown, um, uh, tomatoes for you, all of which may be illegal, but the legal market is empty. And this is what happened in a response to the edict of Pri with of prices. This doesn't mean that the government cannot still remains debatable, obviously the degree to which government can or cannot intervene in such things. But certainly in the case of the Roman Empire, this failed. What did bring back a measure of economic stability is the reform of the taxation. The fact that the state simply started getting in more resources that les was being withheld by private people. And so the state could actually pay for its administrative and military costs.

Speaker 1:          42:46          Diocletian succeeded in abdicating, peacefully spent, uh, his retirement in split in his palace and live to see the breakdown or the partial breakdown of the tetrarchy. And in certain respects, his policies clearly failed. The edict on prices had to be abandoned. The tetrarchy, uh, did not work.

Speaker 2:          43:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          43:14          And Diocletian failed in trying to suppress Christianity. We'll talk about this some more, but Diocletian in the late part of his reign, you know, a couple of animals were split open to see what the future would be. Um, right. Isn't that what we all do? Uh, uh, uh, you know, if you want to figure out kind of what's going to happen, you, you slaughter an animal, an animal, and, and, and check out. It's liver. Maybe it's kidneys and spleen too, but the liver is really which you want to look at. And um, I don't exactly know what the animal was, what the organs were and why they didn't splay out. Right. But the liver told Diocletian that the Christians were responsible for this and that he'd better go after them. So there is this big persecution of Christians in the first part of the fourth century. Um, and uh, he certainly didn't succeed in that. Not only did the Christians not crumble, but of course Diocletian's most effective successor six years after he abdicated would convert to Christianity. But Diocletian is extremely important and in many respects, extremely successful. He did more than prop up a tottering empire.

Speaker 2:          44:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          44:37          He did more than just transform a tottering empire into a kind of tottering tyranny. He saved the Roman Empire. He saved the Roman Empire for a hundred years. When you take a course like this that goes for 700, 800 years, you start to hurl centuries around, uh, and get confused above them. But any polity that exists for a hundred years is fairly impressive or a policy that looks like it's about to collapse and then is restored for a hundred years.

Speaker 2:          45:11          Okay.

Speaker 1:          45:11          The Roman Empire, conventionally speaking, is thought to have collapsed in the West in the late fifth century in the east. However, arguably Diocletian's reforms last for more on the order of 1200 years. The eastern empire, the Byzantine Empire would fall in 1453 and two its last day it was modeled on Diocletian panic, administrative and military forms. People at the time clearly thought that they'd been saved from disaster. If you look at fourth century artifacts, things like mosaics on the floors of dining rooms, people often put mottos there and their mottoes or things like joyful times everywhere or a world restored.

Speaker 1:          46:10          The fourth century is interpretable as an era of increasing gloom because we know that in the fifth century things are going to collapse, but people in the fourth century are not saying to each other, I'm so glad I'm alive in the fourth century cause I don't want to see what's going to happen in the fifth. They're just happy that the barbarians are back across the Danube and the Rhine. The Persians are more or less controlled along the frontier. Yes, taxes are high. Yes, the elite is sort of a riff raff and not as well educated and their military people. Basically things are working. Prosperity is restored to the people who had been prosperous before. You know, the local elites have declined, but uh, it's not so visible as it had been. But there are some changes. Changes that we can with the proverbial benefit of hindsight. See changes in the center of gravity. The dominant places are now places that are military basis. They are great cities with all the amenities of Rome. That is stadiums, gateways. One of the best preserved of these to this day is trickier in Germany.

Speaker 1:          47:31          On the Moselle. Behind the Rhine has a wonderful collection of Roman ruins, a gateway. The port and I grew up, uh, uh, eight um, theater, a sports arena, a basilica, a law court turned into a church. The reason or was great was because of the frontier. There was one of the most important cities in the empire because of the military, because its strategic importance. And there are other cities that are like this. Milan, for example, becomes more important than Rome because Milan is further north. It's a good place to get to the Daniel van to the Rhine quickly, whereas Rome is buried in the Mediterranean. So we're in a new world. We'll discuss more of the new world on Wednesday and we will see the Constantine in some cases, completely revolutionizes things, and in other cases continues Diocletian's work.
