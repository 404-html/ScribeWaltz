Speaker 1:          00:02          Today we're going to talk about Ireland and England, predominantly England. It's not because Ireland isn't important, but because we know less about Ireland, the reason we know relatively more about England in its post Roman period, that is to say after, um, uh, four 20 is uh, because of the historian bead writing in the early 18th century, a monk at a gyro which was a part of a twin monastery in North Umbria, can see on your map the northeastern port part of England before you get to what's now Scotland Bead wrote among other things, a history of the English church and people which is full of miracles and very, very here, no pro Christian as much as Gregory of tour, but is a much more um, easy to follow narrative and a narrative with a certain kind of point. It's about the conversion of England and the establishment of the church.

Speaker 1:          01:19          The other advantage for England over Ireland in terms of evidence is archeology. A lot more has been done with excavating sites in, um, England and by England we mean literally England. The part that is not whales, not Scotland, uh, not Ireland. The part of the British Isles, the ensemble, essentially the two islands are referred to as the British eyes. Britain is England, Scotland and Wales. Ireland is Ireland. Uh, the Britains, however, B r, I t o n s are the collective term for the Celtic population. Celtic is both a linguistic group and a somewhat vague ethnic term. It means the people who were there in the British isles before the Romans came and who were there afterwards fighting invaders from Europe. These invaders who come in the four forties, known as the Anglo Saxons. Bead tells us it's the Anglo Saxon. The Saxons excusing the angles, the Saxons and the jutes.

Speaker 1:          02:37          The angles give their name to England angle land. The jutes we know nothing about. So, you know, certain kind of medievalist uh, we'll go on about founding a journal of Jute Studies, uh, and inviting contributors to something that we really have absolutely no idea. It would be, you know, in that League of smallest, thinnest Vanya items. Um, at least in terms of three dimensional box, uh, the Saxons, uh, come from, there is still a very large part of Germany called Saxony. Uh, what the nature of these peoples are, how they were differentiated among themselves is a source of a lot of Rio or at least looks real scholarship as opposed to studying the glutes. But we don't have to go into that, can need to get the cast of characters, Celts angle Anglo Saxons and the Anglo Saxons conquer much of the island, more or less what would become England. But not all.

Speaker 1:          03:44          They do not conquer Scotland. They do not conquer whales and they don't really conquer cornball. So the western part of Britain remains Celtic. And to this day, whales and Scotland considered themselves different from England can get into a lot of trouble by calling that, uh, area England with the people there. And um, particularly in Scotland there's a possibility that they may separate from the United Kingdom at some point. Ireland Ireland was never occupied by the Romans. Ireland, um, was, caltech was in contact with the Roman Empire but was not part of it. This makes some difference and we'll talk about it when we come to talk about conversion, but it doesn't make as much difference as it sounds because the thing about England or Britain is that the Roman impressed there would be almost wiped out once the Romans withdrew. And so in contrast to what we saw with Gregory of tour and Merovingian Gall Merovingian, uh, Frankish kingdom, the Roman influence in Britain is almost wiped out. Recall what we saw as persistence of Roman practices in the mirror of kingdom bishops, cities, the Latin language

Speaker 1:          05:21          tax records, written legal codes. That is not to say that the mirror of engines weren't, as I said before, to be described by technical terms like thugs or that this was a sleek, well-functioning kingdom. You know, you landed at the airport and, uh, you know, got the train immediately and everything was sleek and nice like Amsterdam or some place like that as opposed to Kennedy. But, uh, that, um, the Roman inheritance was visible and influential in Britain when the Roman troops withdrew to fight, uh, the, um, uh, invaders in Gaul, this ended Roman society and Britain. And the reason for this is partly the Britain was a frontier viewed from the point of view of the Mediterranean, the center of gravity of the Roman empire.

Speaker 2:          06:24          The

Speaker 1:          06:27          frontier symbolized bumps dramatically by walls, the most famous of which is Hadrian's wall, a wall that separated out the barbarians. But since you didn't have a river like the Daniel Board, the Rhine, there seems to be no natural frontier. Remanence of Hadrian's wall are the largest, um, souvenir of the Roman era. A wall to keep out the barbarians from the north because in fact, the Romans didn't conquer the entire island. They conquered the parts they thought were worthwhile and they did think it was worthwhile frontier or not. We know that the Romans built villas might be a little cold, the somewhat open Air Mediterranean plan things, but, uh, you know, mosaic court yards, uh, drank a lot of wine, but to have it imported, uh, built cities, walls, other fortifications, cultivated land. So it's not as if there wasn't a Roman serious Roman province of Britain from its conquest in the late first century until it's abandonment in the early fifth century. But here the invaders tended to obliterate much of what had been there in Roman times and the Celtic population who had been romanized, at least at the elite levels. The Celtic population didn't really save very much from the Roman empire. The Celts, uh, might remain Christian, whereas the invaders were pagan.

Speaker 1:          08:12          But the Celts tended not to have cities or at least large centers

Speaker 1:          08:19          and they tended not to have or retain Roman forms of government. The one kind of, if not literally interesting, at least weird aspect of Celtic Roman resistance is the figure of King Arthur. I'm going to bring them up now and then I'm going to drop him. King Arthur belongs properly to the continuation of this course because his, uh, legendary status starts in the really in the world of romance, of French Romance and then of Romance Chevelle Rick Literature. By romance we mean not, it not only loves stories but novels of Chivalry, of nights of battles. He is a figure who is 99.9% legend. Uh, whatever the remainder of that 0.1% real. And so far as he's real, he may be identified with Celtic resistance to the Anglo Saxon invaders, Celtic Roman resistance in the late fifth, early sixth centuries. But the proportion of art to history in this is if not 99.9, at least. Very, very substantial. So the original setting of the Arthurian stories is that of the resistance to the Anglo Saxon invaders. The, uh, Arthurian romances do have a kind of Celtic begin, well not a kind of, they have a Celtic beginning and then they are our appropriated by people in the romance language tradition French, first of all.

Speaker 1:          10:08          So as what comes says on page one 51, nowhere else in the Roman empire was the collapse of culture, economy and urbanization. So complete. He uses that wonderful phrase again. Uh, radical economic simplification. I, he, uh, you know, there's no more plumbing. There was no more, uh, there's no more sort of a what we would consider to be affluent, civilized society. The ceramics don't come from Africa anymore. The wine doesn't come from France anymore. People are uh, um, reduced to a kind of subsistence or at least most people because as we'll see, some of these kings actually are able to get, uh, some luxury goods from abroad.

Speaker 1:          10:59          If it were just a story of Barbara's aviation, it would be less interesting then in fact, the peculiar nature of England in this period, which goes from being a contested territory between the Germanic invaders and the Celtic population to a kingdom slowly converted in the course of the seventh century to Christianity from paganism to the leading center of Culture in Europe feed who lived from six 73 to seven 35 was the most cultivated scholar in Europe of the early eighth century. And the most cultivated scholar in Europe of the late 18th century was also from England, uh, eloquent counselor and advisor to Charlemagne. How do you go from being a,

Speaker 2:          12:01          uh,

Speaker 1:          12:04          well, I don't like to use the word primitive, but certainly barbarian enough area to having the largest libraries, the, uh, most cultivated a scholars now. It is true. As I think I've said before, that any time you can say that such and such a person was the smartest person in Europe has got to be a fairly bad time, right? In the 19th century, you have your choice from all sorts of scientific literary, uh, um, other kinds of intellectual experts who, who, you know, who would even dare to say, but, um, you know, we know that, but we theists and Casio doors are the smartest guys in Europe in the sixth century because have access to stuff that almost no one else does because they're writing about a classical authors that almost no one else has in their libraries. And we know that Isidore of Seville is probably the smartest guy of the early seventh century.

Speaker 1:          13:05          And visit Gothic Spain, um, because we have his works, we have an idea of what he's read, we know his sources. And again, he's got the biggest library. Biggest library may mean a hundred books, but a hundred books in 780 is a serious collection of knowledge. Now, this is not easy knowledge. This is not, you know, as if everything were, um, uh, well I don't want to say Wikipedia either. Uh, everything, we're kind of like Wikipedia five years ago, um, elementary and often wrong. These aren't very different kinds of works from what might interest us. Certainly a lot of biblical stuff, but also, for example, a lot of computing of time bead would be remembered for the history of the English church and people, but also for a lot of his works on figuring out time. He is credited, although not uniquely credited, but is an important person in the development of the BC, a d scheme. Believe it or not, people are not born into the world calculating according to BC a day, lots of people calculate according to other systems. How did they come up with this? And Moreover, how do they then fit the calendar into it? How do you keep time when you don't have electric or battery operated clocks? How do you know what the seasonal changes?

Speaker 2:          14:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          14:45          But in fact, that most troublesome problem, which had been particularly controversial to the conversion of England in the generation before bead in the early seventh and mid seventh century was the calculation of Easter. Easter is a real problem. Now, naturally, it's not a problem if someone else tells you, if you know, in 1970 you open up a little pocket book calendar and you know, it says, okay, Easter is this day. You trust them. Or now, you know, if you have some feature on your iPhone that gives you Easter for the next 3000 years in case you want to know when Easter is in, uh, you know, 3,500, uh, a d, uh, no problem. But if you're out there in north Umbria or anywhere for that matter in a monastery somewhere where it's really crucial to celebrate it on the right day. Remember what I said about Dogma and religious observation?

Speaker 1:          15:52          God doesn't want you to say something like, dude, I don't really know any Easter is, but I think I'm going to celebrate it. Now you can't do that. You can't just decide. I know it's sort of in the spring, uh, nobody around here for miles and miles and miles, and it was how to calculate it. So what the heck? We'll do it on a Tuesday because I'm busy out in the thumb on what I think is east or something. That's not the way monasticism works. And we'll talk about that next week. The schedule is really, really important, but it's also difficult to figure out and people disagree about it. To this day, the eastern Orthodox churches celebrate a different date for Easter than the western because they operate according to a different calendar. All right, well, so, um, I'm not saying that this is the kind of knowledge that you want to drop everything else to pursue, but it is a kind of knowledge that requires a sort of observation that in fact, we do not have, um, most of us, unless we're astronomy majors, have no idea what the sky looks like at night. Uh, a because we can't see it because of artificial light and be because we're not very curious.

Speaker 1:          17:02          We cannot track animals, most of us. And those of you who can, uh, um, you know, I'm interested in your knowledge. Most of us haven't the faintest idea how things grow except because we've been to the Yale farm and oh my gosh, look at this stuff. Um, you know, that's part of the reason for it because we're not very close to nature. Uh, I think that environmental concerns, not withstanding, most of us have a huge investment in not being too close to nature, but the observation of phenomena is something that is much superior in so-called indigenous primitive, traditional or historical societies.

Speaker 1:          17:57          So the story of England and Ireland centers on conversion. And the reason this is a so is because conversion represents a change in orientation, a change in orientation towards a larger world instead of a kind of tribal and fragmented identity. It's not making, I'm not making a statement about the truth or non truth of Christianity, but about the sense of belonging to a larger world whose purposes encompass not only your group, but a larger group of people out there. And I think we can get a feeling for this from a famous passage of beads, ecclesiastical history written in seven 31 and he is describing events of about a century earlier when King Edwin of North Umbria, someone to council to decide whether or not to accept the Christian God and the chief of the Pagan priests speaks in favor of embracing Christianity even though you would think that he would be the defender of the old faith. He in fact speaks to this assembly according to bead in favor of Christianity on the grounds that it tells us what went before us and what will come after us. And the passage goes like this and one of the kings chief men presently said, thus seems that to me, Oh king, the present life of Man on earth against that time, which is unknown to us is as if you were sitting at a feast with your chief men and your things, your nobles in wintertime, t, h, a. N, e. S

Speaker 1:          19:53          the fire burns and the hole is warm and outside it rains and snows and storms. There comes a sparrow and swiftly flies through the house. The insulation is not great in these halls, right? It comes through one door and it goes out another low in the time in which he is within. He has not touched by the winter storm, but that time is the flash of an eye and the least of times. And he soon passes from winter out to winter again. So is the life of man revealed for a brief space, but what went before and what follows after? We do not know. Therefore, if this teaching can reveal any more certain knowledge, it seems only right. We should follow it. Now, this is not why people necessarily converted because not everybody's really bothered by that. But most people figure, wow, I'm in the hall.

Speaker 1:          21:01          It's warm, it's great. I'm having such a good time. And when I have to leave brief though, it will be, I'll deal with that. Uh, but it does explain some of the appeal of Christianity and why the invaders who were, uh, um, quote pagan converted and indeed why people tend to convert to world religions like Christianity and Islam. To this day, a local religion come calling tribal only because by that I mean confined to a people whose identity is caught up in their religion. A tribal people are a tribal religion has trouble surviving extensive contact with other people,

Speaker 2:          21:49          okay?

Speaker 1:          21:50          Because, um, it's uniqueness is threatened by the realization that there's a huge world out there of lots of other people. And when you start interacting with them, that is when you're no longer isolated, uh, eh, you will tend to seek an explanation for things that is grander than just these gods protect my sphere. This God protects my hearth. This God protects against accidents in childbirth,

Speaker 2:          22:19          okay?

Speaker 1:          22:20          There are exceptions. Judaism is one of the most obvious. Here is a religion of a small group of people that survives, uh, um, over the centuries. Uh, but it is not exactly a tribal religion in the sense that it's monotheistic and historical sense is very strong. And this is what the priest means. Uh, or at least this is what I mean, and interpreting the priests words as reported by bead, by historical sense, a sense that God, uh, rules of the world. Even if I'm not in it, that there is something to come, not necessarily that there is an afterlife, although that obviously is part of the teachings of Christianity, but that there is a kind of a purpose to life. So conversion, the conversions of, um, Ireland and England are different. Um, the process of converting England begins in five 97 with a missionary known. Uh, unfortunately his name is Augustine, Augustine of Canterbury, not Augustine of hippo, the confessions, Augustine, he is sent by the Roman Pope Gregory the first Gregory the great bead tells us that he was motivated to do this. It's a very strange thing to do. There had not been missionaries sent by the pope before, uh, that he was motivated to do this by seeing British boys for sale in the slave market in Rome and asking who they were. He was told they were angles. A Anglos as an Anglo Saxon Aang les, and he is reputed to have said, uh, uh, we should make them angels, not angles. Uh, [inaudible], uh, known, uh, uh, uh, on glee or um, uh, Angel's not ankles.

Speaker 2:          24:29          Okay.

Speaker 1:          24:29          Whatever the story. Augustine arrived around five 97 at an island that had some remanence of Celtic Christianity, but is basically a pagan and barbarian.

Speaker 1:          24:50          He landed in Kent in the southeast corner of the island, closest to the continent. And on this map, what I'd like you to know, particularly our Kent with Canterbury as its capital and the south east west six in the west. So I think I've helpfully underlined Murcia towards the center, North Umbria, northeast, uh, the most important kingdoms in England. And, and what come has emphasized how fragmented this territory was? The most important kingdoms would be at different times, Northumbria show and west sex. But the first place to convert is Kent. It faces the continent. The Pagan Ruler of Kant had actually married a Christian princess from Merovingian Gall and Augustine established the first bishop Rick in Kent at Canterbury, which would be henceforth the major ecclesiastical center of Britain. It's Archbishop Prek bead tells us about this, but he also tells us a lot more about North Umbria, which is where he lived. And here you can see the off again on again, pace of conversion.

Speaker 2:          26:06          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          26:06          the pious King Edwin who had that council that we just described converted his people after a vision. But after his death and six 33, his successor went back to the old traditional religion, renouncing Christianity, and then the successor to that king, a man named Oswald reestablished Christianity. But he was killed in battle by the Pagan King of Mercer. And six 42

Speaker 1:          26:38          only in the six 66, seven days is England pretty definitively converted to Christianity. We can see this kind of transition, uh, in, uh, two of the most famous sources of information about this world. The Poem Beowulf, how many people have read this? Yeah, everybody's read this at one time or another. Beowulf does have some little Christian themes and there is some debate as to what extent the poem is to be understood in Christian terms. But it's atmosphere. It's rituals, the burial and the ship, the burning of the body, the devotion, not only to war, but to feasting and two gold ring giving, uh, it evokes, not merely evokes, it is, uh, a description of a warrior society in which, although it is written in old English, remember that it actually takes place in Denmark. This is a North Sea world in which the communications patterns are such that you could write an English poem about, uh, someone who goes over to the mainland for adventure.

Speaker 1:          28:06          The other source is one of the great archeological triumphs of, uh, the last hundred years. The so called Sutton who treasure, which is in the British Museum, uh, in East Anglia, uh, close to the water, actually close to the sea. A burial ship was found in 1939 probably, uh, the king buried here was, um, uh, red Wald, king of East Anglia, um, uh, who died in six 27. Now it's a pagan burial, uh, because of all the grave goods. You know, all this stuff is in there. Uh, or so it would seem, but it's hard to tell just as in Beowulf, is it pagan? As a Christian, it's hard to tell about this burial scene because he's got a lot of stuff from what might be called foreign gifts or maybe plunder foreign gifts. He's got two Byzantines silver spoons, so two silver spoons made in Constantinople or thereabouts.

Speaker 1:          29:24          He's got gold coins. They're mostly from the Merovingian kingdom. And they, they're, they're different. They're all different. This is not an economic thing. This is a treasure thing, right? The difference between economy and treasure is that treasure is just for hoarding and economy is fluid and transactional. The hoarding, of course we see in Beowulf most obviously with the Dragon, the dragon is not accumulating the treasure in order to safeguard his retirement know or, or a trade up in caves. Um, he just sleeps on this tracer. And the point of that is, of course, the people accumulate treasure for noneconomic reasons, uh, for reasons that have to do with their own satisfaction or their own, uh, anxieties. And the utility of treasure is generally overestimated. Nevertheless, of course, at the same time, this is a world in which gold treasure accumulation is what men do.

Speaker 2:          30:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          30:38          Uh, so what else is at Sutton who a wonderful helmet, a unique in because these, these things tend to disintegrate a, a sword.

Speaker 2:          30:50          Okay.

Speaker 1:          30:51          A male shirt. Um, and then all sorts of little paraphernalia. Some of it with Christian symbols like crosses some of it very much, uh, in the pagan kind of a, um, world. Beowulf and Sutton who go together, they both show us a world of treasure of weapons, uh, of drinking halls of palaces, sort of isolated. The drinking hall is important as you know from Beowulf. It is, uh, the manifestation of civilization. It is that protection from outside that bade just be described in the little sparrow anecdote, but it is also the center of government. We're back to the ruler and his entourage or come and talk to us, his gang, if you want to put a more cynical coloration on it. So the conversion of England is completed by the late seventh century, but it is a more complicated story than just monolithic Christianity versus monolithic paganism. Because there are two kinds of Christianity that seek to convert and Glen, one from Ireland and one from Rome,

Speaker 1:          32:22          Ireland. Let's just pause over Ireland never part of the Roman empire as I said, but it's also the first place outside the Roman world to have been converted to Christianity. The first place in Europe, actually the first place period is Ethiopia. Ethiopia of course in North Eastern Africa would be converted to Christianity. Uh, very early fourth century. Hey d probably, but within Europe, Ireland was converted to Christianity. Um, uh, by, um, the British or English missionary Saint Patrick. Um, this is, uh, a little embarrassing, but in fact the, the apostle to Ireland is a one of those British Celtic, Roman fourth century figures, Patrick. So in 600 a d Ireland was largely Catholic. Well, England was mostly pagan.

Speaker 1:          33:31          Irish Christianity had certain peculiarities, some of them related to its lack of a Roman past. Thus, for example, it did not have bishops really, or the bishops were weak because there had not been cities in Ireland on the Roman model. And therefore, Christianity didn't have an urban background, but rather a very decentralized and rural background. The most powerful institutions in Ireland were monasteries because these were great rural centers. And also the monks ruled over the bishops. Generally, Irish monasticism was very austere. The Irish monks were more aesthetic. Van Amongst, we'll be meeting next week from the Benedictine tradition started in Italy, and they also were less fixed in one place.

Speaker 2:          34:28          Okay?

Speaker 1:          34:30          In Benedictine Monasticism, you're not supposed to move. You're supposed to be stable. You're supposed to go through the same routine every day. The Irish favored a more wandering existence and the establishment of little communities or colonies, far away, the Irish form of piety emphasizes exile. And it might be exile, too scary and almost unimaginable kind of environment. There are, for example, lots of little islands in the Irish Sea, uh, that seem to be uninhabitable. That is, if you look at them from the, the tour boat, you see a lot of birds and you know, it's birder's paradise. But you know, in the middle of July it's overcast and raining and the sea is pounding. And then you notice the little remanence of houses. Yup. Uh, question Oh, a little caves. Uh, where people in the sixth and seventh lived or the island is tiny, you know, a smaller than this building and there, you know, it looks like 20 people were living there.

Speaker 1:          35:45          What are they living on? Well, poultry I guess, but, uh, um, uh, this is a very severe form of a sudden as Satta system. And the wondering also can mean just holing up on some island or wandering around the European con continent and converting people. The Irish were great missionaries both to England and to the continent. And we'll be talking about that some more. What about the, um, the Irish as the saviors of civilization? A book published about eight, nine years ago, uh, how the Irish saved civilization is like all such, well, most sucky popular books, um, kind of overdone and reductionist. Um, it's not literally exactly true, but here again, as with England, we have a society that had no Roman influence and yet had a, a highly developed tradition of learning, preservation of Latin in part very good knowledge of Latin because they didn't think they spoke it. Remember we said the PM people in the former Roman empire, it's hard to date the point at which someone in Spain, uh, is no longer speaking Latin, but it's speaking something that we can start to call Spanish and Ireland. The distinction was quite clear. You had to learn Latin in lessons. You had to go to class, you had to be taught Latin. And so the Latin that was taught was bookish. Uh, but for that, um, uh, in many respects correct.

Speaker 1:          37:25          Finally, the, uh, Irish celebrated Easter according to a different calendar. Um, and so we refer to the Irish or the Celtic church. We mean this more decentralized church, there's somewhat more wandering missionary church, uh, a, a church that was less hierarchical and less organized around bishops than that of its rival Rome. The story of the seventh century in England is therefore partly the story of competition between paganism and Christianity and flip flopping between them and competition between Irish Christianity represented by, for example, the monastery of Iona in what's now Scotland. I o n a a the missions of Saint Iden, a I d a n whom bead describes with great sympathy even though he doesn't agree with him, but the controversy really centered ultimately or at least, um, in an immediate sense over Easter at the Senate of in six 64.

Speaker 2:          38:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:48          It was decided to embrace the Roman calculation of Easter and we're that bishops hierarchy, a more organized church. I have a lot of trouble with this Easter problem. I mean, you will have noticed that I've evaded telling you exactly what the calculations are. Some of you may know much better than me, but um, the Jewish Passover is established by lunar months. Christians wanted to break with Jewish tradition and celebrating east year, uh, uh, uh, according to a somewhat different calendar. So it combined lunar and solar methods of calculation, very complex operation. Therefore, in a year for 55, Rome, that is to say the papacy under our friendly, over the first, uh, mission to the huns, um, definition of the two natures of Christ. Leo The first, uh, and Rome opted for a 19 year cycle of calculating Easter, but the Celtic churches cut off from the continent.

Speaker 1:          39:51          Remember, we're in this, uh, uh, post Roman world have very little contact, kept an 84 year cycle. So in the seventh century when the Roman missionaries had arrived again, you have two conflicting dates for Easter every year. I mean, occasionally just as with the Orthodox and Catholic Easters, they come together. So every so often I will actually be the same Sunday, but generally speaking different. And so you get these ludicrous scenes like king us, we have North Umbria celebrating Easter according to the Celtic tradition. And his wife who was from Kent celebrated according to the Roman tradition. So one Sunday was Celtic Easter and then the next Sunday was Roman eastern.

Speaker 2:          40:41          Okay.

Speaker 1:          40:42          So it's not so much that Easter is so important intrinsically, but it is a symbol of the embrace of the Roman, uh, form of Christianity and the bringing of England into an orientation more towards the continent. Then towards the Celtic West. What is amazing, as I said before, is how quickly once the conversion takes place, England becomes not only integrated into the continent, but a place of, uh, a great cultural accomplishment. The Great Archbishop of Canterbury of this post with B era Theodore, archbishop of Canterbury, six 69 to six 90 established bishoprics monasteries and endowed them with books. Theodore is an interesting character. He's actually from Syria.

Speaker 2:          41:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          41:39          And how somebody from Syria becomes Archbishop of Canterbury, something that would be very unlikely now in the seventh century, a d a is an aspect of some preservation of the outlines of the cosmopolitan Roman world that we began the course web. There are a lot of Syrian pope's at this time, two Syrian and Greek popes from the eastern Mediterranean.

Speaker 2:          42:09          The

Speaker 1:          42:10          first manuscript we have of the Bible as a single manuscript. In other words, we're, all of the books of the Bible are contained in the same volume is from this place and this era, the so called Codex Amiya, Tina's,

Speaker 2:          42:28          okay.

Speaker 1:          42:37          A magnificently decorated by ball.

Speaker 2:          42:41          Okay.

Speaker 1:          42:42          Sent to the pope in seven 16 written at beads, monastery of Gero. Now in Florence at the metallurgy Lorencia and library of Florence.

Speaker 2:          42:58          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          42:59          it is decorated in this very distinctive style, but you all know of if not, uh, um, from courses from Christmas cards and stuff. The book of Kells is the most famous example of this. This is the so called enchilada style because it's shared by both Celtic Ireland and Anglo Saxon England. Lots of intricate curlicues, complicated animals, a magnificent contracts of color, a kind of abstraction. When you first look at it, it looks like an oriental carpet, but in fact, if you look at it a little more closely, you can see that there are all sorts of little intertwining, uh, animals, uh, or, uh, fantastic shapes and colors within it. Questions, problems. We could spend an entire semester on, uh, England. But, uh, I think we've had at least a taste of it's significance, both in its own right and as one more and rather different aspect of the post Roman world that we've been occupied with. I'll see you for the exam on Monday.
