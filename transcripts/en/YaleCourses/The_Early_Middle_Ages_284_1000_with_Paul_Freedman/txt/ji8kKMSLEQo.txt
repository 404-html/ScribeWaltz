Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. In seven 43 Oh, civil war started among, within the [inaudible] had family over, uh, the Khalif for succession. This war broke out in Persia, which is a little unusual because until this point, the subversive discontented prodo Shiite region had been what, uh, is called Kufa Kuf a basically southern Iraq as an owl is, uh, it's thought that this revolt against the Umayyads had the support of the [inaudible] and it makes sense that if it was in Persia, the largest non Arab Muslim country, it makes sense that you would have the most concentration of non Arab Muslims. That is to say converts or the descendants of converts who might feel that the egalitarian promises of Islam had been betrayed. And that in fact the, uh, religion was an Arab, uh, one in which non Arabs were in a subordinate position. The non Arab Muslims of Persia had converted some from Christianity. Most from Zoroastrianism, a, uh, uh, religion of Central Asia, uh, Wickham takes issue with this.

Speaker 1:          01:31          Uh, if you go back to your reading pages to 92, to two 94, he says, um, uh, that, uh, he doesn't think that, uh, the discontent was related to somehow the Omi is being an excessively Arab rather than Muslim dynasty. Um, uh, or that they provoke discontent among recent converts. So this is an open question. I think there's gotta be some Awali a discontent. But as we've seen already, there's plenty of discontent. Shiite Sunni being the most obvious intertribal regional problems of holding this empire together at any way rate. Um, uh, the, uh, um, uh, in seven 49, seven 50, uh, the [inaudible] had Colloff was deposed by a member of another family known as the Abbasids. This new column, a boy out about us. I boss the, the opposites, the opposites. We're early followers of Mohammed, although not particularly heroic ones. Oh, I'm the family had been supporters but hadn't taken very many risks. So the Bostons or not eeros though, they were an old family.

Speaker 2:          03:09          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:11          The Abbasids came to power with support from the Shiites. This is what Wickham means by what he calls their salvationist theology. Salvationist meaning that they were, uh, going to restore the religious fervor that the Umayyads had dissipated so that they were originally supposed to represent a return. I reformation of Islam too. It's austere routes in which the college was a modest clean living austere figure. They very quickly, if that was the hope of the Shiites, the opposite is very, very quickly to trade this. They, um, they moved their capital from Damascus, the Umayyad capital to a new city that they constructed in the desert. Baghdad. A city built in concentric circles as a planned round fortress city, but also commercial city and of course predominantly city of administration. It was located 30 miles from the old Persian capitol. Persian empire was ruled from Tessa Fon.

Speaker 1:          04:44          Relocating the capital of the caliphate to Baghdad has a number of obvious implications. While most historians would not be quite as confident as Peter Brown, whom you're reading for Wednesday, is that this represents the Persian ization of the caliphate. It is certainly true that moving the Capitol to modern Iran, uh, modern Iraq to the Mesopotamian part of the former Persian empire orients the califate further to the east. It changes the center of gravity of the caliphate from the Mediterranean as in Damascus to um, uh, basically to Persia, India, the lands between them, modern Afghanistan, Pakistan, at least those are as important if not more so now than the Mediterranean. Even though the empire stretches from the Indus River to the Atlantic, it's center of gravity has clearly shifted. This has implications also for culture as we'll talk about in a moment. The accomplishment of the opposite caliphate in terms of culture is to bring together realms that had not been

Speaker 2:          06:14          okay

Speaker 1:          06:14          in very much contact with each other. Certainly not in terms of ideas, namely India, Persia and the Roman empire or the former medic. Uh, empire of the Mediterranean east purchase stands in the middle between India and the West. To the extent that Persia is not a isolated empire of its own, but a crossroads. This means that there's all this exchange of information, techniques, science, art and culture. But most of all, the establishment of Baghdad clearly means a different kind of rulership. One that it does not break with the [inaudible] but rather to some extent, um, uh, elaborates on it. This is an empire. It is not a kind of sacred kingdom of people living in tents.

Speaker 2:          07:09          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:10          This is an empire more open to eastern influences. That is to say somewhat more Persian in its style, less Mediterranean. Um, and originally more Shiite.

Speaker 2:          07:28          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:29          So the significance of the opposite takeover is really basically two fold. One is this move east to Baghdad with all that, it symbolizes that I just got through saying the influence of non Muslim, uh, non Arab Muslims and the creation of a complex administration and even more complex administration than that of the Mayans. And then two, it shows the influence of the Shiites. This begins is a Shiite victory. But uh, very quickly the Shiites, as I said, are disillusioned. And so it also shows the limitations of the Shiites. The Shiites don't just want a non Arab dominated Islamic world. They want what we called last week, a Republican administration on non monarchical polity. And the opposites are monarchical if there anything until the early 10th century when the opposite Caliphate starts to break up. Uh, the, uh, uh, world of Islam was splendid, rich, cultivated and scientifically, uh, progressive.

Speaker 1:          08:38          There would be no more great conquests, particularly in the West, all ready before the opposites took power. We've pointed to two moments in which the Arab expansion or the Islamic expansion was stopped. One in seven, 17 before the walls of Constantinople in the failed siege of Constantinople to the battle of Poitier, not that far from Paris in northern France in seven 33. A battle at which the Merovingians or really their high servants, um, so called mayors of the palace defeated Arab Raiders, um, who then retreated basically back to Spain. To some extent, these defeats in the West. We're not so much defeats from the Caliphs point of view as a reorientation in seven 50. Moving the capital back to Baghdad. The capital to Baghdad from Damascus also means less interest in the west. Less interest in trying to take over France if that was ever a serious goal, less interest in besieging Constantinople.

Speaker 1:          09:54          The opposites begin by inviting all of the Umayyad survivors to a banquet, supposed to be a banquet of reconciliation, and instead they had their servitors kill all of the [inaudible] at the dinner table, spread a leather cloth over the, um, some of them were already dead, some of them merely wounded. Um, and with the leather cloth over them, a set the table again and banquet on there, a dead and dying, uh, enemies satisfying. Definitely. Um, one whom I had escaped, uh, not from the banquet, but he had had the foresight to say he was busy, uh, and he escaped as far as he could go in the Muslim world, namely Spain. The last [inaudible] then, um, Abdur Rahman came to Spain and was a claimed by the population or got himself to be a claimed by the population and ruled in Spain as the first Islamic ruler to defy the califate. Thus, the first independent Islamic kingdom, we can call it, although they don't use that term, the first independent Islamic kingdom independent of the caliphate would be Spain. The Omi had ruler actually recognized by Dodd. He did not proclaim himself arrival caliph. It was easy for him to recognize Baghdad 3000 miles away or whatever it is. Uh, they weren't going to come and get him. He took the title of Emea. Emi are, uh, a ruler who is, um, it's more like a title of a governor than that of a king. Nevertheless, as I said, um, Islamic Spain represents the first piece of the Cali Fall Empire to break off

Speaker 1:          11:57          when the opposite califit ran into trouble in the early 10th century. Then the Umayyad ruler of Spain proclaimed himself college in nine 29, he proclaimed himself caliph of Cordoba Cordova was the capital of [inaudible] Spain. And so at this point, Spain becomes the most splendid, most cultivated part of the Islamic world. So if the period of the maximum power and splendor of the opposite caliphate was roughly seven 50 to nine, 10, the period of maximum splendor of the caliphate of Cordoba in all under loose or Spain was about eight 52, it's sudden collapse in 1009.

Speaker 2:          12:55          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:56          Questions? Problems? A lot of names here. No, you don't have a final exam. So what do you care? But I realize it is, um, uh, a dramatic story, but one with a large cast of characters by now you're used to this in history. Um, whether these are good cat names or not, I'm not as sure as I am with the barbarians, uh, but worth experiments as Wickham has described, the Abbasid Caliphate was based on tax collection and administration. And your response to that may be, uh, yeah, well, so what, um, but that's not true of all the states that we've been studying. If you take something like mirror eventual goal, even though in the early period they're still collecting taxes. Remember Fred or gun tells chill Peric let's burn these tax records and maybe our sons will be cured of their disease by God. Uh, but you'll have seen in Gregory a tour that basically the mirror of engines are rich because of plunder, military expeditions and land land above all is the source of wealth in the kingdoms of Western Europe land and the peasants to till it obviously it's no good if it's just empty land, usually not least.

Speaker 1:          14:18          It's productive land and this is the source of wealth. Therefore, the state gains its wealth on the basis of things like land, military power, and not on the basis of taxing and economy that is more sluggish, has less trade, less income than in the uh, uh, cities of the Muslim world.

Speaker 2:          14:45          Okay.

Speaker 1:          14:46          The Caliphate was a tax paying state with a central army. Therefore, the nobility as such as it was, was not a group of local potentates as they had been under the late Roman empire. Great landowners for example. Nor was it a military elite cuase I independent whose loyalty to the ruler was conditional on their own interest. As we've seen with the Merovingian, um, uh, nights rather, it was a complicated administration served as a structure of a vast empire and the tax revenue came into the college whose administration, who's civilian administration, was supreme over army, over local elites, over great land owners. At least for a time. The opposite empire was the greatest state in the world at that time. It's only rival, might've been Tang China, but this is the period of the decline of that empire bogged Dodd was the wealthiest and largest city in the world.

Speaker 2:          16:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:08          Among the programs of the Abbasids in addition to building this plan city, uh, um, creating a certain kind of military structure, consolidating their conquest among their plans was a cultural program. The cultural flowering of the Abbasid Caliphate is in part a planned flowering, not just a spontaneous one. The Caliphs funded translations into Arabic of Greek and Persian texts dealing with science, geography, mathematics, philosophy, and medicine in particular in eight 30, one of the columns established in Baghdad, a kind of combination of library and Research Institute called the House of Wisdom.

Speaker 2:          17:07          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:08          The House of wisdom in the first place, paid for and sponsored translations, but it also conducted research activities, things like an effort to measure the circumference of the earth.

Speaker 2:          17:28          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:28          Kind of thing that, you know, how do you actually do that without modern instrumentation? A lot of the material that they, um, translated was from Greek scientific works.

Speaker 1:          17:53          Where did they get these? In some cases they got them from Byzantium, from Constantinople itself. It said that one treaty between Constantinople and Baghdad cold for, among other things, um, the Byzantine emperor to lend to Baghdad, a copy of Ptolemies geography. Ptolemy, the, uh, one of the great geographers of the ancient world, a author of a book called the great geography known in the West. Later on when it was translated into Latin from the Arabic as the Alma guest, which is a Arab garb, Latin garbling of an Arab garbling of the original Greek title of the work. So this was known in the West even when it was translated into Latin as the Alma guest. And it was just one of many works that when they finally reached Western Europe in translations from the Arabic kept a kind of version of their Arabic name. But the idea that as part of a treaty, one of the things was you lend us this, uh, uh, copy of Ptolemy so that we can translate it into Arabic shows, the commitment of the rulers to the expansion of practical knowledge. What Islamic scholars, scientists and policymakers were most interested in from the classical world that is from the world of the Greek and Roman civilization was science, broadly speaking, science. They were less concerned with Greek plays, Greek poetry, Greek literature in general. This is partly because they had their own poetic tradition in Arabic and partly because they're real source of inspiration for literature would be Persia. Uh, the stories as in the Arabian Nights, uh, and the kind of lyrical poetry, uh, of the Arabs like love poetry or sensuous poetry, uh, is either homegrown or Persian.

Speaker 2:          20:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          20:05          So they translated things like Euclid on geometry or the physician Daya score at ease, uh, who wrote, not the only, but the leading pharmaceutical manual, pharmaceutical manual list of drugs, their properties, what they come from, what they can cure. However, although they concentrated on science, they also were interested in philosophy. They were also interested in propositions. The Lenten nature of reality, metaphysics. And the major project in this realm was the translation of Aristotle. Aristotle is someone who wrote on everything on drama, poetry, politics, metaphysics, ethics, animals, physics.

Speaker 1:          21:18          And so his influence would be tremendous in all three religions that we are concerned with, Islam, Christianity and Judaism. His influence tends to be interrelated. Realms are factors. One is its comprehensiveness. They didn't translate everything of Aristotle's, but all three civilizations were aware of Aristotle as a universal thinker. That somewhere in the work of Aristotle, there's something about everything that's worth studying. He has then an encyclopedic thinker in a way that Plato is not right. Plato is not interested in the natural world. If you go to Plato for information about animals or plants, you're going to be out of luck because Plato despises things like that. Plato's very interested in ethics in how to live life in reality, in the relationship between matter and spirit. Um, but he's not a scientist. Um, he, uh, uh, to put it mildly, he's not interested in the material world, whereas Aristotle believes that the material world, although not necessarily the be all and end all of everything is reliable, that our senses can give us decent information. But observation of the natural world leads to more than merely practical knowledge, if you know, say how to plow or how to plant things. Uh, but leads to knowledge of what creation, what nature. Uh, yes.

Speaker 1:          22:53          So Aristotle, his encyclopedic, and he's also rational. This is the second contribution that Aristotle makes. Rationality that anything from plays to, uh, rocks can be understood in terms of a logical analysis. This is fine when it comes to plays and rocks, but what about metaphysics? What about the world of religion? Aristotle has a profound influence here, again, not only on Islam but on Judaism and Christianity because he essentially encourages a rational view of God. Now, Aristotle is himself not much of a theist. That is to say Aristotle doesn't go on about God very much and whatever God there is an Aristotle is not a personal God to who you would prey on the assumption or in the belief that he was interested in your wellbeing. The closest Aristotle gets to God is the notion of a kind of great mechanic, the prime mover as he would be called in western philosophy.

Speaker 1:          24:11          The guy who makes the mechanism, sets it going and maybe every so often maintains it. Maybe little oil here, a little bit of timing there, but he's not the god of Gregory of tour. He's not the God who is inspiring saints to get revenge when their powers or questioned or when somebody steals. Hey, from there, this is not Aristotle's God. Aristotle's God is not concerned with our little petty squabbles. Uh, it's not Mohammed's God exactly either. A, it's not a god who brings victory in battle, who's interested in a new prophecy that will seal all the previous profits. It's a somewhat mechanistic God. It's an 18th century God. Even a sort of deist God. For those of you who have studied that, the notion, you know, uh, uh, that, um, uh, the world must've been created by God because it has a lot of design in it.

Speaker 1:          25:25          It works. You know, it has a, uh, one animal gives birth to another animal just like it. You know, the tides go in and out. The weather is usually rational. Uh, winter is usually cold. Halloween is usually crisp. Um, uh, that's imposed by some kind of original order. Just like if you went and found a watch on a deserted pathway, you wouldn't assume that nature had constructed the watch, that it just was growing there, the way the ferns were growing by the path you would assume some artificer had been. But that doesn't mean that the artifice or is still alive, still interested in the watch, uh, inclined to take care of you. I go on this detour or seeming detour about Aristotle because he's important to everything in the period that we're discussing. And also in the period of that is concerned for the West in the continuation of this course in history to 11, there are three thinkers just to take examples. The most famous thinkers in each of the Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions who embrace Aristotle. And in doing so, embrace the idea of as a rational, um, companion to ma'am, these are the Arab philosopher known in the West as a Vero, as cure. Again, as with all my guests were using his sort of Latin garbled name of fairways active in Spain, 1126 to 1198. My monities,

Speaker 1:          27:12          perhaps the greatest Jewish philosopher, a rabbi, a physician accordia and a philosopher, also active in Spain. Uh, but also in Egypt, 1135 to 1204 and Thomas Aquinas.

Speaker 2:          27:34          Okay.

Speaker 1:          27:36          You spent most of his career teaching at the University of Paris 1225 to 1274. All of these thinkers embraced Aristotle, the Latin ones, um, uh, like Aquinas, uh, via translations from the Arabic. Aristotle was known in the medieval west, not from the Greek originals, but from translations made from Arabic into Latin. All believed that reason and faith are compatible all base, their outlook not only on nature, but on God, on an heiress cotillion form of knowledge.

Speaker 2:          28:21          Interesting

Speaker 1:          28:23          in that Aristotle knew nothing about Judaism, Christianity or Islam.

Speaker 2:          28:28          Huh?

Speaker 1:          28:36          So what is the, in about Aristotle, what is it about dive securities? What is it about Tommy? All of these scientists and philosophers that is of such fascination to the Islamic world. All of this emphasis that we've made on Islamic culture and its openness to other influences may seem strange to you. In light of the reputation Islam has in modern America, or at least in many circles of modern America and Europe as being obscure, ramp test or anti modern or religiously inflexible. Uh, I teach, uh, a group of, uh, retired people in where I live in just outside New York. Uh, and we're studying, um, Islamic Spain and they're like astounded at w what I've just described at the openness of Islam to other civilizations at its tolerance at, it's a curiosity about classical and Persian science. And I was surprised because this is not new information.

Speaker 1:          29:51          This is not something that historians have just come up with and just discovered. If you read medieval history textbooks of 100 years ago, it's in there. Everybody knows that Aristotle was translated from Arabic into Latin. Everybody knows everybody who studied the of the Middle Ages knows. And I said to them, because you know, you can't say to older people, oh, well, you know, your education is, uh, is uh, uh, actually not very good. The way we say to you right all the time or your attention span is not very good because all, you know, all, all you're doing is you're, you're plugged into uh, uh, your, uh, your social world. No, these people went to college and the tough old days I'd legitly and they're like, God, I thought Islam was just, I thought it was just like this sort of frozen religion that had never changed.

Speaker 1:          30:43          And so, um, you don't have that disadvantage. You don't have that idea. And so I'm not going to brow beat you with it on the basis of the experience of teaching 70 year olds. Uh, but there it is. Um, I do not accept the notion well with one exception, with one honorable exception. Um, right. Right. Me Too. So, um, uh, I don't want to go into a long discussion about, you know, Islam right or wrong or Islam progressive or regressive. I will say this. Uh, there are those who believe wrongly in my opinion, that there's always been this clash of civilization as it's sometimes called between the Progressive Christian West and the, uh, obscurantist Islamic East. I don't accept that in part for reasons you've just heard. There is no a consistent Islamic tradition, uh, of, um, of the maintenance of Dogma or the conversion of the world by force in so far as that exists now.

Speaker 1:          31:51          Uh, it is, in my opinion, a modern phenomenon. It is a phenomenon that results from an encounter with the West beginning around the time of Napoleon's conquest of Egypt. Perhaps it's about two centuries old. There's another kind of belief that at some point things changed. And there's a book by Bernard Lewis, the most eminent western scholar of Islamic culture called what went wrong. And so Louis's assumption is that the world that I'm describing, the opposite caliphate is an open society. And at some point, and for some reasons, uh, the Islamic world closed itself, became less susceptible to outside influence, more suspicious of it, more dogmatic, more anti modern, more fixated on literalism what in the West during the question traditionally be called fundamentalism. Uh, and, uh, on, uh, tradition. Uh, I don't really like this either because it sees all progress as the property of Western civilization.

Speaker 1:          33:01          Uh, and it's not that I am not interested in western civilization. I've taught it, I taught it because I liked it. Uh, I'm not somebody who, you know, uh, believes that it's all a tale of oppression. Uh, but I don't think that anybody who diverts from the path of Western civilization at some point is, you know, um, uh, going off the cliff or off the trail and into the woods, there are a lot of different civilizations out there. There's a third related idea that the Arabs are just intermediaries. Yeah, it's great. They translate Aristotle so that the real guys who can really use Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, that all can, can get started. And I don't accept that either because, uh, uh, they do more than that. They do an awful lot of original research and medicine in mathematics, in philosophy.

Speaker 1:          34:00          But within all of this, to my mind, fruitless speculation, there is a kernel of what is an interesting problem. And the interesting problem is why were the Arabs so much more successful in assimilating conquered cultures than other invaders were? Say for example, the Germans, you don't get this kind of a efflorescence of culture under the barbarian occupants of the former Roman empire. We're talking not just about cultural survival, keep in mind, but about uh, um, a, an expansion of science and uh, allied arts. I'd say there are maybe four factors that encourage the Arab conquest to absorb these new influences and they're not in themselves explanations, but they're certainly background factors. The fact that the conquest was quick and relatively painless and then it was not really a religious war. Two and I think here, very important, the elimination of frontiers. I mentioned this briefly before, you get Persian as well as Greek astronomy from India. You get things like chess, so-called Arabic numerals, [inaudible] we all know come from India. These come into the Arab and Persian worlds from India and eventually to Europe as well. In a world in which there are no frontiers between India and uh, North Africa, you can go, uh, these thousands of miles peacefully.

Speaker 1:          36:01          The elimination of linguistic boundaries, Arab [inaudible], the language of learning much as Latin would be, uh, in the European Middle Ages, much as English has tended to become in our era.

Speaker 2:          36:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          36:16          So my monities, the great Jewish philosopher wrote largely in Arabic, the Christians of Spain, so called Mozarabic Christians, uh, studied Arabic, fought in Arabic, wrote in Arabic. And finally, number four, the attitude of the conquerors and the conquered the attitude of the conquerors was, um, what Peter Brown and the reading for Wednesday, we'll call a garden protected by our spirit. Since this is a quote from one of the concours, the Arab concours considered these to be wonderful civilizations that they were not going to pillage or destroy, but rather protect a garden protected by our spears. But they were planning on enjoying the garden, not merely standing on the outside defending it for other people to enjoy the conquerors. We're confident in their religion, so confident, but they didn't need for others to recognize it or convert. It also gave them the confidence to accept new ideas from Greek civilization, from Persian civilization, from India. But there's also the attitude of the conquered. Brown says that as the storm of the Arab armies rolled over the horizon, the population of the Near East sat back to enjoy the sunshine. The Islamic conquest was of benefit and perceived as of benefit by most of the people who were conquered.

Speaker 1:          38:09          A kind of counter example in a way explains this. In Cordova, the Capitol of the Umayyad Caliphate of uh, or soon to be colorful of um, uh, Spain. A group of Christians around eight 50 were so upset at the, um, contented attitude of the Christians of Islamic Spain who were, if not a majority, probably about 50%, close to 50% of this time, these more fanatical, or at least more serious Christians were so angry that all of their compatriots seem to be just fine with Islamic rule. That they got up in the marketplace of Cordova and denounced Mohammed as a charlatan, as a false god, and as not a prophet. And while Islam is tolerant, that is something that you couldn't do a, so they did, you know, the thing that was most defiant of the regime, really the moral equivalent of like burning yourself, uh, in the marketplace.

Speaker 1:          39:17          And indeed they were imprisoned, told to recant. And when they didn't recant, they were executed. Uh, there are about 50 of these martyrs of Cordova as they're called, but they have to seek martyrdom because they have to look for it. They have to create it because almost all the rest of their compatriots are perfectly happy to be most Arabic Christians practicing the freedom of their religion under a beneficence regime, beneficence in the eyes of these martyr Christians. But nevertheless, uh, uh, you know, uh, the, uh, a regime of the devil. This shows you something about the nature of the Arab conquest and occupation. Uh, let me just speak briefly about a couple of aspects of what the, uh, Islamic world was interested in studying. Uh, and we may continue over into next time, uh, since the lecture on the seventh centuries actually rather short. Uh, let's start with mathematics.

Speaker 1:          40:22          The great accomplishment of this time is the introduction of Arabic numbers, which if you've ever tried to multiply or divide with Roman numerals are superior Arabic numbers come from India. And along with this system of numerals, they imported zero, both of the number or the non number and the concept, the concept of zero allows for things like decimal places, which are also developed at this time from India. The Arabs get the kind of very basic ideas of trigonometry, the sine function, but it is their own researches, their own progress that leads to the call it discovery or development of the five other functions. And here I'm on kind of tricky ground because despite what they tell you about math literacy and how important it is, I haven't used this since 10th grade, but I do remember the co-sign, the tangent, the Cotangent, the sea Canton, the Cosi camp, right? All of these are discovered by the Arabs. Hey, they are, they built on an edifice, uh, whose foundation is Indian mathematics in the early ninth century, a scholar attached to that house of wisdom in Baghdad named all a quorum. Zane inquiries me around there.

Speaker 2:          42:04          Okay.

Speaker 1:          42:05          Quarries mean in the early ninth century, Alcor reads me, writes a book with the title that can be translated as something like the book of addition and subtraction according to the Hindu calculation. And this is what it incorporates, zero and decimal places. And interestingly enough, this book is known only from its translation into Latin. The Latin version survives where's the original Arabic does not.

Speaker 2:          42:34          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          42:36          Within a century of the publication of this book, a decimal fractions had been developed. Square roots. The value of Pi to 16 decimal places had been calculated at quarries. Me is also the author of a treatise on Algebra. The word Algebra comes from Al Jabbar, uh, which is sort of restoring, restoring something that has been in balance and that you're now going to balance with of courses in a way, the visual nature of Algebra all Cory's me, it was also an astronomer. He developed star tables that allowed one to locate the planets and stars at different times of year and at different latitudes. This is what allows the making of things like astrolabs or later sexton's. These are things that describe the sky at a particular time that allow you then to keep time and also, um, to navigate,

Speaker 2:          43:45          okay.

Speaker 1:          43:46          To calculate time for things like prayers or feasts, celebrations, also to cast horoscopes. I'll work a little more with you on geography, medicine, and then, um, summer runs the Abbasids at the beginning of our next class. Uh, so I'll let you go for now. Thanks.
