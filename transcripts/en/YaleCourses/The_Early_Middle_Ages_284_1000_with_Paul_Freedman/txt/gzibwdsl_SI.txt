Speaker 1:          00:01          Good morning questions or problems. So today, this week we begin to talk more seriously about religion. And I remind you, we're talking about Christianity in particular. Uh, not because of, uh, it's spiritual teachings. Exactly. But we're interested in the church as a power and as a power dealing with allied to, but different from the Roman empire. Everything changes with the conversion of Constantine. The church becomes first tolerated than official. And then finally, the sole legal religion, except for Judaism, by order of the emperor Theodosius the great in three 93. On the other hand, in order to understand the church as a power or the politics of this period, we do have to understand the doctrine because people fought over doctrine. And as you've seen in the Jones reading, they invoked the emperor's intervention. This is not a question as might be what you would expect today of a religion split about various problems of Dogma solving those problems itself or splitting off into two factions.

Speaker 1:          01:35          The questions over the relationship between the persons of the Trinity Arianism or the nature of priestly office. Donatism provoked right from the year of Constantine's conversion, three 12 diversive fights. And they're only the first. I urge you to have fun with heresies. Heresies are neat. Professor Carlos Air is teaching a freshman seminar. I believe it's not called Basic Harris. What is it? Essential heresies. Yes. Even better. Um, and I don't know of any quiz shows where you can demonstrate expertise on this, but there ought to be, or there ought to be sites on the Internet where you know, you can get a perfect score. We're only touching the surface, the proverbial tip of the iceberg to use a cliche. Um, there are lots of heresies, there's a lot of division in the church. Um, why not just say, hey, you believe that the father is superior to the sun and I believe that they're coequal.

Speaker 1:          02:50          So what? Um, that's so 2011, uh, or actually, so 2000, because we ought to be used to religious doctrines having military or other kinds of violent effects. So I'm not going to have to justify for you the fact that we're spending some time on religion, I hope. But if you do want me to just, just remind me what the rationale is. If your roommates are bothering you because you're quizzing them about the relation between the persons of the Trinity, uh, have them email me or set up an appointment and I'll explain why, why it's important. I, I'd be glad to do this as a, as a public service, uh, or you know, my Facebook page, whatever.

Speaker 1:          03:43          This is a situation created by Constantine and we've seen Constantine's have fairly long reign, uh, transform the Roman Empire. We emphasize the creation of the city of Constantinople as a second capitol and the favor shown towards the church so that when Constantine died in three 37, 40%, 50%, a large percentage of the empire, its population was Christian when he died, the Roman empire seemed to have been restored to its former glory. That chapter that begins the reading for today in Brown's world of late antiquity is entitled a world restored. And he emphasizes this because traditionally historians saw the fourth century through the lens of the sack of Rome in for 10 as a period of decline in for 10 as we will discuss next week, the city of Rome was pillaged and partly burned by the Visigoths a, I hate to use the word tribe, but don't tell anybody.

Speaker 1:          04:57          A tribe of barbarians who had entered the empire across the Danube in the Balkans. This was a cataclysmic event and it ushered in successive crises in the western empire, the western empire that would lead to its collapse. This weakness of the western empire is partly military, partly political and partly internal, a result of weaknesses of instability culture and the economy. It's always hard to say why empires fall in some absolute sense, even though we can see in retrospect the signs of their decline. One of the signs brown talks about in the reading for today fairly extensively, and that is the inequality among the rich and poor grows. On the other hand, this is a period of inequality, but also social mobility. There are a lot of paths open to barbarians. Even in this period. Barbarians become important figures in the Roman army and indeed the army is a path of social upward social mobility, a very important one.

Speaker 2:          06:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:25          In general, as I've said, between three 37 and four 10 between the death of Constantine and the sack of Rome, people did not see themselves as living in a period of decline. They did see themselves as living in a period of real change, the most dramatic of which was the movement towards Christianity. And the most dramatic example of that movement is the reign of the emperor. Julian, I've given you a handout that shows the emperors, um, of this period. Notice that some of them rain in the east, some in the west, and then some usually briefly reunify the empire. We're in a transitional period ushered in by Diocletian when the empire is sometimes divided and sometimes not with the death of Theodosius in three 95. The second, third to last of those emperors on the list. He had been sole emperor for three years with his death and the division of the empire between his son Oh Noria ruling from Ravana, the western capital now in what's now northern Italy and Arcadia's ruling from Constantinople. From that point on, we can really speak of two different emperors and almost always there were two emperors until the collapse of the western empire in the late fifth century.

Speaker 2:          08:04          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:05          Questions this point? Okay. So, um, the reign of Julian the apostate apostate because he was born as a Christian and tried to restore the traditional Roman religion, three 62, three 63. His failure shows the weakness of what we can call paganism or tradition Roman traditional Roman religion. By this time, Christianity was too big to rollback. Julian tried, he tried to reestablish the temples. He tried to reestablish the vigor of the cults of the Gods. He was an worshiper of many different gods, but he also was a philosopher. He is a wonderful, if sad example of an intellectual in power. Very few of these emperors were, um, what would be called intellectual in the sense, I mean, many of them were cultivated, you know, they liked the equivalent of classical music and art. But, um, Marcus, so realias is a philosopher and Julian at least as a would be philosopher.

Speaker 1:          09:26          He had a beard. He studied in Athens. Um, he was very unsuccessful though people did not follow his doctrines. He was a very good military leader. His troops, when he was on the Orion frontier in what's now France and Germany, uh, were extremely loyal to him. But as emperor, uh, not only did the church oppose him, but, uh, many of his own followers did. He died in an unsuccessful campaign against the Persians, uh, perhaps murdered, uh, unclear, but with his defeat, uh, the, um, the end of civic polytheism of that traditional urban upper class worship of the Olympian gods was in permanent. It clips the decree of the Emperor Theodosius that I referred to already have three 93 proclaiming Christianity. The only legal religion except for a small space allowed for Judaism did not really mean that everybody in the empire was a practicing Christian. The two groups that would be outside of that definition are the people of the country side, the very large number of people who would either continue their traditional polytheistic, local wardship of local gods or assimilate that worship to Christianity.

Speaker 1:          10:59          We're going to be talking a lot about saints in a couple of weeks on some obvious level, which I don't want to exaggerate, but which is nevertheless there. The saints, and there are many of them. They are holy figures. They're not gods, but they're more powerful than human beings. That saints are a kind of substitute for polytheism and we'll talk about why that and how that works. The other class that tended to resist Christianity to the last was the very upper stratum of the Roman senatorial elite. The people who were the most cultivated adherence of the traditional religion and philosophers, people who followed Plato, for example, known as the Platonists, and we're going to come to them because they're very important for Augustine's confessions.

Speaker 1:          11:54          Constantine was succeeded by his sons after the two of the sons died. Constantness ruled alone. Uh, constantness assured that he would rule alone by massacring most of his family. Julian was one of only two, but he allowed to survive and he shouldn't have because Julian overthrew him. Um, you know, this is, um, this is brass knuckle politics. I guess the chief preoccupations of these rulers of the fourth century were the same as we when we started out the Persian threat on the eastern frontier, the barbarian threat on the Rhine, Deb, Danube frontier. But there are also other problems that the third century emperor had not faced. And knees are religious problems. Uh, they are in particular Arianism and donatism. And we've seen a little bit about these from the reading about Constantine, uh, for the first assignment. But let's go over this. Arianism please remember that with a, why this has it takes on a completely different meaning.

Speaker 1:          13:08          Okay. Arian is this discredited racial theory identified but not invented by, uh, Nazi-ism Arion with an I is a follower of areas. Areas was a priest from Alexandria influenced by ideas from Plato about the absolute and unknowable nature of God. Any religion, but Christianity in particular has a problem. If you make God to absolute and unapproachable than why does he care about us? If you make him too approachable, then how is he powerful enough to transcend the world? Platonism that is the philosophy of followers of Plato emphasizes the absolute emphasizes the inferiority of what we can understand with our eyes, with our other senses, and the superiority of the spiritual. The reason the spiritual is superior to the material in Platonism and in Buddhism and in many other philosophies is that the material is more mortal, rots, dies, passes away. The problem for many people, not just people in the modern world, is that the material is right here and the spiritual is kind of hard to apprehend or prove. But most people who think about it most of the time in history of great that the spiritual is superior because it is in mortal.

Speaker 1:          14:59          Therefore, those who emphasize the spiritual emphasize this kind of unknowability, the uh, mystery, the not easy to apprehend ness of the super natural for Platonists and for Ariens. God was placed infinitely high above us. Now, Christianity has as its great strength in many respects. Just speaking of kind of the power of ideas, the fact that God becomes man Christ is incarnated, that means he becomes flesh. This is not a common religious idea. Mohammed is not gone. He is a messenger. In Judaism, there are profits, but they are not made of the same substance as God. There are religions in which a holy man becomes kind of supernatural, a lot of religions of the east, but in Christianity, Christ is God. God is manifested in three forms. The Trinity, the father, the son, and the Holy Ghost. Arianism says that Christ is essentially different from God the father in some fundamental way that Christ was created by God as a way of interacting with the world.

Speaker 1:          16:39          If you have studied Plato or were in ds and remember some of those key concepts in Platonism, there's the one and then there's the demiurge. The demiurge is this hard working guy or hardworking force, whatever you want to call it, who interacts between the divine and the material. He's divine. All right, but he creates things. He's the one who is out there. Uh, I'm creating the spirit as well as matter creating the world and the universe. Indeed, as we know it well, the one is at rest. So similarly in Arianism, Christ is the one who's intervening on earth, indeed sacrificing himself for humanity. Um, God, the father remains in heaven. This is not what Christianity, most of the time teachers, Christianity or the Orthodox or Catholic view is that Christ and God are of the same substance. The Aryans, therefore, our subordination lists they subordinate Christ to God. Oh, convenient way of remembering them is their tag line. There was a time when Christ was not

Speaker 2:          17:59          okay.

Speaker 1:          18:00          It's a kind of supernatural metaphysical time, but God made Christ. This goes against the creed enacted at Nicea, which to this day is the standard confession of faith of Christian denominations. The Nicene creed as it is known, uh, says that all persons of the trinity are eternal. Coeternal God did not create Christ. Now, Arianism appealed to people partly because they worried about the trinity. The trinity could be denounced by Anti Christians as actually three gods. Um, how could God be both one and three? Uh, also, people who worried about the physicality of Christ, Christ becomes flesh, dies, suffers. How can God be God if he dies and suffers? Arianism you have to take seriously as something that is not just troubling. The intellectuals is not just something for people with a lot of time and leisure on their hands. It's a not for philosophy majors. It's not even for religious studies majors. It's not even for the Roman equivalent of college graduates. The barbarians and I, I, I deliberately avoid calling them the German barbarians. But the first barbarians to convert to this religion were, um, more or less. And as time goes on, historians emphasize less, but more or less Germanic tribes, the missionaries who converted them work Ariens in the mid fourth century, which is the high tide of Arianism in the Roman Empire. When the German tribes or the barbarian tribes entered the empire beginning in the three, seven days area, aneurysm was all but over within the empire,

Speaker 1:          20:08          the Council of Nicea in the three twenties. And, uh, uh, the council of Constantinople in 381, pretty much a defined area aneurysm as a heresy. And by three 81, it was on the run in the empire. But ironically, the new rulers of the West would be mostly Ariens well into the fifth and in some cases, sixth centuries. Donatism or what the donotist, the Donna tests here, we're not dealing with doctrine or metaphysical questions of the relationship of the persons of the trinity. We're dealing with the nature of the priesthood, hence the nature of the church. Uh, it's a question of the office or the man. If it turns out that I do not have a phd from University of California Berkeley or indeed that I am an imposter, that uh, somehow I tricked the Yale computer, haven't been showing up here teaching history to 10 and I'm just some random guy, you know, like the guy who is obsessed with the New York City transit and has gotten various passes to get into, uh, you know, drive trains and uh, um, maintenance yards and stuff like that. If I turn out to be like that, you will nevertheless get credit for this course, I assure you.

Speaker 1:          21:47          Um, because Yale as a official body is the one who grants your degree gives you credits and they were responsible for hiring me. So if I've imposed a fraud on, then you nevertheless received credit. You don't have to do a background search of me. You don't have to, you know, find out about how many pets I have or my, my credit status or my mortgage because you rely on Yale to do that. Think of this then, in terms of the priesthood, if it turns out that the priest is not a nice guy and alas that happens, or a sinner or what the donotist really cared about was he had buckled under threat of torture or the reality of tortured during the persecutions of Diocletian and had say a burn the scripture or renounced Christianity. If you're a priest is bad.

Speaker 1:          22:55          Is your baby baptized? That's what donatism is about. And donatism answers, no, no. It depends on the virtue of the officiant. You can't have a priest who was what they called a Prady tour trolley tours and interesting Latin word, Tra d I t. O r because it means both tradition or it is the root of the word tradition, but also of traitor. It's the handing down or handing over of something, the giving up of something. So one can speak of the handing down of, uh, our family has cranberry sauce with slivered almonds. That's our tradition. Or handing over state secrets, military strategy or the scripture to the authorities. But Donna tits accused priests who had more, they believed had, uh, capitulated to Roman persecute Toral pressure in the last years of Diocletian, they branded them as traders and they said that they could not form legitimate sacraments.

Speaker 1:          23:59          Therefore, you in North Africa where the donotist were strong, you as an ordinary Christian had better do a background check on your priest because your marriage is a legitimate, your baby is going to hell. Uh, your, uh, whole participation in the church is as it were short circuited by this defect. Worse than that, supposing your priest is just fine. In fact, supposing it's three 30, Aad and your priest wasn't even born during the reign of Diocletian, but the guy who consecrated him, the Bishop who anointed him was a trolley tour or maybe that bishop was not, but he was anointed. It's like Christmas tree lights. Um, at least the Christmas tree lights that I have, the kind of analog ones, uh, you know, their little bulbs and if one of them goes, the whole, um, string goes. If one is defective, the proverbial bad apple rotting out the entire barrel.

Speaker 1:          25:04          But the problem with that is that you can't organize a church on that basis. You can't organize a body spread from one corner of the world to another unless you believe that the church will guarantee the sanctity of the individual minister, the office. The fact that the guy is a priest has to be more important than the man or else you can only have local communities. You can only trust if you're a donotist, somebody you grew up with and a community stable enough for your confident of the ancestry. Donatism lends itself to what we call sectarianism. A sect is a small, tightly a cohesive group. It does not lend itself to a church that is universal, big, massive. And it also doubts that the church itself has the power to overcome the defects of its members.

Speaker 1:          26:05          Uh, now mannequins are not exactly a heresy, but they appear in the confessions and they're very important. So since we're doing a doctrinal ideas, mannequin ism is a teaching about good and evil that can be applied to other religions. Besides Christianity. Mannequin in basically says that good and evil have a real existence. There is a war in the universe between a good God and an evil one, and this may be applied outside of Christianity. We're within Christianity and quit within Christianity, but evil. God is the devil or according to the mannequins of this period that Augustine for a while joined,

Speaker 2:          26:55          okay.

Speaker 1:          26:55          The God of the Old Testament. Jehovah is the evil God and the God of the New Testament. The Christian God is the good one to Hova. Jehovah is the one who smiles a lot of people. Jehovah is the Creator God because the mannequins believed that matter is evil and is the source of evil. Spirit is good. The Christian God created spirit. Human beings are imprisoned in the body and they have to figure out a way to liberate themselves from the Dominion of the,

Speaker 2:          27:29          uh,

Speaker 1:          27:30          evil God. Vegetarianism for a start,

Speaker 2:          27:35          avoiding flush. MMM.

Speaker 1:          27:40          But Salvation means casting off the flush.

Speaker 2:          27:45          Okay.

Speaker 1:          27:45          How is this different from Christianity? I'm, doesn't this sound to you like regular old,

Speaker 2:          27:51          okay.

Speaker 1:          27:51          Christianity. Mistrust of the flesh,

Speaker 2:          27:55          okay.

Speaker 1:          27:56          The devil is identified with sexual desire or physicality. Generally, mannequin ism is very useful as an explanation of evil. You know, this may not be something that keeps you up at night, but it will at some point a intermittently where does evil come from? Why is there so much evil in the world? Why if God is good, is there evil in the world? Sure. Some of that may just be to test you. You know, uh, uh, you lose your job or your business fails, but you'll get a better one. But that's not the same as horrible infant birth, uh, uh, disabilities or the death of people by starvation in the thousands or any of the payment, you know, choose your evil thing. Why does this happen? One explanation is that God didn't cause it. There's another guy. What's the problem with that? I mean, why, why, why is mannequin is I'm not a bigger, I mean in a way it is, but you know, you will travel far to meet anyone who says they're a mannequin. Yeah. First of all, then God's not all powerful. There's the years. Uh, and so then how is he gone? And then instinctively, I mean, what's another problem may be with him? I could say so what? God is limited, you know, he's, he's trying.

Speaker 2:          29:31          Okay.

Speaker 1:          29:33          Anybody else have a sense of the moral problem of saying the devil made me do it

Speaker 2:          29:41          takes

Speaker 1:          29:42          away response, individual responsibility. I didn't keep those investors. The devil cheated them. Alright, I didn't, uh, um, mug that uh, uh, as style student, the devil did. Um, anyway, this is a debate not asking you to take sides, but notice in the confessions, uh, the attitude of Augustine towards his Manichaean experience. So, uh, the fourth century is a time of ideas circulating around as Christianity starts to define itself. This would merely be a chapter of the history of ideas where it, not that the Roman emperors had to intervene to settle many of these issues. So just forgive me if I'm beating a dead horse, but heresy is important because of its impact in shaping the church through controversy and because it fell to the emperor to try to resolve heresy and bus marks the beginning of a merger of church and state in a way that will become characteristic of the entire middle ages.

Speaker 1:          30:54          The other thing to remark is that the emperor did not have a lot of success with this almost ever. It's very frustrating for an emperor who can get someone killed immediately. All he's gotta do is say, um, you dropped that larks tongue pie, uh, take them away and kill him. But he can't seem to do this with heretics partly cause hair. It takes love, persecution. It just tough in this thing. Um, so you have, um, the prefect of Africa writing to Jones and saying that this bishop in North Africa, Kalien has been attacked as a trodded tor and Constantine does what emperors usually do. They appoint local judges as experts. They say, go and have a hearing and find out what's going on and make a recommendation to me, oh, he makes a recommendation telling the donnas just to go home and shut up. They don't, they appeal to the emperor. The emperor says, go home and shut up. And they don't, they define the emperor himself. They go back to North Africa and they continue preaching against traitors.

Speaker 1:          32:14          Constantine. Why does he intervene? Why didn't he just say the hell with you? Pretty literally, or it's a matter of opinion or this doesn't get at the core of the faith. Yeah. He's afraid of upsetting God. Remember we said that Constantine was not much of a philosopher, not much of a contemplative. He had won a battle with the favor of the Christian God. Now the Christian God, he was the companion of the Christian God. The Christian God has him by the hand. If the church starts dissolving into quarreling factions, God is going to be angry and his favor will cease. We have to take the rulers anxiety about religious unity seriously. So he changes his policy several times. Remember we're talking about a guy who was able to feed defeat all his military rivals. Scentless sinneas, you know, running through Asia minor, caught him, executed him a man of tremendous capabilities. Nevertheless, dealing with these peasants and poor towns people and just, you know, from his point of view, riff Raff who were strong in north Africa. He couldn't get them to obey him. Sometimes he tried compromise, then persecution, then just saying, nobody can discuss this and none of this worked.

Speaker 1:          33:50          Not only did this not work, but now Arianism came to preoccupy him. And you can see in his letters, there's a kind of, oh, em, gee, I didn't realize what I was signing up for tone to it. At first, he was anti Arion pretty totally. He saw it as a denial of Christianity. If Christianity, by its very name is that Christ is God, then Erin Ism would seem to be, uh, antithetical to that fundamental thing. So after defeating, uh, listen, he says he learned more about Arianism, which was strong in the east. And his first reaction was kind of maybe your reaction or certainly the reaction of anybody who is more interested in, you know, power politics, this world, he considered it over subtle, philosophical and ultimately trivial, but he couldn't get rid of it. He couldn't get rid of it. And now instead of appointing judges, he summoned a council of the bishops of the empire, what later would be called an ecumenical council. Ecumenical meaning worldwide, a universal council which met in the city of Nicea across the, not right across the boss for us, but more or less, um, uh, uh, uh, more or less in the western part of Asia Minor.

Speaker 1:          35:27          And it met in three 25 at this first ecumenical council. The last Ecumenical Council, the Catholic Church by the way, was in the 1960s. The early 1960s, um, under, uh, Pope John.

Speaker 2:          35:45          Okay.

Speaker 1:          35:45          At this ecumenical council was summoned by the emperor and the emperor, uh, was in the room and in a certain respects presided, intervened, took sides. He was very deferential to the bishops. He is not a bishop after all. He is not a priest. He does not have the sacramental orders. But nevertheless, he was or attempted to be the boss of this conference and it came up with a formula, a definition of the creed, what every Christian must believe, saying that God and Christ are of the same essence but different persons, God and Christ and the Holy Ghost who is not really an issue. Yet there will be a heresy involving the holy ghost, but not until the end of the course. They are the same essence but different persons. Haim, same essence. The Greek word is homoousios. Christ was begun by the father but not made by him. That's a tough one. That's a tough one. He was begat and by the father, but not in time. There wasn't sort of like,

Speaker 2:          37:20          uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          37:22          three minutes after creation. The someone wants to go out and see what that noise is or is it coming from outside and we're hopeless?

Speaker 2:          37:37          No, it's okay. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          37:46          Areas gave a kind of equivocal acceptance of this arrangement, but the bishop of Alexandria refused to accept areas back into communion. In other words, the Nicene creed defined orthodoxy, but fighting raged for about 50 years over the relationship between Christ and God. The father, Constantine kept on changing his mind again. The poor guy only wanted unity. He wanted this to go away so that God would favor him. Uh, he died. I'm more or less an area. He came to believe that the area in moderate position was the best. Uh, this is partly because of the absolute and trends gents, the Bishop of Alexandria, the Archbishop of Alexandria. Athanasius Athanasia's would then later be a saint, uh, uh, considered the upholder of the Orthodox line. So I'm a constant. Constantine was baptized just before he died in this era. Usually baptism was supposed to mean that you embraced Christianity. Totally. It's Augustine particularly who's responsible for infant baptism. Infant baptism then means baptism. You entered the Christian community, but for sure you're going to sin.

Speaker 1:          39:24          The understanding in the three thirties was more as a baptized Christian. I am no longer a center. So if you were in an office, like constant team where you are shedding blood, giving judgments, leading troops, you would wait until your deathbed moment before getting baptized. So he would be baptized on his deathbed and by an area priest. Um, what's the danger of this? Paranthetically Diane? Baptize, right? The proverbial bus hitting you on the street or sudden death of another sword. And, um, we're going to talk, I'm sure this is going to be one of the things you will remember with pleasure, but briefly about sin. Why people sin. Um, and, uh, the, um, uh, interaction of good and evil in human beings. Indeed, we're going to start very soon because it's, it's all over the confessions. Let me give you a little bit of orientation towards the confessions. Uh, uh, which we, uh, I hope you will read as much as possible. Why are we reading this very personal and autobiographical work? Um, first of all, it is, you know, it is a classic. How many of you mask? I've already read it. Okay. Certain number. Um,

Speaker 1:          41:05          it is an autobiography which makes it very unusual. It's an intimate or about, it's not just highlights of my career or my resume. He talks about anxieties, desires, doubts. It is therefore a portrait of the mentality of a thinking person. In the ancient world. We get a better idea of the life of the then from many other, most other, almost any other source. It shows the fluidity of the religious scene and the late Roman empire. His father is a pagan. His mother is a Christian. He is first a Platonist sort of than a mannequin. Been a Christian Platonist and then a more fervent Christian. So it shows some of the religious and philosophical options of this era. In doing so, we do come across important and lasting ideas of the Western tradition about evil, sin, body and soul. We also are looking at the impact of Christianity on the Roman Empire and the relationship between Christianity and classical culture.

Speaker 2:          42:37          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          42:39          some things to keep in mind as you're reading this, the book is uniquely self revealing for its time. On the other hand, it doesn't tell us a lot of stuff we'd like to know more. Time is spent going over a youthful prank involving stealing pairs from an orchard. Then on Augustine's concubine, concubine, a woman that you're not married to who some sort of like a, a subordinate, uh, with whom you had a sexual relation. And indeed, uh, um, uh, he would have a child pairs book too towards the end. Uh, play a lot of attention to that. Uh, the book has a lot of prayers, quotations from scriptures very biblically and fuse dump would be be put off by that because the book is a confession. Confession has two meanings in this era. One is it's meaning. Now that way we usually use it confession of sin, but it's also a confession of praise. I confess God, meaning I acknowledge God's power and I praise him.

Speaker 1:          43:52          Uh, finally I just want to, uh, go over Platonists because he both admires the Platonists fields that they saved him from the mannequins, uh, but ultimately comes to doubt them. This is described fairly well in Brown, beginning on page 73. Um, but let me just take a few minutes to discuss this. Platonism or neoplatonism. It's the same thing. Neoplatonism is a kind of religious Platonism. It differs from Plato and his dialogues by a little bit more mystical in the sense of focused on the one trying to apprehend the one and less interested in, um, the city, the state, or the kinds of worldly problems that Plato dealt with. Platonism asserts the superiority of the spirit and the inferiority of matter. But unlike Manichaean Isam, which basically says that matter is evil and spirit is good for the Platonists, everything is good, everything is good, but there are inferior good. So matter is not evil in itself. It's just inferior. We're evil comes from is the preference of the inferior to the superior, the preference of the material manifestation to the spiritual. So to take the most famous example, because we still have this little funny vestige, you'll notion of so called platonic love, love of a sexual sort is not evil in Platonism. What is evil is assuming that that's all there is and not referring it to a higher spiritual nonmaterial kind of love.

Speaker 1:          46:03          Wealth is not bad, but the preference of wealth over spiritual things is bad. Here again, as we spoke at the beginning of the lecture, it's important to emphasize the superiority of the spiritual over the material because the spiritual is eternal. Evil comes from not realizing the superiority of the material, of the spiritual, excuse me, or not acting on it, acting as if the material is all there is in Platonism. Evil is a kind of falling away or a turning of your vision to evoke the cave metaphor. It is a misperception and it's the result of poor education. If you educate people to the superiority of the spiritual, they will throw off their evil ways. The reason people misbehave kill each other, oppress each other, is that they don't know any better. And if you teach them, they'll reform. Keep that in mind as we turn tow. Augustine, see what he thinks about it. He adores the Platonists because they were intellectuals. He admires them because rescued him from the trap of Manichaean dualism that is good versus evil. Just simple forces. Platonism is an explanation of evil, but for all Guston it's not a sufficient explanation. And that will form part of the subject matter of our next talk. So I'll see you on Wednesday. Oh, and Wednesday you'll get the paper topics for the first paper, which is due October 10 19.
