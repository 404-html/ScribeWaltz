Speaker 1:          00:01          We um, are starting to use primary sources for our understanding of the historical periods under discussion, primary sources, writings by people who lived at the time. And as with all such sources, the great advantage is vividness, immediacy. The people lived through it and the problem is distance from us and strangeness Pro Copious and Gregory of tour who will be starting out with next week are varied. Different writers per copious, uh, much more conscious of style. A lay man, somebody operating within the classical tradition, uh, Gregory of tour, certainly, uh, uh, a person for whom style is not paramount or at least it's not the classical notions of rhetoric, smoothness, uh, and um, uh, vividness. The per copious has, he is a bishop. He's very concerned with supernatural events and the church or let's say supernatural events controlled by the church for copious as you've seen, is not very concerned with Christianity and the supernatural events that concern him, such as Justinian walking around the palace with no head are not Christian supernatural there.

Speaker 1:          01:40          They're from some other older supernatural tradition, but both Gregory of tour and per copious require an effort to figure out why not just read something by a writer historian living now who may be easier to figure out and who is writing with you and me in mind because of the vividness and because of the trickiness of trying to reconstruct not only what happened, which is hard enough, but also what the mood of people was and what the reaction was. We're talking about Justinian today. So, uh, a um, uh, emperor whose rule occupies most of the, um, sixth century five 27, two five 65.

Speaker 1:          02:40          So we're concentrating on the sixth century as part of this overall survival and crisis of the eastern Roman Empire, his rain, or more precisely the earlier part of his reign until about five 40 is the height apogee maximum power of this empire, which succeeds in, shall we say, reconquering or conquering, taking back or adding the parts of the western Roman empire, many parts of the western Roman Empire that had been lost effectively to the barbarian invasions of the fifth century. If you still can refer to your map or if your memory of geography is okay. Um, the major areas of conquest of Justinian beyond the borders of the old eastern empire, our first North Africa, which is the coast of modern Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, uh, and even, uh, Morocco held by the vandals and seized by Justinian parts of Spain, coastal Spain, Mediterranean, Spain, held by the Visigoths and Italy held by the Ostrogoths.

Speaker 1:          04:11          This is the centerpiece of Justinian's reign. And for a time it looked as if he had in effect, recreated the empire of Constantine and Diocletian. But as we'll see, this is a, uh, triumph with a terrible price, the terrible price being that we can Byzantium. Now, when we say of paint figures in the past or even figures in the recent past, that, uh, their policies were a mistake because it turned out that, uh, uh, the, uh, future enemy would be something other than what they were fighting. We can say that with the advantage of being able to see what was going to happen. In other words, you know, there are people who argue that the invasion of Iraq was a folly or that the expenditures on the, uh, aggressive foreign policy of the first years of the 20th first century was foolish because as it turns out, economic problems, domestic problems, they, a mortgage a, a bubble was really the problem that people should have been addressing or they should have been addressing the deficits.

Speaker 1:          05:29          You know, you can say that it's, it's in, it's in it's own way. It's a fact, but it doesn't necessarily tell you what people at the time should have thought of. Thus, we know from last lecture that first of all, Justinian should have concentrated on the Persians, the Persians on his eastern frontier who didn't interest him, whom he just wanted to sort of pacify in order to go west and make his conquest. The Persians would turn out to be his big, the biggest enemy of the empire. And so, you know, if you were plotting this out as a kind of international political strategy, you could say, uh, forget about the Ostrogoths. Forget about the vandals. Build up that frontier, invade Persia. Uh, keep your army there. And indeed with a little more hindsight, we can say, oh my gosh, in 80 years, the Muslims are going to take the eastern part of your empire.

Speaker 1:          06:32          Well, obviously there's no way he is going to be expected reasonably to know that except if you're looking at a distance from over a thousand years, I was in 500 years. Uh, then, you know, we can say, sure, the eastern frontier turns out to be the point of vulnerability. Uh, so a classic kind of historical problem or early Middle Ages, midterm question is, you know, Justinian um, uh, overreach or, or reasonable, uh, a guy or the conquest of the West folly or a grand jury. And it's both. It is a classic example of overextension overextension of empires, meaning that empires weakened themselves at some point fatally by simply getting either too big or spending too much money and the two are linked, get too big. You have to spend more money to defend your yourself, not really having the resources to keep what you have the British Empire to take a, uh, a reasonably clear and neutral example. At some point is simply to, uh, large, uh, for the resources of a weakened Great Britain.

Speaker 1:          08:00          And, uh, our colleague Paul Kennedy has explored, uh, uh, quite memorably empires that simply could not maintain their commitments. The Spanish empire, the British Empire. And as it turned out after Kennedy wrote his book, the Russian Soviet Empire, this is a, a pattern in history that is, uh, that repeats itself. The question, however, is under the circumstances and assuming the existence of that empire, what are reasonable policies to preserve it or to extend it? We know about Justinian's wars of conquest and of defense. He did have some wars against the Persians, uh, his wars of conquest in defense, largely, although not exclusively through pro copious, but he is our best source in two works. One, the secret history and the other much more extensive, a series of books called the wars. And they're divided in Persian wars, African wars, Italian wars in the wars. You can see that once the Italian war starts to go badly per copious, his opinion of Justinian and of the great general Bellis areas tend to change from a kind of admiration. And Go kill, get them spirit to, um, uneasiness to blaming to a kind of finger pointing.

Speaker 1:          09:51          So we're dependent on pro copious. And if when you first read the wars, it seems very, very different from the secret history. It seems like it's by facilities or some other sensible objective Greek writer and he indeed is writing in that tradition. Those of you who've read through cities will remember, he describes often folly and very terrible events, but soberly, factually in a fashion of Olympians, sorrow at the folly of policymakers in generals. And to some extent per copious has that tone, which seems to contrast very much with the vehemence of the secret history. Leading some people to assume that he was crazy when he wrote the secret history or off balance, let's say, or a that the war's represented, uh, the real pro copious and this represented kind of his evil twin. Uh, the term evil twin doesn't appear in Gibbon, but uh, it could, it could.

Speaker 1:          11:02          Um, what makes it more complicated is a third work of his cold buildings. Buildings is, as the name implies, a book about Justinian's building campaign, which includes but is by no means limited to the Church of Iso Fia in modern Istanbul, which is, Eh, continues to be to this day, an extraordinary building of such immensity and such space in interior I dome that sees unsupported by anything. And that seems to cover half the earth when you're inside it, both splendid and an extraordinary engineering fee. And then, uh, interesting Ian Built Churches, uh, uh, he built churches. That's a stand in Ravenna with unbelievably beautiful mosaics, Ravenna in Italy. And these are important because Ravenna was outside the zone of territory controlled by the iconoclast. And therefore, while the icon of class tended to take down or whitewash representations of anything divine, uh, they're reached, did not extend as far as Ravenna. So in a way, the best, the best examples of Byzantine Mosaic Art of the, uh, earliest period, not in a way, but absolutely are, uh, outside of the, um, uh, the eastern Mediterranean and in Italy.

Speaker 2:          12:34          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          12:34          Buildings though is not just an account of Justinian's architectural essays, but a Pennage lyric, a praise of Justinian almost as slavish Lee at Jula Tori as the secret history is, um, a condemnation.

Speaker 1:          12:56          And as I suggested last time, these actually go together in a society of, um, were tremendous power is concentrated in one person or one court or one setting. The reactions of people tend to be adulation, which is to some extent forced out of them or at least, uh, invited by the ruler. So again, to take an obvious analogy, Stalin for his 70th birthday was pleased that the greatest museum of Moscow, all the permanent exhibit was sort of set aside and warehouse and the whole museum was given over to gifts to Stalin on his 70th birthday from a grateful people. He didn't have to order it. Somebody came up with the idea and he said, oh, uh, don't go to any trouble. They had the thing that agile Latori, this is what later would be called the cult of personality is just one of hundreds of examples of naming cities after him.

Speaker 1:          13:59          Uh, uh, lauding him as the Great Gardner. The friend of children, um, the, uh, uh, a successor of Lenin and so forth. The other side of that is a kind of hatred and diatribe, more or less secret. There were lots of jokes about Stalin you could and people were sent to Siberia or executed for telling these jokes, but they were very good jokes under the circumstances. Um, this is some of the explanation for how you can get at the same time, adulation and demonization. The interesting thing of course is it's in the same guy for copious. And although people at one time thought, oh, well he wrote the buildings earlier and then became disillusioned, he did become disillusioned. Everybody became disillusioned because after five 40 things started to go wrong, there's a huge play getting five 42 that kills off a third of the population for starters. But it looks as if he's writing this stuff more or less. At the same time, the secret history is not finished. That's why it begins so oddly, not with Justinian, but with Bella's areas and Bella's areas as wife being kicked around by his wife Theodora and you knew some don't know who these people are. And then suddenly we're at Justinian. Well, you know, the order, uh, of this thing is not yet set. He probably did not finish it.

Speaker 2:          15:32          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          15:33          he did, however, want it to be published after his death. It's called the secret history or the, uh, neck Dota, um, uh, sort of stories, uh, by later writers. It survives in only one manuscript as I think I remarked. Nevertheless, because it has a highly rhetorical style, it clearly was to be read by other people. It's not just a set of jottings for his own satisfaction. It is a work that he hoped would be a widely published when he was safely dead and enacted. Art Literally means not stories as it would now anecdotes that false cognate. It means, um, not to be published. So in the secret history just in Ian is a monster. What's a set that aside for a moment and talk about what a Justinian actually did? Justinian, uh, was the power behind the throne of his, um, uh, uncle Justin the first.

Speaker 2:          16:46          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:46          So in a way his rule goes back to the five twenties to the five teens Justinian's character as portrayed by per copious in both the wars and in the secret history is very smart, hardworking. A copy of says he almost never slept, devoted to details, capable of immersing himself in many different things. Architecture, Church ceremonies, theology and law. He was of humble birth. His uncle, his family were soldiers. They were from modern. Oh Croatia. More or less the Balkan peninsula, the former Yugoslavia Elyria as would have been the term used at the time. He grew up speaking some form of Latin and he is, as I said last time, the last emperor whose native language was Latin as opposed to Greek. He dressed very simply and he was approachable. He did not have that or inspiring splendor of Diocletian Constantine for example, he was seldom angry,

Speaker 1:          18:34          but he was cold and seems to have had no trace of mercy or kindness. Reminds me of some professors of mine. He was intolerant, he was unforgiving, and he was merciless. He had a grandiose conception of the empire and he was willing to, um, tax his subjects heavily and to endanger the security of the eastern frontier in order to expand his territory and his prestige. I think that is a fair judgment to Mac. He believed that his predecessors had nick through neglect, lost what the ancient Romans had conquered. And you believed that you couldn't call it the Roman Empire if all it consisted of were possessions and the eastern Mediterranean. And as we've said, he did indeed conquer at great cost North Africa, parts of Spain and Italy. He had a, I think it's wrong to use the term totalitarian, but certainly a very strong conception of imperial rulership. He tried to impose doctrines on the church in order to resolve the age old Manasseh side question.

Speaker 2:          20:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          20:10          He was no more successful than Constantina Theodosius by the way. But for example, just to give you a sense of his methods, he kidnapped the Pope in Rome, tried to brow beat him, uh, and exiled him to the Crimean peninsula. He died Theodora one of the most interesting things about Justinian is, uh, that he gave so much power and uh, uh, respect to his consort Theodora who was of even more humble birth then he was now, I don't think we have to believe per copious on the details of the doors. Youth. He certainly reserves his most are hysterical. Diatribes for Theodora. I think it's fair to say that for copious was not a great admirer of a competent women. Uh, the historian burry a JB Barry, one of the great historians of Leighton Rome and Byzantium who wrote it about a hundred 120 years ago, uh, describes her youth as stormy. Um, an adjective that I like because it could be anything. Her stormy youth, probably her father was a bear keeper. Somebody who kept bears for the entertainment of people at the circus, an animal trainer.

Speaker 1:          21:41          She was the mother of a legitimate child. Uh, she may have had a background of amateur or cuase I professional semipro prostitution. Notice that per copious condemns her first for being a prostitute and then for suppressing prostitution once you became empress. Uh, there's a logic to that per copious is not opposed to prostitution. One has the sense that he's, if not a connoisseur, at least a, um, uh, you know, uh, uh, now and then a partaker. But for prostitutes to be anything other than this, uh, firmly subordinated class that is for prostitutes to have some sort of voice or opinion or, uh, for people to, um, endeavored to help them or respect them is, uh, in his mind, uh, ridiculous and scandalous per copious is a conservative. He doesn't like the weakening of the senatorial classes. He represents the land owning interests. He doesn't like too much imperial power. He's quite happy to respect the emperor, but is angry when the emperor seems to be taxing rich people. He doesn't like upstarts. Upstarts like Justinian, who is he? Who is he? Soldiers, child upstarts like Theodora upstarts like a, um,

Speaker 1:          23:23          Antonio, the wife of Bella's Iris Justinian and Theodora ruled as a team. They had very different personalities. They're very interesting team. Theodore loved sleep. Luxury us was sympathetic them an awful sites. Justinian was completely the opposite and insomniac when somebody who dressed in a extremely ordinary clothing and a firmly anti man officer, they in fact supported different factions in the circus. I mean, here's a, you know, uh, um, uh, giants, jets, marriage, uh, the circus, the circus was a arena, uh, attached to the palace where the emperor would make his appearances at sporting events. Although we've said Justinian was approachable. By that we mean that, um, you know, people in the government or, uh, in high positions could see him without too much ceremony. That doesn't mean he's approachable just to anybody in an absolute test state. There's certain kinds of events at which the ruler has to show himself or traditionally shows himself.

Speaker 1:          24:49          So, uh, in the Soviet era, the May Day parades, and it was a reviewing stand in Moscow at the tomb of Lennon and foreign correspondence and intelligence, people would try to see who was in and out of power by who appeared with the leader, who wasn't there, where they were standing. Uh, the hippodrome, the, um, um, horse racing arena in Constantinople was a bit like this. The emperor had his own box and the people could make sort of celebratory gestures to him, praise him. And if they were in a rebellious mood, criticized him as well. There were circus factions, as they're called. That is people who were curing for one side or another. The most important of which in Constantinople are the blues and the Greens. The Greens tended to be somewhat probe an office site. And Theodora was a partisan of the grains of blues anti-money office site.

Speaker 1:          25:59          Justinian was a partisan of there in five 32. These circus factions revolted. Partly it's a tax revolt. Partly it's, uh, uh, factions fighting. It doesn't do to try to probe what these factions represented too much. After a while, they're simply factions. There's simply people who liked to fight or who like to root for one side or another, but they, um, are rowdy and even criminal may have very outlandish costumes. Uh, they expend all their money and all their energy on sporting events and on rowdiness a sort of associated with them. Uh, this is not completely unfamiliar. Uh, the prefect of the city arrested seven people for rioting and condemned them to death. Uh, two of them escaped. When the rope broke. It always pays to maintain your, I mean, this is a tip from a historian, uh, always pays to maintain your coercive equipment. Uh, once these guys escaped, then they were heroes and they were shielded from the crowd. They were put in a monastery where they had sanctuary and conveniently enough, one was a blue and one was a green. So the blues and the Greens United, they ran through the streets demanding pardon for the, uh, escaped the escapees. And when Justinian refused a riot took place, the battle cry of these rioters was victory, right? Nika, not to be confused. What sporting equipment? Nika victory. The crowds tried to overthrow Justinian and Theodora. And in the process they burned down a lot of the city.

Speaker 1:          27:59          Um, Justinian is reported by per copious as being ready to flay, but Theodora stiffened his resolve, basically telling them she preferred to die in the shroud of the imperial robes rather than flee in disguise and mobilized. Uh, the generals blows areas and narcis we've met Bella's areas already and they cracked down on the mob and killed maybe 40,000 of them. Right? How many people attend the Yankee Games? About 80,000. So, um,

Speaker 2:          28:47          yeah,

Speaker 1:          28:48          30, 40,000 people. And at that ended the riots, Constantinople was partially burned. Justinian loved building. This was a great opportunity. He couldn't have asked for a better, uh, um, moment in a sense, a, of course it required more taxes, but people now I hadn't seen both problems with resisting taxes. And so this is where we start the building of the new Iso Fia that we see today.

Speaker 2:          29:18          Okay.

Speaker 1:          29:19          Built in five years. And I mean, compare this to grand, uh, projects like, you know, uh, an exit on the Connecticut Turnpike, which take 15 years or so. Uh, the way you build something in five years, it's by an incredible number of workman, um, and, uh, lavish expenditure of money. The patriarchs thrown in, Aya Sophia was made of silver, weighed 40,000 pounds. The columns are porphyry, many of them, uh, it uses a lot of glass in order to admit light. And the light comes from so far away that it forms these wonderful patterns depending on the time of day.

Speaker 1:          30:08          Justinian also rebuilt the senate, the baths, uh, the imperial palace and the Church of Saint, uh, Irene, the Church of the apostles, et Cetera, et cetera. He started his wars against Persia before the Nika revolt and the war with Persia is one episode of a multisensory war in this case. It's over influence in the caucuses, but it's really about trying to protect Byzantium from Persian invasion. But as I said, Justinian's interest was not really in Persia. He was interested in, uh, peace with Persia and in securing enough of the frontier so that the Persians couldn't launch, uh, at least not easily a surprise attack. And in five 31, the eastern Roman Empire and Persia signed a perpetual peace

Speaker 1:          31:14          and Justinian then moved his troops to the west. The sight of his real ambitions, the vandal war in North Africa was a triumph. What we're seeing is one of those cases in which a policy seems to succeed miraculously easy. The vandals fell. It seemed without a fight here, the people who had been the terror of Rome 120 years earlier, uh, a hundred and a hundred years earlier who had sacked Rome in four 55 who had seized the grainery of realm in four 30, uh, fell almost. It seemed without a fight, true. The native Berber population, um, who were subordinate to the vandals desert people, uh, revolted, uh, and they, uh, were able to raid the coast and to undermine the position of the, uh, the Byzantine occupiers. The next stop was Italy in five 35, five 33, five 30 for the conquest of Africa. But Italy would take 20 years, not one. And in the process, Italy itself would be devastated. And with that devastation, a lot of classical culture would be lost. What wasn't destroyed by the fifth century invasions. And remember we said the Ostrogoths, we're pretty, uh, uh, reasonable. Uh, occupiers would be destroyed by the Romans themselves.

Speaker 2:          32:56          Okay.

Speaker 1:          32:57          I will not, uh, uh, tax you with the INS and outs and ups and downs of this campaign. Suffice it to say that the General Bella's areas at first was able to triumph in Italy. The Ostrogoths pick resistance, however, proved to be much stronger than he expected. And, um, uh, Justinian recalled Bella's areas, almost all of Italy was reoccupied by the Ostrogoths and it was only the second general Narcisse who from five 52 to five 55 is able to take over Italy. Um, five 40 is the year that Ravenna falls to the Byzantines and it seems to be the zenith of Justinian's reign. In that year, the Persians invaded that perpetual peace had lasted nine years, and the Persian invasion was, uh, quite successful. It resulted in the sac of the largest city of the empire after Constantinople and Alexandria, the city of Antioch in the eastern Mediterranean. And this was followed then by a plague, the so called Justinian Anik plague, which seems to be related perhaps to the plague of paraclese Athens or the Athens of the Peloponnesian war and maybe to the black death of 1348, 1349 hard to say. And in fact, uh, research now being done on the DNA in mass graves, uh, from that plague will perhaps tell us what the disease really was. Although so far, apparently it hasn't.

Speaker 2:          35:07          Okay.

Speaker 1:          35:07          So from five 40 to five 65, the death of Justinian, his policies are officially successful. Five 55, the fall of Italy, the plague eventually goes away, or the Persians are pushed out of Antioch at least. But the empire in the later years of Justinian is clearly staggering under the weight of taxation, economic downturn, declining population. And, uh, overextension they had conquered Italy, but the Italy they had conquered was ruined.

Speaker 2:          35:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          35:48          And this empire stretching now from Sicily to the Persian frontier is, um, as clearly a too big to hold on to. So this is some of what pro copious is. Anger is about. Uh, but um,

Speaker 2:          36:09          yeah,

Speaker 1:          36:11          he is, uh, he's bitter and disillusioned, he says, but I grow dizzy when I write of such suffering and pass onto future times. It's memories here. He's speaking about the Persian invasion of Antioch for Canada. Understand why it is the will of God to exalt the fortunes of a man or place and then cast them down for no reason that we can see.

Speaker 2:          36:35          Okay.

Speaker 1:          36:36          Now, if you contrast him with what you've read in Augustine and the confessions, you can see that Augustine has some reasons why this happens. A pro copious resists the Christian explanation here, and this has led some observers to think in general that he's not really somehow a Christian. He is, but he's writing in a classical tradition and he is also remember not an elitist, a conservative. I use the term elitist in a fairly neutral sentence. It's hard to expect someone who's writing is come down to us all this length of time to be somehow an ordinary person. Yes, he represents a class but doesn't really like religious controversy. That doesn't really like all of the, um, fussing about the natures or nature of Christ. But there are other things that are not in for copious that are somewhat surprising. Justinian is best known for architectural monuments like Aya, Sophia to historians for what we're essentially talking about today, the Western conquest at for his legal reforms that just any antic law code, which is the basis of all European law, European that is as opposed to Anglo American Anglo American law is a separate tradition. European law is based ultimately on a reworking of Roman law precedents. So I want to talk a little bit about his legal accomplishment, which per copia is a, a man who would be familiar with law courts, with legal systems, uh, doesn't tell us anything about in his works, virtually nothing.

Speaker 2:          38:28          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:29          Justinian essentially codified the Roman law. And this is not

Speaker 3:          38:36          only because it's the basis of European law, but law is related to political and administrative order. However much we may hate bureaucracy or denounce administration, that is how governments, uh, uh, provide whatever it is they're providing for their citizens. And the, since the alternative to government is anarchy, and since they're examples before our eyes of anarchic societies, it won't do to underestimate the benefits of law. However cynical we may be about its implementation. Roman law at the time of Justinian was as law tends to be, um, learned and unwieldy. If you wanted to know how to resolve a question, you could go through the thousands and thousands of what are called response. Or You could look at legislation just as in the Anglo American tradition. And some of you will learn this very soon in law school. You can either look at statutes passed by legislatures or court cases, precedents, the equivalent of a statute. You know, Connecticut passes a law saying that you can't have a gun in your car. Uh, whereas Texas has laws that say you can have a gun in your car under such and such circumstances. Okay, so you have a whole set of statute law, which would be imperial statutes in the Roman Empire, imperial legislation, or if the statutes don't cover a particular situation or you want something that has the particularity, uh,

Speaker 1:          40:34          my tree, a tree on my property falls on my neighbors. Did I mention this already? Yeah, that one. Uh, on my neighbor's garage, um, you know, who's, who's to blame. Okay. You go and you say, well, you know, at this case came up in a Cincinnati in 1949 and this is what the judge found in the absence of computers. The search for this stuff is very hard in a Anglo American law. This is called precedents. In Roman law, they're called response. And interestingly enough, this term is also singular, plural replied to Jewish law. A response is a response. A judge, an expert, a law professor in effect, is asked his opinion on something and his response becomes preserved as a kind of precedent.

Speaker 1:          41:37          These were voluminous and represented centuries of law and even more. Of course, the response of conflicted one judge says, you have to pay, uh, because it was your tree. Another says, uh, um, uh, it's an accident. He's responsible for his own remedies. What do you do if you have a conflict of judges? What if you do, if you have two kinds of contradictory responses, you've got to decide who takes who is more authoritative, which one is better. So the work of Justinian's compilers was to sort out legislation, statutes and the responses and also to decide among contradictory ones, what is in this law. Well, what's in any law we think of law as having mostly to do with criminals and stuff like that. But criminal law is actually very simple. It's like the Burgundian code.

Speaker 1:          42:37          If you murder someone, this is what's going to happen to you. There may be different kinds of killing if you murder them with intent and premeditation, that's worse than if you murdered them in a fight and spontaneous like, um, it is, uh, man slaughter is different from murder. Manslaughter is where you didn't intend to kill the person. Uh, but you did, you punched him and you didn't know that he had a weak heart and he died. That's manslaughter. Um, you know, you punched him, you intended to hurt him, but you didn't intend to kill him, but he died. Um, vehicular manslaughter, you know, uh, what's the difference between negligence? You should have seen something and you didn't versus criminal intent. You did it deliberately. Um,

Speaker 2:          43:24          okay.

Speaker 1:          43:24          But it's very simple. The criminal law,

Speaker 1:          43:28          there aren't a whole lot of gray areas and you can get through the criminal code pretty quickly. But what about contracts? What about property? This is endless. This is endless. So, um, you know, in law school, criminal law will be, um, you know, the cream or the, um, the tip of the proverbial iceberg or some little side issue. Most of your time is going to be spent on those of you who go for this option on, um, no property and contracts. And that's what the extend Ian law is mostly property and contracts, legal arrangements for buying and selling, inheriting partnerships, Guardian ships, security, surety obligations. This is a very advanced science in Roman law. As advanced as it is anywhere at any time, it's very different from, you cut off one finger, you pay five solid day, which we were looking at last week. The work that ensued, the so called Justinian a code or the Corpus Yoris civil is the body of civil law, uh, was drawn up in five years. Here again, is an example of unbelievable rapidity compared with the length of time it takes. Now, uh, uh, you know, merely to, uh, reform the Connecticut tax code or the to den Connecticut Traffic Code for that matter. Um, it was undertaken by a commission.

Speaker 2:          45:17          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          45:17          four books were issued.

Speaker 2:          45:20          Okay.

Speaker 1:          45:20          The first is a collection of statutes and it's called the codex collected laws of the Senate and imperial laws of previous centuries. The largest book is The d, The digest or in Latin Digesta. The digest is the weeded out response. Sir organized by subject. So this would be where you would go to try and figure out what happens if a river changes its course a little and your land, uh, is it seems to be now taken over by your neighbor. Is the river the border or is align, uh, on artificial line? The morning, the third book is a kind of textbook or a survey of the whole law and what it's supposed to mean called the institutes. And the fourth is called the novella or new laws because obviously new laws would have to be made.

Speaker 2:          46:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          46:37          The Codex, the digest, the institutes are in Latin because Latin was the language of the Roman Empire. But the novella are in Greek because Greek was the language of the empire. Now now being five 34 when this work was finished, the Justinian code is more however than a rearrangement of old laws. It displayed a consistent philosophy of government where law is more than precedent. It is an active force in society. The emperor is seen as the servant of the law, the implementer of the law, but he's also the master of the law. He is an absolute power. He is the embodiment of the law.

Speaker 2:          47:29          This is a well

Speaker 1:          47:30          run, immense burden. Some empire pro copious gives us unreliable though he may be as to Justinian being a demon, et cetera. Copious gives us a vivid picture of a highly governed, even efficiently governed, but oppressively governed and very ambitious society. Now for next week and a little bit after, remember we have no class on Wednesday. We have class on Monday and you're going to read from Gregory of tour, uh, about Clovis and the Franks and it will seem more violent and more primitive than what we've been reading. But violence in primitiveness, unfortunately, are part of history and government at almost any time. Uh, so enjoy the intrigue. I'm not going to test you on the names. You'll see there lots of great cat names, uh, of the Frankish barbarians. Uh, but pay attention to the figure of Clovis and to the attitude of Gregory, because as with per copious, we've got an interesting, if not completely reliable source.
