WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.270
Uh,
okay.
So Islam part two.
Um,

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.460
I know there's a lot of new terminology,
new narratives.

3
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.863
Uh,

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.050
the things that I want you to keep in mind are what we're really gonna focus on

5
00:00:19.951 --> 00:00:24.570
today.
And that is the Islamic conquest,

6
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.970
which certainly take place partly because of religious motivation,

7
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.130
but nevertheless are not,

8
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.440
not accompanied by some fanatical desire to convert the world.

9
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.990
Muslim conquests have to be understood in terms of religious motivation,

10
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.290
but not in terms of a determination to wipe out Judaism and Christianity.

11
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.950
What appears to be a paradox,
uh,

12
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.580
makes this era a little hard to understand.

13
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.640
Namely the paradox being that you would have such a rapid expansion of the Arabs

14
00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:06.420
and the religion that they carried a which eventually would,
uh,

15
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.540
extend from Spain to India.

16
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.330
And at the same time that,
uh,

17
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.390
Islamic Islamic population would be a minority in most of those conquered

18
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:23.340
regions for centuries,

19
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.520
that there is not a demand for the conversion of the population to Islam.

20
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.920
And that although the conversion does take place in many,

21
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.850
even most parts of this imperial Califit,

22
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.690
it doesn't take place immediately and it doesn't take place under great
pressure.

23
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.790
I say apparent paradox because in fact,
the two things are different.

24
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.210
The motivation provided by the religion to conquer does not necessarily mean

25
00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:59.400
that you require that everybody that you conquer embrace the religion.
Indeed,

26
00:01:59.401 --> 00:02:04.070
in part,
this is because as Berkey emphasizes,
uh,

27
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.740
the distinctiveness of the religion was not worked out of four.

28
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.570
I mean,
it was worked out over the course of its first century beginning,

29
00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:14.220
as we said last time in Medina,

30
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.430
but not fully articulated until the change of dynasty in seven 50 from the

31
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.090
Ommaya to the opposites.
Uh,

32
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.030
but the other reason is that there's no logical connection between conquest and

33
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:31.440
conversion.
It's perfectly possible to be,
uh,
uh,
a,
uh,

34
00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:36.090
motivated conqueror and not to require that other people embrace your religion.

35
00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:40.890
And this is for reasons that we'll say the other apparent paradox.

36
00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:41.970
And,
and here,
you know,

37
00:02:41.971 --> 00:02:45.930
I think it really is sort of a paradox is that the Islamic conquest are

38
00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:50.480
accompanied by internal division within Islam.
Uh,
from,

39
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.160
uh,
uh,
six 50,
80,

40
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.900
by the time of the opposite succession that is a century later,

41
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.360
these two parties can be identified as Sunni and Shiite.

42
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:05.980
And you've read that and you're aware that this continues to be a division that

43
00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:09.850
defines an awful lot of the Islamic world today.

44
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.920
It is particularly a problem in those countries such as Iraq for example,

45
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.460
that have both Sunni and Shiite populations.

46
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.160
It's not a problem in Morocco where,
uh,
everybody is,
um,

47
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.120
Sunni,
uh,

48
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.180
and it is less of a problem in contemporary around where a very large majority

49
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.440
is Shiite,
but,
uh,
um,
it is a,
um,

50
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.790
it is a problem that defines both,
uh,

51
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.860
Islam as a religion and the politics of many countries to this day.

52
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.370
And so one of the things we have to talk about in,

53
00:03:47.371 --> 00:03:52.300
in lecture entitled Islamic Conquest and Civil War is the origins of this split

54
00:03:52.301 --> 00:03:53.134
within Islam.

55
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.350
The paradox is that the conquests keep on going even while it would seem that

56
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:00.940
religious unity is falling apart.

57
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.550
Now,
as you remember,
uh,
I hope,
uh,

58
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.150
after Mohammed's death,
there was no clear succession.

59
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.220
He didn't have a son and it wasn't clear.
One anyone would succeed to.

60
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.080
If he was the seal of the prophets,
then you couldn't succeed to prophesy.

61
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.720
Uh,
was he a religious ruler?
Was He military ruler?

62
00:04:27.721 --> 00:04:29.760
Was he a judicial arbitrator?

63
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.510
His father in law are boubakeur who we saw was one of the first of his

64
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.580
followers,
um,

65
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.700
was elected college college meaning successor simply the succeeding two,

66
00:04:47.941 --> 00:04:49.290
what was not defined,

67
00:04:49.291 --> 00:04:54.291
but to some kind of combination of religious and secular rule.

68
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.250
As we said last time,

69
00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.390
religious and secular rule are in a fundamental way,

70
00:05:00.391 --> 00:05:03.900
not separate it in Islam,
although as we're going to start to see,

71
00:05:03.901 --> 00:05:05.180
and as you've read,
uh,

72
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.270
there are some ways in which they do start to separate out,

73
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.470
particularly in the later,
uh,
in the up acid period,

74
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.230
uh,
boob boubakeur was elected.
That is the followers of Muhammad.

75
00:05:19.231 --> 00:05:22.560
The people who were thought to have,
uh,
um,

76
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.400
some sort of original religious authority elected him.

77
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.430
His rival was Ali Ali,

78
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.390
the cousin of Mohammed and the son in law.

79
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:38.310
The same time of Mohammed Ali had married Fatima,
the daughter of Muhammad.

80
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.053
<v 1>Okay.</v>

81
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.800
<v 0>But this election was not recognized by many of the tribes that had regarded</v>

82
00:05:45.801 --> 00:05:50.801
their loyalty to Mohammed as personal loyalty to Muhammad,

83
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.650
not to some institution and not to some permanent coterie of college or

84
00:05:58.371 --> 00:05:59.210
successors.

85
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.100
So they refuse to recognize Abo backers authority.

86
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.330
And there ensued a,
what's called the Rida,

87
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:10.910
our Id d a or apostasy,

88
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.690
where the tribes rejected the authority of Alba backer and Boubakeur militarily

89
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:22.910
compelled them back into submission or recognition of his authority.

90
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.450
Although Bucca ruled for less than two years,

91
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.930
but he had already started on a key aspect of the reader be apostasy,

92
00:06:35.421 --> 00:06:40.421
and that is turning the resistance to the apostasy into a war against external

93
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.640
enemies.
In other words,
the energy,

94
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.680
the military energy that had to be devoted to bringing these tribes back in once

95
00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:49.670
they were brought in,

96
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:54.730
was continued to turn their military energies outward and outward means to the

97
00:06:55.821 --> 00:06:56.654
north,

98
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.610
out of the Arabian desert and to the direct north and slightly northeast,

99
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.360
meaning Persia to the northwest,
meaning the Byzantine Empire.

100
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.510
And already under a boubakeur,

101
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:18.040
it was discovered that the Byzantine Empire and the Persian empire were hollowed

102
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:19.460
out.

103
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:24.460
And that what began as raids to keep these discontented tribes happy with a spot

104
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.720
of plunder turned into a conquest.

105
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.510
And as success breeds success,

106
00:07:32.511 --> 00:07:36.380
and I don't think there's any more dramatic lesson of that Cliche,

107
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.330
the ambitions of the conquerors changed very quickly.
Well,

108
00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:46.331
the ambitions of the Raiders changed very quickly from booty to conquest,

109
00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:50.000
from plunder,
to,
uh,
a,
um,

110
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.440
expansion of territory.

111
00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.130
<v 1>Okay.</v>

112
00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:00.130
<v 0>Remember that the Persians and the Byzantines had fought each other that in six</v>

113
00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:01.461
26,

114
00:08:01.461 --> 00:08:06.140
Persia besieged Constantinople unsuccessfully six,

115
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:08.390
26,
four years after the hug Gyra.

116
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.640
So from the Islamic Muslim Arab point of view,
the timing was great.

117
00:08:13.641 --> 00:08:18.640
These two great empires had exhausted each other militarily and to some extent,

118
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:19.850
so spiritually as well.

119
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.670
In six 34.
In other words,

120
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.910
two years after the death of Mohammad,

121
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:33.970
the city of Damascus fell to the Arabs Damascus,

122
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.300
a capitol of Byzantine Syria.
Indeed,

123
00:08:38.301 --> 00:08:41.110
one of the oldest cities in the world mentioned in the Bible,

124
00:08:41.111 --> 00:08:45.290
in the Old Testament of the Bible,
uh,
uh,
a,
uh,

125
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.190
uh,

126
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:51.190
extremely important center of government commerce and a religion,

127
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:52.910
uh,

128
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:57.910
fel the Byzantine empire was defeated near Jerusalem.

129
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.660
Abo Balker died in six 34 and again,

130
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.720
Ali was passed over in another election in favor of another companion of

131
00:09:08.821 --> 00:09:10.290
Mohammed Omar.

132
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:16.130
Another one of those original followers that we mentioned on the last,

133
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.820
in the last lecture,
Omar would rule from six 34 to six 44.

134
00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:25.821
And he was a startlingly effective ruler in the 10 years of his collar fit.

135
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.810
The Arabs conquered the Persian empire entirely,

136
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.560
an empire that had lasted for centuries.

137
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.520
That had been one of the great,
uh,
uh,

138
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.450
world empires collapsed and,
um,

139
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:48.450
uh,
was taken over by Islam,
by the Arabs.

140
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:50.980
<v 1>Okay.</v>

141
00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.440
<v 0>The Byzantine Empire didn't completely collapsed,</v>

142
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.640
but in this period at lost Syria,
Palestine,

143
00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:01.210
and then its richest agricultural province,
Egypt.

144
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:03.230
<v 1>Okay.</v>

145
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:08.180
<v 0>Alexandria capital of Egypt at that time surrendered in six 42.</v>

146
00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:16.050
We can list the factors that favor the Arab conquest though they're mostly sort

147
00:10:17.081 --> 00:10:21.790
of favorable soil as it were,
not the plant itself.

148
00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:24.100
Weakness of Persian Byzantium.

149
00:10:24.101 --> 00:10:28.660
I've already mentioned a mastery of desert warfare.

150
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:33.730
We'll sort of see this a little bit with the Vikings at the end of the course

151
00:10:33.731 --> 00:10:38.170
there are peoples who have been able to take advantage of an adverse environment

152
00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.900
that they are able easily to swim through,

153
00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:45.160
travel through a and that a less mobile,

154
00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:50.320
um,
uh,
adversary a cannot deal with.

155
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.910
So,
uh,

156
00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:56.940
the similarity between the sea and the rivers of Europe and the desert of the

157
00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.230
Near East is that you can pick and choose your battles.

158
00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.920
You appear off the coast.
Oh,
there's an army there.

159
00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:09.850
We'll just go back and then we'll rate somewhere else.
The same is true.

160
00:11:09.851 --> 00:11:10.600
The desert,

161
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:15.400
you appear out of the desert where the urban dwellers cannot easily field an

162
00:11:15.401 --> 00:11:16.234
army.

163
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:20.680
And you discovered that there's nobody defending the city and you take it or you

164
00:11:20.681 --> 00:11:24.040
discover there is somebody defending the city.
You go right back into the desert,

165
00:11:24.041 --> 00:11:26.560
they can't pursue you there and you pick somewhere else.

166
00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:31.980
So the mastery of desert warfare is in part a question of mobility and the Abl,

167
00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:34.270
the ability to be able,

168
00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:38.590
the ability to move in the desert freely,
easily.

169
00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:45.180
And another aspect of the weakness of Persia and design team is the discontent

170
00:11:45.491 --> 00:11:47.050
of their religious minorities.

171
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.720
Persia was ruled by a Zoroastrian elite and had other religious groups that
felt,

172
00:11:52.721 --> 00:11:56.260
uh,
uh,
if not persecuted,
at least discriminated against.

173
00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:01.270
And as we've seen,
the Byzantine Empire had a substantial Manava side population,

174
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.930
uh,
that were persecuted by the Orthodox.

175
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:10.410
These people might not exactly a fight for the invader,

176
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:15.340
but they certainly weren't unhappy,
uh,
when the invader showed up.
Indeed,

177
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:19.000
remember that I said that in a six 55,

178
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:21.370
there was a naval battle.
Um,

179
00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:27.180
how could the Arabs have sailors if they hadn't seen a year round river,

180
00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.950
uh,
until uh,
um,
you know,
a few years before this battle,

181
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.740
there sailors were many of them,

182
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:39.580
most of them from Manasseh office populations of Egypt in Syria,

183
00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.710
we're able to recruit people who would fight for them,
uh,
who were not Muslim.

184
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:51.300
A third is the channeling of a warlike society towards external fighting.

185
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.210
If you,
I mean this is,

186
00:12:55.211 --> 00:12:59.590
this is like a problem of conservation of energy.

187
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:04.980
You have a certain amount of energy that is being expended in external fighting.

188
00:13:05.711 --> 00:13:10.711
If you can turn all those electrons or whatever in the same direction and make

189
00:13:11.711 --> 00:13:15.400
them go outward,
uh,
they will be extremely powerful.

190
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:20.650
The limits of my scientific knowledge,
unfortunately,
uh,
you see displayed.

191
00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:23.440
But you understand what I'm talking about.
That is the,

192
00:13:23.441 --> 00:13:27.710
the internecine warfare has now turned outside because the plunder is better and

193
00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.660
the motivation is better.
And then motivation is a fourth leak reason.

194
00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:37.480
Religious motivation is this thing that is called a jihad,

195
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:37.990
right?

196
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:42.070
Everybody knows what this means and we're going to have to sort of grapple with

197
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:46.780
it because,
uh,
our understanding of it is,
um,

198
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.900
perhaps Parksville and distorted a jihad means struggle.
Uh,

199
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:57.960
it is a struggle against other religions or against other tendencies within

200
00:13:59.981 --> 00:14:03.150
Islam.
There's plenty of energy,
um,

201
00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:07.330
as we will see devoted to fights within Islam,

202
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:11.500
Internet scene,
religious fighting,
if not tribal feuding.

203
00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:17.410
So we use the term jihad with some reservations.

204
00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:22.830
It is wrong to think of the Arab conquest as an expression of jihad in the sense

205
00:14:25.121 --> 00:14:30.010
that guys with knives in their teeth,
uh,
uh,
you know,

206
00:14:30.011 --> 00:14:34.090
ride out and offer a terrorized population.

207
00:14:34.091 --> 00:14:35.620
The choice of death or conversion.

208
00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:37.400
<v 1>Okay?</v>

209
00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.000
<v 0>Once again,
it is possible to have a religious motivation</v>

210
00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:48.610
and yet not necessarily want to kill or convert the conquered people.

211
00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:55.250
The Koran has plenty of information about the jihad,

212
00:14:55.251 --> 00:14:57.710
but it is not completely consistent.

213
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:03.970
Certainly there is a sense that the unbelievers must be combated a sense of

214
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:07.723
martyrdom,

215
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:12.730
even that those who die in the struggle to advance the religion will receive

216
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:14.630
special favor.

217
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:21.310
But there is also a respect accorded to people of other religions in particular

218
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.130
Jews and Christians.

219
00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:27.653
<v 1>Okay.</v>

220
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.150
<v 0>And if you think about it,</v>

221
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:32.870
it is psychologically possible to be convinced that God is following you.

222
00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.890
God must be following you after all.
You just conquered Jerusalem.

223
00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:43.840
You just conquered Alexandria.
You just came out of the desert and have um,

224
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:47.520
oh started to a role,
like a tsunami.
A,

225
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.660
an image that I don't think has really in the Koran,

226
00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:53.170
well let's say role like the head,
the sands of the desert,

227
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.470
over ancient civilizations.
So God must be with you,

228
00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:01.110
but the fact that God is with you may indicate that you were an elite and that

229
00:16:01.111 --> 00:16:05.520
the people that you've conquered are simply going to stay that way or that if

230
00:16:05.521 --> 00:16:07.740
they want to become Muslim,
that makes sense.

231
00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:11.730
Obviously God favors Islam but they don't want to become Muslim.

232
00:16:11.731 --> 00:16:12.564
That's their lookout.

233
00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:18.780
So it does not mean that you have a hostile conquest policy.

234
00:16:18.781 --> 00:16:23.490
Jihad is in this context not incompatible with tolerance.

235
00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:24.780
Tolerance.

236
00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:29.780
A word I use with caution as well because it's not as if they have a modern

237
00:16:30.721 --> 00:16:34.650
ideal of tolerance of individuality of you have your religion.

238
00:16:34.651 --> 00:16:39.540
I have my religion,
it is more that,
um,

239
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:43.800
uh,
they are not bothered by the

240
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:50.370
presence of people of other religions.
And we'll see some of why that is.

241
00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:56.130
So number five,
a policy of allowing conquered people to maintain their religion,

242
00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.080
livelihood,
and private lives.

243
00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:07.260
So there are other rapid conquest in world history and there are other rapid

244
00:17:07.261 --> 00:17:11.100
conquest by people who are technologically or culturally or certainly

245
00:17:11.101 --> 00:17:14.850
economically behind the people that they conquer.

246
00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:20.390
The Mon goals on goals conquer an incredible,
uh,

247
00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.460
territory.
The Vikings,
which will end the course with,

248
00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.890
are certainly less developed,

249
00:17:25.891 --> 00:17:30.891
economically less civilized than the Carolingian Empire that they plunder.

250
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.890
What is unusual about Islam,
and I reiterate something that I've said already,

251
00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:38.970
perhaps more than once,

252
00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:43.890
is that it has a permanent effect rather than sort of disappearing back into

253
00:17:43.891 --> 00:17:48.891
their yurts like the mon goals or disappearing back the,

254
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:53.580
uh,
Tundra.
Wow,
that's an unfair description of Scandinavia,

255
00:17:53.581 --> 00:17:58.260
but disappearing back into the north like the Vikings,
the,

256
00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:03.870
uh,
Islamic powers not only stay as occupiers,

257
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.700
but become themselves,
uh,
uh,
a,

258
00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.220
a cultivated wealthy,
um,

259
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.440
highly civilized empire.

260
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:18.690
What is unusual about the Arabs then as their ability to consolidate and to hold

261
00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:22.850
onto their conquest?
Okay.

262
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:25.770
I think I said before,
they're three startling things about Islam,

263
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.630
the career of Muhammad,

264
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.560
the rapidity and extent of the conquest and this business of the cultural

265
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.640
adaptability,
the consolidation of the Arab conquer rose

266
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:38.730
<v 1>questions so far.</v>

267
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:44.940
<v 0>I think at the conquest part of this is clearer than the internal divisions.</v>

268
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:47.820
So let's,
um,

269
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:51.740
proceed with the conquest rapidly.

270
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.680
There is no single regime.

271
00:18:55.681 --> 00:19:00.681
There's no rule issued by the collar fed for conquest policy in general.

272
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.600
If the,
uh,

273
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:07.380
population surrendered on terms the way Alexandria had in six 42,

274
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.610
that was fine.
Then the,
uh,
uh,
people,

275
00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:16.050
well we're allowed to keep their local customs.
In other words,

276
00:19:16.051 --> 00:19:20.580
they were allowed to keep their houses,
their jobs,
their religion,

277
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:22.200
their property.

278
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.270
The Arabs were intent on plunder.
However,

279
00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:32.180
why didn't they just pillage these people?
Uh,

280
00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:37.380
some of it is,
um,
just wisdom that they do.

281
00:19:37.381 --> 00:19:40.390
They're going to have to govern these places and that they might as well harness

282
00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:45.420
the industry and enterprise of the population rather than kill them or disperse

283
00:19:45.701 --> 00:19:48.400
them.
Some of it was,

284
00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:53.490
I think that they had so much plunder available to them from other sources that

285
00:19:53.561 --> 00:19:56.770
they didn't have to bother with.
Some,
you know,

286
00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:02.020
middleclass artisans wealth.
They could plunder churches,

287
00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.860
they could seize church lands,
they could take the state treasury.

288
00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:07.330
Between them,

289
00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:12.330
the state and the church held so much wealth that the Arab conquerors didn't

290
00:20:14.711 --> 00:20:18.910
really want to bother with Mir private property

291
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:27.290
bleeding.
Nobles tended to flee.
They align their interests with the state.

292
00:20:27.291 --> 00:20:30.950
They were very large property owners.
That land could be confiscated

293
00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:38.140
and the reward to the congress was to be settled on lands of their own with

294
00:20:38.631 --> 00:20:39.710
tenants of their own.

295
00:20:39.711 --> 00:20:44.711
And these lands tended to have belonged to the state or to the church.

296
00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:51.700
They long leases for these lands from the caliphate and they paid a religious

297
00:20:53.321 --> 00:20:58.000
tax a kind of time as members of the Ooma,

298
00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:03.150
the religious community and non Muslims were allowed to keep their property,

299
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:06.520
their land and other property,

300
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:10.450
but they had to pay two taxes that Muslims did not.

301
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:14.620
They had to pay what is called and it's called in the English speaking world,

302
00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.640
a poll tax,
which is basically just a head tax.

303
00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:23.670
Every person or every household pays a certain amount of money.

304
00:21:24.221 --> 00:21:28.750
It's actually kind of like a flat tax,
but it has nothing to do with income.

305
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:34.150
It is simply that you as a person living in this polity,

306
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.800
pay this as a tax and then a land tax,

307
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:43.810
land tax,
obviously more variable and depending on how much land you own,

308
00:21:43.811 --> 00:21:46.870
if you own x amount of land,
you pay a tax.

309
00:21:46.871 --> 00:21:50.650
If you only ate x amount of land,
you pay eight times that tax.

310
00:21:50.651 --> 00:21:52.090
At least that is the theory.

311
00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:58.510
And given that,
as we said,
as far back as Diocletian,

312
00:21:58.511 --> 00:22:02.350
you need to have very good records to keep track of taxes.

313
00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:07.360
Then that kept on the old officials who had those records.

314
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:12.420
So the language of administration in Syria remains Greek for quite a while.

315
00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.260
In Egypt it remains Greek.

316
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:18.460
In Persia it remains Persian cause the guys that are running it are basically

317
00:22:18.461 --> 00:22:21.370
the same guys who were running it under the old empire.

318
00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:25.220
Why would the Arabs want to get rid of them?
They'd want to get rid of,
you know,

319
00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:30.070
the high officials,
the nobles,
but the functionaries,

320
00:22:30.071 --> 00:22:32.800
the bureaucrats stayed on.

321
00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:39.180
Most people who were Christians or Jews paid no more tax to the conquerors than

322
00:22:41.441 --> 00:22:45.610
they had to the Byzantine or Persian empire.
In other words,

323
00:22:45.611 --> 00:22:50.380
they were conquered.
Their lives did not radically change.
Their taxes,

324
00:22:50.381 --> 00:22:51.490
did not go up.

325
00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:58.350
They didn't really miss the Persian or Byzantine imperial regimes.

326
00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:00.250
The question,
however,

327
00:23:00.251 --> 00:23:04.930
is why are the Arabs so tolerant and this surprises people who assumed that

328
00:23:04.931 --> 00:23:09.931
Islam has always been spread with a kind of a totalizing militancy.

329
00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.470
In fact,
for a time,

330
00:23:14.471 --> 00:23:19.471
the conquerors didn't encourage conversion because you can see the consequences

331
00:23:19.511 --> 00:23:21.040
of conversion for taxation.

332
00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:27.400
If 80% of the population is Jewish and Christian and 80% of the population is in

333
00:23:27.401 --> 00:23:31.090
a high tax bracket,
if you are running things,

334
00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:36.220
it's to your interest that they not convert to that very low 10% tax bracket or

335
00:23:36.221 --> 00:23:39.550
whatever.
Those are caught the,
uh,
religious tax edge.

336
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.860
Go ahead,
have fun.
It's Sunday.
You know,

337
00:23:44.861 --> 00:23:47.090
we'll go to church.
Don't bother me.

338
00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:52.540
Pay Your taxes would be a fairly common attitude on the part of the concourse.

339
00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.860
And of course there's a respect for,
uh,

340
00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:01.230
Christianity and Judaism that I've already mentioned.

341
00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:07.710
Some of it is confidence that eventually people are just going to see that,
uh,

342
00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.350
Islam is a more successful,

343
00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:21.440
up until the Abasand regime SevenFifty a vast majority of the conquered

344
00:24:21.931 --> 00:24:26.700
territory remained in the religion that it had had before the conquest.

345
00:24:26.701 --> 00:24:29.540
In other words,
in Egypt,
in SevenFifty,

346
00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:34.700
a majority of the population were Christian and indeed in Egypt to this day,

347
00:24:34.951 --> 00:24:37.470
10% of the population is Christian.

348
00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:38.843
<v 1>Okay.</v>

349
00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:42.570
<v 0>Certainly Islam would gain,</v>

350
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:47.180
and certainly now,
ironically,

351
00:24:47.181 --> 00:24:52.181
much more than an 800 a d or 1200 a day or 1,580 or 1900 a d it's tough to be a

352
00:24:57.051 --> 00:25:01.280
Christian in Egypt.
This is a problem of modernity,

353
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:05.570
not of the period we're dealing with.

354
00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:12.720
So the process of conquest is very rapid,
but process of Islamization is not.

355
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:14.610
They're not to be confused

356
00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.100
amidst all these triumphs,

357
00:25:22.101 --> 00:25:25.670
the caliphate experiences divisions that culminated in a civil war,

358
00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:28.280
civil war between six 56 and six 61.

359
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:34.190
And this begins,

360
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:39.250
or the origins of it seem to be the murder of Calif Omar in six 44,

361
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.390
he was murdered by a Persian Christian.

362
00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.013
<v 1>Okay.</v>

363
00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:51.180
<v 0>So it's not a Muslim assassination,</v>

364
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.860
but it ushered in another disputed election.

365
00:25:55.890 --> 00:26:00.890
And Ollie poor guy presented himself yet again as the successor of Mohammed.

366
00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:04.831
And again,

367
00:26:04.831 --> 00:26:09.831
he was defeated this time by man with Mon,

368
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:15.240
we,
uh,
along with [inaudible] and Omar,

369
00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:17.010
we mentioned him as one of,

370
00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:19.173
<v 1>okay.</v>

371
00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:24.810
<v 0>The original followers of Mohammed Uthman was a member of a prominent clam,</v>

372
00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:28.893
the Oman.

373
00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:34.683
<v 1>Okay.</v>

374
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:39.860
<v 0>Hey.
Hi.
Status Mecca family.</v>

375
00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:43.260
<v 1>Okay.</v>

376
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:48.120
<v 0>High status,
but the Umayyads had opposed Mohammed Uthman was a success,</v>

377
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:49.253
an exception,

378
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:54.380
but his family were among those people of Mecca who had been the most,

379
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:58.770
uh,
steadfast in opposing this upstart guy.

380
00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:07.110
So to some,

381
00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:13.100
especially the followers of a lay with mon appeared to be a representative of a,

382
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.133
uh,

383
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:21.720
not really staunch Islamic family.

384
00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:26.730
They were not fervent new followers.

385
00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:33.810
Why was Ali passed over so many times?
It's not clear.
You're again,

386
00:27:33.811 --> 00:27:37.340
we're in a very controversial,
uh,

387
00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:42.380
area in which a lot of later tradition elaborates reasons for things that may

388
00:27:42.811 --> 00:27:47.790
not have anything to do with what the reality was.
In,
um,
six 44,

389
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:55.670
you start to have pro Ali parties or traditions.

390
00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:02.720
This is what would become the Shiite party and pro [inaudible] or pro califit

391
00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:07.860
traditions that have the Sunni,

392
00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:13.730
neither of which is completely to be relied on because obviously they are biased

393
00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:22.140
under oath.
Mon,
the pace of conquest continues,

394
00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:29.460
uh,
this naval battle and six 55 took place.

395
00:28:29.461 --> 00:28:33.150
The Battle of the masts in which the Byzantine Navy was defeated by the Arab

396
00:28:33.151 --> 00:28:35.070
navy.
Uh,

397
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:40.280
this meant that islands in the Mediterranean start to fall to the Arabs.

398
00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:46.970
Cyprus was conquered in six 49 roads in six 54.

399
00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:50.820
Meanwhile,
in the former Persian empire,

400
00:28:50.821 --> 00:28:55.800
the eastern part of Iraq tending over towards,
uh,
um,

401
00:28:56.010 --> 00:29:00.510
uh,
Persia was conquered in six 51,
six 53,

402
00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:05.370
Armenia,
north and west of Persia,
uh,

403
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:10.070
east of Anatolia area where the earthquake was recently,
uh,

404
00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:14.100
was conquered in six 53,
six 55,

405
00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:20.390
but Guzman was particularly disliked by much of the population.

406
00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.360
Unlike Omar,
unlike the early Caliphs,

407
00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:29.540
he was regarded as lethargic and as a,

408
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:35.550
uh,
essential list,
let's say with our JIC and profligate,

409
00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:40.020
a lover of luxury,
a monarch rather than a leader,

410
00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:43.140
uh,
it corrupt rulers.

411
00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:45.713
<v 1>Okay.</v>

412
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:54.590
<v 0>And he was murdered by a Muslim in six 56.</v>

413
00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:01.770
Here we have the first assassination of a collar by another member of the

414
00:30:01.771 --> 00:30:02.604
faithful.

415
00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:06.853
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

416
00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:09.370
<v 0>And Ali was proclaimed as caliph.</v>

417
00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:18.550
The problem here is that Ali was proclaimed Colloff by the people who had

418
00:30:18.551 --> 00:30:19.960
assassinated of Mon,

419
00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:25.140
or at least he was perceived as taking the title from the bloodied hands of

420
00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:31.690
assassins.
Whether he knew in advance of the plot against,

421
00:30:31.691 --> 00:30:34.840
with mon is a doubtful,

422
00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.450
but he starts off in a somewhat false position.
His collar off.

423
00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:47.250
He's opposed bitterly body of Maya had family,
but more than that,

424
00:30:47.251 --> 00:30:50.700
his claim to the caliphate is tarnished by the circumstances under which you

425
00:30:50.701 --> 00:30:51.534
came into it.

426
00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:54.413
<v 1>And</v>

427
00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:54.920
<v 0>no,</v>

428
00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:59.920
my Ed rose up against him and starts the first civil war of Islam.

429
00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.620
This is our way up.

430
00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:10.413
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

431
00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:15.370
<v 0>The governor of Syria who revolts in Damascus and leads a,</v>

432
00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:19.300
uh,
uh,
party against Caliph Ali.

433
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.821
In fact,

434
00:31:22.821 --> 00:31:27.740
this gives rise to a militant group of people who hate both climates.

435
00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:33.290
Ali is assassinated and more alia is wounded.

436
00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.450
So I'm why were survives?

437
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:41.350
But the tendency within Islam to dispose of enemies by violent means has,

438
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:46.430
uh,
been sanctioned by the events of this period.

439
00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.300
So six,
six,
31,
the civil war's over more are we are,

440
00:31:53.301 --> 00:31:57.260
moves the capital from Medina to Damascus.

441
00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:03.280
He establishes the Umayyads as a dynasty and they would rule as caliphs,

442
00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.480
uh,
until seven 15.

443
00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.920
What does this move from Medina to Damascus mean

444
00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:13.090
<v 1>was moved from,</v>

445
00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:19.900
<v 0>it certainly is a part of the d Arab possession of the definition of the</v>

446
00:32:21.591 --> 00:32:26.240
caliphate.
Damascus is not an Arab city,
at least in its origin,

447
00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.630
was part of the Byzantine Empire.

448
00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:36.130
It is more centrally located than Medina in terms of administering the empire.

449
00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:41.450
It's also more cosmopolitan.
It has a lot of different kinds of people.

450
00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:50.810
So the move is a way from the Arab heartland to a place where the population is,

451
00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:56.610
uh,
not necessarily Arab.

452
00:32:58.270 --> 00:32:58.660
<v 1>Okay.</v>

453
00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:03.660
<v 0>It is part of the transformation of the caliphate from what we would call</v>

454
00:33:05.381 --> 00:33:09.610
religious leadership to that of a

455
00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:15.660
kind of monarch king.
The college lives in a city.

456
00:33:15.661 --> 00:33:19.770
He lives in a palace.
He has an immense entourage.

457
00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:25.670
The days of the tents in Arabia or of quasar nomadic followers of Mohammed are

458
00:33:28.021 --> 00:33:33.021
definitively over with the defeat of Ali defeat,

459
00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:36.060
but it's not a complete defeat.

460
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:40.810
Shia means party

461
00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:45.100
or to its opponents faction.

462
00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:53.880
And for a long time the Shiites are like the perpetual losers who cannot at the

463
00:33:55.931 --> 00:33:57.580
same time be eliminated.

464
00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:02.290
They are a minority within Islam.

465
00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:08.610
They are at various times seemingly overwhelmed by the wealth armies power of

466
00:34:12.341 --> 00:34:13.174
the caliphs,

467
00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:18.370
but they never go away and they never abandoned their claims.

468
00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:23.410
They form the US eight permanent dissenting group within Islam.

469
00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:26.360
<v 1>Okay.</v>

470
00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.730
<v 0>What is the nature of that descent?</v>

471
00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:34.400
What don't they like about Islam as it's practiced

472
00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:37.830
by the majority in

473
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.260
any sense of that?

474
00:34:42.261 --> 00:34:46.280
From this admittedly busy reading,

475
00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:51.470
it's key that you understand what she is,
um,

476
00:34:51.471 --> 00:34:55.180
is and what it's grievances are,
Spencer,

477
00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:59.240
they reject the colleague as a religious,

478
00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:02.690
they reject the Khalif as a religious figure.

479
00:35:02.691 --> 00:35:05.960
Do they reject him because he's not the descendant of Valet?

480
00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:12.050
Partly,
right.
I mean,
part of this is a succession question.

481
00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:15.290
They reject the college because he's ill.
Legitimate.

482
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:19.730
So it's kind of like a dynastic question.
The only real caliphs,

483
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:22.550
and they don't use the term college,

484
00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:25.640
they start to use the term emom is you've read

485
00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:32.590
the only real religious leader is not the guy sitting in Damascus in his powers

486
00:35:33.321 --> 00:35:38.321
with the position cliff splashing of fountains and you scented perfumes

487
00:35:38.581 --> 00:35:39.414
everywhere.

488
00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:42.883
<v 1>Okay.</v>

489
00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:47.560
<v 0>But to what extent do they re inject the caliphate as such?</v>

490
00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:50.170
Apart from the dynastic question,

491
00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:54.940
how would you describe Shiite political theory

492
00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.740
if the Sunni's are monarchical,

493
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:07.390
if they are comfortable with a colleague who rules over an empire of

494
00:36:07.851 --> 00:36:11.930
unbelievable extent,
what might the Shiites preferred to see?

495
00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:14.600
<v 1>Okay.
It's been,
sorry.</v>

496
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:21.670
<v 0>Uh,
and something more informal indeed,</v>

497
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.690
although I hesitate to use this term,
they are Republican,

498
00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:28.360
Republican,

499
00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:33.370
not in the 21st or 20th century American sense.

500
00:36:33.371 --> 00:36:35.710
What does a Republican mean in this context?

501
00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:44.500
<v 1>Choosing representatives to then carry out the will of</v>

502
00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:45.950
<v 0>yeah,</v>

503
00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:50.950
anti monarchical they regard the Caliph is sorta the George the third of the

504
00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:57.320
Muslim world.
And I think don't want to have a single ruler,

505
00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:00.470
uh,
who is at political ruler.

506
00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:05.650
They're comfortable with rulership in at least some sense,

507
00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:11.440
but the rulership should be either elected or inspired.

508
00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:21.460
They are radicals in part because there dissenters there me out in part because

509
00:37:24.171 --> 00:37:26.360
they are,
um,

510
00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:31.640
they're really angry and they countenance violent tactics of opposition.

511
00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:38.860
They are egalitarian and that's sort of what I mean by Republican.

512
00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:43.580
It's not so much that they necessarily believe in a representative system

513
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:50.230
as that they believe in a system in which one class of believers is not exalted

514
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:57.430
over another and one person is not ruling merely because he comes from a certain

515
00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.050
<v 1>background.</v>

516
00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:12.220
<v 0>Now what happens when religious movements are frustrated?</v>

517
00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:17.700
That is when they are objects of repression because indeed the Shiites worn,

518
00:38:19.111 --> 00:38:24.010
not particularly tolerated by the college.

519
00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:30.300
Often such religious groups become fixated on a future in which their claims

520
00:38:31.661 --> 00:38:32.680
will be vindicated.

521
00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:35.980
<v 1>Ms Certainly</v>

522
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:40.510
<v 0>makes sense.
The Christians persecuted under the Roman Empire wrote,</v>

523
00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:44.920
but granddaddy of all prophetic texts,

524
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:48.820
prophetic of the destruction of your enemies,
the book of revelations,

525
00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:54.010
I suggest that you take a look at that anyway as it's always interesting reading

526
00:38:55.030 --> 00:39:00.030
and it is the book of the Bible that has the most relevance for better or worse

527
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:06.510
to the current world we live in because it's the one that talks constantly about

528
00:39:07.601 --> 00:39:11.860
the future.
And what's going to happen is that future,

529
00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:16.890
the apple computer future where everybody's wonderfully connected and we all,

530
00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:22.060
you know,
can just float in some kind of,
um,

531
00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:25.090
great brain that we participate in.

532
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:30.300
Or is the future some terrible ecological disaster in which will be,
you know,

533
00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:35.580
cannibals and stuff or is the future the visitation of those angels,

534
00:39:37.991 --> 00:39:42.520
those candlesticks,
those,
you know,
flowing rivers of molten metal and stuff.

535
00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:46.420
As in the book of revelations,
we'll can we make trumpets all over the place.

536
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:47.410
Will,
you know,

537
00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:52.410
one third of the population be wiped out one day and then another third the next

538
00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:57.640
day.
And the narrator of the book of revelations cannot wait for this to happen.

539
00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:03.060
It is in the nature of apocalyptic thinking that it is violent because your

540
00:40:04.541 --> 00:40:08.890
enemies who are right now persecuting you are going to be confounded and they're

541
00:40:08.891 --> 00:40:12.970
not going to be confounded in the,
Oh gee,
I'm really sorry I persecuted you.

542
00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:18.060
Since they're going to be split apart and pulverized and you're going to be

543
00:40:19.151 --> 00:40:22.720
watching and you're going to be applauding while they're split apart and

544
00:40:22.721 --> 00:40:27.310
pulverized and torture.
That's the nature of mess.

545
00:40:27.311 --> 00:40:29.380
Cyanic apocalyptic thinking,

546
00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:33.520
apocalyptic meaning the end of the world in some kind of conflagration.

547
00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:36.520
Cyanic meaning the presence of a savior.

548
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:41.020
The two are not the same thing,

549
00:40:41.021 --> 00:40:44.710
but they tend to go together cause there's gonna be somebody who's going to come

550
00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:47.620
and amidst the bloodshed in the fire,

551
00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:51.640
a usher in a millennial world,

552
00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:56.700
that is to say a world in which bad things have been purged and that Messiah may

553
00:40:57.431 --> 00:41:00.340
be Jesus Christ at the second coming.

554
00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:06.810
It may be the Messiah of Jewish tradition or in Shiite Islam,

555
00:41:07.481 --> 00:41:10.390
it may be the mom,

556
00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:12.760
the rightly guided in mom.

557
00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:18.100
The Shiites has a leader.
I've just said that they're Republican and Egalitarian,

558
00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:20.440
but they're not some kind of

559
00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:26.050
occupy Wall Street.
We don't have any leaders and archaic group.

560
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.030
They have leaders,

561
00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:31.840
but they are leaders who are inspired not,

562
00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:36.920
I'm merely administrators have a huge bureaucracy and these moms succeed each

563
00:41:38.391 --> 00:41:41.270
other and are recognized by the Shiite faction.

564
00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:43.593
<v 1>Okay.</v>

565
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:46.640
<v 0>Until the death of the 11th in mom,</v>

566
00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:53.560
the death of the 11th in mom without any obvious successor who is the 12th emom.

567
00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:58.330
And we enter into this period of what the book calls occultation,

568
00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:03.740
not a word that
you find used.

569
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:08.750
Well,
right.
It's got some sort of medical meaning to

570
00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.170
occultation.
Meaning what?

571
00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:16.150
<v 1>Okay.</v>

572
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:17.530
<v 0>Oh,
come on.
This is in the reading.</v>

573
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:22.120
He's gone into hiding occult means hidden.

574
00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:27.730
There is a 12th and mom,
we just don't know where he is.
He's in a cave somewhere

575
00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:32.800
and there are moms and moms after him.

576
00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:37.690
Either he is deathless or he has,
there are other amounts,

577
00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:41.200
but they're all hidden because they're not ready yet.

578
00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:43.450
But when they are ready,

579
00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:49.090
centuries of grievance are going to be uh,
uh,
revenge.

580
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:56.510
So there is a notion of a corrupt and misguided Islamic establishment

581
00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:03.170
and of a true subterranean,

582
00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:04.670
a cult

583
00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:10.440
righteous level of um,

584
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:11.783
<v 1>yeah,</v>

585
00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:17.520
<v 0>uh,
of,
um,
the practice of the religion.</v>

586
00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:23.650
So she isn't,
tends to apocalyptic thinking to prophecy

587
00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.430
is,
uh,

588
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:32.510
exalts Ali and his followers and it feels that it is in touch with the original

589
00:43:32.911 --> 00:43:34.290
desert austere steer,

590
00:43:34.291 --> 00:43:38.940
a galette Tyrian roots of Islam that had been corrupted by the monarchical

591
00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:45.590
suspect purity of the Suni Caliphate who becomes a Shiite.

592
00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:50.603
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

593
00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:55.330
<v 0>This is a hard question to answer because it is more than just a party or</v>

594
00:43:55.331 --> 00:43:59.470
faction.
If it was just a part of your faction,
it could not have lasted,
uh,

595
00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:03.010
into the contemporary world with the force that it has,

596
00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.930
who is discontent under Islam.

597
00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:15.880
It would seem logical that the people who would be discontent would be non Arabs

598
00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:22.210
because there is increasingly as the uh,

599
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:27.790
Islamic world takes shape a population of people who do convert to Islam who are

600
00:44:31.111 --> 00:44:32.040
not Arabs.

601
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:36.270
We've said that the pace of Islam and hey was slow,

602
00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:41.570
but nevertheless it was persistent and logical.

603
00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:44.610
It's logical that people should have converted to Islam,

604
00:44:44.611 --> 00:44:49.200
not only because it is a religion that to this day attracts lots of converts

605
00:44:49.201 --> 00:44:53.770
because uh,
it has a religious appeal.
Uh,

606
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:58.530
and as I argued it is,
um,
it's a doable religion.

607
00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:02.280
It's a religion that does not have a huge number of self.

608
00:45:02.281 --> 00:45:07.281
Mortifying precepts is a way of living a righteous life in the world,

609
00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:11.820
uh,
and performing certain duties that are not um,

610
00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:16.800
tremendously honorous or very subtle and involve a lot of mental um,

611
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:18.990
uh,
internal dialogue.

612
00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:23.310
So people are converting to Islam.

613
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:28.670
These people are known collectively as Marc Walley singular Marwan Marwan is a

614
00:45:36.511 --> 00:45:41.511
non Arab Muslim in the early years sort of by definition a convert the day that

615
00:45:45.991 --> 00:45:47.130
the mosque is fell,

616
00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:52.160
there were no Muslims in Damascus except maybe for some Arab traders

617
00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:59.010
as of the death of Muhammad.
All Muslims were Arabs.

618
00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:05.130
But within decades of this with the conquests and conversion,

619
00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:08.490
there are lots of non Arab Muslims.

620
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:13.230
They may need to learn Arabic to understand the Koran.

621
00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.960
They're supposed to go to Mecca and so forth,

622
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.630
but they are not Arabs.

623
00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:23.870
Are they equal to Arabs?
Well,

624
00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:27.640
Arabs are always to this day going to feel themselves to have a special

625
00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:28.750
relationship,

626
00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:34.030
a special status should we say because Mohammed was an Arab and the movement

627
00:46:34.031 --> 00:46:37.870
starts in Arabia.
But as I'm sure you know,

628
00:46:37.930 --> 00:46:42.930
the largest countries from a point of view of population that are Islamic are

629
00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:46.990
not Arabic almost at all.

630
00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:50.260
Indonesia is the largest Muslim country in the world.

631
00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:55.360
India is the second largest Muslim country in the world actually,

632
00:46:55.361 --> 00:46:59.140
even though it's population is so large that Islam is a minority there.

633
00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:02.790
Pakistan is the third largest,
I think,
uh,

634
00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:06.160
these all our contribution without Arabs,

635
00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:11.410
Iran is not Arabic.
It is,
as we all know,

636
00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:13.450
an Islamic republic,

637
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:18.070
the w the world of Arabs is very numerous,

638
00:47:18.071 --> 00:47:20.500
but the world of non Arab Muslims is more so,

639
00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:24.320
and it is starting to become that way.

640
00:47:24.321 --> 00:47:28.300
In the period that we're talking about was the Arabs are simply a small number

641
00:47:28.301 --> 00:47:32.800
of concours and particularly in Persia,
uh,

642
00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:36.940
where the pace of conversion is faster than that of say Egypt or Syria.

643
00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:38.610
There are a lot of Milwaukee.

644
00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:41.150
<v 1>Okay.</v>

645
00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:44.720
<v 0>At some point,
some of the benefits of conversion,</v>

646
00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:47.570
the fiscal benefits of conversion are eliminated.

647
00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:50.210
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

648
00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:52.330
<v 0>Because the state,
the caliphate,</v>

649
00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:57.350
it can't afford to have a population that is only paying the low religious tax.

650
00:47:58.730 --> 00:48:03.200
So it would seem that the moment at which you say,
okay,

651
00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:05.540
we're happy that you're becoming a Muslim,

652
00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.870
you're still paying land and poll taxes because we can't,

653
00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:13.640
we can't actually aspire to make all Muslims equal from a fiscal point of view.

654
00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:18.170
At that point you would have some angry,
my Wally,
at least.
So one would think,

655
00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:23.350
and so one would think these would be prodo Shiites or she I recruiting grounds.

656
00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:27.013
<v 1>Okay.</v>

657
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:31.940
<v 0>There's a lot of debate about this Berkey kind of skirts over this issue.
Um,</v>

658
00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:35.370
other scholars doubt that this is the case.

659
00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:40.030
They don't actually think that there's such a close connection between,
um,

660
00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:43.710
the Shiite party and discontented people,

661
00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:47.490
or at least there is a connection between the Shiite party and discontented

662
00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:47.940
people.

663
00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:51.750
But the discontented people are not discontent because of their tax position.

664
00:48:54.210 --> 00:48:55.043
<v 1>Okay.</v>

665
00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:59.190
<v 0>The presence of discontent within Islam is a constant.</v>

666
00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:03.630
The presence of prophecy within Islam is a constant,

667
00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:07.290
even though the teaching of the religion has been,

668
00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:10.410
that is that Mohammed is the last prophet.

669
00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:16.310
It's very hard to put a stop to prophesy in the Christian religion,

670
00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:21.330
in the Jewish religion,
in the Muslim religion.

671
00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:26.140
Once you have started to talk about inspired religious leaders,
uh,

672
00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:28.390
they're going to crop up,
uh,

673
00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:33.440
even after you've declared an end of a religious charisma and the consequences

674
00:49:34.441 --> 00:49:39.441
of that and the splendor nevertheless have the opposite empire will form our

675
00:49:39.541 --> 00:49:42.360
subject for the next lecture.
