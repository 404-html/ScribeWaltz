1
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.550
We're not going to talk today now about Carolingian decline.
Uh,

2
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.000
it's not just that we're compressing lectures or in a hurry.

3
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.800
And the empire of Charlemagne is an empire that does not last that long.

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.640
So when we say that it has certain flaws like size,

5
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.820
well we already said that the Roman Empire had this flaw.

6
00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:24.450
We've already said that the Abbasid Caliphate has this floor floor,

7
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:29.451
but those empires are able to manage with this weakness for quite some time.

8
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.093
Um,

9
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.700
part of the problem with the Carolingian empire is its size part of it.

10
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:41.430
However,
as you will have read in,
uh,
the,
uh,

11
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.460
fished in our reading is it's lack of infrastructure and economic development

12
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:53.460
infrastructure in the sense of not just towns,
roads,

13
00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:57.300
communications,
but a social infrastructure.

14
00:00:57.301 --> 00:01:02.301
The lack of an idea of obeying the state or obeying the ruler and a tendency

15
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.320
therefore to mix private and public interest and to the benefit of the powerful.

16
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.950
Uh,
we'll talk more about that.
There are also external problems,

17
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:21.210
the beginnings of the Viking invasions,
which we will be talking about,
uh,

18
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.330
after the break,
uh,

19
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.450
occur before Charlemagne death in eight 14.

20
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.610
But nevertheless,
there's no sense hastening the signs of decline.

21
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.230
We always can see signs of decline coming after.
Uh,
but,

22
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.710
um,
Charlemagne's rule had been so successful,

23
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.400
so full of accomplishments.
He was a ruler of such prestige,
uh,

24
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.450
that even the difficult last 10 years or so of his reign can't quite it clips

25
00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:57.450
that.
Um,
in,
uh,
uh,
eight oh one,

26
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.430
there arrived an elephant at the court of Charlemagne,

27
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.050
a gift from the Caliph of Baghdad,
Iran,

28
00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:12.030
Al Rashid,
the Caliph who figures in the Arabian nights,
entertainments.

29
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.133
Uh,

30
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.200
this is a link between two very powerful and very distant empires.

31
00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:24.351
The two of the three that we've described as in some sense heirs to the Roman

32
00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:30.110
classical empire and civilization.
Uh,

33
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.560
there was a kind of tentative thought of perhaps in alliance,
uh,

34
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.660
between Baghdad and him at capital of Charlotte,
Maine's a empire.

35
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.890
Um,

36
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.400
at various times there had been negotiations between Constantinople and Ah,

37
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.210
and over,
uh,
the,
um,

38
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.270
discussing the possibility of an imperial marriage.

39
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.490
The Carolingian ruler was contemptuous of Byzantium though because it was ruled

40
00:02:56.491 --> 00:03:01.390
by a woman,
the emperor Irene rather figure.
Um,

41
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.710
but,
uh,
neither the alliance with Byzantium,
uh,

42
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:06.820
at least at this point,

43
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and certainly not the more far fetched alliance with Baghdad came to anything.

44
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:17.311
The elephant was certainly the first one seen in Europe probably since Hannibal

45
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.630
and his,
uh,
uh,
attempt to,
well,
his invasion of Italy.
Um,

46
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.580
and,
uh,
you know,
how he got there,
what the logistics of his transport work,

47
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.650
how he got to Baghdad in the first place.

48
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:34.510
It's not as if they have elephants in the natural habitat of Iraq,
either.

49
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.070
Nevertheless,
hears this elephant who lives for about 10 years.
Uh,

50
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.810
one of the signs of things starting to unravel in the Carolingian empire,

51
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.410
so some historians say is the death of Charlemagne,
is elephant,

52
00:03:47.411 --> 00:03:51.460
which Einhard talks about actually in his biography.
That is,

53
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:56.410
it is an event that's worth mentioning.
Uh,
but I,
you know,
pets,

54
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.810
they,
you know,
they don't last forever.
And you've got it.

55
00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:03.190
It's someone who lost his cat,
uh,
uh,
within recent memory.

56
00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:05.770
You just got to get over it.
On the other hand,
I,

57
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.310
I can get another cat and Charlemagne presumably,

58
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.230
well,
not presumably we know he didn't get another elephant.

59
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.320
The high watermark of his reign seems to be the year eight oh two.
I mean,

60
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.290
this is arbitrary,
but,
uh,

61
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.670
this is shown by the energy of his quarrel with the Byzantine emperors over his

62
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.910
arrogating to himself,
the title of Emperor,
Right.

63
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.030
That's the first person in the west claiming to be emperor.

64
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.320
And the Byzantine Empire doesn't like it.
Uh,

65
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.360
by eight Oh two,
he is done with his two campaigns,

66
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.410
one in Spain,
uh,

67
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.590
and the other in Saxony and the regions of the Danube.

68
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.420
He had pacified the Saxons after a nearly 20 year effort.

69
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.340
Uh,
and while he hadn't achieved his ambitions in Spain,
um,

70
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.370
he had a seize territory in the northern part of what's now Catalonia.

71
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.140
He attempted to address the problem that I've just identified,

72
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:21.160
namely the tendency of powerful people to take over,

73
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.070
uh,
um,

74
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.460
and rule localities not as government servants,

75
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.200
but as noble rulers.
Uh,
he,
um,

76
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.220
in order to combat that,
tried to get everybody,

77
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.400
every free man in his realm to swear an oath to him personally,

78
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.180
that is to make sure that they understood that their prime loyalty had to be to

79
00:05:46.181 --> 00:05:50.950
the emperor and not to the count.
Duke,
uh,
local ruler,

80
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.540
bishop,
whoever he was

81
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.700
and the instructions that he gave to the men's sent out to try and,

82
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.030
um,
to administer this oath.
Show you some of his idea of rulership.

83
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.770
We've talked about this already,
but since it's a fairly complex idea,
it's worth,

84
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.983
um,

85
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:12.180
<v 1>yeah,</v>

86
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.060
<v 0>emphasizing in the instructions it says,</v>

87
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.180
let each man keep himself in the sacred service of God following the divine

88
00:06:20.521 --> 00:06:24.810
commandment and observing whatever promise he may have made fully to the best of

89
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.840
under his understanding and powers for the Lord.

90
00:06:27.841 --> 00:06:32.841
Emperor cannot exercise his vigilance or powers of correction over every man.

91
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.780
So the notion that the emperor is supposed to be responsible for people behaving

92
00:06:39.781 --> 00:06:44.781
themselves is responsible for not just what we would call political order or

93
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.080
piece,
but for the salvation of the people.

94
00:06:49.081 --> 00:06:54.081
For the spiritual as well as a political health of the realm is uh,

95
00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.110
typically Carolingian and in a way,
typically mid evil.

96
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.960
There's a sense of imperial responsibility before God for the behavior of the

97
00:07:06.241 --> 00:07:07.590
emperors subjects.

98
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.050
But already a few years later and eight Oh six,

99
00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.140
this idea has been weakened

100
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.840
in eight oh six.
If you take a look at the first map that I've given out,

101
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.680
we have a partition in eight oh six,

102
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.490
an agreement at a place called [inaudible] veal.

103
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.170
I guess this is going to have to be spelled out since we don't have chalked t,
H,

104
00:07:37.171 --> 00:07:41.100
I.
O.
N.
V.
I.
L.
L.
E,
and it's written on the first,

105
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.760
well now it just says proposed partition in eight Oh six,

106
00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:48.570
he came up with the idea of dividing his realm.

107
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.160
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

108
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.650
<v 0>Uh,
upon his three children,</v>

109
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.980
his son Charles would get the north,

110
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
his son Pepin would get Lombardi in Bavaria and his son Louis would have

111
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.070
Aquitaine in this document.

112
00:08:06.071 --> 00:08:11.071
There's no mention of the imperial title leading one to surmise that maybe he

113
00:08:11.801 --> 00:08:14.770
thought this title was just his personal accomplishment.

114
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.880
Maybe he didn't really envisage the reestablishment of the Roman Empire in any

115
00:08:20.921 --> 00:08:22.210
kind of permanent way.

116
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:24.410
<v 1>Okay.</v>

117
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.290
<v 0>Here we just have a kind of splitting up of land.</v>

118
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.370
Louis gets the south west.
Charles gets the lion's share,

119
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:39.020
the heartlands of the Carolingian family.
Um,

120
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.333
uh,

121
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.420
the parts of Germany that the Carolingian is controlled and northern France and

122
00:08:44.421 --> 00:08:46.820
Pepin gets Italy and the outs.

123
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.390
So here you have a contrast between eight oh two,

124
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:56.730
this grandiose imperial idea of unity eight Oh six,
uh,

125
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.290
just like the Merovingians partitioning out,
uh,

126
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.390
the successor to Charlotte and the lands,
uh,
uh,

127
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.890
for the successors of Charlemagne.

128
00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.020
Ah,N is a long way from being another Byzantium Constantinople or another

129
00:09:12.021 --> 00:09:12.854
Baghdad.

130
00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.810
And in these low capiche hilarious.

131
00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.840
The documents that are issued by the court of instructions to the administrators

132
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.160
we do see as fished.

133
00:09:27.161 --> 00:09:31.790
And how emphasizes a sense of,
um,

134
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:37.090
unease and have problems again and again.
The capitulate,
Larry's lament,

135
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.830
corruption maladministration.

136
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:43.623
<v 1>Okay.</v>

137
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:44.440
<v 0>Uh,</v>

138
00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.440
they start to mention the vikings as a more than just a minor mosquito bite

139
00:09:51.521 --> 00:09:54.070
level,
um,
distraction.

140
00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:01.200
But most of all they emphasize usurpation of royal authority.

141
00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.600
Usurpation meaning again,

142
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:09.840
that the people such as the counts or Duke's or the nobles who are supposed to

143
00:10:12.071 --> 00:10:14.800
be servants of the crown,

144
00:10:14.801 --> 00:10:17.830
supposed to be his chief servants,

145
00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.300
are taking over for themselves.
Things like taxes,

146
00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:27.670
revenues,
the right of judgment,
the right to punish people.

147
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:34.110
And people are tending to look at them as their rulers.

148
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.210
But count of Flanders,
the count of Barcelona,
the Duke of Aquitaine.

149
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:45.480
These are people who are starting to think of themselves as potentially at least

150
00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:51.160
rulers who might transmit their office to their children.

151
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.590
And if then is not an office,

152
00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:58.210
it's a possession if you have a right of inheritance.
In other words,

153
00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.720
uh,
um,

154
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.920
I could transmit to my children my 10 year old car,

155
00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:11.350
uh,
um,
my,
um,
silver butter dish,

156
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.050
all of my treasured possessions,

157
00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:19.240
but I cannot transmit to them the professorship that I have.

158
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.370
I can't just say,
well,
you know,

159
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:25.900
my eldest son is going to be a professor of medieval history at Yale.

160
00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.470
Whether or not he has any interest in doing that because I don't own the

161
00:11:29.471 --> 00:11:33.250
position,
uh,
I don't,
it's not my property.

162
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.140
It is my office.

163
00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:39.430
We're so familiar with this that we don't even think about what it would be
like.

164
00:11:39.431 --> 00:11:39.581
Well,

165
00:11:39.581 --> 00:11:44.440
we actually do because there are some things that people do tend to start to own

166
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:49.300
that originally were not supposed to be that way.
But,
uh,
in the Medieval world,

167
00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:54.510
it is a problem to dislodge people from property because properties in land,

168
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:59.890
all Yale has to do is stop paying me and I'm no longer benefiting from this

169
00:11:59.891 --> 00:12:03.520
office.
On the other hand,
if I had a castle,
um,
you know,

170
00:12:03.521 --> 00:12:06.040
across campus and some stored,

171
00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:10.910
some boiling pit and some followers naturally,
uh,
some,
uh,
you know,

172
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:15.850
trustee drinking mates.
And,
um,
you know,
had this,

173
00:12:15.851 --> 00:12:19.000
a little a moat and by he establishment,
uh,

174
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:23.710
right outside of harkness I could terrorize yet,
uh,
and extort from it.

175
00:12:23.711 --> 00:12:27.280
And the picture is not so far fence where the picture,

176
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.530
where the picture is really not far fetched because if you imagine Yale in
ruins,

177
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.223
um,

178
00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:39.160
people pastoring sheep on cross campus and wondering God,

179
00:12:39.161 --> 00:12:42.280
what were those buildings anyway,
I hear you really huge.
And,

180
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:47.260
and all those funny little blackboards,
whatever they were for a,
and then,

181
00:12:47.261 --> 00:12:52.150
you know,
using Wla to build,
um,
you know,
fortifications,

182
00:12:52.151 --> 00:12:56.830
why build a new castle on the lawn when you can,

183
00:12:56.831 --> 00:13:01.090
um,
you know,
you've got building materials that somebody else left for you.
So,

184
00:13:01.091 --> 00:13:04.690
you know,
WLA h one 17,
one 16,
one 15,

185
00:13:04.691 --> 00:13:09.240
or one person's fortress and uh,
you know,
that auditorium at the other end,

186
00:13:09.241 --> 00:13:12.910
the is somebody else's.
And A,
here,

187
00:13:12.911 --> 00:13:14.380
I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself,

188
00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.430
but this is what's going to happen once the Carolingian empire dissolves.

189
00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:20.080
Essentially we're going to have,

190
00:13:20.081 --> 00:13:25.081
when I say people USERP or arrogated or make hereditary their possessions.

191
00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:29.080
Uh,
I'm talking about something that sounds abstract,

192
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.910
but if you think of it in terms of what it means to defy people.

193
00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:39.430
Um,
basically you're talking about building castles and this has to do with the

194
00:13:39.431 --> 00:13:43.930
nature of warfare.
This is all a subject for the courses exceeds this one,
but,

195
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.100
um,
it has to do with the nature of warfare in the sense that once you have that

196
00:13:48.101 --> 00:13:52.480
castle,
it's very hard to be dislodged from it.
The advantages with the defense,

197
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:56.630
um,
catapults,
Trevi,

198
00:13:56.631 --> 00:14:00.670
Shay's all these interesting weapons actually both require an insane amount of

199
00:14:00.671 --> 00:14:05.671
mobilization and organization and are not as effective as artillery.

200
00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.160
Uh,
some centuries later is going to be

201
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.690
so the problems of Charlemagne,
his empire,

202
00:14:13.691 --> 00:14:18.370
despite the invasions that will be our subject for um,
uh,

203
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.170
Monday after thanksgiving.

204
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:25.260
The problems of Charlemagne's empire are essentially internal as was the case of

205
00:14:25.811 --> 00:14:30.760
the Roman Empire.
Only more so these internal problems,

206
00:14:30.761 --> 00:14:33.160
what I've called the lack of infrastructure,

207
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:38.650
which means political and economic infrastructure make it very difficult

208
00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:41.290
effectively to resist the Vikings.

209
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.550
And there are other invaders whom will have to mention as well later on the

210
00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:49.060
Hungarians.
Um,
and um,
uh,

211
00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:52.310
invaders and Raiders from North Africa.

212
00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:58.860
The empire was too large given the nature of communications and the

213
00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:00.360
<v 1>okay</v>

214
00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.360
<v 0>mechanisms available to impose order.</v>

215
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:07.550
It had the same thing that made it an empire,
uh,

216
00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.420
made it have some disadvantages.
Diversity of population.

217
00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:13.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

218
00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.340
<v 0>Um,
ethnic loyalties.</v>

219
00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:18.890
Um,

220
00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:23.890
so you have revolts of Aquitania ones who are not Frank's of Britain's people in

221
00:15:24.741 --> 00:15:29.580
Brittany who are not Frank's Bavarians Visigoths.

222
00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:34.430
All of these people are not necessarily overjoyed with Frankish rural,

223
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:39.640
not necessarily immune from the possibility of seizing on the weakness of the

224
00:15:39.651 --> 00:15:41.240
Franks to rebel.

225
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:50.510
These problems become more manifest in the reign of Charlemagne son Louis,

226
00:15:50.511 --> 00:15:55.511
the pious who rolls from eight 14 to eight 40.

227
00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.960
My hesitation in using the word rules is that he has deposed once and forced to

228
00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:05.660
go undergo public penance twice.

229
00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.073
<v 1>Okay.</v>

230
00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:13.210
<v 0>One of the problems of the empire was obviated.
However,</v>

231
00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:16.240
when Charlemagne died in eight 14,

232
00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:21.400
the succession was just to Lewis because his brothers had died.

233
00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:26.590
So the eight oh six or eight,
oh six plan was not implemented,

234
00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.060
uh,
and became moot.

235
00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:33.160
Charlemagne was succeeded by one sole ruler over the entire empire.

236
00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.430
Louis the pious because Pepin and Charles had died.

237
00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:37.463
<v 1>Okay.</v>

238
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:40.950
<v 0>Lewis is often seen as inept,</v>

239
00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:45.780
but well meaning his sobriquet and a lot of the Carolingian rulers now have

240
00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:51.000
less flattering men.
Pious Charles the bald,
well,
you know,

241
00:16:51.001 --> 00:16:54.420
that seems a little unfair.
Um,
Charles,

242
00:16:54.421 --> 00:16:59.400
the simple Charles the fat Louis the stammer Louis the child,

243
00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.610
um,
you get the idea,

244
00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:07.260
I'm not unimposing group of rulers,
but pious,

245
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:12.270
shouldn't us be a compliment?
And indeed,
um,
uh,

246
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.700
uh,
it could be,
and,
and as it happens,

247
00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:18.710
he's not known as Louis the pious in every language.
Uh,

248
00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:23.850
so in German he's referred to as low as the pious,
but in French,
uh,
he's,
uh,

249
00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:28.080
Louis,
the debonair,
the,
uh,
imposing.

250
00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:32.820
He is an imposing figure.
Actually.
He's not as weak as what I'm going to say,

251
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.550
uh,
in the rest of the discussion about him is going to make him look.

252
00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:39.730
He was a very effective general.
He did a lot of,
uh,
uh,

253
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:44.700
wars in southern France.
He was the effective ruler of Aquitaine.

254
00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:46.920
He,
um,
uh,

255
00:17:46.921 --> 00:17:50.250
conquered a Barcelona for Charlemagne.

256
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.850
Uh,
he suffered from three problems,

257
00:17:56.851 --> 00:17:58.210
however,
um,

258
00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:03.480
one not at all of his own making the second,

259
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:08.950
uh,
certainly exacerbated by his vacillation.
Uh,

260
00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.690
and the third is just who he was.
The first problem is the invasions.

261
00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:18.180
The Viking invasions in particular begin during his reign,

262
00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:22.290
the first part of the ninth century.
And,
um,

263
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.410
so it's an external problem.
On the other hand,

264
00:18:25.411 --> 00:18:27.990
the lack of an effective response

265
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.800
does have to do with,
um,

266
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:36.980
flaws in the nature of Carolingian rule flaws in the nature of Lewis's rule in

267
00:18:37.681 --> 00:18:38.514
particular.

268
00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:43.080
The second problem is his sons,

269
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:47.940
his sons fought against each other and against their father.

270
00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:52.980
This is not something that's new to us.
We've seen this with the Merovingians,

271
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:58.380
but in order to maintain control of,

272
00:18:58.770 --> 00:18:59.250
uh,

273
00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:04.250
sons who expect some kind of rulership and who are jockeying for power,

274
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.860
uh,
with their siblings,
um,

275
00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:13.010
Lewis made it worst in part because he had sons by two marriages and tried to

276
00:19:13.591 --> 00:19:17.940
carve out another realm for his youngest son,
Charles,

277
00:19:17.941 --> 00:19:20.520
the Bald Charles.
The future,
the bald.
I mean,

278
00:19:20.521 --> 00:19:24.060
I don't know that he was called Charles the bald when he was 14.

279
00:19:24.061 --> 00:19:28.500
I actually don't know when that title starts to come into effect,

280
00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.290
not title,
nickname.
Um,

281
00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:37.170
as we'll see,

282
00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:42.180
these civil wars have greater significance than mere civil wars because they're

283
00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:47.181
at the origins of the breaking up of the empire into entities that we can just

284
00:19:48.121 --> 00:19:50.760
about start to call France and Germany.

285
00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:56.420
So we're at the kind of crucible or moment of creation of the European order

286
00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:02.730
that will exist for the next,
uh,
more than 1000 years.

287
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:08.700
Lewis had very sophisticated ideas about imperial rule,

288
00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:13.800
perhaps even more sophisticated than those of his father because Louis was quite

289
00:20:13.801 --> 00:20:17.850
a,
a bit more educated than Charlemagne,

290
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.900
quite literate.
Um,

291
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.590
one might almost say an intellectual as well as an effective general,

292
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.180
but he was less pragmatic,
less realistic,

293
00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:32.910
less flexible than his father.

294
00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:36.210
Even more than Charlemagne.

295
00:20:36.211 --> 00:20:41.211
Lewis believed that the emperor must answer before God for the conduct of his

296
00:20:41.551 --> 00:20:44.550
population.
Even more than Charlemagne.

297
00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:48.670
He believed that he ruled over a,
um,

298
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:54.100
a sanctified state.
In other words,
he was not just a political ruler.
He was,

299
00:20:54.101 --> 00:20:58.330
in some sense,
a religious leader that the religious and the political,

300
00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:00.790
we're not to be distinguished.

301
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:08.640
If the state is a religious entity,

302
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:14.840
does it mean that the state rules over the church or if it's a religious entity,

303
00:21:16.111 --> 00:21:19.320
perhaps it means that the church rules over the state.

304
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:21.930
It can go either way.

305
00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:26.190
When Charlemagne was crowned by the pope,

306
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:32.960
he certainly indicated a conception of rulership sanctified by the church.

307
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:37.650
He was not at all worried about the pope dictating to him.

308
00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.170
He had rescued the pope from the Roman mob.

309
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.100
The pope was utterly dependent on him.
Okay,

310
00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:44.300
<v 1>okay.</v>

311
00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:49.300
<v 0>But that is not necessarily the way things would be and Louis had less to worry</v>

312
00:21:49.641 --> 00:21:54.641
about from the pope's then from his own bishops taking his rulership as a sacred

313
00:21:56.571 --> 00:21:56.931
trust.

314
00:21:56.931 --> 00:22:01.931
Seriously meant that an eight 22 he appeared at a place called [inaudible],

315
00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.030
eight t.
T.
I.
G.
N.
Y.

316
00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:13.030
Apt to me in the church of at t need covered with ashes and dressed in sack

317
00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.433
cloth.

318
00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:20.500
The Bible describes and which I guess burlap would be the best kind of modern

319
00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.940
equivalent.
So dressed in,
you know,
kind of rags,

320
00:22:25.941 --> 00:22:30.941
literally covered with ashes to ask forgiveness for the way in which the

321
00:22:32.451 --> 00:22:35.930
rebellion of his nephew Bernard had been suppressed.

322
00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:41.240
Not only were his sons restless,
but his nephew had rebelled,

323
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:43.910
been captured,

324
00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:49.840
been blinded and died the blinding or maybe the knew how to do it better in

325
00:22:51.321 --> 00:22:55.790
Byzantium.
Um,
we're supposed to be a more humane alternative,

326
00:22:55.791 --> 00:22:59.510
rendering them unfit to rule but sparing his life.
But in the NT.
Dot.

327
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:05.470
Louis was full of remorse for this and did a public act of penance.

328
00:23:05.901 --> 00:23:10.430
And we know from the experience of all forms of rulership,

329
00:23:10.431 --> 00:23:11.660
including modern,

330
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:16.990
that there are ways of saying you're sorry and ways of not saying you're sorry.

331
00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:24.160
The problem with a political officer or ruler saying they are sorry is that it

332
00:23:25.131 --> 00:23:26.660
may make them look weak.

333
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:27.960
<v 1>Okay.</v>

334
00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:31.140
<v 0>It may make them lose their aura of leadership.</v>

335
00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:35.490
The problem with them not saying they're sorry.
In modern.

336
00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.200
The modern world of course,

337
00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:42.450
is also very great and it's very tricky to negotiate a line of,

338
00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:48.890
um,
that preserves,
but also gives at least the impression of candor.

339
00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:54.620
Louis does not have Charlemagne instinctive charisma of leadership.

340
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:59.360
The pennants at at teeny resulted in his,
uh,

341
00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:00.740
loss of prestige

342
00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:06.300
and a great increase in the power of the church.

343
00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.910
So there's always been an implicit danger of this.

344
00:24:11.911 --> 00:24:16.911
Once Frankish end Christian ideas of rulership were merged.

345
00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:22.170
Charlemagne,
as I've said,
had no problem with us,

346
00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:28.610
but Louis did already in eight 29 Pope Gregory the fourth would claim is not the

347
00:24:31.051 --> 00:24:32.700
authority oversouls,

348
00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:36.660
which belongs to the pope above the imperial rule,

349
00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:40.630
which is of this world.
Right.

350
00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:45.760
The implication here is that because the spiritual is superior to the material

351
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.590
in moral terms,

352
00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:54.280
and why is the spiritual superior to the material was sort of Plato's republic

353
00:24:54.771 --> 00:24:59.410
kind of question.
I'm just saying this.
Yes.

354
00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:00.980
Morality over,
you know,

355
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:06.230
like the pleasures of loss and not merely morality over the pleasures of lost.

356
00:25:06.401 --> 00:25:06.641
What's,

357
00:25:06.641 --> 00:25:11.530
what's the problem with the pleasures of lust from the Killjoy Plato's Republic

358
00:25:11.531 --> 00:25:16.210
point of view?
They end,
right?

359
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:20.080
They end,
they are mortal,
they die.

360
00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.850
And so is all matter.
By definition,
all matter fades.

361
00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:26.770
So which is superior,

362
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:30.040
the spiritual or the material,

363
00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:34.150
the spiritual doesn't die.
The spiritual is immortal.

364
00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:35.830
That's what makes it spiritual.

365
00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:41.680
That's what the forms or reality or the higher,

366
00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:44.440
the invisible,
the invisible,
but real.

367
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:46.423
<v 1>Okay.</v>

368
00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:51.650
<v 0>To put ourselves in the mindset of eight 29,
of course,
we have to admit that,</v>

369
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.500
you know,
you may not feel that,
uh,
I'm not,

370
00:25:54.501 --> 00:25:56.870
I'm not urging this upon you as a worldview.

371
00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.910
You may think that there is no such thing as a spirit,

372
00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:03.500
or you may think that the spiritual is as mortal as the material,

373
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.860
but I think 29 people would agree.
Yeah.
Okay.

374
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:10.040
The spiritual is superior to the material because it's a mortal in the material

375
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:11.300
withers and dies.

376
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:16.070
But does that mean that the spiritual has got to rule the material?

377
00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:21.530
That's the question for the ages,
at least for the medieval ages.

378
00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:25.511
So Louis,

379
00:26:25.511 --> 00:26:30.511
the pious and his sons in eight 17 Lewis issues an order map number B,

380
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:40.780
to
divvy up the realm and the event of his death.

381
00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:46.530
Uh,
order called the [inaudible] Perry,
the ordering of the empire.

382
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:53.900
This unlike Charlemagne's division really expresses an idea of imperial rule.

383
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:59.250
Louis associates with himself,
his eldest son,

384
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:04.310
low Thar and look at how big their territory is.

385
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:06.600
First of all,
it's huge.

386
00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:11.810
It encompasses the Carolingian ancestral lands and basically the other sons,

387
00:27:12.181 --> 00:27:16.590
Louis,
the German Bernard and Pippin are given,

388
00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:21.570
uh,
a bunch of,
um,
uh,
a bunch of,
uh,

389
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:26.610
you know,
sort of adjunct lambs.
And in fact,
I'm sorry,
I said that,

390
00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:30.290
uh,
Bernard is not his son as his nephew.
Uh,
and,

391
00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:34.320
and this is what Bernard rebels and counts the rebellion that will cause his

392
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.670
blinding and death.

393
00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:40.890
Is this what he regarded as a few crumbs from the table rather than a full
share?

394
00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:44.280
The real problem begins,
uh,
however,

395
00:27:44.281 --> 00:27:47.460
even after our ta in a 25 when Lewis,

396
00:27:47.461 --> 00:27:51.300
his second wife gave birth to a son named Charles,

397
00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:55.950
thus complicating the succession,
his second wife Judith,

398
00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.850
urged him to fit Charles into the succession.

399
00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:04.290
And this enraged the older sons from his first marriage.

400
00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:10.400
<v 1>In</v>

401
00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:14.590
<v 0>29 a council met at Paris and while Charles was given a share,</v>

402
00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:18.610
the bishops of the realm also claimed the right to judge the king by his

403
00:28:18.611 --> 00:28:19.510
performance.

404
00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:25.400
In eight 31 eight rebellion,

405
00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:30.410
a second or third rebellion broke out the sons of Louis the pious,

406
00:28:30.861 --> 00:28:33.440
although fighting against each other,
allied,

407
00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.660
but church regarded Lewis now is hopelessly ineffectual,

408
00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:39.800
incapable of bringing order to the realm.

409
00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.910
And Louis was captured by his sons,

410
00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.440
forced to abdicate.

411
00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:48.043
<v 1>Okay.</v>

412
00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:52.490
<v 0>Both by the church and by a low Thor and Louis,</v>

413
00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:57.290
his older sons.
Luther was so arrogant,

414
00:28:57.291 --> 00:29:01.230
however,
that by eight 34 Lewis had been restored.
Uh,

415
00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:04.810
um,
I won't go into the,
uh,

416
00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:06.620
complexities of this.

417
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:10.520
Suffice it to say that the hapless or at least unlucky Louis,

418
00:29:10.521 --> 00:29:15.521
the pious when he died in eight 40 provoked another war of succession among his

419
00:29:17.211 --> 00:29:17.840
sons.

420
00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:22.640
Keep in mind that meanwhile the administration of the empire is dissolving and

421
00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:27.670
the Viking invasions are occupying ever more attention in effectual attention

422
00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:31.190
and plundering.
Yeah.
Even more.

423
00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:32.923
<v 1>Okay.</v>

424
00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:37.060
<v 0>After a series of battles and uh,
um,</v>

425
00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:42.390
campaigns in eight 43 a partition took place,

426
00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:47.890
but this one is really important.
This is the treaty of [inaudible] done V,
e,

427
00:29:47.891 --> 00:29:48.701
r,
d,
u,

428
00:29:48.701 --> 00:29:53.701
N and that's the third one on your map that I have bold or at least felt tipped

429
00:29:55.630 --> 00:30:00.040
lines showing the division.
And then on page two of the handout,

430
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.910
um,

431
00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:05.380
on the upper part is the division of very done.

432
00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:13.380
The treaty over done divided the empire among the three sons of Louis,

433
00:30:14.621 --> 00:30:17.080
the pious three surviving sons.

434
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:22.060
The western part went to Charles the bald.

435
00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:24.250
<v 1>Okay.</v>

436
00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:28.480
<v 0>And you see that in white,
new Straya Aquitaine Spanish mark.</v>

437
00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:30.123
Uh,

438
00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:36.280
it is what can start to be called France,

439
00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.980
the eastern part,

440
00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:43.200
which is the darkest Saxony eastern Australia,

441
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:48.300
Allah Marnia Bavaria went to Lewis's son Louis,

442
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:54.100
also named Louis Louis the German as he's known to historians.

443
00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:58.480
And he's known as Louis the German in part because his sphere of influence was

444
00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:02.260
the east,
which we can start to call Germany.

445
00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:08.970
The eldest son low thar got the middle part,

446
00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:14.930
which stretches from what's now the northern part of the Netherlands free.

447
00:31:14.931 --> 00:31:19.920
Zia.
All the way down to Rome and even a little south of Rome.

448
00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:20.873
Spoleto.

449
00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:24.523
<v 1>Okay.</v>

450
00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:29.540
<v 0>This is the most prestigious and in some ways,</v>

451
00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:32.060
richest part of the empire.

452
00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:36.410
It has ochin the imperial capitol,
and it has Rome,

453
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:40.160
the old imperial capital.
It has,
uh,

454
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:44.880
the lands of the Carolingian,
most of them in,
uh,

455
00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:49.850
uh,
the region of [inaudible] in the region of the low countries,

456
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:51.800
modern Belgium.

457
00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:55.870
Uh,

458
00:31:55.870 --> 00:32:00.680
what's the problem with this realm hour?

459
00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:04.470
What's the obvious military political problems,

460
00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.610
you know,
can see we're very hard to defend,

461
00:32:09.611 --> 00:32:11.140
be easy to cut off and invade.

462
00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:17.610
And if we say that the western part is France and we say that the eastern part

463
00:32:18.701 --> 00:32:23.440
is Germany using these terms anachronistically but not inaccurately.

464
00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:25.240
What is the middle part?

465
00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:31.890
The middle part is all that part of Europe that has been fought over all of

466
00:32:32.051 --> 00:32:36.970
world war one takes place in the,
uh,
on the western front.

467
00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:40.060
Most of it takes place in the northern part of the realm of love from

468
00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:46.920
the places where like Belgium,
which to this day is oh wow.

469
00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:51.740
Now is bitterly divided between frank speaking and Flemish speaking.

470
00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.350
In other words,
people who speak a Germanic language

471
00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:00.880
descended from some ancestral Germanic language and those who speak French

472
00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:05.750
descended from Latin.
That line runs right through Belgium.

473
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:08.923
Uh,

474
00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:14.200
and the same ambiguity pursues this whole realm of low Thor's down into

475
00:33:16.101 --> 00:33:20.960
Switzerland,
a modern polity,
what modern,
late medieval and modern,

476
00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:21.621
uh,

477
00:33:21.621 --> 00:33:26.621
where they speak four official languages and are so unsure about which is the

478
00:33:26.781 --> 00:33:31.340
official one that their stamps give the name of the country in Latin and their

479
00:33:31.341 --> 00:33:34.810
airline gives its name in English,
right?

480
00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:37.920
Their stamps call themselves.
Hell,
Vizient.

481
00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:44.380
There has not been an entity called that really in sort of real life terms since

482
00:33:44.781 --> 00:33:46.640
the Roman empire,
but that's uh,
you know,

483
00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:51.700
that's better than having all four languages on there that's more convenient.

484
00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:58.010
So there's a linguistic ambiguity,
there's a,

485
00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:58.993
um,

486
00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:03.950
cultural ambiguity and there's a political ambiguity because of course the realm

487
00:34:03.951 --> 00:34:06.710
of low thar didn't hold up very long.

488
00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:11.540
It's strategic flaw was very quickly manifested.

489
00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:15.260
It was divided but never permanently.

490
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:21.680
Part of this realm would be called what in French is called low rain,

491
00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:26.780
but in German it's called low training load.
[inaudible]
named after loath,
R,
l,
O,

492
00:34:26.781 --> 00:34:29.360
t,
h,
r,
I,
N,
g,
e m,

493
00:34:31.910 --> 00:34:33.290
Alsace and Lorraine.

494
00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:38.320
These two provinces are now France in 1870.

495
00:34:39.291 --> 00:34:42.800
They were taken by Germany after World War One.

496
00:34:42.801 --> 00:34:45.980
They were taken back by France under Hitler.

497
00:34:45.981 --> 00:34:50.340
They became a next to Germany after World War II.

498
00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.940
They're back with France.

499
00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:57.800
A substantial proportion of the population of Alsace still speaks German.

500
00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:02.720
And until about 70,
80 years ago,

501
00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:07.280
a fairly significant proportion of low rain did as well.

502
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:11.260
Same kind of ambiguity as to what,

503
00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:14.570
what are these territories?
And in our world,

504
00:35:14.571 --> 00:35:18.110
they either are neither France nor Germany,
hence Belgium,
Netherlands,

505
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:20.540
Switzerland or they've traded hands.

506
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:25.760
It is not exactly accurate to say that the political military history of Europe

507
00:35:25.761 --> 00:35:30.761
since eight 43 is simply the unwinding of the consequences of the treaty of very

508
00:35:30.951 --> 00:35:35.630
done.
Uh,
but it's not completely inaccurate to say that either.

509
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:41.280
That doesn't mean that,
you know,
events like the reformation,
uh,
or,
um,

510
00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:44.670
the second world war don't have significance well beyond that.

511
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:50.240
But just in terms of border shifting and maps of Europe,

512
00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:54.630
uh,
the legacy of Verdun is tremendous.

513
00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:59.660
If the legacy of Charlemagne is in some sense the creation of a cultural realm

514
00:36:00.661 --> 00:36:04.980
that can be referred to as Europe.
The legacy of the sons of Louis,

515
00:36:04.981 --> 00:36:09.390
the pious is the ambiguous division of that realm.

516
00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:15.720
What this really means then is that the,
in ninth century terms,

517
00:36:15.721 --> 00:36:18.900
since nobody said,
wow,
we're signing the treaty of are done,

518
00:36:18.901 --> 00:36:22.110
this is going to have consequences for centuries,

519
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:27.870
but immediate consequences were the decreasing relevance,

520
00:36:27.871 --> 00:36:31.020
the decreasing importance of the imperial title.

521
00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:37.610
When low third died and his eldest son died soon after low stars were almost

522
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:40.740
divided between Lewis and Charles,

523
00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.580
then Italy was left to a son of low Thor's called Louis.

524
00:36:44.581 --> 00:36:47.760
The second he took on the imperial title.

525
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:54.690
Uh,
but,
um,
under Charles,
the bald,

526
00:36:54.691 --> 00:36:58.770
the third and much youngest son of Louis the pious for a little while,

527
00:36:58.771 --> 00:37:01.480
the empire was reunited for a little while,
uh,

528
00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:06.530
meaning basically two years when Charles died in eight 77,

529
00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:14.490
um,
the empire would not be reestablished as unified,

530
00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.640
uh,
for almost a century.
And when it was,

531
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:21.820
it would really consist of basically,
um,

532
00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:25.830
an enlarged Germany and a portion of Italy,

533
00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.080
not France.

534
00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:36.300
And Charles,
although he bore between eight 75 and eight 77,

535
00:37:36.301 --> 00:37:40.520
the grand title of emperor and was unchallenged within his own family.
Uh,

536
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:44.760
his rulership was already severely undermined by,
uh,

537
00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:48.990
the intrigues of his nobles and the Vikings.

538
00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.313
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

539
00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:53.420
<v 0>By the time of his death,</v>

540
00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:58.580
many of the counties that had originally been administrative divisions of the

541
00:37:58.581 --> 00:38:02.570
empire had become almost independent.

542
00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:08.720
So for example,
Barcelona conquered by Louis,

543
00:38:08.721 --> 00:38:11.490
the pious was now ruled,
um,

544
00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:16.540
after eight 68 by a count who paid nominal allegiance to the ruler of the

545
00:38:19.551 --> 00:38:20.690
western kingdom,

546
00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:26.690
but who was the founder of a dynasty up to eight 68.
Therefore,

547
00:38:26.691 --> 00:38:31.691
you have counts of Barcelona who are appointed by the ruler after eight 68.

548
00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:34.750
The ruler has very little to do with it.

549
00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:40.530
It is a local ruler and the account is no longer an office holder,

550
00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:43.400
but a ruler in his own right.
Uh,

551
00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:46.210
similar with Aquitaine,

552
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.580
similar with Bavaria,

553
00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:54.060
similar with [inaudible] to lose Flanders.

554
00:38:57.170 --> 00:39:02.000
The reason that the counselor able to do this is the weakness of the central

555
00:39:02.001 --> 00:39:06.440
power,
not only because of the personality of the ruler,

556
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:10.490
but because of the inadequate nature of the administration.

557
00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:11.943
<v 1>Okay.</v>

558
00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:19.040
<v 0>When Charles died,
he was succeeded by,</v>

559
00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:23.450
um,
several rulers in the West Louis,

560
00:39:23.451 --> 00:39:26.540
the stammerer Louis the third,

561
00:39:26.541 --> 00:39:31.010
who has the good fortune of just being Louis the third,
uh,
and Carla man.

562
00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:36.560
Um,
in Germany the ruler was Charles the fat

563
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:43.120
and he was elected as emperor for again,
for years,
but was pretty,

564
00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:46.060
utterly ineffectual and not because he was fat,

565
00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:52.020
I hasten to add on the Middle Ages did not share,
uh,
uh,
or,

566
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:56.020
uh,
prejudices in this regard.
So Louis,

567
00:39:56.021 --> 00:40:00.010
the fat in the 12th century,
uh,
was a very effective cow.

568
00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:06.330
Fatter,
not Charles.
This particular Charles was not,
uh,

569
00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:12.160
was not,
uh,
an effective ruler.
All of these rulers,
as I said,

570
00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:15.820
suffered the depredations of the vikings.
But once again,

571
00:40:15.821 --> 00:40:20.821
I want to emphasize that the problems of this empire or the problems of the

572
00:40:20.921 --> 00:40:25.921
separate kingdoms or indeed the problems of some of the counties ruled by

573
00:40:26.111 --> 00:40:30.910
independent counts,
but affected by the Vikings.
And other invaders were internal.

574
00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:35.080
The Vikings were opportunistic Raiders,

575
00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:39.070
not the cause of the dissolution of authority.

576
00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:47.200
The dissolution of authority didn't mean that the Carolingian has come to an end

577
00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:49.510
because by this time in the late ninth century,

578
00:40:49.511 --> 00:40:53.140
they have some of the prestige that the mirror of engines had in there.

579
00:40:53.141 --> 00:40:57.610
A decline in their veins flowed the blood of Charlemagne.

580
00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:01.960
They were a sacred dynasty.

581
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:07.120
They had a certain kind of prestige.
So for example,

582
00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:12.180
they would be kings of France with some minor interruptions until 987

583
00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:20.850
in Germany.
The family ends in nine 11 and a new,

584
00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:26.010
uh,
series of dynasties not comes in,
uh,
into effect.

585
00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:32.090
In 1987 a new dynasty comes into rule of France called the Capetian Dynasty.

586
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:38.360
C A,
P,
e t,
I a,
N A,

587
00:41:38.361 --> 00:41:42.520
which technically runs out in,
um,
13,

588
00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:47.300
14,
but which is related to the French kings since.

589
00:41:47.301 --> 00:41:50.510
And indeed when Louis the 16th,

590
00:41:50.511 --> 00:41:53.090
was Ghia teen by the French Revolution,

591
00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:58.180
he was referred to in the court documents as Louis Copay.

592
00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:02.450
Then as they gave him a kind of artificial last name,
uh,

593
00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:06.590
and regarded him as descended from this ruler.
Hugh Kopay,

594
00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:10.480
CPE t that's a member of the Capetian CIP,

595
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:12.140
t I a n dynasty.

596
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:20.230
But the reality of France and even of Germany in the 10th century would be as a

597
00:42:23.511 --> 00:42:28.040
series of nearly independent principalities,
feuding,

598
00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:34.230
uh,
only nominally controlled by the king,

599
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:40.800
the ruler,
uh,
Huka pay who succeeded in nine 87 basically,

600
00:42:40.801 --> 00:42:43.890
he seems to have controlled the road between Paris and or layoff.

601
00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:46.040
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

602
00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:49.660
<v 0>But in places that are now public parks in Paris,
uh,</v>

603
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:52.600
like a van Song,
uh,
uh,

604
00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:57.290
there were castle's not loyal to the king at all.
So my little fantasy of,

605
00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:59.420
uh,
a fortified

606
00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.500
across campus is not so far fetched,

607
00:43:03.501 --> 00:43:07.760
at least not so far fetched in terms of what really happened in places like

608
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:11.840
Paris.
And indeed in a,
for example,
the,
uh,
uh,

609
00:43:11.841 --> 00:43:15.890
city of RL in southern France,
uh,
there's a wonderful,

610
00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:20.390
wonderfully preserved Roman stadium,
Roman sports arena,

611
00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:24.490
uh,
that,
um,
was fortified.

612
00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:25.360
<v 1>Okay.</v>

613
00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.790
<v 0>That is one family had,
you know,</v>

614
00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:32.820
the bleachers and a have fought against the people who had,

615
00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:36.610
uh,
you know,
the,
um,
the boxes behind home plate,

616
00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:39.400
not a classical term,
but,
uh,

617
00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:45.010
behind what might've been considered home plate in acronystic link.
Uh,

618
00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:49.510
and indeed there are towers built on top of this structure that we're then

619
00:43:49.511 --> 00:43:53.810
demolished because they were medieval and not classical.
Uh,
but,
uh,

620
00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:56.200
they made use of these materials.

621
00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:01.860
So we have a society in which the power of the ruler has literally dissolved,

622
00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:08.140
not dissolved into water,

623
00:44:08.141 --> 00:44:12.340
but certainly crumbled into much smaller components.

624
00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:18.060
Those components being essentially a castle or a few councils,

625
00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:23.710
the territory around it,
the right to exploit the peasants around it.

626
00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:30.930
Maybe you would have an effective regional ruler like the count of Barcelona or

627
00:44:31.171 --> 00:44:32.430
the count of Flanders

628
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:38.040
who would tie to himself.
These castle lands,

629
00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:42.170
the people who own or run the castles.

630
00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:46.290
But it is a society that has become fragmented.

631
00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:50.810
It's not a barbarian society.
These are not nomads.
Uh,

632
00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:55.170
they're violent.
But then again,
lots of societies run on violence.

633
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:59.850
It's a controlled kind of violence.
They want to squeeze the peasants,

634
00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.310
even occasionally,
perhaps plunder them.

635
00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:06.330
They didn't want to have them go away or exterminate them cause they don't have

636
00:45:06.331 --> 00:45:10.080
any wealth otherwise.
It is an exploitative society.

637
00:45:10.081 --> 00:45:15.081
But that again is not entirely new or entirely unknown and other historical

638
00:45:16.291 --> 00:45:21.240
periods and places.
What it does bring up,
however,

639
00:45:21.241 --> 00:45:25.020
and which I'll try to address in our last class once we've talked about the

640
00:45:25.021 --> 00:45:27.060
vikings,
is what's been accomplished.

641
00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:33.320
Here we are from 380 to the year 1000 and we're still talking about invasion and

642
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:38.160
we're still talking about polities falling apart because they're too large.

643
00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:43.700
We're still talking about the lack of administrative control over powerful

644
00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:46.440
individuals.
So a,

645
00:45:46.441 --> 00:45:50.580
I promise you that something was accomplished and I will try to describe that,

646
00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:52.320
uh,
um,
next time.

647
00:45:52.321 --> 00:45:56.520
But you're forgiven for thinking that perhaps we have wandered around and not

648
00:45:56.521 --> 00:46:01.020
come very far.
Very good Thanksgiving and I'll see you soon.
