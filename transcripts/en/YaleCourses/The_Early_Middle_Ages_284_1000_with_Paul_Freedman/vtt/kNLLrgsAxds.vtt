1
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.900
So today is an exciting day because the papers are due,

2
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.270
uh,
is,
uh,
the midterm is soon,
but most of all,

3
00:00:11.271 --> 00:00:15.770
because we're finishing up our talk on the mayor of engines,
uh,
questions,

4
00:00:15.771 --> 00:00:19.040
comments,
cat names.

5
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.210
So the Merovingians remember that the reason we're studying them as is as an

6
00:00:25.971 --> 00:00:30.971
example of barbarian king ship are burying states and the Post Roman world post

7
00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:37.880
Roman,
um,

8
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.850
meaning that the Roman Empire is gone,

9
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.720
but the society is not completely severed.

10
00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:50.000
It's connections with the Roman tradition are not severed.

11
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.310
This is most obvious in the church and the survival of Latin learning,

12
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.740
bishops,
Christianity Literacy.

13
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:05.280
<v 1>Okay.</v>

14
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.280
<v 0>But even though we seem to be in an environment of rather primitive,</v>

15
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.780
uh,
and even we could use the word loosely,

16
00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:18.480
barbarian kings,
uh,

17
00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:23.481
I hope that we'll see that within Gregory's narrative there is evidence of a

18
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:27.720
kind of royal administration and a certain sense of purpose.

19
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.290
We are entering a period in which we have to start asking what held society

20
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.883
together.

21
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.520
This becomes a question when two things start to fail.

22
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.790
One is the government where it's really not clear that there is a government

23
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.750
other than powerful people plundering less powerful people.

24
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.800
And the other factor is when the people themselves don't really believe that

25
00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:03.120
there is any force holding their society together.

26
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.790
Anything that they unconsciously give deference to.

27
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.830
So we're all familiar with what are called now,

28
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.860
failed states that his policies that have an official existence but that cannot

29
00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:25.131
seem to keep the most basic form of order within their borders,

30
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.250
whatever those borders may be.
So,
uh,

31
00:02:29.251 --> 00:02:34.251
unfortunate states like Somalia or no longer,

32
00:02:34.261 --> 00:02:36.750
but,
uh,
10 years ago,
Liberia,

33
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:40.320
Sierra Leone were examples of failed states.

34
00:02:40.321 --> 00:02:45.321
And this is a phenomenon that has grown in the contemporary world

35
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.900
in the Middle Ages.

36
00:02:51.901 --> 00:02:56.040
And here we're talking about the period from the collapse of Roman authority in

37
00:02:56.041 --> 00:03:00.220
the West and the fifth century until I'm at least the 12th century.

38
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.050
There are various kinds of societies that are held together.

39
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:09.730
They are not as anarchic as Somalia,
uh,

40
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.593
actually,

41
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.750
but they are not held together by government in the sense that we understand it.

42
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.560
They are held together partly by informal social networks and ties,

43
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:27.610
things like kinship,
family,

44
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.490
private vengeance,
religion.

45
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.710
But by having to ask the question what holds society together,

46
00:03:40.711 --> 00:03:45.711
you are already making a kind of statement about the sort of society you're

47
00:03:47.161 --> 00:03:50.790
talking about.
I would say that the United States has,

48
00:03:50.791 --> 00:03:55.791
for most of its history been a polity in which this kind of question didn't have

49
00:03:57.811 --> 00:03:58.830
to be asked.

50
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.640
It's not that people loved the government or even particularly deferred to it,

51
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.440
but that in their everyday life,

52
00:04:07.441 --> 00:04:10.950
in their everyday gestures and in their everyday assumptions,

53
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.470
they assumed that they were protected.

54
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.010
They normally did not have to go out with a weapon in order to feel that they

55
00:04:21.271 --> 00:04:22.980
would not be robbed.

56
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.350
There are exceptional communities in the,
uh,
uh,

57
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.840
where that's not been true.
But generally speaking,

58
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.580
you could assume that,
uh,

59
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.640
the police or the police forces intimidated,

60
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.740
uh,
criminals or potential evil doers.
You would,
you know,

61
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.290
send your bills in by mail,

62
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.500
assuming that they would arrive at a government agency,

63
00:04:49.501 --> 00:04:52.530
would take care of the transport of them.

64
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.820
You might try not to pay as much taxes as you perhaps owed,

65
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.980
but you wouldn't really try to just be under the radar of the government because

66
00:05:01.981 --> 00:05:04.950
you would assume that you couldn't do that through would have to make some kind

67
00:05:04.951 --> 00:05:08.670
of tax payment and on and on.

68
00:05:08.671 --> 00:05:13.140
Educating your children of signing up for social security,

69
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.580
um,
you know,
being part of a community,

70
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.610
the mark of privilege then historically is not having to think about the ties

71
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.190
that holds our society together.

72
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.490
If you had to come up with a standard with which to measure human happiness,

73
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.560
that might not be such a bad one.

74
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.880
Now there are other forms of human happiness,
Total Independence.

75
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.620
The idea of,
you know,

76
00:05:40.621 --> 00:05:45.621
the person who lives out somewhere on a farm and is completely self sufficient,

77
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.730
has all of the food that they need,
either that they catch or cultivate,

78
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.560
uh,
lives in some kind of wonderful climate in which the food grows on trees.

79
00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.950
Dreams of authors of the 19th century in Europe and America,

80
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:04.280
about the South Sea Islanders.
Uh,

81
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:09.281
so we have in our imagination the idea of living a blissful life without any

82
00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:15.710
particular social ties or only the most,
uh,
casual ones.

83
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.800
But I think we all know that usually,
um,

84
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.620
such

85
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.840
an existence when it in fact exists at all,

86
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.920
is an invitation for someone else to plunder it and to steal it.

87
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.070
Part of the reason for social ties,
his company,

88
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.070
part of the reason for social ties his protection.

89
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.570
So in asking what held barbarian societies together,

90
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.900
we're asking something that's more than just a banal question of medieval

91
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:49.910
sociology.

92
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.970
We're asking a question about the fundamental nature of a society that is,

93
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.040
um,
not so unsuccessful as people think.
You know,
again,

94
00:07:01.041 --> 00:07:06.041
nobody wakes up in five 60 ade saying how unfortunate it is that they're alive

95
00:07:07.611 --> 00:07:11.990
in the dark ages.
They didn't call it the dark ages.

96
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.700
They didn't think it was the dark ages.
Um,
and,
uh,

97
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:21.290
it wasn't the dark ages as I hope to show it and have Gregory of tours is a

98
00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:25.700
great source because he gives a lot of very miscellaneous information.

99
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:30.850
He's perhaps a a source who likes violence though he likes violence for reasons

100
00:07:32.211 --> 00:07:36.470
we were talking about last week.
He wants to show that on the one hand,

101
00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:41.471
the life of human beings is terrible and full of outrage and violence,

102
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:47.140
but that it is redeemed by God's solicitude and that those people who recognize

103
00:07:48.171 --> 00:07:52.490
God's power as manifested through bishops,
Saints,

104
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:57.560
the rites of the church will,
if not prosper,
always in this life,

105
00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.170
at least receive,
uh,

106
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.340
a reward that is commensurate with their loyalty to God.

107
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.140
Gregory is a pessimist.
One of the reasons,

108
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.750
one of the themes that guides this work.

109
00:08:11.751 --> 00:08:13.550
I was going to say one of the reasons he wrote this work,

110
00:08:13.551 --> 00:08:15.920
but I don't want to kind of venture that far out.

111
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.160
One of the aspects that unites this work is a sense of the decline of the Franks

112
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:27.850
from the model Clovis to the fools that he feels he has to deal with.

113
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:35.390
Like she'll Parak three generations,
the generation of Clovis,

114
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:39.290
the generation of Clovis,
his sons,
the generation of cloves,
his grandsons,

115
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.080
each one worse than the one before it.
So if he,

116
00:08:43.081 --> 00:08:47.900
it grudgingly acknowledged that the sons of Clovis fulfilled in some sense a

117
00:08:47.901 --> 00:08:50.180
mission in accord with God's plan,

118
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:56.190
he was much more clearly hostile to this third generation of Merovingian

119
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.263
leaders.

120
00:08:59.060 --> 00:08:59.893
<v 1>Okay.</v>

121
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:02.570
<v 0>He says at one point,
um,</v>

122
00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:07.730
in a part that is not in marine to this day,

123
00:09:07.731 --> 00:09:11.930
one is still amazed and astonished at the disasters which befell these people.

124
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.870
And I think I mentioned this little passage before,

125
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:20.030
we can only contrast how their forefathers used to behave and how they

126
00:09:20.031 --> 00:09:22.130
themselves are behaving today.

127
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:27.730
So he is scolding the current generation and exalting the older ways he is

128
00:09:31.161 --> 00:09:34.220
scolding them for their violence.

129
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.920
But what about the fact that as we emphasized Clovis was violent,

130
00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.650
what he's really scolding them for then is not violence as such,

131
00:09:47.651 --> 00:09:51.960
but violence channeled to unproductive ends.

132
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:56.140
Violence is inevitable in Gregory's world.

133
00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:02.920
Violence in defense of the true faith is not only acceptable but necessary in

134
00:10:05.751 --> 00:10:07.130
order to defend that.

135
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:12.320
And Gregory's interest as I hope I'll show in the true faith,

136
00:10:12.321 --> 00:10:15.680
is not just a defense of Christianity as a religion,

137
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:20.390
but Christianity as the thing that holds society together.

138
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.990
If you asked Gregory what holds society together,

139
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.310
he would give some kind of answer on the order of the bishops,

140
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.870
the saints,
the supernatural,

141
00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:38.180
the church.
And then if you said,
well,
what is the role of the king in this?

142
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:43.460
It's basically to terrorize people to make sure that,
um,

143
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:48.580
the mere threat of divine vengeance is backed up by threats of a more immediate

144
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.100
sort through out the history of the Franks,

145
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.310
although not excerpted so much.
In the addition we're using,

146
00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:03.610
there are examples of people who hold god Saint Martin or the Bishop or some

147
00:11:05.691 --> 00:11:10.070
other saint in contempt and who pay for it often with their lives.

148
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:16.330
So in Gregory's official presentation of events,

149
00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.410
any defiance of God is met with a thunderbolt,

150
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.550
but he's not actually a fool.

151
00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:30.610
I know in the dark moments of 2:00 AM reading Gregory that thought may have

152
00:11:31.521 --> 00:11:35.630
crossed your mind and,
and I know that you repressed it very quickly.

153
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:40.790
Um,
and uh,
it's evil of me even to raise it,

154
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:45.530
but lest you think that he's just a credulous guy who lived in the sixth century

155
00:11:45.531 --> 00:11:49.030
Aad and whatever.
He,
uh,

156
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.190
is perceptive and he understands that most people,

157
00:11:52.191 --> 00:11:57.191
most of the time of God not withstanding need something a little more immediate

158
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:02.270
to whip them into shape.
That is to follow,
uh,

159
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.760
a kind of basic civil order.
And that is supposed to be the ruler.

160
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:12.330
So it's fine for the ruler to be violent and it's even okay if some people get

161
00:12:13.031 --> 00:12:15.670
caught in the jaws of the state,

162
00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:20.671
if we can call it that or let's say the jaws of the king who should not have

163
00:12:21.821 --> 00:12:22.654
been punished.

164
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.430
But look at the people he's dealing with.

165
00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.560
He's dealing with people who are violent as well as kind of silly and a

166
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:39.330
quixotic.
He has this little conversation with,
um,

167
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:43.350
a chill Parak that,
you know,

168
00:12:43.351 --> 00:12:47.550
reminds one of pseudo learned people,

169
00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:52.580
a bloodthirsty dictators with pseudo learning on the order of the Moammar

170
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:53.820
Qadhafi.
You know,
people,
people who,

171
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.870
who sort of study some stuff and decide that they're experts on it because

172
00:12:57.871 --> 00:12:59.760
they're able to terrorize their population.

173
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.810
So I'm Jill Perry issued a circular,

174
00:13:03.811 --> 00:13:08.130
this is on page one 11,
a circular to the effect that the holy trinity was to,

175
00:13:08.131 --> 00:13:11.860
for not two distinct persons,
but only God,
um,

176
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:15.840
that it's unseemly for God to be called a person like a mortal flesh and blood.

177
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.390
He also declared that the father is the same as the son.

178
00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.420
The Holy Spirit is the same as the father and the son.
Well,
you know,

179
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:26.130
people have died and they certainly had written huge controversial works and had

180
00:13:26.131 --> 00:13:30.610
lots of councils over this issue.
This is not right.
Uh,

181
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.720
this nobody actually really believes this in Christianity.

182
00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.560
This is how it appeared to the profits and patriarchs.
He said,

183
00:13:37.561 --> 00:13:41.820
and this is how the law itself proclaimed him,
meaning Christ.

184
00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:44.400
And he then tells Gregory,
okay,

185
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.640
this is the law I want you and the other members of the church to believe.

186
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.780
And Gregory said,
give up this false belief.

187
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:56.370
You must observe the doctrines passed onto us by other teachers of the church

188
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.130
who followed in the footsteps of the apostles,

189
00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:01.800
the teaching furnished by Hillary,

190
00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:06.210
and use CBS and the confession you yourself made at baptism.

191
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:12.370
He's got to say this.
I mean,
he is very courageous to say this to the king,

192
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:16.960
but the king,
you know,
it is like somebody,
Oh,

193
00:14:16.961 --> 00:14:19.090
who is extremely powerful,

194
00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:23.190
denying very basic scientific facts.
Uh,
um,

195
00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:28.120
Stalin tried to impose the biological theories of Lysenko,

196
00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.270
uh,
which basically went against

197
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:38.170
the consensus of a evolutionary biology at the time.
Um,

198
00:14:38.171 --> 00:14:42.580
so this kind of pseudo learning is a feature of people who,

199
00:14:42.581 --> 00:14:44.500
since they being a claimed as geniuses,

200
00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:48.520
and as leaders assume that their expertise carries over into all sorts of
fields.

201
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:51.070
Well,
the king grows angry.
He says,

202
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.830
it's quite obvious that I regard Hillary in new Zb just as my bitterest

203
00:14:54.831 --> 00:14:57.020
opponents on this issue.
Uh,

204
00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:00.770
not only have Saints Hillary knew Zb has been dead for years,
but they're saints.

205
00:15:00.771 --> 00:15:04.490
They're theologians.
You know,
it would be like me saying,
well,

206
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:09.520
obviously a Charlemagne and Clovis are my enemies to a statement that is

207
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:14.750
ridiculous.
And,
um,
note Gregory's response.

208
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:19.400
It would suit you better to watch out that you do not make God or his saints

209
00:15:19.401 --> 00:15:20.234
angry.

210
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:25.460
And that could really serve as one of the themes of the entire work.
For,

211
00:15:25.461 --> 00:15:29.030
you'd fit,
know that the father,
son and Holy Spirit are all distinct in person.

212
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:34.210
And then he goes on to the theological,
um,
uh,

213
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:38.230
justification and then the kings responses.

214
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.430
I'm going to find some people smarter than you are.

215
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:45.770
And Gregory says such a person will not be smarter but an idiot.

216
00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:51.260
Anyone who wants to follow what you propose would be an idiot grinding his teeth

217
00:15:51.261 --> 00:15:56.180
at those response.
He said no more.
And then another,
uh,
uh,
visit,

218
00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:59.540
uh,
another bishop is consulted.
Uh,

219
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:03.380
so the king gives this up and then he starts writing a treatise on the alphabet

220
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:06.680
and,
and wants to add some letters and uh,

221
00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:11.780
tells the teachers that the educational system needs to be modified to include

222
00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.900
these letters.
Well,
I go into this degression to show you,
first of all,
uh,

223
00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.520
she'll perk actually is literate.
He is actually educated.

224
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:23.600
He's at least educated enough to have half baked ideas.
Uh,

225
00:16:23.601 --> 00:16:27.710
and that's more than some kings of this time and later we'll be,

226
00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:36.260
he tried writing poetry as well.
He also tried to depose Gregory as Bishop,

227
00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:41.150
which is in some later books.
Who are these people?

228
00:16:41.151 --> 00:16:43.280
Then what is the basis of their power?

229
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:51.310
The kingship is in large measure based on inherited status.

230
00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:58.540
The Mirror of Indian family had an aura of sacredness and prestige that made it

231
00:16:59.091 --> 00:17:04.091
impossible to conceive of anybody not have their bloodline ruling.

232
00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:08.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

233
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:13.400
<v 0>This power is partly the prestige of Clovis who is seen as really the father of</v>

234
00:17:15.691 --> 00:17:16.524
his people,

235
00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:22.400
bringing them into what would become France or the land land of the Franks and

236
00:17:23.491 --> 00:17:26.160
converting to Christianity.

237
00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.510
But a lot of the prestige is what might be called Pre-christian.

238
00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.250
The long hair.
The riding around in carts,

239
00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:40.440
four wheeled carts and we've seen with the long hair is quite crucial.

240
00:17:40.441 --> 00:17:43.230
Once it's cut in a humiliating manner,

241
00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:48.650
the representative of the family loses some crucial kind of prestige.

242
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.660
Remember that choice pretended to two Queen Clo Tilda,

243
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.060
the scissors or the sword.

244
00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:02.120
Do you want your grandchildren scalp tour?
You know,
at least to give an a,

245
00:18:02.121 --> 00:18:07.121
a military haircut or a maximum monastic haircut in this context or,

246
00:18:09.481 --> 00:18:10.380
or do you want them killed?

247
00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:13.290
And she's so angry at this that she in fact says killed.

248
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:18.710
That shows you at least the,
uh,
um,

249
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:22.020
humiliation that is involved in this haircutting.

250
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:28.310
These kings also practice something on the order of polygamy.

251
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:32.070
They are Christians,

252
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:37.160
but they are still tribal leaders in a society in which the possession of women

253
00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:43.170
in the plural is a sign of status.

254
00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:46.043
Um,

255
00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:53.130
one passage that describes a number of different things,

256
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:55.920
uh,
a fairly usefully,

257
00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:06.770
um,
is on page 58 and this is the marriage.
And again,

258
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.690
it seems random when you're reading through it,

259
00:19:08.691 --> 00:19:11.930
but then that's the point of the lectures is to highlight the seemingly random,

260
00:19:11.931 --> 00:19:15.440
isn't it?
On page 58,
she'll Perich's wives,

261
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:22.460
she'll Parak asks for Brunhilde this other visit,

262
00:19:22.461 --> 00:19:23.780
gothic queen,

263
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:29.230
kind of one of his brothers asks for the hand of her sister gals wins.

264
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:32.630
Although we already had several wives.

265
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:38.690
Okay.
So he promises the envoy,
he will put away the other wives,

266
00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.690
he will renounce them and he will be married.

267
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:45.770
Only two gals with.
And so with these assurances,

268
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:48.770
her father sent his daughter as he had sent the first,

269
00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:53.540
along with a great deal of wealth.
This is what's called a Dowery,

270
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:57.380
d.
O.
W.
R.
Y.
A payment made,
uh,

271
00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:01.010
by the bride's family to the ground.

272
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:04.340
When she came to king kill parrots.

273
00:20:04.341 --> 00:20:08.690
She was received with great honor and made his wife and for the time being his

274
00:20:08.691 --> 00:20:12.230
love for her was considerable force.
He had brought great treasure.

275
00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:17.430
Okay.
It's not a,
you know,
a,

276
00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:21.050
a we both like horseback riding kind of relationship,

277
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:22.970
although they probably did,

278
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:28.280
but because of his love for Fred Gund,

279
00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:33.800
who is another wife,
a low status wife,

280
00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:35.750
a wife who didn't bring him much money,

281
00:20:35.751 --> 00:20:40.751
but who was mesmerizing or beautiful or certainly had a hold over him because of

282
00:20:43.491 --> 00:20:45.950
his love for Fred or groomed whom he had before,

283
00:20:45.951 --> 00:20:50.890
a disgraceful arose to divide them gals with had already been converted to the

284
00:20:50.891 --> 00:20:53.770
Catholic creed.
That is,
she had been a physical effect.

285
00:20:53.771 --> 00:20:57.730
Princess raised as an area.
She's now been converted.

286
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.580
She complained to the king of the wrongs.

287
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:05.170
She constantly had to endure and said that he had no respect for her.

288
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.970
Finally,
she asked him to give her her freedom to return to her native land.

289
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.430
If she left the treasures that she had brought him,

290
00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:14.380
which seems like a reasonable deal,

291
00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:19.120
but he made a very sick skews as he mollified her with sweet words.

292
00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:23.500
And in the end he had her strangled by a slave and he himself found the corpse

293
00:21:23.501 --> 00:21:24.334
on the bed.

294
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:25.483
<v 1>Okay.</v>

295
00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:31.010
<v 0>Why didn't he just let her go?
Keeping the treasurer,
um,</v>

296
00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:35.330
humiliating.
Probably it's better to kill her.
Uh,
uh,

297
00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.150
why didn't he do what he said he did?

298
00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:44.300
He,
you know,
he's a barbarian roller.
After her death,

299
00:21:44.301 --> 00:21:46.400
God revealed a great sign of his power.

300
00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:52.190
A lamp burned before her tomb suspended by a cord without anyone touching it.

301
00:21:52.191 --> 00:21:54.830
The cord broke and the lamp fell to the pavement.

302
00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.960
The hard pavement gave way before it,

303
00:21:56.961 --> 00:22:01.250
and the lamp as if it had landed on some kind of soft substance was buried in

304
00:22:01.251 --> 00:22:04.730
the middle and not at all broken to those who saw it.

305
00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:09.620
This did not happen without a great miracle.
Well,
as miracles go in,

306
00:22:09.621 --> 00:22:13.250
Greg,
give tours.
This is pretty pedestrian freak accident.

307
00:22:13.251 --> 00:22:17.500
The lamp breaks a Po,
the exterior breaks,
but the,
the,
the,
the,

308
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:22.460
the actual lamp park does not,
but it is a sign in Gregory.

309
00:22:22.461 --> 00:22:25.700
And these things don't happen at random.
Uh,
in Gregory,

310
00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:30.890
the king wept over the body and then after a few days took Fred a gun back again

311
00:22:30.891 --> 00:22:33.350
as his wife when he did this,

312
00:22:33.351 --> 00:22:37.070
his brother's attributed gals killing to his orders and toppled him from power.

313
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:41.990
Uh,
the editor points out that probably they didn't actually,

314
00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:46.880
this is a little bit to pat and it may be a case of Gregory arranging the world

315
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.390
so that the evil get punished,
uh,

316
00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:52.730
in ways that they ought to rather than in the ways that they do or don't.

317
00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:56.000
But nevertheless,

318
00:22:56.030 --> 00:23:00.890
the portrait is of a,

319
00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:02.900
um,
polygamous king,

320
00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.500
a king who,
uh,

321
00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:11.530
accumulates treasure a king who is unscrupulous enough to kill his wife,

322
00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.590
uh,
does not seem to hide.
It very much

323
00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:25.600
is however,
um,

324
00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:31.450
vengeance has taken on him both by supernatural powers and by natural forces.

325
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:37.840
So in talking about the basis of kingship,
we have blood

326
00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.200
and then war leadership.

327
00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:47.690
I have tried not to over emphasize the violence of this society,

328
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:51.500
but it is a society in which war leadership is the major,

329
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:56.510
one of two major criteria of political leadership.

330
00:23:56.511 --> 00:24:00.140
The other being spiritual leadership that we're going to talk about towards the

331
00:24:00.141 --> 00:24:01.400
end of the lecture,

332
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:07.930
the loyalty of the kings entourage was based on his ability to reward them with

333
00:24:10.761 --> 00:24:15.290
plunder
member.
That king cloth are,

334
00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.780
goes out to fight the Saxons,

335
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:23.240
but the Saxons actually,
uh,

336
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.530
give them a good deal and offered to give up a lot of their territory.

337
00:24:27.531 --> 00:24:30.530
And he says to his men,
I think this is a reasonable thing,

338
00:24:30.531 --> 00:24:33.920
the Saxons are pretty well armed there.
They're willing to negotiate with us.

339
00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:34.990
So on pages 50,

340
00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:40.010
51 but the men won't accept that they have income on this military expedition

341
00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:45.800
for political reasons.
They want plunder.
And so they force him.

342
00:24:45.801 --> 00:24:48.830
They threatened to kill him if he doesn't lead them into battle.

343
00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:55.540
So if in certain respects we're back to the situation of Clovis.

344
00:24:56.541 --> 00:24:59.270
On the one hand he seems very powerful.
On the other hand,

345
00:24:59.271 --> 00:25:04.271
he seems intimidated by his followers and this is a accurate picture of the

346
00:25:04.761 --> 00:25:06.470
position of rulership of this time,

347
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:11.450
the king has to reward his followers because they're not following him for

348
00:25:11.451 --> 00:25:15.260
reasons of abstract political loyalty.

349
00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:19.730
They're not Merovingian patriots.
They don't have a national anthem.

350
00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:24.110
I don't have a flag.
They have a pledge of allegiance,

351
00:25:24.111 --> 00:25:27.620
but it's a private pledge of allegiance of warrior two warrior.

352
00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:35.610
He has two ways of rewarding number,
plunder or land.

353
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:42.350
He can't pay them a salary because the economy does not produce revenue in quite

354
00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:48.600
this way.
It does,

355
00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:53.550
but it doesn't produce enough to reward soldiers in the way they want to be.

356
00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:54.510
Therefore,

357
00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:59.510
a successful leader is one who leads his troops in to victory in battle.

358
00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:04.740
If he doesn't expand his possessions,

359
00:26:04.741 --> 00:26:07.350
if he doesn't lead them successfully,

360
00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:12.840
he's going to have to start giving away lands that belonged to the king or to

361
00:26:12.841 --> 00:26:16.680
the state,
if we can call it that,
and once he starts doing that,

362
00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:21.780
he's going to start having a,
an erosion of his own revenue

363
00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:27.910
to the weakening of his dynasty and has power.

364
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:30.360
<v 1>Okay.</v>

365
00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:35.220
<v 0>For the time being in the world of Gregory of tour,
the kings are wealthy.
Um,</v>

366
00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:36.350
there is a,
a,

367
00:26:36.351 --> 00:26:41.020
a description of an extraordinary dowery sent with,

368
00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:41.560
uh,

369
00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:46.560
the princess name for beyond the Eh page assignment that Q,

370
00:26:47.511 --> 00:26:48.344
um,

371
00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.013
<v 1>uh,</v>

372
00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.910
<v 0>uh,
that you read.
And um,</v>

373
00:26:56.210 --> 00:27:00.630
um,
there was so much stuff that it took 50 wagons to carry the golden silver and

374
00:27:00.631 --> 00:27:04.110
other ornaments.
The Franks offered many gifts.

375
00:27:04.111 --> 00:27:08.100
I'm giving gold some silver,
many giving horses and most garments.

376
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:12.773
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

377
00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.010
<v 0>the mother of a,</v>

378
00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:19.080
the princess brought so much gold and silver and garments that when the king saw

379
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:23.270
he thought he was left with nothing.
Yeah.
Ha ha ha.
In fact,
uh,

380
00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:26.720
the quantities of gold,
silver,

381
00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:30.500
silks and other fine fabrics are quite impressive.

382
00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:35.210
He's kings are very wealthy and they're wealthy because of plunder.

383
00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:39.860
But also because of taxes.
If you read Gregory carefully,

384
00:27:39.861 --> 00:27:43.430
you will see that the kings are collecting taxes.

385
00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:49.340
In order to collect taxes,
you've got to have some sort of records.

386
00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:52.370
You've got to know where people are.

387
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:54.800
You've got to have a kind of register of property.

388
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:58.070
I'm distinguishing taxes from plunder.

389
00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:03.220
You can plunder your own people,
that is,
you can just ride around and,

390
00:28:03.221 --> 00:28:08.150
and take cattle that happened to be passing by or you know,

391
00:28:08.151 --> 00:28:12.800
burn people's farms or shake them down,
you know,

392
00:28:12.801 --> 00:28:17.801
a threatened to cut off their ears if they don't cough up a certain amount of

393
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:19.730
money and treasure.

394
00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:26.120
The problem with that is of course you start killing your own economy and even

395
00:28:26.121 --> 00:28:28.220
barbarian kings recognize that.

396
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:32.450
But they do then have a kind of um,

397
00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:36.470
uh,
administration.
And here again,

398
00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:41.510
we have an interesting interaction of what might be called the,
um,

399
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:44.780
the practical and the superstitious,

400
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:49.340
the death of children Erickson's by dysentery described on page one oh five,

401
00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:53.870
there's a serious epidemic.
The epidemic is of course,

402
00:28:53.871 --> 00:28:58.871
announced by portents whoever heard of an epidemic disease that wasn't proceeded

403
00:28:59.361 --> 00:29:03.020
by comments or eclipses or you know,

404
00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:07.790
a heavenly phenomenon
while the kings were quarreling.
Again,

405
00:29:07.791 --> 00:29:12.080
dysentery affected nearly all of Gaul high fever with vomiting,

406
00:29:12.081 --> 00:29:14.720
extreme pain in the kidneys,
headaches and neck pain,

407
00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.980
saffron colored or even green vomit.
Uh,

408
00:29:18.981 --> 00:29:22.430
some people thought it was a secret poison,
blah,
blah,
blah.

409
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:25.520
Um,
it affected children.

410
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:30.380
We lost children so sweet and dear to us when we sat on our laps or carried in

411
00:29:30.381 --> 00:29:32.450
our arms and north with such care.

412
00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:35.623
<v 1>MMM.</v>

413
00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:40.930
<v 0>Joe Parex younger son became sick.</v>

414
00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.950
They say when they saw that the end was near,
they baptized him.

415
00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.490
He was doing a little better when his older brother named [inaudible] Burke was

416
00:29:48.491 --> 00:29:49.990
stricken by the same disease.

417
00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:55.320
Now these are the children of Fredda gunned the lower status but extremely

418
00:29:56.411 --> 00:30:00.310
powerful concubine,
wife,
whatever you want to call her,

419
00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:02.800
and Fred again,

420
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:07.801
seeing that they were in danger of death became repentant and she says for a

421
00:30:08.591 --> 00:30:11.290
long time the divine goodness has endured,

422
00:30:11.291 --> 00:30:16.291
are evil doing often it has rebuked us with fevers and other afflictions and

423
00:30:17.501 --> 00:30:22.000
repentance did not follow.
Look,
now we are losing our sons.

424
00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.340
The tears of the poor,

425
00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:29.350
the laments of widows and the size of orphans are killing them.

426
00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:33.190
We are left without a reason for gathering up anything.

427
00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:36.030
We pile up riches and do not know for whom we gathered.

428
00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:41.330
Our treasury will be left without an owner full of plunder and curses where our

429
00:30:41.921 --> 00:30:46.690
store houses were.
Our store houses not already overflowing with wine,

430
00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:51.580
where our barn's not already full of grain were a treasury's not laden with

431
00:30:51.581 --> 00:30:54.790
gold,
silver,
precious stones,
necklaces,

432
00:30:54.791 --> 00:30:58.030
and the rest of the trappings of emperors.
Look,

433
00:30:58.031 --> 00:31:02.860
we are losing what we held to be even more beautiful.
Now please come.

434
00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:07.330
Let us burn all the unjust registers.
In other words,

435
00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:09.700
let's burn the tax registers.

436
00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:14.790
Let's burn the records we have of who owes what and let what was sufficient for

437
00:31:15.581 --> 00:31:18.250
your father can cloth our be sufficient for us.

438
00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:24.760
And then she ordered,
brought forward the registers that Marcus,

439
00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:28.000
we don't know who he is,
had delivered from her cities.

440
00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:32.980
She had them thrown in the fire and then turn to the king who's not eager to

441
00:31:32.981 --> 00:31:36.640
have his registers burned.
Uh,
but finally he does

442
00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:41.820
and they stopped the future assessments and the kids die anyway.

443
00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:50.600
After this,
she'll park,
was generous to cathedrals.
BASILICAS and the poor.

444
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:55.460
He's sort of learned his lesson,
but it's very interesting,

445
00:31:55.461 --> 00:32:00.461
this idea that what is killing their children is the vengeance of God.

446
00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.250
And that the poor,
the widows,
the orphans,

447
00:32:04.251 --> 00:32:09.251
the people that they have oppressed have a kind of power of vengeance by

448
00:32:09.501 --> 00:32:12.260
mobilizing this supernatural force.

449
00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:18.110
On the one hand,
this is a regular old story.
People when they have faced,

450
00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:22.610
are faced with difficult situations,
often pray,
uh,

451
00:32:22.611 --> 00:32:26.060
often promise,
make some sort of deal.
Get me out of this.

452
00:32:26.061 --> 00:32:30.730
Oh Lord and I will a never do it again.
Be uh,

453
00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:35.030
do something else.
Uh,
uh,
see I'll be really grateful.

454
00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:40.190
And,
uh,
sometimes it appears to work and sometimes it doesn't.

455
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:44.150
But it is a perfectly understandable,
uh,
emotion.

456
00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:50.050
But the belief that supernatural forces affect politics,

457
00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:55.490
the belief in the political leaders themselves,

458
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.620
the knowledge that they are evil.

459
00:32:58.840 --> 00:32:59.360
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

460
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:04.110
<v 0>And that God has at least for a while permitted this evil,
uh,</v>

461
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:08.330
is very,
very powerful and very,
very up,

462
00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:12.690
uppermost in the mind of even an uneducated,
uh,

463
00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:17.450
and as Gregory himself demonstrates normally thoroughly unscrupulous character

464
00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:22.430
like Fred a gun.
So what makes a good ruler?

465
00:33:22.431 --> 00:33:25.400
According to Gregory knock,

466
00:33:25.401 --> 00:33:30.401
peacefulness since he believes the job of the ruler is to inflict fear at the

467
00:33:30.831 --> 00:33:33.620
minimum and damage more likely.

468
00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:40.020
At one point he describes theater bird,
uh,
one of the suds of Clovis,

469
00:33:40.021 --> 00:33:41.700
one of the members of the second generation,

470
00:33:41.701 --> 00:33:46.060
the closest thing he has to a good ruler.
He says,
oh,
theater Burke.

471
00:33:46.061 --> 00:33:49.980
He rolled his kingdom justly respected his bishops,

472
00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:52.290
was liberal to the churches,

473
00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:57.810
will leave the wants of the poor and distributed many benefits with piety and

474
00:33:57.811 --> 00:33:58.644
goodwill.

475
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:06.880
So he is adjust ruler and an effective one.
But after that,

476
00:34:06.881 --> 00:34:11.630
all of his good qualities,
uh,

477
00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:16.830
amount to treating the church wow and treating the poor well when the church is

478
00:34:17.291 --> 00:34:18.850
supposed to represent.

479
00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:26.640
So in the remainder of the time we should consider what is the church,

480
00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.580
what do we mean by the church?
Any questions so far?

481
00:34:35.910 --> 00:34:40.080
The church in the society is represented by bishops and monasteries.

482
00:34:40.081 --> 00:34:42.600
We will be talking about monasteries next week.

483
00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:47.790
The difference is that bishops rule from cities,

484
00:34:47.791 --> 00:34:52.380
even if they are just little shell remanence of Roman cities,
nevertheless they,

485
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:54.510
they rule from a population center.

486
00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:58.440
They are involved with ordinary people,

487
00:34:58.441 --> 00:35:01.980
or at least their administrative apparatus deals with

488
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:08.510
regular life monasteries are more a retreat from regular life where monks,

489
00:35:09.991 --> 00:35:11.820
as you'll read in the rule of Saint Benedict,

490
00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:14.970
live in a kind of isolated community,

491
00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:17.280
renouncing the world.

492
00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:23.220
Now in actual practice,
there would be more similarities than differences,

493
00:35:23.221 --> 00:35:28.221
particularly as these monasteries were involved with the world quite a lot.

494
00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:31.950
But it is the bishops that represent

495
00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:38.610
to the extent that any aspect of society does it,
of the Roman order,

496
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:42.450
a continuation of the notion that,
um,

497
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:47.880
there is a kind of educated ruler of local society.

498
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.760
So the bishops are members of prominent families.

499
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000
They're often members of Roman prominent families.

500
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:57.540
Remember that Gregory was bishop of tour.

501
00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:03.240
The great relic of tour was the Cape of Saint Martin.

502
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:07.260
His family had been bishops of tour

503
00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.640
because they were locally prominent under the Roman empire and continued this

504
00:36:13.641 --> 00:36:18.170
prominence under the mayor of engines,
not necessarily peaceful or easily.

505
00:36:18.171 --> 00:36:22.660
As I said,
Kilpatrick had tried to have him deposed a,

506
00:36:22.661 --> 00:36:26.270
and you've seen the episode in which they don't get along very well,

507
00:36:26.271 --> 00:36:30.560
but nevertheless his family of what he calls senatorial rank,

508
00:36:30.561 --> 00:36:32.840
even though there's no senate anymore,
uh,

509
00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:35.900
we're locally quite a prominent,

510
00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:43.520
this relic that they guard is not the only reason for their power,

511
00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:49.120
but this ships as well as monks are associated with some kind of saint

512
00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:50.323
protector.

513
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:55.510
And the Saint protects churches that have relics of the saints.

514
00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:59.090
A relic could be a bone,

515
00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.660
like an arm or a jaw,

516
00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:07.170
or it could be a piece of clothing associated with the saint.

517
00:37:07.171 --> 00:37:08.330
And the case of Saint Martin.

518
00:37:08.331 --> 00:37:13.331
Saint Martin was a military figure who's the most famous act of piety was he was

519
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:19.580
stopped by a beggar while on horseback and he,
um,

520
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:24.790
he split his cloak with a sword and gave part of it too close to this,

521
00:37:24.981 --> 00:37:29.600
uh,
uh,
this beggar and this relic itself,

522
00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:32.690
the cloak or a capa,
uh,

523
00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.390
was held by the Church of Saint Martin of Tours.

524
00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:40.420
And indeed it is a thought that the word chapel comes from the word for cake.

525
00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:45.740
That sort of a sacred space within a church where in this era relex would have

526
00:37:47.421 --> 00:37:48.590
been kept.

527
00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:54.200
We'll talk a lot about relics and why they are powerful.
But for now,

528
00:37:54.201 --> 00:37:59.201
I do want to talk about the mobilization of sacred power because we don't have

529
00:38:00.591 --> 00:38:04.590
to ask the question,
you know,
well,
did it really work?
Did this really happen?
Uh,

530
00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:05.810
uh,
did,
uh,

531
00:38:05.811 --> 00:38:09.950
Saint Martin really revenge himself on people who plundered lands belonging to

532
00:38:09.951 --> 00:38:10.430
him?

533
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:15.230
The important thing is to realize that the conception of the saint is not merely

534
00:38:15.231 --> 00:38:19.670
that of a pious respect,
but of fear of a,

535
00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:23.840
a living presence.
Somebody who,

536
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:28.870
although dead is not dead in the normal understanding of the word dead,

537
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:35.470
the bishops and monks mobilize a kind of locus of sacred power.

538
00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:40.520
<v 1>Okay.</v>

539
00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:41.750
<v 0>Now,
uh,
again,</v>

540
00:38:41.751 --> 00:38:45.590
at 2:00 AM after you were done thinking that Gregory was a fool and may have

541
00:38:45.591 --> 00:38:50.591
occurred to you that the sounds a lot like polygamy does seems to multiply

542
00:38:52.341 --> 00:38:56.300
deities,
it seems to multiply the sites,

543
00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:01.360
the places where the sacred has an effect and shame on you for such a thought.

544
00:39:04.261 --> 00:39:05.700
How can this be polygamous?

545
00:39:05.701 --> 00:39:09.360
Just because there seemed to be a bunch of different people wielding sacred

546
00:39:09.361 --> 00:39:11.010
power.
Um,

547
00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.430
we don't have to deal with this.

548
00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:19.140
Certainly there seem to be a lot of people,

549
00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:24.200
most of them not alive wielding sacred power and it's a rather threatening kind

550
00:39:24.271 --> 00:39:25.150
of power at bat.

551
00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:30.670
The bishop is a religious later.

552
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:34.343
<v 1>Okay.</v>

553
00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:39.570
<v 0>Some of them are religious leaders in the sense of powerfully religious forces,</v>

554
00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:46.330
but most of them are more squires than preachers.

555
00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:50.860
That is,
they are landowners,
patrons,

556
00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:51.970
uh,

557
00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:56.970
more or less generous to the poor or to the people of the area that they rule.

558
00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:02.930
It's not a religion of deep introspection.

559
00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:07.130
We don't have a lot of mystical thinkers in the sixth century.

560
00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:13.090
We don't have a whole lot of ethical concern except for the notion of the poor

561
00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:20.050
as a collection of people with the certain rights to the ear of God.

562
00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:26.870
The poor does not mean exactly what it means now,
the marginal,

563
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:29.450
the people below some kind of income level,

564
00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:34.690
it means basically ordinary people without any particular unusual power in

565
00:40:36.351 --> 00:40:37.184
society.

566
00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:43.730
In certain respects.

567
00:40:43.731 --> 00:40:48.320
The church is an aspect of the power of the Kings in certain respects.

568
00:40:48.321 --> 00:40:49.670
It defies the Kings,

569
00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:54.970
Gregory himself and his work is full of other examples of bishops who stand up

570
00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:01.600
to the ruler and remodeled straight with the ruler that is scold the ruler.

571
00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:11.490
But they can't really do this by themselves.

572
00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:17.690
They have to mobilize at least the potentiality of a kind of power,

573
00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:19.140
uh,

574
00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:24.140
that goes beyond merely the prestige of their family or the prestige of their

575
00:41:24.511 --> 00:41:27.180
office.
So for example,
and again,

576
00:41:27.181 --> 00:41:31.500
this is something that's not in the Murray edition.
Uh,

577
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:35.030
an example of the power of Saint Martin.

578
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.000
This is at a monastery,

579
00:41:38.001 --> 00:41:43.001
the monastery of lot where some other relics of Saint Martin or kept a force of

580
00:41:43.461 --> 00:41:46.580
hostile troops approached and prepared to cross the river,

581
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:51.410
which runs by so that they might loot the monastery of lat,

582
00:41:51.411 --> 00:41:55.700
Lat tea latte.
But I think it's pronounced lot.

583
00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:00.420
This is the monastery of Saint Martin cried the monks.

584
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:03.330
You Frank's must not cross over here.

585
00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:08.130
Most of those who heard this were filled with the fear of God and so withdrew,

586
00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:12.000
uh,
oh.
Uh,
I just thought it was a regular old monastery,
sorry,

587
00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:15.780
20 of their number.
However,

588
00:42:15.781 --> 00:42:20.781
who did not fear God had no respect for the blesseds saint and they climbed into

589
00:42:20.791 --> 00:42:25.620
the boat and crossed the river and driven on by the devil himself.

590
00:42:25.621 --> 00:42:27.090
They slaughtered the monks,

591
00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:30.960
damage the monastery and stole his possessions.

592
00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:35.210
They made the,
you know,

593
00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:40.460
gold and silver chalices all of these properties that they had taken into

594
00:42:40.651 --> 00:42:44.940
bundles and piled on their boat.
Then they pushed off into the street.

595
00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:50.280
The Keel began to sway to and fro,
and they were carried round and round.

596
00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:55.560
They lost their oars,
which might've saved them.
They tried to push the,

597
00:42:55.561 --> 00:42:59.070
to reach the bank by pushing the butts of their spears into the bed of the
river,

598
00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.720
but the boat split apart.

599
00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:04.500
They were all pierced through by the points of their own Lance's.

600
00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:09.900
They were killed by their own javelins.
Only one of them remained unheard.

601
00:43:09.901 --> 00:43:12.600
A man would rebuked the others for what they were doing.

602
00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:16.350
If this anyone thinks this happened by chance,

603
00:43:16.351 --> 00:43:20.730
let them consider the fact that one innocent man was saved among so many who

604
00:43:20.731 --> 00:43:23.370
were doing evil after their death.

605
00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:26.910
The surviving monks retrieved the corpses from the bed of the river.

606
00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:30.780
They buried the dead bodies and replaced their own possessions in their

607
00:43:30.781 --> 00:43:32.310
monastery.
Okay.

608
00:43:32.311 --> 00:43:36.510
So this is what happens to people who plunder monasteries.

609
00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:37.680
On the one hand,

610
00:43:37.681 --> 00:43:41.760
the story is useful for the fact that they plunder monasteries anyway.

611
00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:43.600
<v 1>Okay?</v>

612
00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:47.860
<v 0>And without asking the question,
did their boat really sink?
Uh,</v>

613
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:53.190
we can see a notion of the violence of society being directed to illegitimate

614
00:43:55.811 --> 00:43:57.760
ends and then being punished by the church.

615
00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:04.330
In terms of the question that we have been asking,
what held society together,

616
00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:09.310
a lot of the answer has to be the church and its perceived mobilization of

617
00:44:09.311 --> 00:44:12.610
spiritual power.
It's not the only answer,

618
00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:16.000
but it is a,

619
00:44:16.001 --> 00:44:21.001
an important aspect of the cohesiveness of a,

620
00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:26.050
uh,
violent but not completely unstable society.

621
00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:29.200
Let me give you one more example.

622
00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:34.303
<v 1>MMM.</v>

623
00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:39.710
<v 0>Pelagius inherited the office of count in the region of Java.</v>

624
00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:41.410
J a.
V.
O.
L.
S.

625
00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:45.070
A quarrel ensued between him and Bishop Parthenia,

626
00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:49.820
this which this count,
uh,

627
00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:52.090
insults the bishop,
abuses him,

628
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:55.810
accuses him of all sorts of crimes and seize the property of the church,

629
00:44:55.811 --> 00:45:00.040
which is of course what he really wanted to do.
They both go to the king's court.

630
00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:04.050
Polonius accused the bishop of being weak and a feminine.

631
00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:09.280
Where are your darling boys cried?
He with whom you live in shame and debauchery.

632
00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:15.160
The vengeance of God soon brought an end to these attacks.
The following year.

633
00:45:15.161 --> 00:45:20.140
Polonius law says count ship,
uh,
and uh,

634
00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:24.070
became a,
a terrified that Kingston Schubert wanted him killed.

635
00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:28.540
Um,
and uh,
eventually he commits suicide.

636
00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:34.710
I find it hard to believe that this horrible deed could have been achieved

637
00:45:34.711 --> 00:45:35.880
without the help of the devil.

638
00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:39.750
For the first wound was enough to kill them unless the devil came to his

639
00:45:39.751 --> 00:45:42.720
assistance to give them strength to carry out his terrible plan through to the

640
00:45:42.721 --> 00:45:46.800
end,
he stabbed himself twice.
His mother rushed in beside herself with grief.

641
00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:51.330
Feldon,
Eh,
fainted in front of her son.
The whole family be wailed his fate.

642
00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:56.340
He was buried at the monastery of core,
known but not in Christian ground.

643
00:45:56.341 --> 00:45:59.760
And no mass was sung over him.
Moral of the story,

644
00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:02.610
and Gregory is great at telling you the moral of the story.

645
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:07.980
It is clear that this fate befell him only because he had wronged is bishop.

646
00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:11.850
Okay.
Message of the book.

647
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:16.110
Don't mess around with these bishops.

648
00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:22.070
This is a world in which spiritual power is effectively mobilized to a social

649
00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:29.070
cohesion.
Gregory dies and five 94.

650
00:46:29.071 --> 00:46:34.071
I just want to cast and I forward because we're going to pick this story up with

651
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:41.100
the successors to the Merovingian dynasty.
The Carolingian,

652
00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:46.080
Carolyn's Ian's retrospectively named for their most famous member,

653
00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:48.360
Charlemagne Corollas in Latin.

654
00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:54.470
The Mirror Vingean Carolingian transition is in the middle of the eighth

655
00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:59.280
century.
So this dynasty had another hundred 50 years or so,

656
00:46:59.630 --> 00:46:59.970
uh,

657
00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:04.970
after Gregory and they continued to be involved in civil war.

658
00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:07.110
Uh,

659
00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:12.110
eventually there was a terrible feud between our friend Fred [inaudible] wife of

660
00:47:13.921 --> 00:47:17.130
Chill Parak and Brun held,
uh,

661
00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:22.050
married to CGI bird burn.
Hilde was sister of the murdered gals wind,

662
00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:24.420
uh,
whom,
uh,
uh,

663
00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:27.480
Fredrick and had basically gotten murdered.

664
00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:33.170
<v 1>Okay.</v>

665
00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:38.000
<v 0>So Bryn hill tries to a venter murdered sister Souljah Burton makes war on
shelf.</v>

666
00:47:38.001 --> 00:47:38.834
Peric

667
00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:41.290
<v 1>yeah.</v>

668
00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:45.940
<v 0>Um,
Fred gun hires assassins to kill a bird.
Um,</v>

669
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:49.600
and,
and you've seen that to burn.
Hilde married the,

670
00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:54.660
a wayward son of chill Peric named Mira Vac a mirror.

671
00:47:55.441 --> 00:47:59.830
AVEC eventually commit suicide of brand.
Hilda eventually,

672
00:47:59.831 --> 00:48:04.030
after these guys passed from the scene rules,
um,

673
00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:08.620
and so just Frederick and she'll perk is assassinated.

674
00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:13.930
Fred a gun rules in the name of her son.
And so in fact,

675
00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:18.210
in the early seventh century,
in the late sixth century,
the,
the,

676
00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:22.870
the rulers are,
um,
these two powerful and feuding women,

677
00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:28.480
uh,
in six 13 cloth are the second son of Fred are good and she'll perk,

678
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:32.860
captured the agent,
Green Queen Burn held and um,

679
00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:35.320
had her torn apart by wild horses.

680
00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:38.130
<v 1>What</v>

681
00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:43.130
<v 0>is happening here behind the unedifying drama of violence and feud within a</v>

682
00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:49.280
dysfunctional family?
Dysfunctional.

683
00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:54.350
A word unknown in Merovingian Frankish I'm pretty convinced is that certain

684
00:48:56.431 --> 00:49:00.090
regions of the Frankish realm are identified.

685
00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:05.520
If you look on the last of the maps in the appendix to the Murray Edition,

686
00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:10.700
you'll see reference made to two regions that don't really correspond to today.

687
00:49:12.001 --> 00:49:13.500
One is our straws yet,

688
00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:19.980
which is a kind of land that encompasses the Rhine regions,

689
00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:24.780
Belgium,
a little bit of Holland,
northeastern France,

690
00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:29.880
and new street,
which is more the heart of France,
Paris,
the Sen.

691
00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:33.343
<v 1>Okay.</v>

692
00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:38.140
<v 0>These will become sort of two sub realms of the mirror,
Vingean,
Frankish kingdom,</v>

693
00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:44.050
and our people that we're going to be following towards the end of the course,

694
00:49:44.051 --> 00:49:49.051
the Carol engines will be associated with our Straw Zia.

695
00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:53.580
We turned to England for Wednesday.
If you,
um,

696
00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:56.590
still have your papers and want to give them to us,

697
00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:59.260
please do so and I'll see you on Wednesday.
