1
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.980
So last time we spoke about the collapse of the Roman empire and I didn't quite

2
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:13.170
definitively answered the question.
Uh,

3
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.890
external force,
internal collapse.
Uh,

4
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.380
there are other possible explanations that eminent historian and the barbarians

5
00:00:21.381 --> 00:00:25.500
says that the Roman Empire committed suicide by accident.

6
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.890
Uh,
that essentially it was just a political problem.

7
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:33.090
The wrong people became emperors,
some bad things happened and one day,

8
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.950
oh,
there it was,
it was gone.
Uh,
sure.
I buy that.

9
00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:39.690
I like longterm causes more.

10
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.340
But it is important to emphasize that a lot of this is contingency and not

11
00:00:44.341 --> 00:00:45.270
inevitability.

12
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.870
Historians generally tend to make things look as if they had to happen as if

13
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:58.400
there are sort of longterm things playing out inevitably.
Um,

14
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.710
and the longer or the farther away the historian is from the period that he or

15
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:07.080
she is studying,

16
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.640
the greater that tendency because the look back is longer.

17
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.080
So in talking about both the empire and the barbarians,

18
00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:20.760
I want to at least remind you that events could have gone other ways.

19
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.400
Uh,
there are lots of longterm tendencies,
but uh,

20
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:29.150
we're talking about a series of,

21
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.990
of factors that are both immediate and long term.

22
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.080
This is relevant to talking about the barbarians and who they are,

23
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.690
which is a more of a mystery than it might seem.

24
00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:50.400
Who they are as in what does it mean to say that someone is a physic off?

25
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.090
How much have I described what that means?

26
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.330
And despite the business about plunder,

27
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.690
that's not actually the only thing they were after.

28
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.980
As we have tried to emphasize they liked the Roman empire.
Uh,

29
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.010
they wanted to share in its advantages not to destroy it.

30
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.540
We've emphasized accommodation rather than conquest.

31
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.720
We've said that this is the end of a world,
not the end of the world.

32
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.010
It is the end of a certain civilization perhaps or maybe transformation of that

33
00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:35.310
civilization.
But it's not the end of civilization.

34
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.770
They're not invaders from outer space.

35
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.320
Where do they come from?
Who are they are,
who are they?

36
00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:45.870
What are these aspects of accommodation?

37
00:02:45.871 --> 00:02:50.871
That's partly what we want to talk about today in discussing the barbarian

38
00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:54.690
kingdoms after the collapse of Rome.

39
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.810
So for 76 to five 30,

40
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.650
what happens in five 30 is that the eastern Roman Empire embarks on a recon

41
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:08.620
quest of the west under the emperor Justinian.

42
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.010
And that will be the subject of our discussion a week from today.

43
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.410
Any questions in the meanwhile?

44
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.453
<v 1>Okay.</v>

45
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.000
<v 0>Notice that in the Burgundian code,
the authors of the code,</v>

46
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.310
the Burgundians called themselves barbarians,

47
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.330
they distinguished between barbarians and Romans.

48
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.363
Um,

49
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.480
even though they use the word it's deceptive to think of barbarians or tribes or

50
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:42.481
Germans as if these were absolute well defined terms that corresponded to an

51
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.750
absolute well defined set of realities.

52
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.500
What do we know about these people before they enter the empire?
Uh,

53
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.900
we know something from archeology,

54
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.930
but as they moved around,
as I said,
they're not nomadic.
They have settlements,

55
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:06.760
but they're not very urban settlements.
They have grave sites.

56
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.080
People who have grave sites with a lot of graves are not moving around a lot.

57
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.800
So that's one indication.
And the grave sites sometimes have stuffing,

58
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.950
uh,
things buried with them.
Uh,
and among other things,

59
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:24.400
they show that they had trade with the Roman Empire because they've got Roman

60
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:27.300
artifacts in them.
Well,
okay.
Uh,

61
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.700
but we actually don't find out that much about them.
Uh,

62
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.030
the main written source for pre,
uh,

63
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.960
invasion,
let's call them Germanic tribes delicately,

64
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.200
is Tacitus the Roman historian,

65
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.280
better known or best known for his very pessimistic annals of the history of the

66
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.023
Roman Empire,

67
00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.530
but also the author of a brief work called Germani.
Yeah.

68
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.470
About the German tribes

69
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.370
for Tacitus,
the Germans.

70
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.400
That is the people's living beyond the Rhine frontier are both childlike and

71
00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:17.510
Novo
there,
like

72
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.600
from the Roman point of view,

73
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.290
these barbarians are intent on invading the empire and enjoying its riches.

74
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.280
Hence the defensive kinds of frontiers.

75
00:05:32.281 --> 00:05:36.600
We've talked about the Rhine or in Britain,
uh,
Hadrian's wall,

76
00:05:36.601 --> 00:05:39.990
which you can still see a in the north of England,

77
00:05:39.991 --> 00:05:44.550
not that far from the Scottish border that to guard,
not against Germans,

78
00:05:44.551 --> 00:05:47.430
but Celts picked and Scott's in particular

79
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.380
Tacitus portrays the Germans as kind of warlike

80
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.690
round the year 100 is his description,
but he never visited

81
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.210
Kermani.
Yeah.
And if you'd asked him,
well,
if you're going to write about them,

82
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.090
shouldn't you do some field work?

83
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.330
He'd have looked at you as if you were crazy.

84
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.730
Go the Air Mi ma.
Uh,

85
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:20.930
you gotta be kidding.

86
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.650
The reason he wrote the work was probably not an anthropological description of

87
00:06:29.801 --> 00:06:32.710
the Germans,
but as a way of berating the Romans,

88
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.480
if you describe people who are virtuous but primitive,

89
00:06:37.481 --> 00:06:41.620
you can use that to castigate your own people.

90
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.600
Rousseau's noble savage where the American Indians are used to attack supposedly

91
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.980
civilized societies is an example.
Or,

92
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.820
um,
descriptions of the south seas.

93
00:06:57.821 --> 00:07:02.821
Some of Herman Melville's earlier works or Robert Louis Stevenson or Gauguin's

94
00:07:03.371 --> 00:07:08.020
paintings contrast a beautiful natural,

95
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:12.430
simple world,
far superior to the,

96
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.440
uh,
fatiguing rat race of what passes for civilization.

97
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.120
So Tacitus,

98
00:07:19.121 --> 00:07:24.121
as Germans are warlike concerned with personal bravery and honor.

99
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.690
They have close family ties
there.

100
00:07:31.691 --> 00:07:36.120
Heterosexuals,
uh,

101
00:07:36.121 --> 00:07:37.950
they treat their women well.

102
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:42.300
All of these are supposed to contrast with what Tacitus,

103
00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:47.370
who's a bit of a scold.
Tacitus sees as Roman decadents.

104
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.490
The Romans are given to prostitution,

105
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.120
none of that in the German realms.

106
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.570
The Romans are given to same sex

107
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.800
love.
Oh No,
no.

108
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:06.480
The Germans know that that is really evil.
Uh,

109
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:11.390
they don't practice divorce according to Tacitus.
Now,
this is not,
you know,

110
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:16.430
this is a moralistic rather than an ethnographic treatise.

111
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.740
He does condemn them for certain vices.

112
00:08:19.741 --> 00:08:24.741
The vices typically ascribed to so called primitive peoples by the civilized.

113
00:08:24.901 --> 00:08:28.920
They're lazy,
they tend to get drunk,

114
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.460
they quarrel,
they gamble.

115
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:35.523
<v 1>Okay.</v>

116
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.040
<v 0>In several respects,
Tacitus,
however,</v>

117
00:08:39.041 --> 00:08:44.041
describes things that are true of later German practices,

118
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:48.160
visible in the Burgundian code,
for example,

119
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:53.580
and that he does not make up for any particular moralistic purpose.

120
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.640
Two of these things are the coma taught to us.

121
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.760
Mccomber Tartus is the important men surrounding the leader,

122
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.280
his entourage.

123
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.750
But his military entourage is armed men.

124
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.590
Not just bodyguards,
but members of a gang,

125
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.740
I guess would be the closest similar people who are loyal to their superior,

126
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.000
but who are,
have a certain amount of autonomy.

127
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.320
They're not just sort of paid.
Uh,
as I said,
body guards,

128
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:39.010
they are his
followers.

129
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:44.020
We can say an anachronistic word would be vassals anachronistic because it's not

130
00:09:45.661 --> 00:09:49.650
used at this time.
His military followers.

131
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.240
Armed military followers.

132
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:56.241
The Comma Tatas Tacitus describes the feud

133
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:03.740
feud between clans feuds are generally characteristic of society's without a

134
00:10:04.951 --> 00:10:09.951
strong central government and with fairly generous definitions of kinship.

135
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.050
Generous definition of kinship means you know who your second cousin is,

136
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.530
maybe your third cousin,
maybe your third cousin twice removed.

137
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.920
And that cousin is going to consider your interests to be his or her interests

138
00:10:25.951 --> 00:10:26.784
as well.

139
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:33.140
You might expect your children or parents to support you,

140
00:10:34.771 --> 00:10:39.771
but you probably don't expect your great uncles or cousins,

141
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.850
second cousins to do much for you.

142
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.880
So in terms of vengeance,

143
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:52.290
which is also a protection,
in other words,

144
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.650
I am protected by the fact that if somebody kills me,
uh,

145
00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:00.710
my clan will take vengeance on their clan in terms of protection and vengeance.

146
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:01.890
Uh,

147
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:06.890
extended kinship is related to a feud and to keeping order in a society that

148
00:11:09.481 --> 00:11:12.540
doesn't have a very powerful central government.

149
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:19.400
One way of avoiding feuds that kill too many people is compensation.

150
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:26.430
And this compensation is mentioned by Tacitus and is what appears in the

151
00:11:26.431 --> 00:11:29.490
Burgundian Code.
And elsewhere as very gelled,

152
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:34.640
very guild is the money paid in compensation for hurting or killing someone.

153
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:44.130
I kill your brother and we have a drunken brawl.
Uh,

154
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:48.630
I don't like the way he describes my mother.
Uh,
and I killed him.

155
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:53.380
I'm sorry,
but uh,
but um,
that's just the way things go.

156
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:57.430
What are you going to do about it?
Are you going to kill me?

157
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:03.840
Are you going to kill a cousin of mine or maybe you'll accept compensation based

158
00:12:06.521 --> 00:12:10.390
on say what kind of guy he was.
Was he a silver Smith,

159
00:12:10.391 --> 00:12:14.320
in which case I to have to pay a huge amount of money.
Uh,
um,

160
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.590
or was he just some guy,
some random god,

161
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:21.430
random Burgundian or free Burgundian or free,

162
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.450
formerly slave.
Uh,
all of these are terrorists.

163
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.450
They're sliding scales of compensation.

164
00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.050
Tacitus mentions this,

165
00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:40.160
so we're looking at the Burgundian code and there are other barbarian law codes

166
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.490
for clues as to how this society function.

167
00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:48.020
But of course it's a society that's already in the Roman Empire.

168
00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:54.650
It looks like before they entered the empire,
they lived in little villages.

169
00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:59.150
They cultivated grain,
but they were more cattle raisers.

170
00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.910
They're skilled at iron working.

171
00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:08.410
They also supplemented their income by a spot of rating and a warfare.

172
00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.630
A opportunistic warfare.

173
00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:14.960
Ties of kinship are very important.

174
00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:18.680
When we're talking about a clan and extended kinship group,

175
00:13:18.681 --> 00:13:20.660
we're talking about maybe 50 households.

176
00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:23.293
<v 1>Okay,</v>

177
00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.520
<v 0>and we'll see this again.
We'll see this with the better ones in the desert,</v>

178
00:13:27.521 --> 00:13:32.290
for example,
within the clan,
you're not supposed to feud,

179
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:34.810
not supposed to.

180
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:41.400
Above the clan level is some kind of confederation for tribe,

181
00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.840
and this is where things get kind of difficult because we don't really know how

182
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.840
one clan considered another clan to be part of something larger.

183
00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:58.390
That is,

184
00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:01.690
we know that the Romans called the people who defeated them at Adrian Opal,

185
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:06.400
the Visigoths,
oh my gosh,
here I am Adrian Notebook.

186
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.620
The Visigoths are winning.
What am I going to do?

187
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.830
But who are the Visigoths?

188
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:17.550
One theory is that they're just groups of people who come together in contact

189
00:14:18.431 --> 00:14:22.240
with the Roman empire,
in part because the Roman empire calls them something,

190
00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:23.800
gives them a name,

191
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:29.160
and they develop what's called fictive kinship from a common ancestor.

192
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:35.820
They invent the notion that they all come from one place and one ancestor.

193
00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:42.780
This process of sort of fictitious ethnic invention is called ethno.

194
00:14:44.891 --> 00:14:49.891
Genesis Ethno Genesis means the birth of an ethnicity

195
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:57.110
rather than some kind of biological fact that you could confirm with DNA.

196
00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:57.620
You know,

197
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:02.620
our Eg all Visigoths have some sort of biological thing in common.

198
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.540
These people are not really related,
but they invent a common ancestor.

199
00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:17.560
And this question of who forms a real group,

200
00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.060
uh,
remains,
uh,

201
00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:26.980
both important as a real thing.
For example,

202
00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:28.720
American Indian tribes,

203
00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:34.030
there are some who is claims to existence are indisputable.

204
00:15:34.031 --> 00:15:36.880
They have treaties with the United States,

205
00:15:36.881 --> 00:15:41.440
they've had reservations for many years,
but now with the,
um,

206
00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:46.030
inducements for tribes,
the tax free status,

207
00:15:46.031 --> 00:15:48.010
the ability to have casinos and things like that,

208
00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:52.210
there are petitions for tribes to be recognized as such.

209
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:54.910
And here the question of ethnicity,

210
00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.270
ethnic identification becomes extremely important.

211
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:04.710
A more sinister and much more widespread modern aspect of ethno genesis is

212
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:11.550
precisely the use of the Germanic barbarians as the origins of the Germans.

213
00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.520
It's no accident that,
uh,

214
00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:20.050
in the late 19th and early 20th century culminating but not limited to the

215
00:16:20.051 --> 00:16:25.030
Nazis,
the idea of the Germans as a racial group,

216
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:30.670
as a group with a common Arion with a y ancestry

217
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.690
as manly and as

218
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
pure in the sense that tacit does portrays them becomes a polemical idea,

219
00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:46.570
a fighting idea,

220
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.740
uninvented idea of great force.

221
00:16:50.741 --> 00:16:52.420
Just because something is false,

222
00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.200
it does not necessarily lack of historical importance.

223
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:04.160
So the idea of the f no genesis of the invention of a group called the
Visigoths,

224
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.840
uh,
is,
uh,
one way of approaching who they are.

225
00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.990
On the other hand,
there's not a whole lot of evidence that they're doing this.

226
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.920
There's not a whole lot of evidence that they are developing this notion of a

227
00:17:15.921 --> 00:17:20.720
common ancestor.
Much of the evidence or seeming evidence for that is Rome.

228
00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:27.280
A lot of this f no genesis comes from contact with the Romans.

229
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:34.630
Certainly people who come in contact with those who are more civilized than they

230
00:17:35.181 --> 00:17:39.890
are.
And by civilized,
I mean people's who have writing,

231
00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:44.870
who live in cities,
who have extensive trade and administration.

232
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.100
Uh,

233
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:50.910
the so called barbarian peoples are going to want to define themselves against

234
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.730
the Romans.
Hence among other things,

235
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:58.320
many of these invaders are Arion with an eye.

236
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:04.280
They use religious difference as part of their identity.

237
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.923
<v 1>So</v>

238
00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:17.650
<v 0>they have come into the empire and as we said last time,</v>

239
00:18:17.651 --> 00:18:22.240
they come into the empire first as allied troops,
as refugees,

240
00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.760
as Federal Rati Fed Herati.

241
00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:28.480
That is to say a armies of the Roman empire.

242
00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:34.770
They are supported by a system with the bland name of hospitality,

243
00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:38.140
hospitality,

244
00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:43.480
meaning that they're settled on the land of Roman,
uh,

245
00:18:43.481 --> 00:18:47.890
of Romans.
And they share in the revenue of that land.

246
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:50.360
<v 1>Okay?</v>

247
00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.510
<v 0>That's how the Romans pave them.
They don't pay them cash,</v>

248
00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.310
they don't pay them and plunder,

249
00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:59.310
they paid them in a portion of the tax revenue.

250
00:18:59.311 --> 00:19:04.310
So you owe a reasonably powerful but not quite powerful enough.

251
00:19:04.311 --> 00:19:06.200
Senator in Burgundy,

252
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:12.490
you settle some friendly Burgundian troops on your land and you give them

253
00:19:16.041 --> 00:19:16.970
hospitality.

254
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
That is to say in one third of the tax revenue that you're collecting for the

255
00:19:22.101 --> 00:19:27.101
empire or maybe one third of just your regular old private revenues.

256
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:33.140
This is a kind of accommodation.
Then it hits a commendation that costs money,

257
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:40.090
but it is part of a set of ways that the Roman elite figures out how to deal

258
00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:46.040
with these
invaders,

259
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:48.830
collaborate with them.

260
00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:53.920
So the Roman aristocratic land owners and the barbarian war leaders come to

261
00:19:54.051 --> 00:19:55.820
various kinds of accommodation.

262
00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:00.470
Now the accommodation differs depending on where we're speaking of.

263
00:20:00.471 --> 00:20:03.530
And now we come to the point of having to describe

264
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:09.440
the barbarian kingdoms.
I've given you two maps,

265
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:13.820
one of which are you're not to show people who are not in the class.

266
00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:16.370
This one,
the one with the arrows,

267
00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:21.910
a Yale University is home to one of the great historians of our time.

268
00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:23.600
Uh,
Walter Golfer.

269
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:27.320
And I can't believe that I'm talking about all sorts of people like Wickham and

270
00:20:27.321 --> 00:20:32.180
got offered in something that's going to be a widely available.

271
00:20:32.181 --> 00:20:36.920
But anyway,
let me express my admiration to him is one of the great,

272
00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:41.870
uh,
early medieval historians.
It could certainly run rings around me.

273
00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:45.080
Uh,
he's retired,
he taught at the University of Toronto.

274
00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:50.080
And among his many works is one that completely destroys the notion of having

275
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:55.010
invaders with arrows.
This whole idea of,
you know,
who,
like,

276
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:58.810
they've got this path,
we know where they are.
They come from somewhere,

277
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.620
a SIOP where,
what,
what is now southern Sweden.

278
00:21:02.621 --> 00:21:06.360
Scandia a lot of these histories or what purport to be histories,

279
00:21:06.361 --> 00:21:11.361
say they came from Scandia and you can still read in not very old textbooks.

280
00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:12.581
Oh,
uh,
you know,

281
00:21:12.581 --> 00:21:16.150
the Visigoths came from Scandia and then they went here and then they went there

282
00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:20.410
and they,
they're migrating all around and you have little arrows that show their

283
00:21:20.411 --> 00:21:22.930
progress.
You're not supposed to do that.
I,

284
00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:26.110
I'm not sure what you're supposed to do though,
as a substitute and had,

285
00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:28.780
there's always with historically misleading things,

286
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:33.030
once you get rid of the misleading thing,
uh,
you're kind of helpless.
Uh,

287
00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.870
if you're trying to teach this.

288
00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:39.070
So I'm asking you to look at this really closely and not take it seriously and

289
00:21:39.071 --> 00:21:42.910
asking you to memorize everywhere they went.
Uh,
but not to tell anybody.

290
00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.230
Once they enter the empire,
then those arrows start to make sense.
I mean,

291
00:21:47.231 --> 00:21:48.740
we know that the physical,

292
00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:53.410
we're in the Balkans at the time of the Battle of Adrian Oakland three 78,

293
00:21:53.411 --> 00:21:55.640
we know that they sacked Rome in four 10.

294
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:59.590
We know that they go down to Italy to try to get to the greeneries of North

295
00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:03.820
Africa.
We know that they discover Omg,
I can't build a boat.
So then they come up,

296
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:08.350
uh,
uh,
the other side of Italy,
uh,
they settle in southern France.

297
00:22:08.351 --> 00:22:11.290
They're kicked out of southern France by the Franks for the most part,

298
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:16.060
and they settle in Spain where the Arabs get them four weeks from now,

299
00:22:16.061 --> 00:22:16.894
I think.

300
00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:23.860
So the arrows are not completely deceptive,
and that's why,
uh,
I've,
uh,

301
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.960
I've given these to you and,
uh,

302
00:22:25.961 --> 00:22:29.180
it's hard to tell which arrows applied to which tribes.
Uh,

303
00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:33.910
so hence map tube
now too,
a lot calmer.

304
00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:39.610
This is the situation in five oh six y five.
Oh six.
Because in that year,

305
00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:44.760
the Franks whom we're going to be following a more closely the mirror Vingean,

306
00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.353
Frank's,

307
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:52.200
defeat the Visigoths and start pushing them out of southern France.

308
00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:56.170
So this is a map,
I guess before that defeat,

309
00:22:56.180 --> 00:23:01.180
you see the Visigoths in southern France and northeastern Spain with the Basques

310
00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:03.880
kind of in between them.

311
00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:10.330
So this is the situation in 500.

312
00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:16.070
There is no more Roman empire of the West or there is a fictitious Roman empire

313
00:23:16.071 --> 00:23:19.720
of the West.
All of these people to varying degrees,

314
00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:21.573
well not all of them,

315
00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:26.820
most of them acknowledge some kind of suzerainty of Constantinople.

316
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.650
You'll read about Clovis,

317
00:23:32.651 --> 00:23:37.651
king of the Franks in the beginning of the sixth century who gets some sort of

318
00:23:39.851 --> 00:23:43.420
gift from the emperor in Constantinople,

319
00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:49.460
a letter of appointment,
some robes,
various trinkets.

320
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.170
And uh,
according to Gregory of tour,
the historian of Clovis,

321
00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:55.670
the title of console,

322
00:23:56.390 --> 00:24:01.010
and he is very pleased with this.
He,
dawn's these robes.

323
00:24:01.011 --> 00:24:05.210
He scatters coins just like a newly appointed,
uh,
emperor.

324
00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:09.880
But is he obeying the emperor and a status to the Emperor Anna status?

325
00:24:09.881 --> 00:24:14.570
He has starts sending orders to him or have any kind of administration?
No,

326
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.090
this is really just symbolic,

327
00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:22.580
but we will talk about the relationship between the eastern empire and the

328
00:24:22.581 --> 00:24:27.500
barbarians because it's going to change in the sixth century as the eastern

329
00:24:27.501 --> 00:24:32.501
empire fends off its opponents and becomes more concerned to take back as much

330
00:24:32.601 --> 00:24:36.050
as possible of the last western empire

331
00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:41.980
in the year 500.

332
00:24:41.981 --> 00:24:46.480
The most impressive of these barbarians would have been the Ostrogoths because

333
00:24:46.481 --> 00:24:51.400
they are occupying Italy,
which is the most Roman,

334
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.910
the most prosperous,
the most intact,

335
00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:59.170
economically and culturally of the,

336
00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:05.480
uh,
uh,
of the former Roman empire of the West.

337
00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.070
The Ostrogoths had been in the,

338
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:14.020
if you look at the arrows,

339
00:25:14.021 --> 00:25:18.520
they had been maybe in the Crimean area around the Black Sea that came into the

340
00:25:18.521 --> 00:25:23.200
Balkans.
They tried to attack Constantinople in the,
uh,

341
00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:24.850
late fifth century

342
00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:32.520
and they were defeated and they were encouraged to move into Italy by the

343
00:25:33.401 --> 00:25:36.730
Byzantine emperor to get rid of Odoacer.

344
00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:42.450
That military leader who's takeover of Italy and 76 is conventionally understood

345
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.210
to be the end of the Roman Empire in the West.

346
00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:49.533
<v 1>Okay.</v>

347
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:53.500
<v 0>The Ostrogoths had an impressive ruler named Theodoric</v>

348
00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:01.900
and they ruled from Ravenna.

349
00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:07.890
The old last Roman capital in northeastern Italy,

350
00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:12.490
and the tomb of Theodoric can still be seen in Ravenna.

351
00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.650
Very impressive monument.

352
00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:22.330
Roman education survived in Italy.

353
00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:26.590
It would reach its last flowering with two figures.

354
00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:32.110
I mentioned one of them last time,
but we theose

355
00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:36.620
and Casio Doris.

356
00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:40.970
<v 1>Okay.</v>

357
00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:45.390
<v 0>These are two key figures in the of classical learning,</v>

358
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.560
but we theose

359
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.100
not perhaps literally the last person in the west who knew Greek,

360
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:59.240
but certainly the last person who tried to make Greek knowledge known two people

361
00:27:01.621 --> 00:27:03.270
who could only read in Latin.

362
00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:08.960
He conceived the project of translating all of Plato and Aristotle into Latin.

363
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.880
He started by doing a kind of introductory textbook,

364
00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:20.100
like a lot of great projects.
This one was not completed.
In fact,

365
00:27:20.101 --> 00:27:24.510
this one barely got off the ground because he was accused by Theodoric of

366
00:27:24.511 --> 00:27:29.160
conspiring with the Byzantine Empire,

367
00:27:29.161 --> 00:27:31.590
the eastern Roman Empire to overthrow him.

368
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:35.340
He was imprisoned for a year in prison.

369
00:27:35.341 --> 00:27:39.810
He wrote one of the most magnificent works of philosophy

370
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.353
of

371
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:48.990
why we are alive and why we die.
The consolation of philosophy

372
00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:56.630
and then he was executed.
Can't see your doors.

373
00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.760
Uh,
live to be nine days.

374
00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:04.790
So one of the differences between these two figures of the last gasp of Roman

375
00:28:05.011 --> 00:28:08.550
culture in Italy is Casio Dora says relative longevity,

376
00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:13.800
they're both figures of the sixth century who easiest dies in the five thirty's

377
00:28:13.801 --> 00:28:15.270
Casio doors much,
much later.

378
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:19.950
Casio Doris also conceives of a program of education,

379
00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:24.630
but it is more oriented towards Latin learning.

380
00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.680
And Casio doors in some way is the founder,

381
00:28:28.681 --> 00:28:32.640
or at least the transmitter to us of the idea of the liberal arts.

382
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.570
Casio doors is a religious figure,
but we,

383
00:28:36.571 --> 00:28:38.940
theist is a Christian and he wrote on Christian topics,

384
00:28:38.941 --> 00:28:40.620
but the constellation of philosophy,

385
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:45.710
interestingly enough is a stoical work as very little explicitly about

386
00:28:47.731 --> 00:28:50.340
Christianity.
Casio Doris on the other hand,

387
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:55.350
is the guy who invented the idea that monks should copy manuscripts,

388
00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:58.440
that the preserve of culture,

389
00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:04.070
the place where it seeks refuge and is protected in barbarian times should be

390
00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:06.620
monasteries.

391
00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:09.960
This seems so self evident to us because if there's one thing we know about

392
00:29:09.961 --> 00:29:11.790
monasteries,
it's,
you know,

393
00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:16.470
guys hunched over and writing stuff and the preservation of learning.

394
00:29:16.471 --> 00:29:20.340
But in fact,
monasteries start out as just,
um,
uh,

395
00:29:20.341 --> 00:29:24.940
anti intellectual institutions where you pray and you don't,
uh,
uh,

396
00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.570
spend a lot of time reading,
let alone copying,

397
00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:30.480
let alone thinking she's supposed to have visions.

398
00:29:30.481 --> 00:29:33.960
You're supposed to be inspired.
You're supposed to fast and you know,

399
00:29:33.961 --> 00:29:36.420
become ecstatic.
It's Kaseya,

400
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:41.430
Doris who conceives of this as a contemplative and learn it project

401
00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:49.250
the liberal arts means here things that are not immediately practically useful,

402
00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.490
but that help aluminate

403
00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.660
the person seeking after knowledge.

404
00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:02.100
And what kind of knowledge is a person seeking after in the sixth century,
a day

405
00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:07.770
they're seeking after knowledge of God and knowledge of the divine.

406
00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:11.040
Why not just read the Bible?

407
00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:17.240
I'm sure many of you have read the Bible or read parts of it.

408
00:30:17.241 --> 00:30:22.241
The Bible is not an immediately evident document in terms of its view of the

409
00:30:25.551 --> 00:30:29.720
world is total,
but it's full of mysteries.
It's full of obscurities.

410
00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.770
Um,
it's a strange work that requires knowledge.

411
00:30:33.771 --> 00:30:38.420
And explication or to celebrate divine services,

412
00:30:38.421 --> 00:30:42.920
for example,
requires a certain kind of knowledge to know when Easter is,

413
00:30:42.921 --> 00:30:46.100
to know the phases of the moon,
to know what day it is.

414
00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:51.790
I think these monks or just anybody out in the countryside can't just look at

415
00:30:52.431 --> 00:30:55.160
their phone and see what time it is.

416
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:59.720
There's a need for some practical knowledge,

417
00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.560
but that involves abstract concepts like the movements of the planets.

418
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:08.590
This is what the liberal arts are and this is what's being preserved in the

419
00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.010
Ostrogoths kingdom,

420
00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:15.110
but the fate of [inaudible] just shows you the sort of duality of the barbarian

421
00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:17.450
patronage of culture.
On the one hand,

422
00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:22.900
the Ostrogoths in Italy or as civilized as these groups get on the other hand,

423
00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:26.750
of course,
but with this is executed.
On the third hand,

424
00:31:26.751 --> 00:31:30.350
you didn't have to be a barbarian to execute people.
After all,

425
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:33.050
Seneca was forced to commit suicide by Nero.

426
00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:38.260
So the fate of intellectuals in the Roman Empire is not necessarily so much

427
00:31:38.991 --> 00:31:42.380
better than the fate of intellectuals in the barbarian kingdoms.

428
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:45.710
The thing about the intellectuals in the barbarian kingdoms is there,

429
00:31:45.711 --> 00:31:48.890
very few of them.
Seneca is great,
man.

430
00:31:48.891 --> 00:31:51.830
It's too bad that he died and we could've had more works.

431
00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:55.370
But there were lots of other philosophers.
There were lots of other playwrights.

432
00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:57.660
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

433
00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.370
<v 0>But we see us,
we can say,</v>

434
00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:04.350
but with this and Casio Doris maybe are the two smartest people in the sixth

435
00:32:04.351 --> 00:32:05.184
century.

436
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:07.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

437
00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:11.880
<v 0>Judging by what they had access to,
what they read,
how they wrote,</v>

438
00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:14.340
and that's scary,
right?

439
00:32:14.341 --> 00:32:18.360
If you can say that Isidore of Seville is the smartest man of the seventh

440
00:32:18.361 --> 00:32:20.880
century,
or bead an Alk,

441
00:32:20.881 --> 00:32:24.660
when are the smartest men of the eighth century?

442
00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.690
It's not just a compliment to them.

443
00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:33.380
It's a right,
you know,
some,
some,

444
00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:37.820
if you're rated like the 18th best tennis player in the United States,

445
00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:38.930
that's a tremendous,

446
00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:44.150
but presumably there are 200 tennis players who are ranked and behind them

447
00:32:44.151 --> 00:32:47.030
they're 10,000 very good tennis players.
Right?

448
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:51.230
But what if you were the number one tennis player in the country and there was

449
00:32:51.231 --> 00:32:55.400
no number four,
no number four through 100 million

450
00:32:57.110 --> 00:33:01.220
tennis would be an endangered game.
Uh,
it would mean a lot,

451
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:05.600
but supposing nobody followed tennis anymore.
Right?
I mean,

452
00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:09.330
perhaps,
I don't know.
I don't know enough about Ah,

453
00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:12.830
antiquated games,
but some medieval game,
you know,

454
00:33:12.831 --> 00:33:17.090
that only five people know how to play.
I could be the fourth ranked,

455
00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:25.040
but here we're not talking about,
you know,
sports important though.
They are,

456
00:33:25.041 --> 00:33:28.880
we're talking about the fundamental aspects of knowledge.

457
00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:32.300
Vrx the artwork is a great ruler,

458
00:33:32.301 --> 00:33:36.890
but he had a problem that is typical of many of these barbarian groups.

459
00:33:36.891 --> 00:33:39.500
He had to hold his minority together.

460
00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:45.230
The thing that made Italy the most,
uh,
and the wealthiest,

461
00:33:45.231 --> 00:33:46.100
the most important,

462
00:33:46.101 --> 00:33:49.940
the biggest prize for the barbarians is it's Roman population.

463
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:53.030
It's Roman wealth preservation of its cities.

464
00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:57.050
But that also meant that the Ostrogoths are a tiny proportion of the total

465
00:33:57.051 --> 00:33:59.750
population.
He needs to hold them together,

466
00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:03.920
but he also needs to mollify the Romans.

467
00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:08.283
<v 1>Okay.</v>

468
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:12.470
<v 0>So it's a dangerous place for barbarian rulers or to way sir had already been</v>

469
00:34:12.471 --> 00:34:13.304
overthrown.

470
00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:19.420
It's too valuable to the eastern empire and indeed apps after Theodoric died in

471
00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:24.740
five 35,
very shortly thereafter,
the Byzantine Empire,

472
00:34:24.741 --> 00:34:29.660
the eastern Roman Empire would invade Italy and devastated in the course of

473
00:34:29.661 --> 00:34:34.160
conquering it.
In a 20 years war.
Now,

474
00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:36.800
if you look at the map again and turn to North Africa,

475
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:42.190
you'll see we've got the vandals and what's now to means Ya and eastern Algeria

476
00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:48.340
and then Morris Kingdom and Roman empire.
Uh,

477
00:34:48.410 --> 00:34:52.590
ignore Roman Empire.
I don't know what they're talking about.
Uh,

478
00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:56.700
Morris Kingdoms.
Uh,
what does that mean?
Uh,
uh,

479
00:34:56.990 --> 00:35:01.670
we don't really know who these people are either.
They're not invaders.

480
00:35:01.671 --> 00:35:05.450
Their desert peoples who have now taken over what was formerly the Roman Empire

481
00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:07.070
and they're pressing the vandals.

482
00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:12.280
The vandals were less accommodating than V Ostrogoths.

483
00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.020
They,
um,

484
00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:21.790
were more fiercely Arion.

485
00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:24.683
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

486
00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:28.520
<v 0>they persecuted the elite of the Roman population,</v>

487
00:35:28.521 --> 00:35:33.280
including the Roman bishops.
What?

488
00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:36.290
They were very effective rulers.
They had a navy,

489
00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:40.860
they were able to plunder Rome several times in the fifth century.

490
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:46.193
<v 1>Okay.</v>

491
00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:50.710
<v 0>But they were beleaguered by these morrish groups.
In other words,</v>

492
00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:55.150
native peoples of the North African desert.
And so by five Oh six,

493
00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.830
there has shrunk.

494
00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:03.180
They were also a minority in what had been a very populous part of the Roman

495
00:36:03.181 --> 00:36:05.100
empire.
And

496
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:11.370
they tended to fight among each other.
They had internet seeing feuds.

497
00:36:11.371 --> 00:36:14.610
And so we're talking about things that are common to many of these barbarian

498
00:36:14.611 --> 00:36:19.290
kingdoms,
disorganization,
internal fighting,

499
00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:24.450
alien,
religious beliefs,
particularly area and heresy.

500
00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:31.180
And once they've done the plundering inability really to start making the

501
00:36:31.181 --> 00:36:32.540
economy work very effective,

502
00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:36.400
the vandals would be driven out of North Africa or,

503
00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:41.460
or obliterated actually by the eastern Roman Empire in the five,

504
00:36:41.951 --> 00:36:44.240
late five twenties,
early five 30.

505
00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:48.993
<v 1>Okay.</v>

506
00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:51.360
<v 0>Now,
I'm not going to go through every one of these,</v>

507
00:36:51.361 --> 00:36:54.630
but I want to give you some examples of accommodation.
Uh,

508
00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:59.190
go up to the British isles.
You'll see it says British kingdoms.

509
00:36:59.191 --> 00:37:03.870
That means Celtic Kingdoms.
Oh,
who's remanence would later be Wales,

510
00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:09.060
Scotland,
and then the Anglo Saxon Kingdoms.

511
00:37:09.061 --> 00:37:14.010
The Anglo Saxons are invaders who come from the continent beginning in the for

512
00:37:14.011 --> 00:37:18.060
four days.
This is the first place that Rome abandoned.

513
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:23.700
Here.
It looks more like a conventional invasion.

514
00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:28.440
The invaders come and the Romans pull back their troops because they're afraid,

515
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.290
uh,
that gall is going to fall next.

516
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:35.833
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

517
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:41.030
<v 0>And this is an island where the Roman impressed the Roman impact was less.</v>

518
00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:48.200
There isn't a large Roman majority and a small German minority.

519
00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:49.951
Uh,

520
00:37:49.951 --> 00:37:54.951
there is a Celtic majority that blends with the invaders or that seeks refuge in

521
00:37:58.141 --> 00:38:02.580
these independent British kingdoms as they're called on the map to the west.

522
00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:06.930
We don't know very much about what's going on in Britain at this time because

523
00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:12.600
more than vandal north Africa more than Austria,
Gothic Italy,
uh,

524
00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:16.290
the,
the past is obliterated.

525
00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:18.540
There's very little Latin being written.

526
00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:21.690
We have very little knowledge of what is going on.

527
00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:28.310
So this is at one extreme of what might be called a Barbara [inaudible] versus

528
00:38:29.341 --> 00:38:32.220
Rome Roman,
uh,
permanence.

529
00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:35.870
<v 1>Okay.</v>

530
00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:39.110
<v 0>We're going to be talking about the Franks later</v>

531
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:43.670
and we're going to talk a little bit about the Burgundians in closing today.

532
00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:48.050
But this leaves really among the important groups,
the Visigoths,

533
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.920
the Visigoths,

534
00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:53.540
the people who in a way started this with their invasions of the Balkans in the

535
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:57.360
late fourth century,
in five Oh six,

536
00:38:57.361 --> 00:38:58.940
they control much of France,

537
00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:02.810
the south and the West particularly and are trickling into Spain.

538
00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:07.040
We will be following in a reading Gregory of tour,

539
00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:11.180
the tremendous success of the,
um,

540
00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:15.710
Frank's against the Visigoths.
And so the Visigoths will be pushed out.

541
00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:18.920
What about the Burgundians?

542
00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:24.860
You've read the Burgundian Code,
anything strike you about him,

543
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.983
<v 1>Spencer?</v>

544
00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:41.490
Very status oriented.
Hair pulling.

545
00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:45.100
<v 0>Uh,
yeah.
Why?
What's that all about?</v>

546
00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:53.400
<v 1>Yeah.
Um,
uh,</v>

547
00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:56.860
working with,
talked about how long hair or we have working status.

548
00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:01.820
<v 0>Yes.
So the,
uh,
the question was what does that salt,
this hair pulling?</v>

549
00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.440
It's a status symbol.
Uh,

550
00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:08.480
we'll see that the mirror of engine kames wear long hair,

551
00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.010
specially long hair.

552
00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:15.260
And when they're finally deposed by the Carolingian,
that hair is cut.

553
00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:18.080
Now of course,
all their hair is cut.

554
00:40:18.081 --> 00:40:21.860
They're put in monasteries and monks are what's called Tan shirt.
You know,

555
00:40:21.861 --> 00:40:25.040
they have,
uh,
if they're not completely bald,

556
00:40:25.041 --> 00:40:26.870
they at least are pretty near.

557
00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:28.883
<v 1>Uh,</v>

558
00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:34.910
<v 0>like many barbarian,
so-called barbarian people or like many people,
period.</v>

559
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.060
There's certain signs of prestige symbols.

560
00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:47.250
The Burgundian code is drawn up between four 83 and five 32.

561
00:40:47.471 --> 00:40:50.410
It's drawn up in different stages.
The Burgundians,

562
00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:55.230
we're a closer to the Ostrogoths in degree of Roman [inaudible].

563
00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:59.920
There are a group that wants to be Roman or at least accepted by the Romans.

564
00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:03.070
They write their own law code in Latin,

565
00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:06.040
like the Visigoths for example.

566
00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:10.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

567
00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:14.620
<v 0>They also write a for of law code for the Roman population.</v>

568
00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:21.870
This law code is aware of disputes between Romans and Burgundians.

569
00:41:21.871 --> 00:41:23.700
And if each has a different kind of law,

570
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:28.910
then how do you settle a problem that arises between members of,

571
00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:31.350
uh,
both communities.

572
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:37.220
The Burgundian law in itself shows a lot of Roman influence,

573
00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:43.040
uh,
for example,
in,
uh,
um,

574
00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:48.940
chapter 18 you've seen this title of things that happened by chance and

575
00:41:49.341 --> 00:41:52.550
probably,
you know,
it didn't seem very,
uh,

576
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:57.790
dramatic if any animal by chance or any dog by bite causes death to a man.

577
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.660
We ordered that among Burgundians,
the ancient rule of blame be removed,

578
00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:06.290
hence forth.
This is an interesting question.

579
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:11.510
If my dog bites you and you die,
am I responsible?

580
00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:16.630
Is your brother going to have to kill me?

581
00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:20.860
That's what the Burgundian tradition would have been.

582
00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:24.160
But here they say if it's an accident,

583
00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:29.860
uh,
then I,
you can't,
you can't,
your brother can't kill me.

584
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:35.950
This is the difference between,
um,
uh,
I mean this is a,

585
00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.900
this is a tricky problem.
Those of you who,
uh,

586
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:41.800
have the good fortune to go to law school or going to study this first year

587
00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:46.720
right towards a tort is so called civil wrong as opposed to a crime.

588
00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:52.290
A crime is where I kill you cause I want to a tort is I leave a roller skate out

589
00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:58.000
in the side on the sidewalk,

590
00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:59.410
you trip and die.

591
00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:05.580
I'm not going to be considered in the same league as someone who poisoned you,

592
00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:14.050
but that rollerskates shouldn't be there.
Of course,
this is a crucial thing.

593
00:43:14.051 --> 00:43:18.280
For example,
I've learned,
fortunately not from experience,
but from neighbors,

594
00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:20.890
uh,
after hurricane Irene,

595
00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:24.850
that if a tree in my yard falls on your house,

596
00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.880
uh,
I'm not to blame.

597
00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:33.660
Your insurance is going to have to cover that.
I'm really sorry about that tree.

598
00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:35.430
But if you warned me,

599
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:38.850
I don't like the look of that tree in your yard.

600
00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:42.870
It's leaning over like this and I'm afraid in the next storm it's going to fall

601
00:43:42.871 --> 00:43:44.400
on your house and I don't do anything.

602
00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:48.360
Then my understanding is that I'm liable for negligence.

603
00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:53.880
This was a present and obvious nuisance.

604
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:58.110
It was an obvious threat and my neighbor called my attention to it and I didn't

605
00:43:58.111 --> 00:44:02.280
do anything.
So next time it storms and your,

606
00:44:02.281 --> 00:44:04.910
your house is threatened by somebody else's tree.
Uh,
you know,

607
00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:07.560
just as the wind starts to blow go next door and say,
you know,

608
00:44:07.561 --> 00:44:11.910
I don't like the look of that tree on your property.
You better do something.

609
00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:12.821
But this is the,

610
00:44:12.821 --> 00:44:16.260
these are real legal questions and they are handled in here with some

611
00:44:16.261 --> 00:44:20.940
sophistication.
On the other hand,
there is vengeance,

612
00:44:20.941 --> 00:44:23.490
right?
It's okay to practice vengeance.

613
00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:26.310
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

614
00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:29.460
<v 0>but there are some limitations.
For example,</v>

615
00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:32.790
if I kill you,

616
00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:37.290
your relatives can kill me,
but the can't just kill my cousin.

617
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:43.530
This is sort of individual directed and not clam directed venture.

618
00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:51.880
There is a lot of talk about compensation and Vera gelled a four victims,

619
00:44:52.451 --> 00:44:53.284
right?

620
00:44:56.180 --> 00:45:00.080
How much you pay,
whether you grab them by the hair,

621
00:45:00.081 --> 00:45:04.670
whether you cut off which finger,
whether they were free or slave,

622
00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:10.040
whether they,
you know,
were skilled,
artisan or a surf.

623
00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:13.280
I love a title 10

624
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:19.040
if anyone kills a slave barbarian by birth,
a trained house servant or messenger,

625
00:45:19.041 --> 00:45:23.630
let them come pound 60 soliday
but 200 soliday.

626
00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:25.610
If the slave is a skilled goldsmith,

627
00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:28.940
40 solidly for a carpenter and so forth.

628
00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:35.580
If you cut off someone's arm,
it's half of their very gout.

629
00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:38.880
Very guilt is like murder their murder value.

630
00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.750
So I have a murder value of a hundred solid cut off an arm.

631
00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:46.530
You've got to pay me 50 solid.
This seems pretty crude,
doesn't it?

632
00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:52.910
<v 1>How does it strike you?
Yes.
I mean,</v>

633
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:53.753
yeah,

634
00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:59.000
but I think it gives a solution cause like a total outbreak.

635
00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:05.180
<v 0>It,
it is a maintenance of peace.
And um,
oh,</v>

636
00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.430
what about victims compensation

637
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:14.300
in the western legal tradition?
If you injure me,

638
00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:20.070
it's a crime against the peace and the state punishes.

639
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:25.870
The perpetrator only relatively recently has this notions of victim's rights.

640
00:46:26.421 --> 00:46:30.580
Victim's compensation,
uh,

641
00:46:30.581 --> 00:46:31.500
have been entered,

642
00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:37.560
which is like a reversion back to the notion that the crime really injures not

643
00:46:37.561 --> 00:46:42.561
the state or the king or the piece that we all take for granted.

644
00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:46.320
Uh,
but the individual who was affected,

645
00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:52.440
but what makes it seem crude is the specificity of the offenses,

646
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:57.810
right?
If you look at the Connecticut
Criminal Code,

647
00:46:57.990 --> 00:47:00.690
it's not quite so precise about hair pulling.

648
00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:04.980
If anyone sees is a Freeman by the hair,
the fine is greater.

649
00:47:04.981 --> 00:47:08.000
If he seized with two hands,
then one

650
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:15.410
maybe that has to do with intent.
One hair.

651
00:47:15.411 --> 00:47:19.100
My one on one arm might be instinct I pulling your hair,

652
00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:24.160
but two hands argues of serious intent to do harm or it's more humiliating.

653
00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:32.620
This is a culture in which there's an awful lot of shame and compensation for

654
00:47:34.781 --> 00:47:35.890
public shaming.

655
00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:37.930
<v 1>Okay?</v>

656
00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:42.930
<v 0>A lot of a questions of personal status and title for about thefts.</v>

657
00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:46.270
If a slave commits a theft,

658
00:47:46.271 --> 00:47:50.680
he's either beaten or killed and of story Freeman.

659
00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:55.830
That is to say people who are not slaves pay fines and compensation.

660
00:47:58.720 --> 00:47:59.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

661
00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:00.850
<v 0>It's a violent society.
Of course,</v>

662
00:48:00.851 --> 00:48:05.230
all criminal codes show various forms of violence.
There's a lot of mutilation.

663
00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:07.120
There are a lot of assaults on women

664
00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.780
compensation for the assaults on free.

665
00:48:14.781 --> 00:48:17.300
Women are paid to the women themselves,

666
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:22.430
but in native Freeman who assaults a maid servant must play,
must pay.

667
00:48:22.431 --> 00:48:27.431
The master maid servant as a slave is regarded as a commodity.

668
00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:32.390
And then finally,

669
00:48:32.391 --> 00:48:36.230
it's a society in which at least according to the official law code,

670
00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:38.510
men are more valued than women,

671
00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:42.170
or men are less regulated than women.

672
00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:47.300
If a man breaks a marriage in title 34,

673
00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:51.830
he's fine.
If he goes and runs off with another woman,

674
00:48:51.831 --> 00:48:54.860
if a woman goes off and runs off with another man,

675
00:48:54.861 --> 00:48:56.450
she used to be smothered to death.

676
00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:03.450
On that enlightened note,
we'll leave the Burgundian code.
Uh,

677
00:49:03.451 --> 00:49:07.260
and indeed we're going to leave the barbarians only for a little while.

678
00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:11.760
Next week we're going to talk about the eastern Roman Empire and why it survived

679
00:49:11.761 --> 00:49:13.590
and even why a flourish.
