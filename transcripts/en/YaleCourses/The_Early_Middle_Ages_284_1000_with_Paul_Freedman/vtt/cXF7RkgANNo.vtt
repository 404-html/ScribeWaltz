1
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.480
Now we're going to talk about Islam.

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.020
And here we enter into a segment that in a sense is the most relevant if

3
00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:14.781
relevance as a criterion sort of is a to today's world because these

4
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:19.390
controversies that play out today,
uh,

5
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.460
she ism versus Sunni,
uh,
for example,
uh,

6
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.560
the nature of Islam,
it's appeal,
uh,

7
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.580
as a religion on a world scale are obviously established in the period that

8
00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:35.400
we're talking about.
They're established slow.

9
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:39.420
Like one of the things that you'll have noticed from the assignment is that the,

10
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:43.690
uh,
author Berkey emphasizes very much,
uh,

11
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.710
that Islam is slow information,

12
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.700
that it's not fully grown as this militant movement with a set of rules in,

13
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:56.430
you know,
six 32 the year that Mohammed dies.

14
00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.430
And because of that,

15
00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:04.431
then it's not to be understood as some militant conversion oriented jihad.

16
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:10.440
Oh centric religion from the start.

17
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.290
I said at one point when we were summarizing the end of the Roman Empire that

18
00:01:19.201 --> 00:01:22.440
there were three heirs to the Roman empire.

19
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.580
One was the church.
Uh,

20
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.460
ironic because of the,
of course the church had grown up,

21
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.080
persecuted by the empire.
The other was the Byzantine Empire,

22
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:36.600
the eastern Roman Empire,
uh,

23
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.760
remember that it called itself the simply but Roman empire.

24
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.180
So that's the most clear claim being staked to succession,

25
00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:52.020
to the Roman Empire.
And that the third was Islam.
And a couple of you said,
well,

26
00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:54.420
Islam,
that's,
that's the most surprising of all actually.

27
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:56.670
And I didn't really elaborate at that time.

28
00:01:56.671 --> 00:02:01.320
And that's not the center of what we're going to be talking about because time

29
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:03.360
moves on.
I remember in the seventh century,

30
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.340
the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West is a established,
um,

31
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.470
two and a half,
a two centuries earlier.
But,
uh,

32
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.120
uh,

33
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.210
Islam all though developed in Arabia outside of the Roman Empire.

34
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.350
And although very strong in places like Persia or the western part of India

35
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.970
would in many respects take up the inheritance of the Roman and Byzantine

36
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.130
Empires,
the,
uh,
conquests on the Mediterranean and the east.

37
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.240
And in the south,
it's architectural and artistic style.

38
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.660
It's administrative structure and not least the translation and elaborations of

39
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:53.940
Greeks,
science,
medicine,
uh,
and other,
uh,

40
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.840
academic,
uh,
forms,
including,
for example,

41
00:02:57.841 --> 00:03:02.530
the translation of Aristotle.
And the influence of Aristotle would be,

42
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.280
uh,

43
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.280
signs of evidence of the significance of Islam within,

44
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.983
you know,

45
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.190
it's pointless to debate whether it's the western tradition or what the western

46
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:19.480
tradition means,
but within the classical legacy,

47
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.290
within what it means to say that Rome as a polity,

48
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.690
a ceased to exist in the west and yet the classical world has continued to

49
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:33.610
influence,
uh,
um,
society and ideas to this day.

50
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.550
So in,
in talking about the history of Islam,

51
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.580
one is inevitably going to be emphasizing,

52
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.050
uh,
it's um,
revolutionary nature.

53
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.820
And so I'm going to go against the reading in some sense or the reading is

54
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:59.821
intended to go against the conventional way of presenting the early history of

55
00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:02.770
Islam.
And that can be sometimes annoying.
You know,
the,

56
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.150
the writer is a cautioning you against views you never had or the writer keeps

57
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:11.560
on saying,
well,
you know,
you,
we should not think that this,

58
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.660
and I hadn't thought that.
Just tell me what you think happened.
Uh,

59
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.540
in early Islam.
My apologies for that.

60
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.360
Writers are always writing against other writers.

61
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:25.570
The scholars are always riding against a prevailing interpretation.

62
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:30.400
Berkey is a continuous and that is the scholarly consensus now,
uh,

63
00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:35.401
arguing against this notion of Islam bursting forth like some kind of pent up,

64
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.590
uh,
um,
uh,
explosion in Arabia.

65
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.010
But Arabia is off the map.

66
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.040
Islam as a movement and certainly the Arab conquest are uh,

67
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.530
unpredictable events.

68
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.580
They may be understandable later in terms of developments in the Near East,

69
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.990
both religious and cultural,

70
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.260
but up until the seventh century,

71
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:13.261
Arabia was on the periphery of the two great controlling empires to its north,

72
00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:17.980
namely Persia and Rome.

73
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.200
And we are taking Byzantium as the air of Rome in this sense.

74
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.670
The problem with Arabia is that it is really dry and before the discovery of oil

75
00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:36.630
or more precisely the,

76
00:05:36.631 --> 00:05:40.240
before the discovery that of that oil was useful,

77
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.740
important and valuable,

78
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.070
it was a strikingly impoverished land in terms of natural resources,

79
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.600
a terrible land.
As Isaiah the Prophet says,

80
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.760
Isaiah 21,
one,

81
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.750
the burden of the desert of the sea as whirlwinds in the south pass through it.

82
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.560
So it cometh from the desert,
from a terrible land.
Now,

83
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.890
Isaiah actually grew up in what most of us,

84
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:10.880
we considered to be pretty dry circumstances.

85
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.290
The eastern Mediterranean Modern Day Israel,
Lebanon,

86
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:20.410
Syria are hot and dry compared to bounteous climbs like new haven.

87
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.513
Um,

88
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:27.050
<v 1>okay.</v>

89
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.600
<v 0>Uh,
so the eastern Mediterranean however,</v>

90
00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:34.601
is a land of fertile oases river valleys like the fame Tigris,

91
00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:38.760
Euphrates,
Fertile Crescent area,
uh,

92
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.960
coastal cities with commerce.
Uh,

93
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.570
<v 1>yeah.</v>

94
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:44.650
<v 0>Where's Arabia</v>

95
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:51.530
a is essentially a vast expanse of barely habitable terrain.

96
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.650
It is isolated by the sea on three sides.

97
00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.270
It has very few natural harbors.

98
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:01.813
<v 1>Okay.</v>

99
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.950
<v 0>There are no lakes,
no forests,</v>

100
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:12.200
no grasslands even and no rivers that run year round.

101
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.360
<v 1>Okay.</v>

102
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.360
<v 0>The only intrinsically favorable part of it is the south east,</v>

103
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.260
South West Corner,
a modern Yemen.

104
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:26.870
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

105
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.160
<v 0>This was in the ancient world,
or at least to the Roman Geographers Arabia,</v>

106
00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:35.030
Felix,
Happy Arabia,
Nice Arabia.

107
00:07:35.031 --> 00:07:40.031
And indeed there were two kingdoms that emerged here around 1000 BC harbors

108
00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:41.540
oases.

109
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.840
And these two kingdoms controlled the spice and incense trade from India and

110
00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:51.260
from the Horn of Africa.

111
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:57.280
These are two extremely valuable kinds of products for religious gastronomically

112
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.220
and medicinal purposes.
Um,

113
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:06.280
and most of the spices come from India and most of the incense comes from modern

114
00:08:07.611 --> 00:08:12.560
Somalia,
Ethiopia,
uh,
places,
uh,
along the Red Sea.

115
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:20.280
By the time of Mohammed,
however,
Southern Arabia,
his best days have passed.

116
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.470
And Mohammed is,
uh,
of course,
uh,
from,
uh,

117
00:08:25.471 --> 00:08:29.820
central and in the sense of it's orientation,
really northern Arabia,

118
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.970
the worst desert in Arabia is the south.

119
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:37.710
So just when you get out of Yamen going North East,
you come to a,

120
00:08:37.711 --> 00:08:42.150
an area that still bears the not really encouraging name,

121
00:08:42.151 --> 00:08:46.020
the Empty Quarter.
Uh,
this is really serious,

122
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.590
no oases desert further north.
However,

123
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.810
in places like Mecca or Medina,

124
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:57.020
there is enough water for a settlement though not enough for agriculture.

125
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.780
A key event in the history of Arabia is the domestication of the Cammo,

126
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.430
which can be situated around 1000 BC.

127
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:13.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

128
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:14.330
<v 0>Arabia,</v>

129
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:19.070
outside of the Yemenite kingdoms was mostly nomadic.

130
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.610
Though there were trading cities of which the most famous,

131
00:09:22.611 --> 00:09:24.680
our Mecca and Medina,

132
00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.500
these cities were rather cosmopolitan.

133
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.750
They had Arabs and other people's,
they had Christians,
some of whom were Arabs,

134
00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:41.800
some of whom were not,
and Jews,
many of whom were also Arabs.

135
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:50.030
They controlled overland trade again from further east bearing exotic products

136
00:09:53.191 --> 00:09:57.930
like spices from India,
organizing caravans.

137
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.473
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

138
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.410
<v 0>Uh,
times they would form kingdoms.</v>

139
00:10:03.411 --> 00:10:05.510
At times there would be Arab kingdoms in the north,

140
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.240
but generally these are feuding.

141
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.840
Society's organized along tribal lines,

142
00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.290
looked at from the Roman or Persian.
Empire.

143
00:10:17.291 --> 00:10:19.870
Arabia was a little bit like the forests of Germany,

144
00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:24.750
a hostile terrain from the Roman point of view,

145
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:28.810
person point of view,
inhabited by useful,

146
00:10:28.811 --> 00:10:32.980
but presumably barbarian and presumably not very interesting.

147
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:34.243
<v 1>Paintball,</v>

148
00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.140
<v 0>this is the point of view of the Bible as well.</v>

149
00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:45.090
They're primitive people bearing interesting products inhabiting a land that's

150
00:10:46.541 --> 00:10:51.490
not worth having,
not worth invading,
not worth owning,
not worth dealing with.

151
00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:57.690
The first mention of Arabs seems to be eight 54 BC when according to a Syrian

152
00:10:59.561 --> 00:11:02.710
inscription,
a certain,
uh,
Guindy Boob,

153
00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:07.240
the Arab contributed a thousand camels to forces revolting against these

154
00:11:07.241 --> 00:11:10.900
Syrians,
the Arabs,
hence forth.

155
00:11:10.901 --> 00:11:15.901
After eight 54 I mentioned often in Babylonian and Persian texts,

156
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:21.300
they're always frontiers men or people inhabiting a land beyond a frontier

157
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.490
questions so far,
okay.

158
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.580
Not all Arabs are nomads,

159
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.390
but the Bedouin Bedouin in this sense,

160
00:11:36.391 --> 00:11:40.080
meaning Arab nomad is sort of the or Arab,

161
00:11:40.081 --> 00:11:41.460
the original Arab,

162
00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:47.090
the defining archetype and the original colloquial meaning of the word Arab.

163
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:49.290
Uh,

164
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:53.320
in a way the better ones are a little like the Germanic tribes and analogy I'll

165
00:11:53.321 --> 00:11:55.270
mention,
but I don't want to push too hard.

166
00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:00.750
They form extended kinship units.

167
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:05.890
That is to say they know who their second cousins are and care about them.

168
00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:07.870
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

169
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.900
<v 0>And these extended kinship units form</v>

170
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:16.460
a kind of tribal structure.

171
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:18.953
<v 1>Okay.</v>

172
00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:23.960
<v 0>This notion of tribe remains important to this day.</v>

173
00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:28.790
You'll have seen in accounts of post Qaddafi,
Libya for example.

174
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:33.890
The cliche and probably accurate is there is no tradition of government.

175
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.950
Kadafi didn't govern.
He just um,

176
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:41.060
tyrannized and there are no civil institutions.

177
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:44.600
It is divided by tribal loyalties.

178
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:49.550
What does tribe mean in math?
I actually don't know.

179
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.230
In terms of Libya,

180
00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.310
it is a way of saying that people do not have loyalty to the state,

181
00:12:55.910 --> 00:13:00.910
but to some extended kinship group or what's sometimes called fictive kinship

182
00:13:03.411 --> 00:13:05.450
group.
I'm not really related to you,

183
00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:10.780
but we have either the same name or we're from the same place or we consider

184
00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:16.480
each other Ken and therefore have a certain protective sense about each other.

185
00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.410
This is very useful if you don't have a government.

186
00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.160
We've already spoken about this in terms of our question of what held

187
00:13:25.161 --> 00:13:27.440
Merovingian society together.

188
00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:32.240
Your second cousin becomes important to you if there's no police force,

189
00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:37.790
if there's no way of making sure that someone's not going to kill you just for

190
00:13:37.791 --> 00:13:39.380
fun or because they got angry at.

191
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:40.303
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

192
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:47.060
<v 0>under the circumstances we live in,
we don't care about our second cousins.</v>

193
00:13:47.061 --> 00:13:48.530
We don't know who they are.

194
00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:53.650
We don't expect anything from them in a society in which family is not just a

195
00:13:54.381 --> 00:13:55.790
sentimental attachment,

196
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:59.540
but it actually is what is protecting your life.

197
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:03.290
Can ship is very important,
better wins as well as Germans.

198
00:14:03.291 --> 00:14:06.860
Then the problem with kinship is that wall,

199
00:14:06.861 --> 00:14:11.390
it's a very solid attachment.
It's also an irritant.

200
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:16.190
And here we're not talking about arguments over,
uh,

201
00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:21.700
who's Christmas is better or who gets the Venetian glass vase,

202
00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.510
uh,
after mom and dad's death.

203
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:31.690
We're talking about terrible arguments feuds that are within a kinship group.

204
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:39.250
So you have feuds within the skin,
uh,

205
00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:44.320
groups or tribes and feuds between tribes accentuated in this case,

206
00:14:44.451 --> 00:14:46.670
often by water,
water,

207
00:14:46.671 --> 00:14:51.671
a scarce resource of the Asley and one that people fight about a lot in terms of

208
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:57.230
territorial feuds.
So the Bedouins tend to have more feuds,

209
00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:59.090
um,
than the Germans.

210
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.380
There's no better when equivalent of their go.
Remember,

211
00:15:03.381 --> 00:15:07.670
the variegated is the price that you have to pay,
uh,
um,
uh,

212
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.870
to make someone a half piece with you,

213
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.900
even if you've killed their relatives.
It's the worth of a person.

214
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.810
It's compensation.
And then other people can be,
um,

215
00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:23.870
uh,
assessed on the basis of some tariff.

216
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:28.810
So women may be two thirds of a man.

217
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.820
Pregnant woman may be one and a half times a man and so forth.

218
00:15:31.821 --> 00:15:36.170
We saw this in the Burgundian code key to the Burgundian code is this notion of

219
00:15:36.171 --> 00:15:37.220
compensation,

220
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:42.380
that money related to the nature of the loss.

221
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:46.640
One finger,
two fingers,
right hand,
left hand,
uh,

222
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:50.890
is compensation better don't have that idea of compensation of tariffs of

223
00:15:50.891 --> 00:15:53.000
Vericode in both.

224
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:58.030
The Bedouin in the German society is the ruler has a limited amount of power.

225
00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:00.080
These are,

226
00:16:00.081 --> 00:16:03.980
I wouldn't want to say democratic societies in terms of some theory of

227
00:16:03.981 --> 00:16:04.910
representation,

228
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:10.090
but they're not societies in which one person well is obeyed unquestionably.

229
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:16.850
They are consultative.
They are more like gangs in that sense.
There's a leader,

230
00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:18.860
um,
but,
uh,

231
00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:24.010
his control is conditional on the loyalty of his most powerful subordinates.

232
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:28.670
And as most powerful subordinates are quite capable of overthrowing him,

233
00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:34.510
the better one shake is a little different from the Germanic King.

234
00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:36.680
And by dramatic king,

235
00:16:36.681 --> 00:16:41.390
I mean not the kings that we've seen in the settled post Roman Merovingian

236
00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:45.810
Empire,
but the Kings,
uh,
as described by Tacitus with,
uh,

237
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:50.510
uh,
possible,
greater or lesser accuracy in the Germanic tradition,

238
00:16:50.511 --> 00:16:54.830
the king is a war leader.
In the better one tradition,

239
00:16:54.831 --> 00:16:59.750
the shake is an arbiter,
uh,
a settler of disputes.

240
00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:09.320
Both societies exalted custom and both had an exacting standard of masculinity.

241
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.433
<v 1>Okay.</v>

242
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.710
<v 0>The Germans practiced agriculture and herded animals.</v>

243
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:19.250
The better ones don't have agriculture.
Uh,

244
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.090
and they supplement their,
uh,

245
00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:26.390
hurting of animals by raids on wealthier society.

246
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:31.280
These raids called Rasia,
uh,
are important

247
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:36.320
because the Islamic conquest that we're going to be star,
uh,

248
00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:41.360
talking about on Wednesday may be said to begin as raids.

249
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:48.070
They begin as raids and then they discover that there's almost nobody there.

250
00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:53.560
The army and the Persian army are a crippled by fighting against each other.

251
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:58.950
So what begins by raids becomes conquests.

252
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:02.833
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

253
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:04.510
<v 0>So we come to Mohammed.</v>

254
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:08.500
At first glance,

255
00:18:08.501 --> 00:18:13.501
it would seem that Mohammad is a religious leader whose career takes place in

256
00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:21.520
what a French scholar of religion called the full light of history.

257
00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:25.250
Six twenties.

258
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:30.600
A D may not seem like the full light of history,
but,
uh,

259
00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:35.640
Mohammed as a historical figure at least seems to emerge more clearly than

260
00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:41.220
Abraham or Moses or Jesus.

261
00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.620
But as you have read,

262
00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:53.240
Muhammad's biography is hopelessly entwined with legend.

263
00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:57.110
What we know about Mohamad is what later

264
00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:03.670
Islamic and Arab commentators wanted to have happened to Mohammed.

265
00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:10.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

266
00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:15.270
<v 0>There are several sources for the life of Mohammed and four,</v>

267
00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.470
thus the early years of Islam.

268
00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:23.590
There are formal biographies called Sera as Ira.

269
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:30.010
A problem with these is they were written long after Mohammad's death,

270
00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.290
a hundred years at least.

271
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:39.050
There are collections of oral tradition called Hadi,

272
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:41.060
h,
a,
d,
I,
t,
h

273
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.860
to which similarly there are sayings,

274
00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:49.600
proverbs,

275
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:53.873
<v 1>okay.</v>

276
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:59.830
<v 0>These are also questionable because although they were put together within 50</v>

277
00:20:02.031 --> 00:20:03.440
years of Mohammed's death,

278
00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:08.510
they're very heavily influenced by the first civil war of the six fifties,

279
00:20:08.511 --> 00:20:11.960
which we will be talking about,
uh,
the day after tomorrow.

280
00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.820
And then there's the Koran,
the Koran.

281
00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.253
<v 1>Okay.</v>

282
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:22.650
<v 0>Which is supposed to represent,
uh,</v>

283
00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:27.290
the words of Muhammad,
uh,
as inspired by divine,

284
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:32.600
uh,
um,
well as,
as,
as,
uh,

285
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:36.820
composed by divine inspiration.
Uh,

286
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:42.530
the Koran itself is a text that scholars outside of the Islamic tradition have

287
00:20:42.531 --> 00:20:46.790
questioned in terms of when it was put together,
how much by Mohammed,

288
00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:48.850
how soon after Mohammed.

289
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:54.210
<v 1>Okay.</v>

290
00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:58.950
<v 0>The problem with all these sources is not that they are unreliable in the sense</v>

291
00:20:58.951 --> 00:21:00.120
of fabrication,

292
00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:05.330
but that they tend to shape events in light of what the writers already know

293
00:21:07.441 --> 00:21:12.000
happens and in light of what they think should happen.

294
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:17.310
So that as an example,
uh,
we'll be talking about this in a moment,

295
00:21:17.311 --> 00:21:21.780
but you're all aware that in six 22 Mohammed moves suddenly from Mecca to

296
00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:22.614
Medina,

297
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.670
he maybe can be said to flee Mecca.

298
00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:34.670
This is called the Hedgehog IRA,
or he's Ra in the a Berkey book,
H,

299
00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:39.380
e j.
O.
H.
E.
G.
I.
R.
A or H,

300
00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:44.270
I.
J.
R a,
depending on just how faithful you think you're being too.

301
00:21:44.271 --> 00:21:48.920
The Arab original,
the head Gyra is a key event in Islamic history.

302
00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:53.000
It is the point from which Islamic dating is done.

303
00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:57.560
That is to say the Islamic calendar starts with the [inaudible].

304
00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:03.020
So this year is the year of the hub Gyra such and such.

305
00:22:03.021 --> 00:22:06.740
I can't do 2011 minus six 22 immediately,

306
00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.740
but that's the Islamic year.
Right.

307
00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:12.083
<v 1>Okay.</v>

308
00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:17.100
<v 0>According to the traditional historical record,</v>

309
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:20.463
um,

310
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:25.470
the Meccans tried to assassinate Mohamed and he escaped a narrowly this attempt.

311
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:36.850
There's no real evidence of this degree of hostility on the part of people in

312
00:22:36.851 --> 00:22:41.560
Mecca.
There's no evidence of an assassination attempt or at least independent

313
00:22:41.561 --> 00:22:42.370
evidence.

314
00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:47.370
And the assassination attempt seems to be something that is important for the

315
00:22:47.381 --> 00:22:48.214
story,

316
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.230
for the way that the story is presented later.

317
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.760
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

318
00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:59.200
<v 0>To dramatize something that may not have been at the time as dramatic as it</v>

319
00:22:59.201 --> 00:23:00.034
seemed,

320
00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:03.760
it may have been that the Meccans simply didn't listen to Mohammed and then he

321
00:23:03.761 --> 00:23:08.000
accepted an invitation to Medina.
It may be that they are,
uh,

322
00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:12.130
we're trying to sort of shut his movement down,
um,

323
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.930
but that they resorted to assassination does not seem to be a very likely.

324
00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:19.541
Okay.

325
00:23:19.541 --> 00:23:23.740
So having given you all of these fatiguing caveats about what we do and do not

326
00:23:23.741 --> 00:23:25.030
know,
uh,

327
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:29.230
let's say Mohammed was born between five 70 and 580,

328
00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:33.100
he was born into a reasonably,
um,

329
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:36.790
prominent but not really very affluent family of Mecca.

330
00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.000
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

331
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
<v 0>He may have been a merchant.</v>

332
00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.370
It is usually assumed he was.

333
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:50.290
And this is partly because the Koran has a lot of mercantile similes in order to

334
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.550
elucidate various points,
uh,
uh,

335
00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:58.340
comparison is made with trade,

336
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:03.830
but there's no real evidence.
We don't really know what he did for a living.

337
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:08.180
We know that he married well,
his first wife,

338
00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:11.600
Kardisha k,
h,
a,
d.

339
00:24:11.601 --> 00:24:14.810
I n j a was,
uh,

340
00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:19.580
from a wealthy family,
a higher class family,
then Muhammad's own.

341
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:26.200
And we also know that Mohammed got his start as a religious thinker,

342
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.610
as a profit at the age of 40,

343
00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:35.440
on encouragement to those of us who are slow to get our careers off the ground.

344
00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:44.650
The discouraging part is that his career only lasts relatively brief time dies

345
00:24:44.811 --> 00:24:48.740
10 years after the judge had Gyra,
but he does accomplish an awful lot.

346
00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.000
What was his religious experience?

347
00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:58.620
W was the revelation vouchsafed to him that he preached to the citizens of a

348
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:06.310
mecca beginning around six 15 to six 20.

349
00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.640
It is certainly a message of monotheism against what was considered to be a

350
00:25:17.031 --> 00:25:22.031
prevailing paganism or polytheism on the part of the merchants and tribesmen of

351
00:25:25.131 --> 00:25:28.730
Arabia.
But as we've said,

352
00:25:28.731 --> 00:25:32.330
Arabia had lots of Jews and Christians as well,

353
00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:37.250
and it's a little tricky to tell how much Mohammed would have known about

354
00:25:37.251 --> 00:25:40.790
Judaism and Christianity,
but it looks as if he did.

355
00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:46.140
And indeed it looks as if his preaching begins as a kind of biblical monotheism

356
00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:51.230
for the Arabs.

357
00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:56.260
It is a message to the Arabs congruent with the message of Judaism and

358
00:25:57.201 --> 00:25:58.070
Christianity,

359
00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:03.140
the message of Judaism and Christianity being understood as a,

360
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:04.100
uh,

361
00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:09.100
statement of the unity of God and a progressive interpretation of God's message

362
00:26:11.661 --> 00:26:13.940
by a series of profits,

363
00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:17.300
a series of profits beginning with Abraham,

364
00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:22.010
including,
uh,
Moses,

365
00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:24.020
Isaiah,

366
00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:31.660
Jesus according to Islam and Mohammed Mohammed is then in the line of profits.

367
00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:42.820
The degree to which this means that Islam takes on its own identity is hard to

368
00:26:44.551 --> 00:26:45.090
say.

369
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:50.090
And the tendency of scholars outside of the Islamic tradition that is people

370
00:26:50.191 --> 00:26:52.770
like Berkey is to say it takes quite a while.

371
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:57.780
It takes quite a while for there to be the confidence that Islam is a religion

372
00:26:57.781 --> 00:27:01.530
that is different from Judaism and Christianity.
Uh,

373
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:06.680
while it is clear from the start that the people who are embracing it are

374
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:11.430
different,
even though there are Arab and Jewish Christians.

375
00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.230
And we'll see what that means in a moment.

376
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:20.300
Muhammad's first converts are his family circle and a group of key friends and

377
00:27:21.721 --> 00:27:25.200
they're all important.
Historically,
his wife,

378
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.410
his cousin Ali,

379
00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.980
who would marry his daughter Fatima.

380
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.010
<v 1>Okay.</v>

381
00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:36.970
<v 0>A merchant named [inaudible].</v>

382
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:42.163
<v 1>Okay.</v>

383
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.280
<v 0>A powerful member of the,</v>

384
00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:50.870
one of the leading clans or family groups of Mecca.

385
00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:55.460
Othman sometimes spelled I think in the Berkey book,

386
00:27:55.461 --> 00:27:59.900
spelled with a u.
So we'll,
we'll,
we'll use the you Offman,
right.

387
00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:03.800
Ali?
I've mentioned Abo backer

388
00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:12.380
off button is a member of the EU Mayan family.

389
00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:15.053
<v 1>Okay.</v>

390
00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.010
<v 0>And,
uh,</v>

391
00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:20.093
<v 1>oh Maher,</v>

392
00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:29.250
<v 0>these are sort of considered to be the inner circle of very,</v>

393
00:28:29.251 --> 00:28:30.480
very early converts.

394
00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:37.780
As I said,
according to tradition,
the ruling circles of Mecca became fearful

395
00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:44.080
as what had been a fringe movement started to gain more converts.

396
00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:50.520
The people who ruled Mecca feared that there a control was slipping from their

397
00:28:52.991 --> 00:28:57.991
grasp and they feared that this new movement was popular with a lower class.

398
00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:02.200
The leading clan,
uh,
of,
uh,

399
00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.510
Meco were the carriage

400
00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:11.800
knees are the people who are most powerful in Mecca and begin as the enemies of

401
00:29:12.621 --> 00:29:17.621
Mohammed and are responsible for driving him out if indeed he was driven out in

402
00:29:20.361 --> 00:29:23.270
six 22,
the city of Medina,

403
00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:29.380
another merchant center invited Mohammed to come as a kind of arbiter or ruler

404
00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:40.310
who was above factions and who could then settle their internet scene disputes.

405
00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:42.730
This is not an uncommon pattern.

406
00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:47.620
You'll see it in late medieval and renaissance Italy in fact.
Um,

407
00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:53.820
but Podo star in Italian cities is an outsider who is empowered with very,

408
00:29:56.930 --> 00:30:01.660
uh,
extensive police powers to quell feuds in Romeo and Juliet,

409
00:30:01.661 --> 00:30:06.440
for example,
there a postop,
but he doesn't,
he's not able to,
to solve the,
uh,
uh,

410
00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:09.790
the feud.
But that's the kind of scene,
uh,

411
00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:14.820
that we can imagine a as the western equivalent of Medina Mohammed is invited as

412
00:30:16.541 --> 00:30:19.480
a wise man,
as an arbiter,

413
00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:23.920
as a reconciler to the city of Medina.

414
00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.170
An offer that he accepts

415
00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:33.060
and it is in Medina,
is that we really start to see emerge,
uh,

416
00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.370
what can be called in Islamic identity.

417
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000
I tend to think a little bit earlier than Berkey because here Islam starts to

418
00:30:44.641 --> 00:30:49.641
differentiate itself from Judaism and Christianity and indeed the period at

419
00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:52.850
Medina culminates with the,
uh,

420
00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:57.930
expulsion of Jewish groups who refuse to accept Muhammad.

421
00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:01.240
<v 1>Cool.</v>

422
00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:06.240
<v 0>What he does at Medina also is to preach that the religious loyalty is more</v>

423
00:31:06.791 --> 00:31:09.340
important than loyalty to the tribal group.

424
00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:14.590
The religious loyalty therefore is not simply a,
um,

425
00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:18.730
accompaniment to your already existing identity.

426
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.630
It is the most important aspect of your identity.

427
00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:26.710
<v 1>Okay?</v>

428
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:27.940
<v 0>It's at Medina.</v>

429
00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:33.090
That Mecca replaces Jerusalem as the point of orientation for prayer.

430
00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:40.650
It's at Medina that Mohammed stopped celebrating Yom Kippor and institutes a

431
00:31:43.391 --> 00:31:45.820
month long fast

432
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.680
during the daylight hours.
Ramadan

433
00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:56.720
at Medina Friday becomes the sabbath,

434
00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:59.420
not Saturday or Sunday.

435
00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:03.430
<v 1>Okay.</v>

436
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:07.600
<v 0>And the Jews are expelled from Medina and by Jews I don't mean some kind of</v>

437
00:32:07.601 --> 00:32:11.830
foreign community of non Arabs who happened to be living in Medina,

438
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:15.520
but rather Jews,
some of whom came from elsewhere,

439
00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.020
many of whom were Arabs.

440
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:26.350
And it's also here that Mohammed perfects this notion as against the Christians

441
00:32:27.021 --> 00:32:28.880
and Jews who have scorned him,

442
00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:32.510
that he is the seal of the prophets.

443
00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.290
The last of the process.

444
00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:36.873
<v 1>Yes.</v>

445
00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:45.070
<v 0>From Abraham to Jesus.
Now to Mohammed.
This is the last prophecy.
Okay.</v>

446
00:32:45.071 --> 00:32:48.760
God's message has not been packaged into one deal.

447
00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.630
One a file,
you know,

448
00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:56.670
too large for one email attachment and it's come in a bunch of them at this is

449
00:32:57.101 --> 00:33:01.990
it?
Okay.
Here are all the cute cat pictures and all of the,
you know,

450
00:33:01.991 --> 00:33:06.670
all the whole file which you now can download in segments,
but it's over.

451
00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:11.700
This is the Jews and Christians are wrong to think that either it ended,

452
00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:14.051
you know,

453
00:33:14.051 --> 00:33:19.051
with Alijah or that it the be all and end all of all prophecy was Jesus.

454
00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.033
No.

455
00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:22.280
<v 1>Okay.</v>

456
00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.270
<v 0>No,
this is uh,
the truth.</v>

457
00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:30.300
But keep in mind that Islam did and at least is supposed to respect Judaism and

458
00:33:32.741 --> 00:33:36.070
Christianity as not merely precursors,

459
00:33:36.071 --> 00:33:37.870
but as part of the same tradition,

460
00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:44.070
people of the book is the term often used in Islam to describe Judaism and

461
00:33:44.951 --> 00:33:45.730
Christianity.

462
00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:50.080
They share the same if not scripture.

463
00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:51.040
Exactly.

464
00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:55.660
But the same kind of historical religious orientation,

465
00:33:57.370 --> 00:34:01.630
the criticism that Islam can make against Christianity is that it tends to be

466
00:34:01.631 --> 00:34:05.960
polytheistic.
And as you know,

467
00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:11.050
Islam expense great care to make sure that the human form does not appear in art

468
00:34:11.781 --> 00:34:16.370
and in some forms of Islamic art that not even,
you know,
animals,
uh,
appear.

469
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:19.100
The depiction of the human figure is proscribed.

470
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:24.490
Great Care is made in differentiating Mohamed from what Muslim see as the

471
00:34:25.101 --> 00:34:28.070
exaggerated stature of Jesus.

472
00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.260
Muhammad is a prophet.

473
00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:33.530
He is a messenger of Allah,

474
00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:36.560
not to be identified with Allah himself.

475
00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:38.780
There is no depiction of Muhammad.

476
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:41.870
People do not have pictures of him in their houses.

477
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:44.090
There are no statues to him.

478
00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:49.650
Well,

479
00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:54.220
Hammond's greatest challenge was to overcome these tribal loyalties in favor of

480
00:34:54.221 --> 00:34:57.850
the Ooma u m m a the community of the faithful.

481
00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:06.770
He allowed property in marriage to be decided still by tribal tradition,

482
00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:14.210
but prohibited feuds and required that disputes be arbitrated in religious

483
00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:18.360
courts.
This is important because Mohammed,

484
00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:23.690
like the rabbis of the diaspora in Judaism is both a religious leader and a

485
00:35:25.021 --> 00:35:25.854
judge.

486
00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:31.280
He is a community leader and a spiritual leader and indeed these two things are

487
00:35:32.251 --> 00:35:34.170
not really distinguished.

488
00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:38.040
I emphasize this because it's really different Christianity.

489
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:43.910
In Christianity there's a church and there's a legal secular state sometimes and

490
00:35:47.161 --> 00:35:49.800
of course the Middle Ages as time extent defined by this,

491
00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:53.070
the church will have what looked like secular powers.

492
00:35:53.071 --> 00:35:56.550
We've talked about this with regard to the bishops in Gregory of tour.

493
00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:02.930
At times the papacy later would claim all sorts of political powers,

494
00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:08.180
but conceptually in Christianity because Christianity was any illegal religious

495
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:13.030
brotherhood within the Roman Empire for uh,
uh,

496
00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:17.490
over two centuries,
church and state are different.

497
00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:19.860
<v 1>Okay.</v>

498
00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:23.760
<v 0>In Islam,
when can't really talk about church or clergy,</v>

499
00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:29.850
there are religious leaders who have political authority,

500
00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:35.080
but their authority is what we would call that of a judge and that have a

501
00:36:35.081 --> 00:36:37.540
religious leader.
At the same time,

502
00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:44.110
the political order and the religious community are the same.

503
00:36:44.111 --> 00:36:48.820
That's why when we talk about the Arab conquest or the Islamic conquest,

504
00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:53.970
we're talking about something in which the new territories are taken over by a

505
00:36:55.481 --> 00:37:00.481
state that's not a theocracy in the sense that the church is ruling the state.

506
00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:03.730
But something in which the church and state are not to be distinguished.

507
00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:11.420
We'll talk about this more when we come to the conquest within two years of the

508
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:14.520
Hud Gyra six 22.
So by six 24,

509
00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:19.850
Mohammed was planning to take over Mecca to re enter in triumph the city that he

510
00:37:21.481 --> 00:37:24.060
had fled,
if not under cover of darkness,

511
00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:26.700
at least under murky circumstances.

512
00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:35.160
A victory in battle in six 24 gave Mohammed the confidence to expelled Jews and

513
00:37:35.161 --> 00:37:39.120
Christians from Medina
and uh,

514
00:37:39.121 --> 00:37:44.090
to take on this title of Seal of the Prophets.
And by six 27,
uh,

515
00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:49.200
uh Medina game,
the other upper hand and in six 30,

516
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:54.230
Mecca fell to Mohammed and his forces and all of the tribes of Mecca and of the

517
00:37:56.341 --> 00:37:59.970
surrounding areas submitted to Mohammed.

518
00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:05.240
They recognized him as a political as well as religious leader.

519
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:08.520
Again,
the two things not easily to be distinguished.

520
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:14.490
And then Mohammed died in six 32.
He died.

521
00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:21.150
And what is remarkable is that the momentum he established was able to survive

522
00:38:21.151 --> 00:38:26.100
his demise because most of the tribes probably thought that their loyalty was to

523
00:38:26.101 --> 00:38:31.101
him as a prophet and a person and not to some sort of institution that would

524
00:38:31.501 --> 00:38:32.700
survive his death.

525
00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:42.580
And indeed his death would usher in a period of incredibly rapid expansion

526
00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:49.010
within a few years of Mohammed's death.
Damascus,

527
00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:51.710
the great city of the eastern Mediterranean,

528
00:38:51.711 --> 00:38:54.140
the Byzantine Damascus would fall to the Arabs,

529
00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:58.210
the first of many such conquests that we will be,
uh,

530
00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:01.010
marching through on Wednesday.

531
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:08.160
But this question of religious loyalty would be exacerbated by splits within

532
00:39:09.461 --> 00:39:11.620
Islam,
which will also be describing

533
00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:14.670
<v 1>okay.</v>

534
00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:18.270
<v 0>The tenants of Islam,
just to close by way of,
uh,</v>

535
00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:22.350
uh,
uh,
our last remarks for the day,

536
00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:28.170
Islam means surrender and to surrender oneself to the power of Allah is the

537
00:39:28.171 --> 00:39:31.170
beginning of wisdom.
The beginning of faith.

538
00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:34.170
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

539
00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:39.170
<v 0>Acknowledgement of Allah is acknowledgement of a strict monotheism</v>

540
00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:44.670
acknowledgement of Mohammed as the Messenger Prophet of Allah.

541
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:46.470
And as the last prophet.

542
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:47.543
<v 1>Okay.</v>

543
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:53.900
<v 0>The so called five pillars of wisdom of Islam are duties.</v>

544
00:39:53.901 --> 00:39:58.901
Incumbent on the believer and these are the confession of faith that I just

545
00:40:00.771 --> 00:40:01.604
mentioned.

546
00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:06.260
Daily prayers five times a day,

547
00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:10.040
the giving of arms.

548
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:13.783
<v 1>Okay.</v>

549
00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:19.140
<v 0>Be Observance of Ramadan and the performance of the pilgrimage to Mecca if</v>

550
00:40:20.311 --> 00:40:24.810
that's possible.
What's not there?

551
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:28.260
It's interesting to what's not.

552
00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:32.220
Intrinsic to Islam is a strong sense of sin.

553
00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:34.980
<v 1>The</v>

554
00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:39.630
<v 0>Arabs do not like the confessions of Saint Augustine.</v>

555
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:44.400
They are not interested in this particular form of spiritual investigation.

556
00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:47.603
<v 1>Okay?</v>

557
00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:51.900
<v 0>They're the believer can pray directly to Allah.</v>

558
00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:57.770
There is really no Islamic clergy in the sense of presiding over sacraments or

559
00:40:58.411 --> 00:41:00.090
channels of grace.

560
00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:06.530
The mosque is a gathering place.

561
00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:12.610
It is not a place that has some kind of powerful holy objects in it in the sense

562
00:41:15.861 --> 00:41:20.861
that a church in this era would have relics or eucharistic hosts and other very

563
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:26.330
powerful sacred things.

564
00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.780
Islam is a religion of conduct and law,

565
00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:34.610
not of mortification and purgation.

566
00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:40.190
It emphasizes upright behavior.
No drinking,
no gambling,

567
00:41:40.191 --> 00:41:44.600
certain dietary restrictions,
not than renunciation of the world.

568
00:41:44.601 --> 00:41:47.540
It does not say sell everything you have and give it to the poor.

569
00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:52.310
It says give arms.
It is a moderate religion actually.

570
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:55.340
It is a doable religion.

571
00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:57.070
<v 1>Okay.</v>

572
00:41:57.070 --> 00:42:02.070
<v 0>These obligations may be somewhat inconvenient at times,</v>

573
00:42:02.801 --> 00:42:04.330
Ramadan,
for example.

574
00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:10.120
But there is nothing in here to the degree that the New Testament,
for example,

575
00:42:10.121 --> 00:42:13.360
prescribes behavior that most people are not going to follow

576
00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:19.680
or the traditional Judaism possible,

577
00:42:19.681 --> 00:42:23.580
but certainly a onerous,
lots of obligations.

578
00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:27.163
<v 1>Okay.</v>

579
00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:29.150
<v 0>The other difference,</v>

580
00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:34.180
more important with Judaism is that Islam would be very quickly universal.

581
00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:40.190
In other words,
it would encourage conversion,

582
00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.430
although not as we will see,
um,

583
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:45.920
with great enthusiasm,

584
00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:51.260
it is completely erroneous to think that these armies that burst forth from

585
00:42:51.261 --> 00:42:55.420
Arabia after the death of Mohammad were intent on getting everybody to fall on

586
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:58.730
Mohamed.
They weren't tent on conquest.
All right?

587
00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:05.910
But we'll see that their goals were a little more complicated than that of a

588
00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:10.710
orienting everybody towards this new faith whenever we're going to call it.

589
00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:13.560
And we'll see more about that today after tomorrow.
Thanks.
