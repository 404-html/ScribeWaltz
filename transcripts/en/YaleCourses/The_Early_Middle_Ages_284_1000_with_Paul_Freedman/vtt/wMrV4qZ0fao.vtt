WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.090
We in the midst of,
uh,

2
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:07.980
uh,
laughs,

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.420
attempted to look at the seventh century last time as a turning point in the

4
00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:17.421
history of the period that we're dealing with the post Roman world.

5
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.300
The early Middle Ages certainly,
uh,

6
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.400
among of a major shifts was the rise of Islam and the consequent radical changes

7
00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:33.270
in the Mediterranean,

8
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:38.271
territory's particularly of course P areas conquered from the eastern Roman

9
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:45.180
empire by Byzantium,
namely Syria,
Palestine,

10
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.480
Egypt,
uh,
and eventually North Africa.

11
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.460
The seventh century therefore changed the shape of the Byzantine Empire.

12
00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.180
And so it's orientation as well as culture.

13
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.120
Here I have a kind of periodization

14
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.070
we've spoken about just any ends expansion.

15
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.690
Very shortly after his death there begins what seems in retrospect,

16
00:01:19.091 --> 00:01:22.990
at least in part to be a reaction to imperial overreach.

17
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.320
Imperial overreach is a phenomenon seen,
uh,

18
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.480
throughout history described most memorably,

19
00:01:31.481 --> 00:01:34.060
perhaps by our own Paul Kennedy.

20
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.360
The tendency for empires simply in order to protect themselves or order to fill,

21
00:01:39.881 --> 00:01:41.080
fulfill their ambitions,

22
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.350
to get too large for their own ability to hold onto their possessions.

23
00:01:46.901 --> 00:01:48.610
This is an economic problem,

24
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.330
a logistical problem of resource problem.

25
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.540
And even a cultural problem.
Uh,

26
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.940
in general,

27
00:01:57.941 --> 00:02:02.941
it's hard to say what provokes the crisis that is with the Roman empire.

28
00:02:03.071 --> 00:02:06.820
As we're the opposite,
we can say,
oh,
well it was too big.

29
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.560
On the other hand,

30
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.800
it was too big and did just fine for centuries in the case the opposite empire,

31
00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:16.090
maybe not centuries,
but 150 years,

32
00:02:16.091 --> 00:02:20.170
which is these things go is a pretty long time here.
However,

33
00:02:20.171 --> 00:02:25.171
we're talking about something that is much more obviously related to some kind

34
00:02:25.391 --> 00:02:30.220
of overreach.
Justinian formed his,
uh,
expanded empire,

35
00:02:30.221 --> 00:02:34.100
which is the first map in the handout.
Uh,

36
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.330
and merely a few years after his death,
it started to unravel.

37
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.480
You'll recall that we said that he had at great cost conquered Italy after the

38
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.160
easy conquest of North Africa.
Uh,
this,
uh,

39
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.280
looked like it would be easy as well.
But in fact,

40
00:02:54.281 --> 00:02:59.281
while North Africa occupied by the vandals fell within a year two,

41
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.550
uh,

42
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.550
Italy took 20 years to rest from the Ostrogoths and the,

43
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.730
uh,
peninsula was devastated and,
uh,
Ian,

44
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.780
a radical economic decline when Byzantium took over a mere three years after

45
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:18.580
Justinian's death.
And five 68,

46
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.110
Italy was invaded by yet another barbarian tribe.
The lombards,

47
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.440
the lombards did not take over all of it.

48
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.290
The Byzantine Empire,

49
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.320
the eastern Roman Empire managed to hand hold onto Sicily much of southern

50
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:37.510
Italy,
the,
um,
east coast,

51
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:42.130
particularly the Capitol of the Byzantine province,
uh,
Ravenna,

52
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.590
but nevertheless,
the lombards occupied most of the peninsula.

53
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.660
And,
uh,
uh,
as we'll discuss in a moment,

54
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.900
other disasters piled up in this period that I have just called contraction.

55
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.530
But it's not just a question of the,
uh,
of the,
uh,

56
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.100
empire getting smaller.
It's really a,
um,
uh,

57
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.740
uh,

58
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.740
a radical crisis and an ongoing crisis with the appearance of many enemies and

59
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.430
the radical shrinking of the borders of this empire.
So,

60
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.140
um,
again,
look at the empire in five 65.

61
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.150
It's making a good attempt at Justinian's death to mimic the Roman Empire at the

62
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:35.530
beginning of our course,
at its height in the third century,

63
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.550
it doesn't have Northwestern Europe,

64
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:42.550
but it has most of the Mediterranean.

65
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.850
And to the degree that the Roman empire was,

66
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:50.740
as we with fatiguing repetition have said,
a Mediterranean centered empire.

67
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.740
This empire of Justinian's,
uh,

68
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.030
does a good job of restoring that Mediterranean orientation.

69
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.650
If you look at the second map,
um,

70
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.950
during this period of what,
uh,
uh,

71
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.680
the author of this book that I took the map from Howden h a l d o n calls the

72
00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:13.300
process of devastation,

73
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.820
you can see how much has been lost.
Uh,
the,

74
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.300
uh,

75
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.280
empire at this point consists mostly of Anatolia,

76
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.410
a little bit of Italy,
a few islands,
uh,

77
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.180
even the Balkans is mostly occupied by Slavs and Bulger's

78
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.240
there then follows a period of reconstruction of the stabilization of borders of

79
00:05:42.851 --> 00:05:47.851
taking back some lands in the Balkans and in Anatolia from,

80
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.600
uh,
the Arabs in Anatolia and from various groups in the Balkans.

81
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.160
This is also the period of the icon of plastic and emperors.

82
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.430
And then finally,
uh,
a,

83
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.860
an expansion of the Byzantine Empire.

84
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:08.861
The golden age of the Byzantine Empire is this period after the settlement of

85
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:14.300
iconoclasm and eight 43 until the appearance of a new enemy,

86
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:19.301
the Seljuk Turks who won a devastating victory and 10 71 and begin a process of

87
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:24.560
uh,
what ultimately,

88
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.100
but in this case ultimately means a 350 years.

89
00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:31.970
What ultimately would be the final crisis for the Byzantine Empire,

90
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:35.270
which would be extinguished by the Turks in 1453.

91
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:37.760
So if you look at map number three,

92
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.690
the Byzantine Empire around the year 1000,
um,

93
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.260
ignore Bulgaria for the time being.
That is a separate kingdom.

94
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:51.350
And we're going to talk about it soon.
Uh,

95
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.400
this is a compact empire compared to that of Justinian.

96
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.270
It is not in control of the Mediterranean.

97
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.940
It has two bases,
really,

98
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.180
the Balkans and Asia minor,

99
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.400
and it has a little bit of territory in Italy still.
Uh,

100
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.530
but,
uh,
this empire made logistics sense,

101
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:24.080
uh,
was never easy to keep together.
Nevertheless,

102
00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:26.480
it was stable,
uh,

103
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:31.510
had enough money for its substantial military expenses and even to create a kind

104
00:07:32.391 --> 00:07:34.280
of cultural efflorescence.

105
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.930
So here we have a story not merely of survival,

106
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:43.160
but of survival adaptation and expansion.

107
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:48.190
And that's what I want to discuss with you today of the reason we're doing this

108
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.230
is because this is part of early medieval history.

109
00:07:51.231 --> 00:07:55.580
We've talked about the legacy of the Roman empire,

110
00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:00.710
a three part kind of legacy in our formulation on Wednesday,

111
00:08:00.711 --> 00:08:03.890
we'll start talking again about Europe,
northern Europe,

112
00:08:03.891 --> 00:08:07.160
and the degree to which Charlemagne in particular,
uh,

113
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.270
is a self conscious heir to the Roman Empire.

114
00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:15.320
He revives the title of Roman Emperor.
In the case of the east,

115
00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:18.140
these people have never abandoned the title of Roman Emperor.

116
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:23.150
And indeed as a key thing about the Byzantine crisis in contrast to the crisis

117
00:08:23.151 --> 00:08:26.910
of the West is that the empire never falls.

118
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.580
It is never destroyed,

119
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:33.820
but it does undergo many of the same crises and consequences of the crises that

120
00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:42.590
the West did in the fifth century.
I said last time that to some extent,

121
00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:47.630
uh,
while we don't like the term dark ages,
um,
uh,

122
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.700
certainly,
uh,

123
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.330
after the collapse of the western Roman Empire in the fifth century,

124
00:08:53.331 --> 00:08:58.140
Europe enters into a period of radical materials simplification.

125
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.820
That is to say it is more rural,
there's less commerce.

126
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.990
It is politically more decentralized.

127
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:09.210
It is militarized

128
00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:17.920
and its culture is the preserve of a relatively small group of clergy.

129
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.410
<v 1>Yes,</v>

130
00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:25.410
<v 0>a lot of the same things happen in the Byzantine Empire in the seventh and</v>

131
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.760
eighth centuries.

132
00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:32.530
This is a kind of dark age for Byzantium.

133
00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.920
We don't have a lot of written sources.
For example,

134
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:41.310
there seems to be an almost complete desertion of the ancient cities and with

135
00:09:44.051 --> 00:09:47.590
the exception of Constantinople itself and one or two others,

136
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:52.630
same kind of ruralization of society.
It is a militarized society,

137
00:09:52.631 --> 00:09:56.380
although as we'll see with more central governmental role.

138
00:09:56.381 --> 00:09:58.900
But it is a society built around warfare

139
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:06.100
and it is a society in which culture is also somewhat restricted.

140
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:11.600
Uh,
the libraries don't get destroyed exactly.

141
00:10:11.601 --> 00:10:14.330
But they certainly don't get a whole lot of use,

142
00:10:14.331 --> 00:10:18.710
at least in terms of things that we can understand or fall.

143
00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.593
<v 1>Wow.</v>

144
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:27.110
<v 0>And the Byzantine Empire faced an awful lot of enemies.</v>

145
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:32.690
The history of Byzantium is to some extent the history of emperors.

146
00:10:32.691 --> 00:10:34.760
You never heard of writers,

147
00:10:34.761 --> 00:10:37.970
you never heard of a lot of really need art

148
00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:42.850
heresies that you may have never heard of before,

149
00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:47.470
but you have to learn anyway.
Um,
and uh,

150
00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:50.380
invaders,
some of whom you've heard of,
some of whom not.

151
00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.810
But Harris season invaders are really the story.

152
00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:59.560
Uh,
so I didn't make this history,
but,
um,
it is very important.

153
00:10:59.561 --> 00:11:03.490
And actually,
uh,
I think Harris,
these are kind of neat.
Uh,

154
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.120
although who am I to say since I went into this for a living,

155
00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:08.230
so I must've liked them.

156
00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:14.850
The most dramatic enemy of Byzantium in this period is the caliphate,

157
00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.740
the Arab empire of Islam.

158
00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:24.420
And so in terms of the shocks and crises of this period of contraction after

159
00:11:26.411 --> 00:11:29.020
Justinian the rise of Islam,

160
00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:34.021
and in particular the two dramatic sieges of Constantinople in six 74 were a

161
00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:40.750
naval battle,
finally defeated the Arabs,
uh,
um,

162
00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:45.280
forces and the siege of seven 17,
six 74,

163
00:11:45.281 --> 00:11:50.281
seven 17 to sieges of Constantinople by the caliphate.

164
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.980
So what was the problem of imperial overreach?

165
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.590
Just to take this back to its origin?
Justinian in particular,

166
00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:09.424
as we said,

167
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:13.810
was focused on the conquest of the western Roman Empire,

168
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.650
which he saw,
of course not as a conquest,
but as a reconquest,

169
00:12:17.651 --> 00:12:22.651
a restoration of territory's taken unjustly by barbarian rulers,

170
00:12:24.191 --> 00:12:26.470
which he was determined to take back.

171
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.520
He already had one enemy,
however,

172
00:12:30.521 --> 00:12:34.180
and that was Persia on the eastern front.
This is nothing new.

173
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.660
We started the course with the,
uh,
uh,

174
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:42.750
Ryan and Danube frontier as one a front and the Persian frontier in the east as

175
00:12:43.871 --> 00:12:44.704
another.

176
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:47.710
The only difference is now the Ryan and Daniel Frontier has been breached.

177
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.430
Justinian pacified the Persians,
paid them off,

178
00:12:51.431 --> 00:12:56.170
made a treaty with them in order to have a free hand to undertake the conquests

179
00:12:56.171 --> 00:12:59.770
in the west.
In retrospect,
you know,
with,
uh,
um,

180
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:04.420
the historians ability to quarterback,
uh,
after the game,

181
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:09.460
the,
um,
lack of attention to purse was a mistake.

182
00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:14.710
The Persians in fact,
invaded despite this peace treaty,
uh,
in the,
uh,

183
00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:19.660
five forties,
uh,
the Italian campaign didn't go well.
Uh,

184
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.810
things were patched up.
Justinian died in peace,

185
00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:26.590
but his empire was quite a fragile.

186
00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:33.730
In addition to everything else,
there's a plague and five 41,
five 42,

187
00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:38.410
that kills a very large proportion of the population.

188
00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:44.650
And as I said,
after just Indians death in five 68,
the lombards invade Italy.

189
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.270
And beginning just a few years later in the five seventies,

190
00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:54.390
we start to have another force that's a little more difficult to describe,

191
00:13:54.821 --> 00:13:58.930
just,
uh,
in the manner of the convenient term.
Lombard's I mean,

192
00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:00.880
we don't really know what Lombard's means.

193
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.010
We don't really know who these people are.
I mean,

194
00:14:03.011 --> 00:14:07.660
we know a little bit about them,
but,
uh,
you know,
it's a pseudo ethnic name.

195
00:14:07.661 --> 00:14:10.660
We don't really know how people identified themselves,

196
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:15.760
but it becomes even more confusing with the groups that invaded the Balkans.

197
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:21.210
The conventional way of describing these is that the leaders were a group called

198
00:14:21.881 --> 00:14:26.620
the a vars and their subordinates.

199
00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:30.460
They are sort of cast of thousands.
They're slave armies,

200
00:14:30.461 --> 00:14:32.230
whatever you want to call them,
more slobs.

201
00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:39.080
The vars are a Turkic or Mongo.

202
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:44.000
People of the Slavs are Indo European Slavs.

203
00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:49.400
Uh,
this is to some extent how the Slavs get into the Balkans.

204
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:54.440
Uh,
how this worked,
uh,

205
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.310
relations between the Slavs and the virus is not completely clear,

206
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:03.140
but we certainly know that they took over much of the Balkans,

207
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.000
including Greece.

208
00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:09.170
Greece in this case has to be considered part of the Balkans.

209
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:14.540
So the south eastern corner of Europe,
modern Greece,

210
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:19.310
Bulgaria,
European,
Turkey,
Albania,

211
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.720
Croatia,

212
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:24.980
Serbia costs of Oh um,

213
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.280
Bosnia Herzegovina.
Um,

214
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:33.610
all of these countries are at heartland of the Byzantine Empire in its post,

215
00:15:34.131 --> 00:15:36.700
just in the antic form,
but,
uh,

216
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:40.080
now invaded by a vars and Slavs beginning and five 70.

217
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:46.630
The Emperor Maurice was murdered by his troops in six oh two campaigning in the

218
00:15:47.751 --> 00:15:50.750
Balkans against the a vars and the Slavs.

219
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:56.080
He was succeeded by a cruel but hapless general named focus,

220
00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:03.020
who's disastrous rule has emperor involve not only the uprising or invasion of a

221
00:16:04.981 --> 00:16:08.450
vars and Slavs and the Balkans,
but a,
uh,

222
00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.550
Persian invasion in the east

223
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.020
focus was overthrown in six,
10.

224
00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:21.560
The Persians a virus and Slavs allied against Constantinople.

225
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:25.700
And in six 26,
the city was besieged from both sides.

226
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:30.770
The Persians camped out across the Bosphorus in Asiatic,

227
00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:35.720
the end of Asiatic Turkey and the AE vars and the Slavs camped out outside of

228
00:16:35.721 --> 00:16:39.190
the great theodosian walls of the city.
Uh,
uh,

229
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.070
that we're on its land side.
It's western side.

230
00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:48.440
The fact that the city managed to overcome this was attributed to various

231
00:16:48.441 --> 00:16:52.250
miracles and saints and particularly the protection of the Virgin Mary.

232
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:56.030
And it's very important in terms of the later history of iconoclasm to point out

233
00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:00.410
that they had icons and all sorts of wonder working,
uh,

234
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:05.650
portrayals of powerful saints on the walls in order to protect the city.

235
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:10.820
And it worked.
Uh,
or at least certainly it looked like it worked.
Uh,

236
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:13.310
the,
uh,
the invasions were foiled.

237
00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:16.370
How did the Byzantine Empire fight?

238
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:20.870
How did it manage to withstand these invasions?
Um,

239
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:25.610
very briefly,
one factor is the strategic position of Constantinople.

240
00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:30.650
A city extremely difficult to take by force.
Indeed,

241
00:17:30.651 --> 00:17:35.651
it would not be taken by a flat out of salt until 1204 when western crusaders an

242
00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:42.010
alliance of the Venetians and uh,
uh,

243
00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:46.250
the Franks as they're called basically various western European groups,

244
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:51.750
um,
took Constantinople,
uh,
how they took Constantinople,

245
00:17:51.751 --> 00:17:53.100
why they didn't go to Jerusalem,

246
00:17:53.101 --> 00:17:56.850
which was the original plan and how they took a Christian city instead of the

247
00:17:56.851 --> 00:18:01.830
Muslim held.
City of Jerusalem is a topic for the next semester,

248
00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:07.550
but that is the first time that the walls were breached by force.

249
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:12.420
There is,
there are various successful sneak attacks.
So,

250
00:18:12.421 --> 00:18:15.390
for example,
uh,
in hour period,

251
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:19.230
the emperor Justinian the second

252
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:24.330
had been deposed,
uh,
and,
um,

253
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:27.430
had his nose and tongues slit.
Uh,

254
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:30.690
this form of mutilation was to prevent him from coming back again,

255
00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.110
was considered more humane to mutilate someone than to kill them.

256
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:37.220
But the mutilation was considered to be disabling.

257
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:41.520
You can't have an emperor with a,
you know,
whose knows is basically gone.

258
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.790
Um,
but they were wrong about him.
In fact,

259
00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:49.770
he came back with a force of people from,
if you look at that,

260
00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:54.900
I'm a third map Terrison the Crimean peninsula that's sticking out into the

261
00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.353
Black Sea.

262
00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:02.400
They besieged the city and he and some followers snuck in at a point where the

263
00:19:02.401 --> 00:19:04.250
aqueduct,
uh,
uh,

264
00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:08.190
one of the aqua ducks met the wall who's a little sort of space to,
uh,

265
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:13.320
to sneak in.
And,
uh,
they managed to,
um,
um,

266
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:18.350
by a surprise attack and by acclimation of the noseless Emperor Justinian,

267
00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:22.050
uh,
when the city for themselves.
Um,

268
00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:27.150
so this is an example of a successful siege,
but not a flat out,
uh,
you know,

269
00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.230
open a assault.
Now,

270
00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:34.240
just an Ian rain had a reign of terror for another six or seven years after

271
00:19:34.441 --> 00:19:39.180
seven oh five,
the date of the siege.
Um,
he was a very angry man and,

272
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.700
uh,
he got his revenge on as many people as possible,

273
00:19:41.701 --> 00:19:44.790
including people who had nothing to do with his mutilation.

274
00:19:44.791 --> 00:19:49.590
And he was eventually killed an awful lot of these emperors.
Dot.
Violent deaths.

275
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:54.870
Uh,
they're,
um,
they're tough guys,
but it's a fairly tough time.

276
00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:02.800
So,
uh,
Persian,
a Var,
Slav,
siege of six 26,

277
00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:06.850
the seeming victory of [inaudible] this over these forces.

278
00:20:06.851 --> 00:20:11.851
And then it's virtual undoing by the Islamic conquest of much of the Byzantine

279
00:20:14.111 --> 00:20:18.280
Empire member,
the conquest of Syria and the six thirties,

280
00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:22.000
the capitulation of Alexandria in six 42.

281
00:20:22.001 --> 00:20:25.780
We looked at all of these from the Muslim side very recently.

282
00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:31.550
Meanwhile,
while Byzantium was busy losing,

283
00:20:31.551 --> 00:20:33.680
it's a much of its empire in the east.

284
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:38.830
The Slavs were permanently settling in the Balkans and in Greece and they,

285
00:20:39.081 --> 00:20:43.280
we're now joined by another invading people.
The Bulger's,

286
00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:44.850
the boogers in it.

287
00:20:44.851 --> 00:20:48.970
And that is the people who live in Bulgaria are a Slavic people.

288
00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:54.690
But the original bull guards were a more Turkic people who formed a kind of what

289
00:20:55.541 --> 00:20:59.500
was called connate.
That is a,
um,
uh,

290
00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:04.420
state ruled by a military leader,
a con.

291
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:09.430
But here again,
uh,
who are the boogers ethnically?

292
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:14.470
How many of them have Slavic followers?
Um,
uh,
it's,

293
00:21:14.471 --> 00:21:19.370
uh,
it's both very controversial.
That is the Bulger's hate the notion.

294
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:23.590
The modern Bulgarians hate the notion of being thought of as ancestrally Turks.

295
00:21:23.591 --> 00:21:27.880
So when I'm saying is heresy,
uh,
in some quarters,
uh,

296
00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:32.920
but these ethnic designations are not as meaningful or at least as stable as we

297
00:21:32.921 --> 00:21:35.530
often tend to think they are.
Uh,

298
00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.820
the Bulger's would intermarry with the Slavs and they would eventually convert

299
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.380
to orthodoxy,

300
00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:46.860
but they would be a problem for Byzantium from the about 700 until just after a

301
00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:55.240
thousand.
So how is this empire rebuilt?

302
00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:02.310
It was rebuilt on the basis of control over the Balkans and Anatolia.

303
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:06.760
It was also rebuilt on the basis of reorganization of the army.

304
00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.021
Obviously,

305
00:22:08.021 --> 00:22:13.021
the position of Constantinople and its walls is not enough to assure a victory

306
00:22:13.961 --> 00:22:16.510
in battle once you get away from Constantinople.

307
00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:19.030
There are certain kinds of weapons that they had.

308
00:22:19.031 --> 00:22:23.020
There's this mysterious one that I mentioned before called Greek fire,

309
00:22:23.021 --> 00:22:26.440
which is certainly part of the victory of six 74.

310
00:22:26.441 --> 00:22:29.680
The naval battle against the Caliphs.
Um,

311
00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:32.590
uh,
the um,

312
00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:34.370
<v 1>okay.</v>

313
00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:36.470
<v 0>Uh,
it's a project top burning,</v>

314
00:22:36.471 --> 00:22:40.550
some sort of burning substance that explodes on impact and as useful to burn

315
00:22:40.551 --> 00:22:41.384
ships.

316
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:44.980
<v 1>Um,
but um,</v>

317
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:50.990
<v 0>the army is reorganized and this is one of the key aspects of this period of</v>

318
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.830
contraction and of reconstruction of crisis and of um,

319
00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:57.953
recovery.

320
00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.270
<v 1>And we'll come to that in a moment.</v>

321
00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.780
<v 0>During this era of crisis,</v>

322
00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:09.100
it should not be thought that they didn't have time for religious controversies

323
00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.710
in the seventh century.

324
00:23:12.711 --> 00:23:17.711
The big controversies continued to be those related to the natures of Christ.

325
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:23.110
Even though the territories that were Manasseh site had been taken by Islam,

326
00:23:25.611 --> 00:23:27.990
or at least the most monopolies side territories,

327
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:34.070
there's still are controversies trying to compromise this question of does

328
00:23:34.071 --> 00:23:38.330
Christ have one or two natures?
How if he has two natures,

329
00:23:38.331 --> 00:23:42.830
are these two related rather than saying he has two natures,

330
00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:48.560
the emperor's proposed to possible solutions.

331
00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:50.990
<v 1>Okay.</v>

332
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:53.900
<v 0>Christ is both God and a human,</v>

333
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:57.140
but he's got one energy on our end.

334
00:23:57.141 --> 00:24:02.141
Urge ASM or maybe he's both God and man,

335
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.980
but he's got

336
00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:08.243
<v 1>one will</v>

337
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:12.870
Monteith elitism.

338
00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.850
<v 0>The emperors in the seventh century tried to impose Mano,</v>

339
00:24:29.851 --> 00:24:34.851
Fella Tism or tried to impose Monteith elitism and then prohibit discussion or

340
00:24:36.181 --> 00:24:39.320
just prohibit discussion about it.
Uh,

341
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:43.580
the papacy was adamant in upholding the um,

342
00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.620
uh,
uh,
two natures

343
00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.170
and um,
uh,
two natures,

344
00:24:52.171 --> 00:24:55.260
one person and this,
this,
this eventually won.

345
00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:59.880
But a huge amount of energy was expended in this controversy.

346
00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:03.560
And in the eighth and early ninth centuries,
um,
uh,

347
00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:08.730
we then have iconoclasm which as we've spoken about is the prohibition on the

348
00:25:10.471 --> 00:25:13.980
worship of icons.
Icons again,

349
00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:19.040
are a form of religious art that remains characteristic of the eastern church.

350
00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:26.360
And the difference between icons and other forms of religious art is that

351
00:25:26.851 --> 00:25:27.840
they're portable.

352
00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:32.780
You can carry them around and they,
um,

353
00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:35.850
are non narrative.
They don't tell a story.

354
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.300
So an icon doesn't have,
you know,

355
00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:44.330
a depiction of the annunciation or a depiction of events.

356
00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:47.610
They don't come in series showing,
for example,

357
00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:51.890
the life of a saint or the um,
uh,

358
00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:56.160
life of the Virgin.
They are a single depiction.

359
00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:58.650
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

360
00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.340
<v 0>The iconoclasts we're worried about this as a form of idolatry.</v>

361
00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:07.850
We're not sure where this concern came from.
Eh,

362
00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:13.280
there is no evidence that it comes directly as a reaction to Islamic or Jewish

363
00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:14.910
criticism.

364
00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:19.910
Although of course Islam and Judaism patrol the frontier against idol worship or

365
00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:25.530
image worship much more severely than does Christianity.

366
00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:27.790
<v 1>Okay.</v>

367
00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.460
<v 0>It does seem to be a reaction to the crisis.</v>

368
00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:35.490
It does seem to be part of an effort to re make Byzantium into what I guess now

369
00:26:38.231 --> 00:26:39.970
would be called a leaner,

370
00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:45.210
more adroit responsive or that a obnoxious business word.

371
00:26:46.801 --> 00:26:47.191
Now,

372
00:26:47.191 --> 00:26:52.191
what robust a robust response to the crisis imposed by Islam.

373
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.320
Certainly it has something to do with that.

374
00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:56.913
<v 1>Okay.</v>

375
00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:02.710
<v 0>But what it really shows us is the role of the emperor in religion.</v>

376
00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:12.130
The role of the secular ruler in the West is not as extensive.

377
00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:15.950
Even as we will see soon under Charlemagne,

378
00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:22.030
remember Clo tar and his attempts to dictate religious doctrine to Gregory of

379
00:27:22.671 --> 00:27:26.750
tour.
Who scared though he is of Clo tar basically laughs at him

380
00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:33.250
that shows a ruler who does not really have control at least over the doctrine

381
00:27:33.861 --> 00:27:38.180
of his church.
Even if he's got a lot of control over the wealth of the church,

382
00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:43.480
the western tradition would tend to separate out ruler of the state and Ruler of

383
00:27:46.551 --> 00:27:50.030
doctrine.
The east less so.

384
00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:53.900
This is partly just the way,
uh,

385
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:57.230
the patriarch of Constantinople is situated.

386
00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:02.380
He's right next to the palace of the emperor and so can be intimidated by the

387
00:28:02.571 --> 00:28:03.404
emperor.

388
00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:10.030
It is in the tradition of the Orthodox Church that there is less resistance to

389
00:28:10.791 --> 00:28:12.920
state authority.
I'm a part of the church.

390
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:17.560
More collaboration with state authority,
uh,
and um,

391
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:19.730
less controversy.

392
00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:25.390
Vaneen this is the way it's normally taught is that the emperor functions kind

393
00:28:25.881 --> 00:28:30.770
of like the pope in the West.
The emperor defines doctrine,

394
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:36.310
but actually however much difference is paid to the emperor and however much the

395
00:28:36.861 --> 00:28:41.780
emperor tries to define doctrine,
the real story,

396
00:28:41.781 --> 00:28:46.160
certainly four hour period is of the lack of success of the emperors.

397
00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:51.490
The emperor's constantly come down on the wrong side or come up with compromises

398
00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:56.450
or doctrines that don't work.

399
00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:04.420
They propose what in a sense seems like a rational compromise over

400
00:29:04.431 --> 00:29:07.430
monophysitism.
But theology doesn't work that way.

401
00:29:07.431 --> 00:29:10.820
Just because you come up with a compromise doesn't mean everybody's going to

402
00:29:10.821 --> 00:29:15.200
accept it.
In fact,
often compromises mean that nobody accepts it.

403
00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:20.800
It's not,
you know,
like a negotiation over,
uh,
you know,

404
00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:25.070
political trade offs.
This is,
uh,
a theological truth.

405
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:30.560
So the is then create their own theological position.

406
00:29:30.561 --> 00:29:34.070
ICONOCLASM is very much an imperial demand.

407
00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:37.850
And for time they succeed in imposing it.

408
00:29:37.851 --> 00:29:41.470
They succeeded in imposing it for 120 years off and on.

409
00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.740
Sometimes there'll be an emperor who is a moderate iconoclast,

410
00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:49.980
but let's the icons come back.
Sometimes there's an emperor's,
a moderate icon.
Oh,

411
00:29:49.981 --> 00:29:52.660
dual or a of file.
Um,

412
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:58.780
but the emperors,
Ethan in the East,

413
00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.930
even where the emperor is so heavily involved in religion,

414
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:06.760
have limitations on their bill ability to define doctrines.
Nevertheless,

415
00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:11.820
clearly they are the leaders of a besieged people who sees itself both as

416
00:30:11.861 --> 00:30:16.120
Christians against,
uh,
uh,
pagans or Muslims,

417
00:30:16.121 --> 00:30:20.560
or at least a infidels,
uh,
and as a,

418
00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:24.700
um,
you know,
as a religious people and as a secular population.

419
00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:35.280
So with all of these crises,
sieges,

420
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:41.130
uh,
invaders,
how did the empire survive?

421
00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:46.070
We can see some of the plans of the emperors.

422
00:30:46.071 --> 00:30:51.071
One plan was simply to get out of Constantinople and rebuild a kind of a western

423
00:30:52.491 --> 00:30:55.610
empire based in the West.
So constants,

424
00:30:55.620 --> 00:31:00.620
the second you'll remember I said in six 61 moved his capital to Syracuse in

425
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:04.010
Sicily,
a,

426
00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:09.100
this was intended in part to guard the possessions in Italy and in part to hold

427
00:31:09.651 --> 00:31:14.420
on to North Africa.
Contents was murdered in his bath.
In six 68,

428
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:19.520
the capital was moved back to Constantinople.
And within 30 years,

429
00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:22.490
all of North Africa had been lost to the Arabs.

430
00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:27.080
And you start to get the shape of the empire,
uh,

431
00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.530
to resemble that of the map.

432
00:31:28.531 --> 00:31:33.470
But we looked at last that have 1000 a Balkan Anatolian empire.

433
00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.280
<v 1>Okay.</v>

434
00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.470
<v 0>Constance is very important though,</v>

435
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:43.500
even though his plans come to not because it seems to be under his reign,

436
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:48.130
not exclusively,
but very much forwarded by him,
uh,

437
00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:52.750
that two things develop that are crucial for Byzantine success.

438
00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:57.990
One is the practice of deporting whole peoples and settling them on new lands.

439
00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:02.230
This extremely brutal practice.

440
00:32:02.231 --> 00:32:07.231
You can imagine what it's like at any time forces as practiced a considerable

441
00:32:09.461 --> 00:32:10.390
amount.
For example,

442
00:32:10.391 --> 00:32:13.830
in the former Soviet Union where you just tell people to get up and you're going

443
00:32:13.831 --> 00:32:15.520
to move them 2000 miles away,

444
00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:18.730
they're going to have better opportunities there now,
whatever.

445
00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:20.890
But in the meantime,
some of them are going to starve.

446
00:32:20.891 --> 00:32:22.930
Many of them are going to falter disease.
Uh,

447
00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:27.960
this is a brutal kind of transporting of peoples manipulation of people's from

448
00:32:29.111 --> 00:32:32.530
one area to another.
The People's manipulated.
In this case,

449
00:32:32.531 --> 00:32:37.531
we're often Slavic prisoners or groups taken over as the empire expanded and

450
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:45.040
often sent to Anatolia to resettle lands that had been deserted in the Arab

451
00:32:46.041 --> 00:32:49.130
invasions and now seized back from the errands.

452
00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:54.970
This policy against what one might expect actually seems to work to the extent

453
00:32:57.110 --> 00:33:02.110
that it does increase the population of these key frontier regions in the east

454
00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:09.080
with militarized forces transported,

455
00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.940
uh,
from the Balkans

456
00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:17.650
related to this is the Organization of the army by locality instead of as a

457
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:23.630
mobile and very large force.

458
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:26.960
And this is related to the problems of paying the army.

459
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:30.230
As far back as the beginning of the course,

460
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:35.000
we said that a lot of imperial policy just as that it's just true of the state

461
00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:38.540
today is dictated by the need to pay for trips.

462
00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:42.260
The most expensive thing that most states,

463
00:33:42.261 --> 00:33:47.261
including the United States does is maintain an army and use it

464
00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.440
for a number of reasons.
This is just a very,

465
00:33:51.441 --> 00:33:55.340
very expensive thing and clearly a necessary thing.

466
00:33:55.341 --> 00:34:00.341
Something that is not easy to dispense with Diocletian's reforms.

467
00:34:02.631 --> 00:34:03.081
Indeed,

468
00:34:03.081 --> 00:34:08.081
the whole restructuring of the empire in the late third century and early fourth

469
00:34:08.151 --> 00:34:12.410
century was oriented around increasing the size of the army,

470
00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:16.940
basically doubling it and figuring out a tax regime to pay for it.

471
00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:22.640
This no longer works in the post Justinian panic world.

472
00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:27.670
In the crucial era here and beyond because the state does not have enough money

473
00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:33.350
to pay these.
It does not have a tax base.

474
00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:38.590
It cannot raise the money for a large army to operate in the Balkans and to

475
00:34:39.621 --> 00:34:44.390
oppose the Arabs without the tax revenues from its richest province,

476
00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:49.630
Egypt and from other very wealthy and important provinces such as Syria.

477
00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:54.260
How then is it going to have an army at all?

478
00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:59.330
To some extent it is going to do this by um,

479
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:03.170
creating local armies,

480
00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:07.790
paid for not so much by money as by,
um,

481
00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:12.380
kind that is to say grain leather,

482
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:17.510
uh,
weapons and things manufactured locally,
harvested locally,

483
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:20.000
and that stay locally.

484
00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:24.080
This is the so called theme system.

485
00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:29.800
And Wickham doesn't talk too much about it because historians are in the process

486
00:35:30.951 --> 00:35:32.810
of drawing back from this.

487
00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:36.410
This is one of those frustrating things about progress in history.

488
00:35:36.411 --> 00:35:41.411
A lot of in history is the dismantling of convenient kinds of a formula.

489
00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:46.800
So when I started teaching this,
the themes were everything.

490
00:35:46.801 --> 00:35:50.550
I would've spent 60% of this lecture talking about the themes.

491
00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.450
It's a situation and how it saved the Byzantine Empire,

492
00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:59.490
the themes look like soldiers who are peasants.

493
00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.350
In other words,
to some extent the,
uh,

494
00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.460
the deal that's offered to these troops is,
uh,

495
00:36:05.461 --> 00:36:09.420
we will give you land and we will allow you to keep most of what you produce

496
00:36:09.421 --> 00:36:12.060
rather than paying it as tribute to a landlord.

497
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:14.600
But you've gotta be willing to fight for it and you've got to,
oh,

498
00:36:14.601 --> 00:36:17.730
military service,
you've got to be ready for military service.

499
00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:21.750
And indeed the land was often in places that were dangerous places that we're

500
00:36:21.751 --> 00:36:25.920
liable to invasion.
This is to some extent true,

501
00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:27.480
but um,

502
00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:33.450
it's a little less of a kind of homestead act deal.

503
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:38.370
If you look at,
um,
map number three,
year 1000,

504
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:38.800
uh,

505
00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:43.800
see the things that are in italic capital's like [inaudible] are many icon on a

506
00:36:44.761 --> 00:36:47.960
telecon.
These are themes.

507
00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:52.080
They are large agglomerations of provinces.

508
00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:56.940
They are what might be called military provinces.
And as such,

509
00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:00.780
they combine civilian and military rule.

510
00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:04.440
The empire is now divided into military provinces.

511
00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:08.880
Nothing terribly new about that.
Even though the shape and the size is different,

512
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:14.150
what's new is that rather than the revenue being raised in cash from taxes,

513
00:37:14.581 --> 00:37:18.750
paid all over the empire and then transported to Constantinople and then

514
00:37:18.751 --> 00:37:23.310
disbursed to mercenaries or two,
I'm standing armies,

515
00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:28.620
the money that's raised in the obstacle on tends to stay in the up sick.

516
00:37:28.621 --> 00:37:29.400
He,

517
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:34.400
these provinces tend to be responsible for their soldiers and for paying their

518
00:37:36.601 --> 00:37:40.170
soldiers.
The state is very heavily involved.

519
00:37:40.171 --> 00:37:43.320
This is not a militia in the sense of,
you know,

520
00:37:43.321 --> 00:37:46.170
a bunch of trustee guys getting their muskets or whatever.

521
00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:48.990
They used a off the wall.
This is not,
you know,

522
00:37:48.991 --> 00:37:50.760
Paul revere or something like that,

523
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:56.330
but it is an army that is closer to the population and in which the male

524
00:37:59.821 --> 00:38:04.821
population is largely involved in the military forces.

525
00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:09.270
Uh,
another word that I don't particularly care for and it's monitoring use

526
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:10.550
stakeholder.

527
00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:14.130
They're stakeholders in the sense that it makes a big difference to them.

528
00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:16.440
They're not just civilians.
In this case,

529
00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:20.100
this is then a militarization of society.

530
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
It is a new way of paying for things in an economy that is less,

531
00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:28.250
uh,

532
00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:32.820
productive of revenues at least of taxable revenues.

533
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:38.020
Uh,
and it is above all,
uh,

534
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:39.790
whatever its exact nature,

535
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:45.030
an innovation that works the basis for this expansion that takes place after

536
00:38:47.711 --> 00:38:52.420
eight 43 and indeed for the stabilization of the frontiers that proceeds,

537
00:38:52.421 --> 00:38:56.480
that is,
uh,
a reorganization of the army,
uh,

538
00:38:56.650 --> 00:39:00.710
the theme system,
a reorganization of revenues,
uh,

539
00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:05.080
and they kind of strategic plan to define the Byzantine Empire,

540
00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:06.100
uh,

541
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:11.100
in a way that is ultimately about feasible and defensible.

542
00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:13.523
<v 1>Okay.</v>

543
00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:18.570
<v 0>From seven 17 to eight 43 B empire recovers slowly.</v>

544
00:39:18.671 --> 00:39:22.180
We choose eight 43 because that's the end of the iconic class controversy.

545
00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:28.090
The empire continued to have to fight on both fronts against the Arabs and the

546
00:39:28.091 --> 00:39:28.924
Bulger's,

547
00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:34.590
but it had a viable state of viable military structure and some capable,

548
00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:39.070
uh,
emperors.
After eight 43,

549
00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:44.160
we see a real rebirth and expansion from eight 43 to 1000 about the empire grew

550
00:39:47.231 --> 00:39:50.860
by about one third.
Even though that map,

551
00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:55.120
the third one for the year,
1000 doesn't seem very imposing.

552
00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:56.890
If you take a look at it,

553
00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:02.040
you'll see that it's frontiers with Islam are much more secure than they have

554
00:40:03.491 --> 00:40:04.324
been before.

555
00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:09.780
The empire extends eastward as far as Armenia for a long time,

556
00:40:11.111 --> 00:40:12.550
a frontier province,

557
00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:18.610
and it is a,
are on the borders of Syria.

558
00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:23.080
It has the great city of Antioch.
Again,
it has all of Anatolia.

559
00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.690
It has the islands of Cypress and creed,

560
00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:29.290
which had been occupied by Islamic forces for years.

561
00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:34.960
It has control over all of modern Greece and uh,

562
00:40:34.961 --> 00:40:37.660
has held onto some possessions in Adelaide.

563
00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:43.460
This is an era of great splendor ceremony.

564
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:46.340
The restoration of education and of learning.

565
00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:55.210
The Bulger's will be defeated definitively by 10,
19.

566
00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:00.160
Constantinople would be besieged by them twice,

567
00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:03.760
can't have a century without a couple of seizures of Constantinople.

568
00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:10.290
The opposites are defeated.
And the expansion of the Byzantine Empire,
as you see,

569
00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:10.830
uh,

570
00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:15.450
as far south as modern Lebanon and as far east as modern Armenia,

571
00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:18.120
well,
historic Armenian,

572
00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:29.890
this is a society that is still involved in religious controversy.

573
00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:36.990
This is the,
uh,
uh,
in the ninth century with the,
uh,

574
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:38.780
Carolyn's ends.

575
00:41:38.781 --> 00:41:43.781
There would be a controversy over the Holy Ghost in relation to the son and the

576
00:41:45.261 --> 00:41:47.730
father,
the so called Philly Oakway controversy.

577
00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:50.633
<v 1>Okay.</v>

578
00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:54.760
<v 0>But it is a world of great energy,</v>

579
00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:56.530
artistic,

580
00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:02.030
cultural and actually religious.

581
00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:06.560
Perhaps the most lasting and significant accomplishment of this era is the

582
00:42:06.561 --> 00:42:11.240
conversion of the Slavs and the conversion of much of eastern Europe

583
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:20.710
conversion to what would become the Orthodox as opposed to Catholic form of

584
00:42:20.721 --> 00:42:21.620
Christianity.

585
00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:26.630
The official split between the Orthodox world and the Catholic world won't occur

586
00:42:26.631 --> 00:42:29.660
until 10 54.
In 10 54,

587
00:42:29.661 --> 00:42:33.350
the patriarch of Constantinople excommunicated the pope and the pope

588
00:42:33.351 --> 00:42:37.520
excommunicated the patriarch of Constantinople.
I think they've taken it back,

589
00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:41.670
but obviously the churches are not joined.
Um,

590
00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:46.220
they have differences already,
however,

591
00:42:46.221 --> 00:42:51.010
that are visible in the ninth and 10th centuries.
Um,

592
00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:54.890
orthodoxy is less politically centralized,

593
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.740
<v 1>okay?</v>

594
00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:00.130
<v 0>If,
as we just said,
it's very dependent on the ruler.</v>

595
00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:04.660
If the ruler is different than the church has a sort of national identity.

596
00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:08.680
Thus there is no pope in the Orthodox church.

597
00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:13.980
The Bulgarian Orthodox Greek Orthodox Russian Orthodox are,

598
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.320
um,
uh,

599
00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:21.280
essentially form a confederation under their own patriarchs.

600
00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:23.860
They also have their own languages.

601
00:43:23.861 --> 00:43:28.861
The Bible could be translated into vernacular and the liturgy was,

602
00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:33.310
um,
not in one language necessarily.

603
00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.860
So Slavonic,
uh,

604
00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:39.970
the sort of ancestor of modern Slavic languages would be instituted as the

605
00:43:39.971 --> 00:43:43.240
liturgy in many of these,
uh,
converted places.

606
00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:47.050
Priests are allowed to marry in the Orthodox Church.

607
00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:54.530
Uh,
there are just sort of questions of style.
For example,

608
00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:59.720
the Orthodox Church,
even when it has admitted icons back,
does not have statues,

609
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:03.740
does not have three dimensional statues.
Where's the Catholic world?
Of course.

610
00:44:03.741 --> 00:44:08.270
Does think of,
uh,
you know,
um,
uh,
Notredame of Paris,

611
00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:13.580
uh,
and it's sculptural program or shark or the,
uh,
you know,

612
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:17.790
uh,
Michelangelo and Bernini Sacred Sculptures.
Uh,

613
00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:21.320
this is partly because while icons are okay because they're two dimensional

614
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:23.600
statues were thought of as being too much,

615
00:44:23.601 --> 00:44:28.340
like the idols denounced again and again by the Old Testament.
Um,

616
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:32.570
Greek Orthodox priests have beards,
a Catholic priests down.

617
00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:43.480
They're different styles of worship.
In Orthodox churches,
you stand,
you don't,

618
00:44:43.481 --> 00:44:44.480
there aren't seats.

619
00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.710
Some of this is style.
Some of this is theology.
Some of this is just culture.

620
00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:55.750
But of course,
this would remain,

621
00:44:55.751 --> 00:45:00.490
which would be in the ninth century and remain a very strong difference.

622
00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:05.640
So you can see that those countries converted by the Catholics have a Latin

623
00:45:06.011 --> 00:45:11.011
liturgy and a Western or Latin or Roman orientation.

624
00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:15.340
Poland is Catholic.
Russia on the other hand,

625
00:45:15.341 --> 00:45:19.880
would be converted to a Byzantine Christianity.
Uh,

626
00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.830
the division is clear and,
uh,
um,

627
00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:26.260
unfortunately tragic in the former Yugoslavia,

628
00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:31.060
Serbian and Croatian are almost the same language.

629
00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:35.020
Serbian is written in Currituck,
Croatian in Roman,

630
00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:40.060
the Croatians or Catholics,
the Serbians are Orthodox,
um,

631
00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:43.250
their hatred for each other.
Uh,

632
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:48.120
and then of course the complication of having an Islamic people.
The Bosnians,
uh,

633
00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:49.720
was,
uh,
um,

634
00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:54.990
be background to the tragic Yugoslav civil war of the early 1,909 days.

635
00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:59.590
So these religious boundaries,

636
00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:03.790
which sort of correspond to ethnic boundaries,

637
00:46:03.791 --> 00:46:08.080
even though those ethnic definitions are themselves invented to some extent,

638
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:13.150
these religious boundaries continued to be very meaningful and to define culture

639
00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:14.013
in Europe.

640
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:21.950
The conversion of this world is then one of the most important events of the

641
00:46:23.161 --> 00:46:25.320
renascent Byzantine Empire,

642
00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:29.730
the coronation of the king of Russia,

643
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:31.560
King of Kevin Russia.

644
00:46:31.561 --> 00:46:35.850
In nine 89 at chairperson on the Crimean Peninsula,

645
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:40.740
uh,
presided over by emissaries of the Byzantine Empire.

646
00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.950
Emperor is one symbol of this,

647
00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:50.130
the conversion of the bulk.
Ours,
the conversion of,

648
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:54.090
uh,
many of the peoples of the Balkans.

649
00:46:55.200 --> 00:47:00.200
And indeed there is a kind of aftermath of Byzantine civilization.

650
00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:06.200
The closest heir to the eastern Roman empire is the Russian empire.

651
00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:11.670
They'll look of orthodox worship,

652
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:16.740
the look of the Russian churches,
uh,
the icons,

653
00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:21.360
the gold,
the imperial style,
um,

654
00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:23.340
is,
uh,
uh,

655
00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:28.460
very closely related self-consciously to the model established by the Byzantine

656
00:47:28.591 --> 00:47:33.220
emperors.
Indeed,
in the 16th century after the fall of Constantinople,

657
00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:35.450
uh,
Russian,
uh,

658
00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:39.160
monks claimed that there had been three rounds.

659
00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:44.320
The roam of the West,
the original 100 fallen in the fifth century.

660
00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:49.810
The great eastern Rome bat of Constantinople had fallen in the 15th.

661
00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:54.000
And the third realm was Moscow.
Um,

662
00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:58.350
I don't think that outside of the Russian orbit,

663
00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:03.570
most people think of Bosco as the third Rome for a number of reasons,

664
00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:04.031
uh,

665
00:48:04.031 --> 00:48:09.031
whatever its power and its own form of splendor.

666
00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:14.340
But the degree to which Russia in its history is the heir to the world that we

667
00:48:15.521 --> 00:48:17.470
have briefly described,
uh,

668
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:22.390
cannot be denied even if to some extent it is a self formed or self conscious

669
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:23.650
manifestation.

670
00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:28.090
Moving from Byzantium on Wednesday,

671
00:48:28.091 --> 00:48:33.091
we will come back to friendly old Frank Kia and discuss the rise and

672
00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:38.080
efflorescence of the Carolingian.
Thanks.
