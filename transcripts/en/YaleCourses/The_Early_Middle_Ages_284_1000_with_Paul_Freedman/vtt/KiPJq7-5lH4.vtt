1
00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.790
All right.
So you may be asking yourself,

2
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:08.220
why are we reading the confessions?

3
00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:13.020
I think I gave a preliminary answer before,
but um,

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.490
since it seems to be perhaps more appropriate for religious studies or

5
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:23.940
philosophy.
Let me remind you why we're struggling through this.

6
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.220
First,
the impact of Christianity on the Roman Empire.

7
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.320
That is to say the sort of social and intellectual setting of the rise of

8
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:41.080
Christianity in the late fourth,
early fifth century.

9
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.900
The second is,
uh,

10
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.930
to understand some of the Christian moral and doc tank trinal problems and their

11
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.640
implications.
Once again,

12
00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:58.020
we're not exactly interested in these for reasons of theology or morality,

13
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.260
but we need to get into the minds of people at the time in order to understand

14
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.610
what bothered them,
what controversies they were involved in,

15
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.050
how those controversies indeed divided the Roman Empire and the successors to

16
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:18.150
the Roman Empire.
Some of those problems,

17
00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:22.970
well under the know that second heading of Christian moral and doctrinal

18
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.240
problems.
Uh,
let me just mention three,
which by no means exhausts them,

19
00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:31.710
but our three that we can sort of,
if not identify with,

20
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.500
I think see their importance.
One,

21
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.470
the problem of evil.
Second,

22
00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:43.230
the relation between body and soul.

23
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.443
<v 1>Okay.</v>

24
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.630
<v 0>And three,
the Christian Understanding of sin and redemption.</v>

25
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.040
Now it turns out these are all aspects of the same problem

26
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.800
and they are dealt with in Augustine's works most thoroughly,

27
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.350
more thoroughly than any other thinker of the ancient world.

28
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.370
The third reason we're looking at this is the interaction between Christianity

29
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.010
and classical culture and religion,

30
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.890
Roman life and politics,
Augustine's career.

31
00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:26.280
And he's giving up his career what that means.
Uh,

32
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.050
other ideas within the Roman empire such as [inaudible],
Platonism.

33
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.030
And then finally,

34
00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:38.031
this is a document of philosophical and psychological investigation.

35
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.890
And while that is not our primary purpose here,
uh,

36
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.550
you should not get out of a liberal arts college program without reading this

37
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.020
and pondering it a little.
This,
uh,

38
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.650
can be summarized in terms of the importance of the humanities even or of

39
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.180
philosophical investigation as opposed to mere investigation of natural

40
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:07.600
phenomena in words that Augustine uses in book 10,

41
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:10.750
which we have not read after book nine.

42
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:13.240
Book 10 is a turning.

43
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.710
It discusses time and the meaning of time.
Books.
11,

44
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:22.711
12 and 13 are a commentary on genesis worth reading.

45
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.770
Uh,

46
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.770
if you like an interesting to think about how they do or do not mesh with the

47
00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:34.440
more confessional parts of the confession.
But in book 10,
he says,
um,

48
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.560
men go out and gays in astonishment at high mountains,

49
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.940
the huge waves of the sea,
the broad reaches of rivers,

50
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.420
the ocean that in circles the world or the stars in their courses,

51
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.730
but they pay no attention to themselves.

52
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.500
They are busy looking at external phenomena and not examining their own heart.

53
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.450
And if the confessions is anything,

54
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.400
it is certainly an examination of the authors heart,

55
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.010
but it's not an examination of his heart in a purely emotional sense in the way

56
00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:21.400
we're familiar with in so-called confessional literature.

57
00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:25.750
I had a tough upbringing.
This happened to me,
that happened to me.
Uh,

58
00:04:25.751 --> 00:04:29.440
I struggled with addiction.
I,
uh,
you know,
beat my kids.

59
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:32.530
Now I'm a great person.
Uh,
whatever.
Uh,

60
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.760
this is an intellectual investigation as well as an emotional investigation.

61
00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:37.271
And indeed,

62
00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:42.271
Augustine doesn't see these as separate or to the degree that he does.

63
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.550
It's in a more complicated way than just saying intellectual versus not an

64
00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:48.100
intellectual.
He is an intellectual obviously,

65
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.940
and he awakened to being an intellectual experience that many of you may have

66
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:58.630
had member.
He reads this dialogue by Cicero now lost,

67
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.100
called the Hortencia's.

68
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.820
And this convinces him that the life of the mind is the most important thing to

69
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:11.350
pursue.
And I wouldn't say that we all have had this experience,

70
00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:14.560
but maybe,
uh,
you,

71
00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:17.770
what was the point at which you discovered that you weren't like other people

72
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.460
but they lived more for immediate sensations or pleasure or what Augustine would

73
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:26.130
call debauchery,
uh,

74
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.150
and you wanted to read or think about stuff or,
uh,
you know,
uh,

75
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.770
do lab experiments.
I think the essence of Yale,

76
00:05:35.771 --> 00:05:37.300
if I understand it correctly,

77
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.330
is I don't have to choose between fun and the intellectual life,

78
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.560
but,
um,

79
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.210
so it's not actually perhaps relevant to your lives now,
but,

80
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.620
uh,
particularly if you went to a public high school,

81
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.170
grew up in a non intellectual environment,
uh,
you know,

82
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.250
those of you whose parents are professors and I went to some school where,

83
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.360
you know,
everybody was reading Latin at the age of six.
I'm not talking to you,

84
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.100
but I'm talking to the vast majority who woke up one day and realized,

85
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.330
uh,
either with pride or with dismay,

86
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.290
I'm different from other people.
Ideas have meaning to me.
Ah,

87
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:20.890
I'm going to suffer in life for that though.

88
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.660
They're going to be some rewards and I leave you to discern what the rewards are

89
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:32.000
and to mull over what the suffering has been.
Or maybe we'll continue to be,

90
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:36.170
I hope not.
Uh,
and I suspect,
um,
you'll have an easier time of it.

91
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:42.070
But this book is about a search for truth and they searched the,

92
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:47.750
takes a number of,
um,
wrong turns,

93
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:49.910
at least from Augustine's opinion.

94
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.320
Looking back on the situation when he wrote this in the three,
nine days.

95
00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:00.320
It's a confession of sin.
It's also,
as I said before,

96
00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:05.321
a confession of praise for the God who is love directed him back to the right

97
00:07:07.881 --> 00:07:11.120
path.
It is personal but exemplary.

98
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.630
It is about spiritual yearning,

99
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:20.050
but it is also about intellectual yearning for truth.

100
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:23.243
<v 1>Okay?</v>

101
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:28.100
<v 0>It's a book about the education of a young man and the adventures of this young</v>

102
00:07:28.101 --> 00:07:32.000
man and what he learns from them.

103
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.070
Now in the first place,

104
00:07:37.071 --> 00:07:40.310
he is both an intellectual and a passionate person.

105
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.400
He is someone who is a unusually frank about his desires,

106
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:52.930
but notice that he's not just opposed to desire.

107
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.740
He is not someone who believes that desire,
love,

108
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:02.870
uh,
are to be simply repressed or ignored.

109
00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.830
Love is a psychological need.
And he has a very discerning,

110
00:08:07.831 --> 00:08:12.831
an interesting passage in describing his teenage years and his lusts.

111
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:18.040
Uh,
when he,
um,
uh,
uh,
uh,

112
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:23.130
frequented the Bravos of Carthage in book three,

113
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.010
at the beginning,
he says,

114
00:08:26.011 --> 00:08:30.900
I was in love with the idea of love.
She was not only in love,

115
00:08:30.901 --> 00:08:35.901
but he was in love with the idea of being an emotional being of a love that is

116
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.530
both sexual and spiritual in which they're in.

117
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:46.640
These two things are not well marked off from each other.

118
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:53.370
He is also a believer in friendship.
And it's funny because in our own culture,

119
00:08:53.371 --> 00:08:57.300
I think friendship has changed.
Uh,
when I started teaching,

120
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:03.410
people had trouble dealing with the affection that he has for his friends,

121
00:09:03.661 --> 00:09:08.661
like Olympias and the Bredius or the mysterious unnamed friend who dies after

122
00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:13.980
being baptized.
Uh,
Augustine is always surrounded by friends.

123
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.520
Even in the most intimate moments when he's undergoing this conversion.

124
00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:21.750
There are all sorts of people right around him.
Uh,
and as I said before,

125
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:23.970
this seemed to be,
I mean,
the explanation was,
well,

126
00:09:23.971 --> 00:09:27.630
he must've been homosexual or any young,
you must have these,
uh,
these desires.

127
00:09:27.631 --> 00:09:32.070
Or maybe it's part of Roman culture of friendship.
But,
uh,

128
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.840
in recent decades or years where we have a culture of friendship where your

129
00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:41.710
friends are extremely important,
admittedly,
if you have 900 of them,
uh,
uh,

130
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.370
it's a little bit perhaps weekend.

131
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:49.610
But I think we can understand some of this better than might have been the case

132
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:54.270
a little while ago.
This friend who dies,
uh,

133
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:59.540
after being baptized here is an example of another form of seriousness.

134
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.040
Uh,
they go out and have fun together.
The friend becomes ill,

135
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.080
the friend is suddenly very serious.

136
00:10:07.081 --> 00:10:12.081
The friend gets baptized because to be baptized as with Constantine means that

137
00:10:13.411 --> 00:10:18.411
you are committing yourself to a much more stringent and moral life then,

138
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:21.540
uh,
before

139
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:27.540
and then he dies and there's certainly disturbs.
Augustine.

140
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:34.630
What,
what is life all about?
Any of you who've had the experience of,
uh,

141
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.010
contemporaries of yours who have died,
uh,
will understand this.

142
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.270
Augustine's is also ambitious.

143
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:46.230
He is a successful person even though he's from a modest family.

144
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.440
His father,
a,
um,

145
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:54.030
a pagan or non Christian,
um,
middle class,

146
00:10:54.031 --> 00:10:58.800
a official of North Africa,
his mother,
a Christian,

147
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:04.850
he's clearly marked for success because of his unusual gifts is unusual gifts

148
00:11:04.861 --> 00:11:08.630
being a intellectual ability to write,

149
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.140
the ability to argue.

150
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:15.420
He's marked out as extremely smart.
And at that time,

151
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:19.980
success,
uh,
for such a person,

152
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.030
the course of success was through government service.

153
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:28.530
This is the era of post Diocletian Post Constantine.
Um,

154
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:33.620
and related particularly to a combination of rhetoric and law says not all that

155
00:11:34.951 --> 00:11:37.320
different from society's familiar to us.

156
00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:42.810
That is to say the training and law gives one access to a number of different

157
00:11:42.811 --> 00:11:47.760
kinds of political offices,
but rhetoric is perhaps a little stranger to us.

158
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:52.350
Rhetoric in this context means the art of persuasion.

159
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:56.470
So it's very closely related to law and legal pleading.

160
00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:01.770
It is the art of writing well of writing elegantly and it is very,

161
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:06.700
very highly valued in the Roman empire.

162
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:14.510
His mother,
Monica is extremely pious.

163
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:19.970
In fact,
the first section of class rather than I taught,

164
00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:22.430
um,
no,

165
00:12:22.431 --> 00:12:26.480
I guess I was a section leader right when I was a graduate student.
The first,

166
00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.790
the first section I had,
um,

167
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:33.140
my students were arguing with me about Augustine's patronizing attitude towards

168
00:12:33.141 --> 00:12:36.800
his mother.
And I said,
well,
no,
you know,
he's not patronizing.
He's,
you know,

169
00:12:36.801 --> 00:12:40.910
he's smarter than his mother.
And,
uh,
um,
he's,
uh,
you know,
he's gone.

170
00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:42.920
His mother is just an ordinary person.
After all,

171
00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:47.290
Augustine becomes a saint and his mother doesn't attend.
Uh,
uh,
you know,

172
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:52.150
a guy from Santa Monica Catholic school,
uh,
uh,
sending,
Oh,

173
00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:56.420
who do you think Santa Monica is?
Um,
this is Augustine's mother.

174
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.330
So anyway,
I've learned,
uh,

175
00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:04.550
Augustine's mother is saying she is a more steadfast kind of person than August

176
00:13:04.551 --> 00:13:08.510
and he's not someone who stays up all night wrestling with the problem of evil.

177
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:12.080
Nevertheless,
she does not want him to be baptized.

178
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.080
She wants him to be successful.
Like most mothers,

179
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:19.280
she wants her child to be a good person,
but even more than that,

180
00:13:19.281 --> 00:13:21.890
she wants her child to be a success.

181
00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.360
And that means delaying baptism because if he's going to be a success,

182
00:13:26.361 --> 00:13:29.600
he's going to have to be involved in the world of high government.

183
00:13:29.601 --> 00:13:31.970
And that may mean well,
that definitely means

184
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.510
involvement in sinfulness,
uh,

185
00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:40.460
involvement in the shedding of blood involvement in legal wrangling and stuff

186
00:13:40.461 --> 00:13:42.560
like that.
And so,
um,

187
00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:47.390
he is encouraged to lead a normal life,
normal in meaning,

188
00:13:47.391 --> 00:13:52.280
at least in his own retrospective view,
sinful life.

189
00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:56.240
This is what Augustine has given up in his conversion.

190
00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:58.730
He is giving up a career.

191
00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:05.080
He is giving up a social expectation of success or social definition of success.

192
00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:14.300
He is giving up the pleasures attendant on that career,

193
00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:19.510
which range from parties to honors to sexual conquests,

194
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:22.850
uh,

195
00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:27.850
and the whole life of a well established member of the Roman elite.

196
00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.010
<v 1>Okay.</v>

197
00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:35.810
<v 0>What is bothering Augustine?</v>

198
00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:44.960
What bothers him is in part the,
um,

199
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.270
problem of evil.
We've alluded to already,

200
00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:55.690
why a good and omnipotent God allow evil to flourish?

201
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:05.980
A related problem is that compared to the works of the Greek writers and

202
00:15:11.061 --> 00:15:15.050
philosophers,
the Bible seems awfully crude to him.

203
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:20.860
Rhetorically in terms of style and conceptually in terms of its ideas.

204
00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.350
Be Old Testament God.
And you know,

205
00:15:24.351 --> 00:15:28.430
we're probably at various levels of familiarity with the Old Testament,

206
00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:33.920
but the old testament God is,
um,
temperamental.

207
00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:38.210
I think it's fair to say,
here's the guy who decides to destroy God,

208
00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.810
a deity who does strives to destroy the world by flood,

209
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:46.730
uh,
destroys the cities of the plain,

210
00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.100
um,

211
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:55.150
kills one of the people bearing the a tabernacle back to uh,

212
00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:59.970
a Jerusalem because he stumbles.
Um,

213
00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:01.940
God is this,

214
00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:06.960
this bothers Augustine and his anthropomorphism bothers Augustine in the Old

215
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:14.000
Testament,
in the Hebrew Bible of God speaks with people.

216
00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:19.220
Uh,
Adam hears him walking in the garden.
How can that be?
How can this,
uh,
um,

217
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.700
human seeming God be the Real God?

218
00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:27.700
So these two anxieties put Augustine in the camp of the mannequins member.

219
00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:32.270
The mannequins believe that the solution to the problem of evil is that God is

220
00:16:32.271 --> 00:16:35.780
not omnipotent.
God is trying,

221
00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.380
but there's another evil God who is opposing him.

222
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:44.920
And that evil God is the god of the flesh and the god of the Old Testament to

223
00:16:45.021 --> 00:16:47.900
Hova the creator God,

224
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.590
the God of matter and flesh.

225
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.730
We are souls imprisoned in flush.

226
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:59.300
Our true home is the spiritual.

227
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.600
And we have to renounce everything that has to do with the flesh in order to go

228
00:17:05.271 --> 00:17:10.270
there.
So mannequin is and would seem to be extremely ascetic.

229
00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.340
You should have absolutely nothing to do with the world.

230
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:17.060
But as is always the case with the statement,

231
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:20.900
everything that's material is evil,
but we are material.

232
00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:25.220
Mannequin aneurysm also offers or affords you an opportunity to be completely

233
00:17:25.221 --> 00:17:26.270
involved in the world,

234
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:30.110
totally involved in the world because there's nothing you can do about it.

235
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:34.220
All you can do is say the flushes evil.
I'm in the flesh.

236
00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:39.110
I'm just having to deal with it until uh,
I am liberated into the spirit.

237
00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.130
So Mannequin Ism is not necessarily world renouncing,

238
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:49.620
but they do identify the source of evil with the body.
The body is wicked.

239
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.720
The immaterial soul is good.

240
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:56.580
This is not Christianity as Augustine,
uh,

241
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:59.550
discovers or elaborates.

242
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:05.630
Even though we may think of Christianity as exalting the soul over the body.

243
00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:08.760
Nevertheless,
it also exalts the body.

244
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:13.140
The Christian doctrine is that the bodies of,

245
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.850
uh,
human beings will be resurrected,
not just the souls.

246
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:22.860
There will be bodies after the last judgment in heaven and in Hell.

247
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.030
God created the world and it was good.

248
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.150
What then explains the presence of evil.

249
00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:35.570
Augustine at this stage turns to Platonism for an understanding of the nature of

250
00:18:36.751 --> 00:18:40.380
evil.
Evil is not a thing in itself.

251
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:45.120
It is rather the absence of good.
Now,
if anyone has ever said that to you,

252
00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:49.770
you will have found that unconvincing,
at least in its first iteration,

253
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:56.780
because we're not just talking about the absence of good as in this bowl of

254
00:18:58.441 --> 00:19:02.220
Chili is not very good.
It's not very flavorful.

255
00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:06.330
It's okay,
but it's kind of lacking in something.

256
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:07.860
But that's not evil.

257
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.780
Evil is not kind of like not particularly good.

258
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:18.150
Evil is much more vivid,
gratuitous,
cruel,

259
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:19.530
all encompassing.

260
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.900
The Platonists don't deny that what they mean by saying it's the privation of

261
00:19:24.901 --> 00:19:26.850
good is that it is nothingness.

262
00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:31.830
Evil is in fact the absence of being and meaning.

263
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.620
The reason it produces such spectacular effects as war

264
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.090
oppression,
crime

265
00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:48.650
is that people turn away from the good or they turn away from what is truly good

266
00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.980
to prefer lower goods.

267
00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:00.420
They turn away from the things of the spirit to the things of the flesh.

268
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:04.470
They prefer their own lusts and desires,

269
00:20:04.471 --> 00:20:05.910
their own ambitions.

270
00:20:05.911 --> 00:20:10.911
And greed to the common good or to the immaterial and spiritual good and it's

271
00:20:12.451 --> 00:20:17.451
this turning away from the sun is turning away from good.

272
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.190
That seems to be a human problem.

273
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:27.300
Human beings,
generally speaking,

274
00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:32.370
don't understand what they are on earth for.
According to the Platonists,

275
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.860
many of you are familiar with the metaphor of the cave from the republic.

276
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:43.100
This is the classic depiction of this wrong preference.

277
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:50.210
The people in the cave are chained facing the back wall of the cave and they see

278
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.430
images of what's passing in front of the cave reflected on the wall.

279
00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:02.920
As time goes on,
they come to believe that those images are reality.

280
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.020
They forget that their chain,

281
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:09.070
they forget that they can't see the real things.

282
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.020
They forget the Sun.

283
00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:17.350
If you were to liberate them and turn them around and show them the light,

284
00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:22.630
first of all,
they couldn't bear it because they're used to the world of shadow.

285
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:23.651
Secondly,

286
00:21:23.651 --> 00:21:28.651
they kill you because you are destroying their assumptions and their world.

287
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:30.910
They would at least persecute you.

288
00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.060
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

289
00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:36.060
<v 0>they're not interested in the truth.
They're interested in getting by.</v>

290
00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:44.490
So for the Platonists evil is the result of this error in perception.

291
00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:51.300
Assuming that it's a great thing to get rich or assuming that it's a great thing

292
00:21:52.751 --> 00:21:57.610
to uh,
beat people up because you're stronger than they are,
uh,

293
00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:01.530
or it's a great thing to um,
uh,

294
00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:07.000
conquer and subjugate or all of these things,

295
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.360
some of which are evil,

296
00:22:10.361 --> 00:22:15.361
but are really the preference of things that you should not be pursuing or that

297
00:22:15.461 --> 00:22:18.910
you should be pursuing for reasons inspired by spiritual

298
00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.473
<v 1>truth.</v>

299
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:27.240
<v 0>How do you get rid of this and the Platonist imagination by education.</v>

300
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:31.650
That's the whole point of Plato's dialogues.
That's why they are dialogs.

301
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:34.830
Many of them with a kind of question and answer.

302
00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:40.230
They're very didactic.
They're like being in a class,

303
00:22:40.231 --> 00:22:44.310
Socrates quizzes people,
and then he shows the solution and they say,
Oh wow,

304
00:22:44.311 --> 00:22:46.170
software these.
Now I understand.

305
00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:51.250
Now I'm going to be a Platonist and I'm going to build a perfect society and

306
00:22:51.251 --> 00:22:52.084
live story.

307
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:53.663
<v 1>Okay?</v>

308
00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:02.020
<v 0>The important thing to understand about Platonism is that it is not dualist in</v>

309
00:23:02.021 --> 00:23:03.520
the way that mannequin ism is,

310
00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:07.000
or the way that we sort of instinctively think about evil.

311
00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:11.660
Evil is not opposed to good.
It's hierarchically inferior to good

312
00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:18.240
the Platonists universes like a ladder with many rungs going up from mud bugs,

313
00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:24.370
rocks to the immaterial one,
and with many,

314
00:23:24.371 --> 00:23:28.060
many steps.
As I said,
many runs or steps or levels in between.

315
00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:33.550
Human beings are kind of in the middle and also human beings,
unlike animals,

316
00:23:33.551 --> 00:23:34.750
mud slugs,

317
00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:40.140
but also unlike angels and Demi urges and D at Hays human beings can move up and

318
00:23:41.171 --> 00:23:45.040
down the ladder.
That's what free will is.
That's what being human,

319
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:50.390
you can read Hortencia's breed the confessions,
um,

320
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:56.320
fall in love with the liberal arts and descend to some very high realm of the

321
00:23:56.781 --> 00:23:59.690
spirit or,
uh,
you know,

322
00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:04.550
you can choose to the downward path to debauchery and mere pleasure.

323
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.460
It's a question of how free you are,
but you do,

324
00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:11.120
we do have the opportunity to move up and down this ladder.

325
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:16.210
Unlike the animals and other create all of the creative forces that are fixed.

326
00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:23.100
Now question is what makes us move up and down this or what will motivate us to

327
00:24:23.101 --> 00:24:23.934
move up.

328
00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:26.723
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

329
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:31.080
<v 0>And here we come to some key differences between Platonism and Christianity.</v>

330
00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:33.030
With regard to evil.

331
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:38.030
Platonism tends to ascribe evil to ignorance.

332
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.490
Christianity's tends to ascribe evil to sin.

333
00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:46.110
The difference between sin and ignorance is that,
um,

334
00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:50.180
sin is deliberate.
You know,

335
00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.030
you shouldn't do this and you do it anyway.

336
00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:58.430
You're not overcome by desire.

337
00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:03.280
So to anticipate one of the paper topics,

338
00:25:03.281 --> 00:25:07.000
but I don't think I'm going to be giving away the answer.

339
00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:12.700
What is it about the pair stealing incident that makes it so important?

340
00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:20.640
Anybody want to venture a preliminary response to this?
Well,

341
00:25:20.641 --> 00:25:25.641
it's the fact that he doesn't meet the parents to thought that because he feels

342
00:25:26.131 --> 00:25:29.670
that the center has a desire for you.
So the pairs,

343
00:25:29.671 --> 00:25:33.300
he doesn't need the pairs.
Uh,

344
00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.470
it is just a desire.
I mean,
he doesn't say to himself,
I want to sin.

345
00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.820
I haven't sinned in two days.
Um,

346
00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:45.570
he doesn't need the pairs.
What did they do with the pairs?
When they get them,

347
00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:51.990
they throw them out.
They throw them to the pigs so they're not hungry.

348
00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:56.430
It's not like I was overcome by desire.

349
00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:02.190
Uh,
and uh,
you know,
that led me into some sort of sinful behavior.

350
00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:06.090
They weren't overcome by desire at all.
How would you describe their prepare?

351
00:26:06.091 --> 00:26:10.400
Stealing state?
I mean,
at least what would you guess was there?

352
00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:13.080
Pre pair,
stealing frame of mind?

353
00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.770
There's one word that will describe it,
but if you want to use a few more,

354
00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.310
some guys go and they steal some pairs from an orchard.

355
00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:29.590
Like fool around with them.
They throw them to the pigs.
Bored,
bored,

356
00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:35.260
bored.
Now here's something we can identify with.
They are bored.

357
00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:39.640
They need to amuse themselves.
They cannot amuse themselves by saying,

358
00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:42.370
I'm a good person or a,

359
00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:45.790
I'm going to the won or a,

360
00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:49.690
I'm going to do some homework.
Ryan.

361
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.060
Uh,
it doesn't end.

362
00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:57.230
Young people are thought to be easily bored.
Uh,

363
00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:00.590
but the boredom of the old people,
it's a,
um,

364
00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:05.070
it's a different kind of board.
I'm,
but there it is.
It's persistent.

365
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.600
That's not the only reason people send.
But it is a gratuitous reason.

366
00:27:09.601 --> 00:27:14.280
And that's what's interesting about the pairs.
It's gratuitous.
It's not from me.

367
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:21.110
The Platonists don't have a good response to why this happens because it's not a

368
00:27:22.321 --> 00:27:23.520
question of education.

369
00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:26.413
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

370
00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:29.840
<v 0>Now Augustine does not invent Christian ideas of sin.</v>

371
00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:34.180
If you said to Augustine,
I've come on,
why are you so worried about the pairs?

372
00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:39.130
He's not worried about the pairs as suck.
It's just a little emblem or a little,

373
00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:43.780
uh,
example of a different kind of problem.
That is to say,

374
00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:47.320
knowing how to behave doesn't change us

375
00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.140
feeling how to behave

376
00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:58.980
to put it in Friday in terms it's a,
it's not the uh,

377
00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.700
uh,
uh,
ego,
but the sides,

378
00:28:02.701 --> 00:28:05.490
it's the Ed instinct,
not the intellect.

379
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:12.230
And that's what his conversion means.
He's conversion is not,

380
00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:15.320
suddenly I was convinced that Christianity was true.

381
00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:20.750
He already knows that Christianity is true,
but he knows it intellectually.

382
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:25.820
The conversion is a conversion to an emotional apprehension of it.

383
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.140
So however intellectual he may seem to you,
however,

384
00:28:30.141 --> 00:28:33.740
formed in the tradition of Greco Roman classicism,

385
00:28:33.741 --> 00:28:38.570
he was however much the Hortencia's awakened him to the life of the mind.

386
00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:43.720
He is ultimately a theologian and philosopher of the irrational of the supra

387
00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:50.470
rational.
And indeed,

388
00:28:50.471 --> 00:28:55.471
Christianity in its history has an oscillation between intellectual association

389
00:28:56.230 --> 00:29:00.970
and the rediscovery of Sin and God's grace.

390
00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.073
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

391
00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:09.290
<v 0>If you think of movements like the reformation of Martin Luther,</v>

392
00:29:09.961 --> 00:29:12.720
John Calvin,
etc. In the 16th century,

393
00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:18.980
it takes issue with the notion that we can do works that give us merit in the

394
00:29:19.861 --> 00:29:20.671
sight of God,

395
00:29:20.671 --> 00:29:25.671
and that the church tells us we have accumulated merits and therefore will go to

396
00:29:26.281 --> 00:29:27.114
heaven.

397
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:32.840
The reformation teaches that we are face to face with God and that our so called

398
00:29:33.331 --> 00:29:37.500
good deeds don't amount to anything.
We are all sinful.

399
00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:42.100
If God operated according to justice,
we would all go to hell,

400
00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:46.540
faith and grace that save people,
hence the reformation.

401
00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:52.470
But it's also the great awakening of Britain and America in the 18th century is

402
00:29:54.401 --> 00:29:57.840
the development of methodism.
Um,

403
00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:00.610
the fundamentalist,
a,
a movement,

404
00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:06.270
all of these tend to reject attempts to approach God contractually attempts to

405
00:30:09.491 --> 00:30:12.310
approach God in terms of a deal.

406
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.860
So
if human beings are sinful

407
00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:28.820
and if education is not going to get them out of sin,

408
00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:29.683
what will,

409
00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:32.510
<v 1>okay.</v>

410
00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:36.830
<v 0>Now the Augustine of the confessions is different than the Augustine of 20 years</v>

411
00:30:36.831 --> 00:30:41.780
later when he wrote the city of God and we're not studying the city of God,
but,

412
00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:43.040
um,
uh,

413
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:47.570
this book written in response to the sack of Rome in four 10.

414
00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:49.540
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

415
00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:54.540
<v 0>develop some ideas that are found in the confessions about the nature of sin and</v>

416
00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:01.180
how we get out of it.

417
00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.890
The nature of sin is the pairs.

418
00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:11.200
How we get out of it is at least in part the conversion.

419
00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:15.850
We got the pairs sufficiently for the time being.

420
00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:23.010
The conversion is started,
well,

421
00:31:23.011 --> 00:31:24.810
it started long before the event,

422
00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:30.740
but what precipitates it as a drama is this conversation with Ponti Sianna's in

423
00:31:33.601 --> 00:31:37.920
book eight,
part eight,
who has traveled

424
00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:42.730
and describes the monks of Egypt.

425
00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.070
Now we'll be talking lots and lots about monks.

426
00:31:45.071 --> 00:31:49.270
But the monks of Egypt are the first example of Christian monks.

427
00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:54.510
Men who flee the world into the desert and they are,

428
00:31:54.671 --> 00:31:59.530
you know,
live on,
uh,
you know,
uh,

429
00:31:59.531 --> 00:32:03.400
weeds,
uh,
a sight line,
water,
locusts,

430
00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:08.410
other insects,
basically nothing.
Uh,
and they,

431
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:09.333
uh,

432
00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:13.630
they have visions and they are sought out by ordinary people.

433
00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:19.530
It's key to understand that to be a hermit in this society does not necessarily

434
00:32:19.631 --> 00:32:22.460
mean that you have nothing to do with pink bowl.

435
00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:28.920
People start to want to find you because you must have special power

436
00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:36.250
back in Alexandria,
their baby is sick.
Maybe you,

437
00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:42.540
oh hermit living on locus and out in the desert had some spiritual power to help

438
00:32:44.061 --> 00:32:48.800
my baby.
This is shamanism.
It happens in all sorts of religions.

439
00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:52.880
You can't just be a shaman or medicine man,

440
00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:57.500
a wise man and hold down a regular old job or you can.

441
00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:02.240
But it helps.
And that's the conceit of a lot of TV ideas.
You know,

442
00:33:02.241 --> 00:33:04.850
secret heroes there.
They're real estate agents,

443
00:33:04.851 --> 00:33:08.960
but they're battling the forces of darkness.
But generally,

444
00:33:08.961 --> 00:33:13.961
most of the time you've got to be special and you've got to look special and

445
00:33:14.181 --> 00:33:18.650
you've got to be a reject.
You can't have a spouse,

446
00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:23.480
kids,
a mortgage,
a garden,
a swing set.

447
00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:27.350
You've got a,
B,
a c,

448
00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:31.370
or you've got to have your vision focused on the other world.

449
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:35.330
Pontius Yanas tells Augustine about these men,

450
00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:40.360
and his response is not only to be impressed by them,

451
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:44.510
but to be humiliated by them.
First of all,

452
00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:49.400
here are these guys who are
intoxicated with God.

453
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:54.250
While I'm still thinking about my career,
but,

454
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:59.200
and this is the ancient world speaking.
They are uneducated.
These monks of Egypt,

455
00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:05.100
they didn't study the republic,
the hort 10 cs,

456
00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:06.690
the Timaeus,

457
00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:14.390
the rhetoric of quintillion.
The satire is a juvenile.

458
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:17.270
They don't know anything about this.
They're uneducated people.

459
00:34:17.271 --> 00:34:21.560
The many of them are illiterate,
and yet they are closer to God.

460
00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:25.940
They have an apprehension of the divine that causes them to renounce the world,

461
00:34:25.941 --> 00:34:30.410
whereas we Augustine says of him and his circle,
we,
uh,

462
00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:32.510
um,
lie here,

463
00:34:32.511 --> 00:34:37.280
groveling in this world of flesh and blood while they storm the gates of heaven.

464
00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:39.680
And this is the moment of his conversion.

465
00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:43.053
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

466
00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:44.590
<v 0>Now,
after his conversion,</v>

467
00:34:44.591 --> 00:34:49.591
Augustine's plan was to lead a life of contemplation with his friends.

468
00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:56.680
They would retreat from the world,
meaning they would give up their careers,

469
00:34:56.681 --> 00:35:00.010
but it would be a little bit like,
um,

470
00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:02.620
you and your friends,

471
00:35:02.621 --> 00:35:06.760
one of your friend's parents have a lot of money and have this wonderful cabin,

472
00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:10.360
uh,
somewhere in the Rockies or the sawtooth mountains.

473
00:35:10.361 --> 00:35:14.700
And you're going to figure out some kind of way of,
uh,
uh,

474
00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:17.890
you know,
you'll be on the internet and everything,
but,
but you're gonna,

475
00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:20.030
you're gonna,
um,

476
00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:24.160
have this kind of beautiful contemplative life.

477
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:27.190
But the beautiful part is that it's not going to be uncomfortable.

478
00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:31.750
It's not the desert of Egypt.
It's remote.
You're not going to be bothered,

479
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:36.100
but they're beautiful mountains trouts in the stream.
Uh,
you know,
it's a,

480
00:35:36.101 --> 00:35:40.470
it's a sort of idyllic and you and your friends are going to talk about reality

481
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.920
and,
uh,
the spirit and philosophy and,
uh,

482
00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:48.780
um,
I dunno how idyllic this sounds to you,

483
00:35:48.781 --> 00:35:52.530
but it's certainly an understandable idea of a way of life.

484
00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:58.300
It is the ancient idea of what's called a leisure with dignity.

485
00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:00.270
And indeed,

486
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:04.680
that's what being a professor was supposed to be when I signed up for it.
See,

487
00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:09.570
come dignity,
Dante Leisure with dignity,
leisure,
meaning not,
uh,

488
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:12.150
you know,
wasting time,
leisure,

489
00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:16.890
but not responding to clients or not responding to,
uh,

490
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:20.550
you know,
uh,
urgent scheduling,
phone calls,

491
00:36:20.551 --> 00:36:24.120
a deals you've got to show up to your classes.

492
00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:28.890
Right.
But that's not really honorous.

493
00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.010
At least that was the idea.
You know,
wrong.

494
00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:35.920
I won't go into the frustrations of being a professor or the,

495
00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:40.890
the dissatisfactions.
Um,
but the classical ideal is OTM come dignity,

496
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.800
dignity,
meaning not being naked in the desert,
not having to,

497
00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:49.680
you know,
eat locusts and figure out how to,
okay,

498
00:36:49.681 --> 00:36:52.860
I had curry Blokus last night tonight.
I think I'll have,
you know,

499
00:36:52.861 --> 00:36:57.540
locust casserole.
No,
no,
no.
Something nicer than that.

500
00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:02.850
But in fact,
he did not follow through on this.

501
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:08.630
She did not lead a life of cultivated classical dignity with his friends.

502
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.600
He went back to North Africa.
He became a bishop.

503
00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:15.900
He has years were,
uh,
uh,

504
00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:20.390
consumed by disputes over doctrine with heroin.

505
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.330
Anicole as he deemed them tendencies like donatism most notably.

506
00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:30.300
And he died defending his city of hippo,
hippo,
Regius,

507
00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:35.610
um,
in a modern Tunisia from the vandals,

508
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:40.530
one of those barbarian invaders who will occupy us next week.

509
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.760
He then was very much involved in the world.

510
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:49.790
To be a bishop in the Roman empire was by no means an office of dignified

511
00:37:50.581 --> 00:37:54.780
leisure.
It was right in there in the political trenches.

512
00:37:54.781 --> 00:37:59.100
It's a position of honor to be sure,
but,
uh,

513
00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:04.560
his understanding of the Christian's duty in the world was that you cannot lead

514
00:38:04.561 --> 00:38:05.910
a life of perfection.

515
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:10.200
You cannot lead a life of sin free contemplation.

516
00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:14.010
We all are sinners.

517
00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:20.540
He becomes more and more the theologian philosopher who combat perfectionism.

518
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:29.300
Perfectionism is a doctrine that human beings can be made radically better.

519
00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:35.070
Perfect evening
there,

520
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:40.170
debates through our societies about the degree of human perfectability.

521
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:44.140
This is indeed supposedly,
and to some extent,

522
00:38:44.141 --> 00:38:48.040
I think really at the heart of debates between what is called liberalism in the

523
00:38:48.041 --> 00:38:52.840
United States and conservatism.
Liberals believe in human perfectability.

524
00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:56.980
If you educate people,
if you help them,

525
00:38:57.190 --> 00:39:01.600
if you encourage them,
if you provide government subsidies,

526
00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.000
you will build a better society.

527
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:09.310
The response upon the part of conservatives to that is people are the way they

528
00:39:09.311 --> 00:39:11.350
are because,
uh,
uh,

529
00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:15.800
that's the way they want to be or they made wrong choices.
Um,
but,
uh,

530
00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:20.590
all the help from some,
uh,
uh,
you know,

531
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:23.650
public authority isn't going to help,
isn't going to really make a difference.

532
00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:28.960
Are People perfectible people to believe in education tend to believe that they

533
00:39:28.961 --> 00:39:31.720
are.
On the other hand,

534
00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.120
very well educated people have been

535
00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:36.323
<v 1>bad.</v>

536
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:40.760
<v 0>Hitler loved classical music.
So did Stalin.</v>

537
00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:45.770
Just because you are a connoisseur of art doesn't make you a good person.

538
00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:53.890
Augustine is a radical imperfection perfectionist,
more so in the city of God.

539
00:39:53.891 --> 00:39:57.550
Then in the confessions,
which has sort of teetering on the brink,

540
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000
the pairs as a kind of in perfectionist moment excuses or glimpses,

541
00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:10.420
the power of sin
by the time of the city of God.

542
00:40:10.421 --> 00:40:12.350
By the time that,
uh,
um,

543
00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:16.600
the end of the Roman Empire is at least glimpsed as a possibility and the rise

544
00:40:16.601 --> 00:40:20.100
of the barbarians.
Augustine has become,
uh,

545
00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:25.380
someone who does not believe that human beings can in any way earn salvation.

546
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:30.490
Human beings are irrevocably sinful.

547
00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:38.120
Once again,
if God judged people according to their merits,

548
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:40.190
they would all be damned.

549
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:46.510
Since the Christian belief is that some people are saved,

550
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:53.120
they're saved by mysterious process called grace.

551
00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:58.730
Grace by its very meaning is undeserved.

552
00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:04.120
You don't show up at the door of heaven with a ticket of admission earned by

553
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:07.430
your deeds on earth.

554
00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:14.590
What opens the doors to you is a generous,

555
00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:20.450
arbitrary decision.
Well,
generous may mean I had good intentions.

556
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:24.470
I didn't kill anybody.
Um,

557
00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:32.410
but arbitrary may mean that we can't figure out who's going to heaven and who's

558
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:37.520
going to hell.
It may even mean that God,

559
00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:40.430
since God knew before we were born,

560
00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:45.110
God predestined us for Heaven or hell.

561
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:51.440
This is a harsh doctrine.
It gets periodically rediscovered and then dropped.

562
00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:56.000
It's at the heart of the belief of the people who settled Massachusetts and

563
00:41:56.001 --> 00:41:56.834
Connecticut.

564
00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:01.920
It is the heart of Calvinism and puritanism the belief in the elect.

565
00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:06.410
The question is,
are these elect visible or invisible?

566
00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:08.720
The elect are people who are going to go to heaven.

567
00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:10.083
<v 1>Okay,</v>

568
00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:15.500
<v 0>are they visible?
Can we say,
this guy is so good,</v>

569
00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:20.620
he's going to heaven.
This woman is so,
uh,

570
00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:25.310
um,
loving,
nurturing,
uh,
uh,
self effacing.

571
00:42:25.311 --> 00:42:29.690
When I first she's going to go to heaven.
That's a notion of a visible elect.

572
00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:34.790
An invisible elect is you don't know.

573
00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.530
We have no idea.

574
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:40.790
And this is a crucial difference because if you believe in the visible elect,

575
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:43.250
even if you say they're not guaranteed,

576
00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:48.670
but anybody outside of the circle is for sure going to hell,
then you have PR,

577
00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:49.940
a Puritan New England,

578
00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:55.990
you have a small community of people pursuing perfection or you have the Amish,

579
00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:04.930
or you have any small Pius community that believes that outside of it is more or

580
00:43:08.271 --> 00:43:13.271
less given over to sin and more or less doomed inside of it.

581
00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:18.470
Maybe it's not guaranteed,
but your chances are much,
much better.

582
00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.430
But if you believe

583
00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:28.120
that we don't have a visible elect,

584
00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:33.340
that we have no idea and everybody ought to be in the church,

585
00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:39.450
everybody ought to have access to the sacraments that provide initiation into

586
00:43:40.661 --> 00:43:45.040
the church.
You want to start converting pagans,

587
00:43:45.041 --> 00:43:46.510
even savage pagans,

588
00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:50.980
you ought to be out there roping in as many people into the church,

589
00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:52.510
including people who don't want to be

590
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.310
because you just never know.
Maybe their kids will be,

591
00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:04.560
Augustine is behind ideas of things like forced conversion.

592
00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:07.920
As long as they're baptized,

593
00:44:07.921 --> 00:44:12.270
there's a chance of them being saved and baptized as infants,

594
00:44:12.271 --> 00:44:17.271
preferably because baptism does not any longer mean in Augustine's world

595
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:22.530
perfection.
It means the beginning.

596
00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:26.340
It means entering the the process.

597
00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:33.750
So the three things that he is teaching that are implicit in the confessions and

598
00:44:33.751 --> 00:44:38.751
that he is important for in terms of his intellectual impact are his opposition

599
00:44:40.141 --> 00:44:44.540
to perfectionism,
his exaltation of Grace

600
00:44:46.330 --> 00:44:47.170
<v 1>and</v>

601
00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:51.700
<v 0>the notion of sin as indelible,</v>

602
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:53.140
not solvable.

603
00:44:57.230 --> 00:45:02.230
Where this becomes a key historical importance is in the church.

604
00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:09.340
The church is a body that can either be sectarian m small as with the Amish or a

605
00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:18.740
puritan New England or it can be huge and universal.

606
00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:21.470
As with the Medieval Catholic Church.

607
00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:24.350
Augustine stands behind the Medieval Catholic church,

608
00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:28.880
which is a political body,
a body of doctrine,

609
00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:32.660
a structure ruled by princes,

610
00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:38.440
and a structure that has a missionary impact on the rest of the world.

611
00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:41.943
<v 1>Now,</v>

612
00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:46.180
<v 0>the papers you have,
the paper topics,
if you didn't get them,
come up and see me,</v>

613
00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:48.370
uh,
after,
um,

614
00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.310
you can choose any one of them or you can choose something else.

615
00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:53.050
But if you choose something else,

616
00:45:53.051 --> 00:45:58.051
please talk to your teaching fellow or to me and talk to us anyway about these

617
00:45:58.331 --> 00:46:02.470
papers will give you plenty of opportunity to bounce ideas off us.

618
00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:06.700
Now next week we talk about the fall of the Roman empire,

619
00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:10.510
but this is implicit about in what we've talked about today,

620
00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:14.860
because the bottom line is the Roman empire is gonna fall in the West and the

621
00:46:14.861 --> 00:46:16.780
church is not going to.

622
00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:21.730
And so we'll look at how that works next week.
Thanks.
