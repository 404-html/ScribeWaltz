00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.310
Welcome to a history to 10,
the early Middle Ages.

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.830
I'm Paul Friedman.
And behind this innocuous title,

3
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:14.190
the early Middle Ages,
I think we're going to have to jazz it up a little.

4
00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:17.520
I think we're going to put an exclamation mark on it at least.

5
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.230
But behind this innocuous title,
you will see,
I hope,
uh,

6
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.970
if you stay for this course,
a strange course,

7
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.020
strange,
uh,

8
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.040
not because it covers the particular period to 50 to 1000,

9
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.903
uh,

10
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.890
but because it starts out very recognizable and get stranger and stranger and

11
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:45.300
seems to dissolve into a kind of a hard to grasp world,

12
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.270
um,
hard to grasp.
But Fun.

13
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.040
I will talk about both the strangeness and the Fun Aspects,
uh,
in more detail.

14
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.540
There are several great themes in this span of centuries.

15
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.580
The fall of the Roman Empire.

16
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.310
It's survival in the east as the Byzantine Empire,

17
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.600
the so called barbarian invasions and kingdoms set up on the ruins of the Roman

18
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.940
Empire,
the triumph of Christianity,

19
00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:19.650
which went from being an outlawed minority religion to the established faith of

20
00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:24.210
the Roman Empire,
and then survive to the extinction of the Roman empire.

21
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.140
Uh,
we have,
uh,
two teaching fellows,
uh,
Lauren Mann,

22
00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:35.141
Sia sitting at this end and on Yessica rats standing in that corner

23
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:38.641
so far.

24
00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:43.340
Their section scheduled for Wednesday at four o'clock and Friday at 10 30.
Uh,

25
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.800
we'll probably have two other sections.
Uh,

26
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.000
we'll see how large the class is next week.

27
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.230
Let me know if those two section times,
uh,

28
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.220
well probably the classes,
the sections to be added would be on Thursday,

29
00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:01.560
Thursday afternoon and Thursday evening.

30
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.760
But let me know if you have some special problem in terms of the scheduling of

31
00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:10.710
your,
uh,
of the sections.
Uh,
as I said,
um,

32
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.710
when,
when some of you were already here,

33
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.890
I'll have some pauses so that if you are shopping and want to look at another

34
00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:22.920
course,
uh,
uh,
it'll be,
uh,
if not easy,

35
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:26.930
at least possible for you to get up and leave.
Um,

36
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.300
so I'll have several pauses during the,
uh,
during the,
uh,

37
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.850
presentation.
But I should say I do want to give a full class,

38
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.810
um,
a discussion today or presentation today.

39
00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:43.080
We only have so many opportunities to discuss things.

40
00:02:43.081 --> 00:02:47.340
And I'd like to set the scene for you and I think that will also help you
decide,

41
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.420
uh,
um,
uh,
about taking this course.

42
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.973
Now,

43
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.520
this course is part of the a Yale open courses a program.

44
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.010
Uh,
and as you probably know,
there are lots of,
uh,

45
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.490
well a select number,

46
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:11.491
but a substantial number of courses that are offered free to the public via the

47
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:16.600
Internet.
And this is one of them for the fall.

48
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:20.690
And I take this opportunity to greet our,
uh,

49
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.120
Internet students and Internet,
um,
uh,
friends.

50
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.620
So since it's part of this project,
uh,

51
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.120
a Yale University broadcast team,
uh,
will be,

52
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.260
uh,
recording all the classes and,
um,

53
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.720
there'll be as unobtrusive as possible.

54
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.280
The classroom experience will be essentially as it would be if they're not there

55
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.890
and it's their intention to videotape me and not you.

56
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.640
Uh,
uh,
so neither your faces nor voice.
Uh,

57
00:03:57.641 --> 00:04:00.400
our voices are supposed to appear.

58
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.600
You're questions are unlikely to be a herd.

59
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.310
I will repeat the questions so that people watching this,

60
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.500
uh,
on the Internet will have an idea.
And I do encourage questions,

61
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:18.280
both things that you haven't understood or things for elucidation.

62
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.410
I have a slightly more formal lecture style then some people perhaps,

63
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.090
um,
uh,
I have,
uh,
uh,
try to have a reasonably structured,

64
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.600
uh,
lecture that doesn't wander off too much.

65
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:34.070
Some of you have taken courses from me and know that,
uh,

66
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.760
I have certain themes or preoccupations or a diversions,

67
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.860
but I'm going to try to,
uh,
uh,
be as coherent as possible,
uh,

68
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.130
partly because we are,
um,
uh,
filming this.

69
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.330
Um,
so I hope that you're enthusiastic about the fact that a,

70
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.280
we're participating in this,
uh,
Yale open courses initiative.

71
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.380
And having said that now you should just think it away.
Um,
uh,
the,

72
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.150
uh,
uh,

73
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.260
the team is broadcast team is not very conspicuous and the objective is for us

74
00:05:10.301 --> 00:05:14.230
to interact in the classroom as we normally would.
And,
um,

75
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.690
uh,
this is part of the unique experience of teaching and learning at Yale.

76
00:05:19.691 --> 00:05:23.800
So don't hesitate to ask me if you have any questions or concerns.

77
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.900
Uh,
the syllabus,
you all have copies a of the syllabus I believe.

78
00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:32.350
And of course you'll have seen it on the server.

79
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.310
Uh,

80
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.800
the books are at Yale Bookstore and they are all there.

81
00:05:38.801 --> 00:05:43.480
I'm,
I hope there will be enough copies.
If not,
we will,
we will get more.

82
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:46.500
The first assignment is a,
um,

83
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.890
conveniently in this sense from the course pack.
The course pack is at Tyco,

84
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.720
the photocopy place on Elm Street.
Uh,

85
00:05:55.721 --> 00:05:59.900
if you don't know where is,
uh,
um,
let us know.

86
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.940
Um,
and the assignments for Monday and Wednesday,
uh,
from the,

87
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.070
um,
uh,

88
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.690
the f those first two assignments are from that book from Peter Brown's world of

89
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:14.950
late antiquity and h m Jones a Constantine.

90
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.600
I'm the conversion of western Europe

91
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.760
questions so far.
Right.
Okay.
So,
uh,

92
00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:28.910
the requirements that you'll see on the syllabus or a short paper that's due

93
00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:30.020
October the 10th

94
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.710
a midterm that will be held in class October 17th and the long paper,

95
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.210
which is due December 5th,

96
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.020
that long paper is a research paper.

97
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.310
And we'll be glad to help you choose a topic,
offer you suggestions,

98
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.170
help you get started on that.

99
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.960
It's 15 to 20 pages and accounts for 40% of your grade.

100
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.920
Here's a midterm counts,
30% of the grade,

101
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.291
the short paper,

102
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:10.820
20% and your section grade is 10%.

103
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.880
Now,
this course does not have honorous requirements,

104
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.960
but I expect you to do the requirements that we have.

105
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.780
There's no final exam.

106
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:30.610
I urge you to blot out of your mind the temptation not to do the reading because

107
00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:35.450
there's no final exam or the reading of the second part of the course.

108
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.520
And if we think that this is a problem,

109
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.400
judging on the basis of how the sections go,

110
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:45.580
we reserve the possibility of giving you quizzes in the section and the section

111
00:07:45.711 --> 00:07:48.650
half of the course,

112
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.840
a paper times,
uh,
we're going to be firm on this.

113
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.370
I can't say absolutely no extensions on the paper because I acknowledged the

114
00:07:58.371 --> 00:08:00.710
existence of overwhelming emergencies.

115
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:05.510
But let me give you an example of an excuse that's not going to be accepted.

116
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:10.250
I have three other papers due that week.
Okay.

117
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:12.980
Plan in advance.
We are at your disposal.

118
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:17.990
If you want to plan your final paper tomorrow,
Hey,
this afternoon,

119
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:23.210
uh,
uh,
talk to me how I'm eager to,
uh,
to hear from you about that.

120
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.750
Uh,
in the sections.
Uh,

121
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:31.780
we don't want you to bring laptops and the reason for that is not that we think

122
00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:34.780
you're going to be,
um,

123
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.230
Facebooking or answering your email because we know that you never do that.

124
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.540
Um,
uh,

125
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:45.770
the laptops in our experience interfere with the purpose of the section,

126
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:50.780
which is partly to talk to each other and rather than focusing on the screen and

127
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:56.940
then in a sense being a series of archipelago of little islands rather than a

128
00:08:56.941 --> 00:09:00.480
section in the sense of give and take and uh,
interchange.

129
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:04.560
If you think that that imposes some kind of hardship on you,
I think you'll find,

130
00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.890
uh,
that uh,
uh,
uh,
it is pleasant.

131
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.310
And if there's some technical hardship,
let me know.

132
00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:13.893
<v 1>Okay.</v>

133
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.290
<v 0>So logistical questions</v>

134
00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.940
Pushkin's about the organization of the course or a,
any other aspect of this?

135
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:29.030
Good.
That means that I'm a clearer then,
uh,
on some occasions.

136
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:35.130
So,
uh,
uh,
if anybody is,
uh,
uh,

137
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.530
wants to leave,
now this is one opportunity,

138
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.910
but since it looks like I have your attention riveted,
uh,

139
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.320
let me introduce the course in terms of its actual content.

140
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
We are beginning by looking at the crisis of the Roman empire and then we will

141
00:09:56.301 --> 00:10:01.301
be looking at it's peculiar legacy in the year 1000 where we stopped,

142
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:06.920
we will still be dealing with the inheritance of the Roman empire.

143
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.440
The title of Chris Wickham's book,

144
00:10:09.441 --> 00:10:11.360
one of the books that we're going to be using a lot.

145
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:18.490
The legacy is peculiar because while the memory of the Roman empire remains

146
00:10:18.681 --> 00:10:23.210
intact throughout the period and beyond,
I mean,

147
00:10:23.211 --> 00:10:28.160
to this day,
the head of the Catholic church is in Rome,
uh,

148
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.490
until 1960 the year,
uh,
uh,

149
00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.880
transactions of the papacy were in Latin.

150
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.780
The services of the church.
We're in line with the Catholic church.

151
00:10:38.781 --> 00:10:43.070
We're in Latin and Latin remains the official language of,
uh,

152
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:48.230
of the Catholic church in its administrative head.
So,
um,

153
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.800
the most faithful preserver of Rome and its legacy historically is the Catholic

154
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:55.933
church.

155
00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:01.820
And this is a paradox because the church begins it's career and indeed its first

156
00:11:01.821 --> 00:11:06.260
250 years as illegal in the Roman empire.

157
00:11:06.261 --> 00:11:11.210
And indeed there are periodic persecutions where people were punished,

158
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:14.360
including,
uh,
killed because they were Christians.

159
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.510
The most faithful preserver of Rome.
However,

160
00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:24.760
after the fifth century collapse of the empire in the West is the so called

161
00:11:24.761 --> 00:11:28.240
Byzantine Empire,
the Byzantine Empire

162
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.200
with its headquarters in Constantinople.

163
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.823
<v 1>Okay.</v>

164
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:38.450
<v 0>Despite the fact that it would abandoned Latin for Greek in the sixth century</v>

165
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.440
and turn into a very different kind of political and cultural entity,

166
00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:47.950
the Byzantine Empire went down in flames to the Turks in 15,

167
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.410
14,
53,
uh,
still as the Roman empire.

168
00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:56.890
That was its official name to the end.

169
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.920
Another air to the Roman empire in a sense is Islam,

170
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:10.020
which begins in the seventh century,
in the middle of our period.

171
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:14.430
I don't have to emphasize to you the historical importance of Islam,

172
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:21.320
but our task is to understand its origin and its astonishing expansion in terms

173
00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:27.260
of this era to 50 to 1000 to understand it in terms of its times and thus how it

174
00:12:30.721 --> 00:12:33.990
arises and interacts with,
uh,

175
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:39.020
the Roman and Byzantine as well as offstage the Persian empires that it either

176
00:12:41.311 --> 00:12:45.060
destroys or weekends.
In the seventh and eighth centuries,

177
00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:50.340
Muhammad was from outside the former empire from Arabia and maybe said to

178
00:12:50.341 --> 00:12:54.270
represent a very different kind of set of ideas.

179
00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:57.773
<v 1>Okay.</v>

180
00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:03.290
<v 0>But the power of Islam would for centuries be concentrated in areas of the</v>

181
00:13:03.291 --> 00:13:08.000
former Roman empire,
the Mediterranean,
the Balkans,
Egypt,

182
00:13:08.001 --> 00:13:11.150
Syria,
North Africa.
Of course in the the ladder,
it's a,

183
00:13:11.151 --> 00:13:14.210
still is one of the overwhelming majority religion.

184
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:21.340
And Islam then brings up a sort of,
um,

185
00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.670
question that I'm not going to deal with directly very much,

186
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.810
but that will be at the back of our minds.
And that is relevance.
Uh,

187
00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.970
this is a preindustrial course.

188
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.530
It's in the very preindustrial category in terms of requirements.
Uh,

189
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.810
it's far away.
It's distant.

190
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.610
That is part of its appeal I think is it's as I said,
its strangeness.
Um,

191
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:47.790
but the lessons from the material covered in this course are perhaps these,

192
00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.660
we're thinking about

193
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:57.540
how perhaps the most successful multicultural empire of Western history,

194
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.730
how it did that,
how it endured for so long,

195
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:08.410
the success of the Roman empire and wide finally failed.

196
00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:14.560
And in that failure,
how does a rich literate,

197
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:20.430
well-developed society come to be destroyed by a more primitive one primitive,

198
00:14:23.351 --> 00:14:27.940
at least in the sense of material culture,
economic complexity,

199
00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.430
urbanization and literacy.

200
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:33.390
<v 1>Okay.</v>

201
00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:38.280
<v 0>Another important lesson is the power of religious ideas,</v>

202
00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:43.910
not only intrinsically as part of people's lives and outlook,

203
00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:49.970
but socially and historically how religion affects the political course of

204
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:59.090
history.
Having said this,

205
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:03.500
I think I did mention,
I was going to tell you what was fun about this course.

206
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:08.270
This is what I think is fun and I've already kind of alluded to this.

207
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:14.400
We begin with a familiar world in the sense that the Roman Empire,

208
00:15:14.401 --> 00:15:17.780
although obviously not technologically the same as the one we live in,

209
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:22.880
is a very advanced society and a very complex one.
Advanced,

210
00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:23.960
you know,

211
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:28.130
go to Europe and look around and see the engineering feats of the Romans.

212
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:33.280
See the public life that the Babs stadia temples,

213
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:39.030
law courts,
marketplaces,
uhh,

214
00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.070
who's ruins still,
uh,
in many instances,

215
00:15:43.071 --> 00:15:46.700
dwarf the towns that survived around them.

216
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.510
See how,
what an accomplishment that is.

217
00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:55.760
It is a huge empire of bureaucratic empire.

218
00:15:55.940 --> 00:16:00.710
One with lots of literate people,
a huge army,

219
00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:04.490
a huge civil service,
a lot of commerce back and forth,

220
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:07.610
all things that are familiar to us.

221
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.660
But as it weakens and collapses,

222
00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:16.910
you get a kind of,
if not post apocalyptic,

223
00:16:16.911 --> 00:16:20.660
at least transformative experience.

224
00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:27.350
It gets stranger and stranger more and more disorganized,

225
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.230
harder to understand at first grasp.

226
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:36.040
Basically we begin in the Shire and we end up in more dangerous territories.

227
00:16:37.191 --> 00:16:40.280
It's hard to describe the territory that we end up in,

228
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:45.640
but that is what I think is intriguing about the course.

229
00:16:46.011 --> 00:16:46.621
You,
you,

230
00:16:46.621 --> 00:16:51.621
you start out in a familiar world and it just becomes something alien.

231
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:58.850
But I think appealing,
appealing.
But I do have one morning for you or one,

232
00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:00.103
um,

233
00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:05.440
thing that I have seen students surprised at and sometimes even annoyed at and

234
00:17:06.801 --> 00:17:10.670
that is we've got to talk about religion,
uh,

235
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:15.310
both Christianity and Islam.
Uh,
and uh,

236
00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:20.320
to a more limited extent Judaism this and also paganism for that matter.

237
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.470
But the one that tends to bother people actually is Christianity.
So,
you know,

238
00:17:24.471 --> 00:17:26.290
sometimes people will say,
oh,

239
00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:29.570
I thought I was taking a history course and it's turned into a religious studies

240
00:17:29.571 --> 00:17:33.350
course before my eyes.
We're going to have to talk about some heresies.

241
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:36.770
You're going to have to understand actually what,
uh,

242
00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:40.280
what people are fighting and killing each other over when they talk about the

243
00:17:40.281 --> 00:17:45.230
nature of Christ or the relationship among the three persons of the trinity.
Um,

244
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.600
this is unfamiliar.
Uh,
but again,

245
00:17:47.601 --> 00:17:52.601
I think unfamiliarity is for us and unfamiliarity has a funny way of turning

246
00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:57.120
into familiar.
When I started teaching,
well,

247
00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:02.130
dinosaurs weren't walking the earth,
but they just departed.
Um,

248
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:06.750
primitive birds,
early mammals.
Um,

249
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.650
the assumption was that religion was safely,
uh,
you know,

250
00:18:10.651 --> 00:18:15.600
religion is a political movement.
Not Religion is a personal
commitment,

251
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:20.750
but religion as something that had an impact on politics was pretty safely gone.

252
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:26.100
And that was a feature of medieval history.
Obviously,
the last,
uh,

253
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:30.720
um,
years have shown us in many ways to the power of religious ideas,

254
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:36.090
the power of religious ideas not know,
uh,
solely personally,

255
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.290
but collectively not solely as sentiments,

256
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:42.090
but as political movements.

257
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:48.950
So we begin with the crisis of the empire,

258
00:18:48.951 --> 00:18:52.820
the first crisis of the empire in the third century,
a day.

259
00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:58.740
If we go back just before that,
I mean,
this is an officially part of the course.

260
00:18:58.741 --> 00:19:02.210
This is like,
you know,
the chef offers you this little,
uh,
uh,

261
00:19:02.211 --> 00:19:05.250
I'm used Bruce this little a snack to begin the mail,

262
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.210
the period of the good emperors,
the second century I do.

263
00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:14.420
The good emperor is a term a popularized by the great historian of the decline

264
00:19:15.181 --> 00:19:18.750
and fall of the Roman empire,
Edward Gibbon,
who wrote in the 18th century.

265
00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.920
And it's one of those works that whatever it's myriad factual and interpretive

266
00:19:22.921 --> 00:19:27.921
and accuracies still sets the program for how we look at the decadence and

267
00:19:28.561 --> 00:19:31.680
collapse of the Roman Empire.
Gibbon says,

268
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:36.860
if a man were called upon to fix the period in history of the world during which

269
00:19:37.321 --> 00:19:40.230
the condition of the human race was most happy and prosperous,

270
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.560
he would without hesitation name that which lapsed from the excession of Nerva

271
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.240
to the death of Marcus or yes,

272
00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.540
that is 96 to one 80 a day.

273
00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:53.880
He goes on there.

274
00:19:53.881 --> 00:19:58.650
United rains are possibly the only period in which the happiness of a great

275
00:19:58.651 --> 00:20:01.470
people was the sole object of government.

276
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:08.270
So it's this period of the so called good emperors against which the subsequent

277
00:20:08.461 --> 00:20:13.350
decline traced in Gibbons monumental work,
uh,
would take place.

278
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.353
<v 1>Okay.</v>

279
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:19.970
<v 0>Now,
as opposed to given we're not so confident that the Roman empire was so</v>

280
00:20:19.971 --> 00:20:22.130
wonderful for everybody involved,

281
00:20:22.131 --> 00:20:26.090
we have a somewhat more egalitarian outlook than Gibbons.
Gibbons never says,
oh,

282
00:20:26.091 --> 00:20:29.660
well what about the slaves?
Or,
oh,
hey,
what about the peasant?
Or,
Hey,

283
00:20:29.661 --> 00:20:33.290
the position of,
uh,
uh,
women in society.
Um,

284
00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.780
but more than that,

285
00:20:35.781 --> 00:20:40.730
I think we have some more doubt and hesitation as to whether any state,

286
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:44.590
particularly any powerful state,
um,

287
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.910
necessarily represents a,

288
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.950
of virtue or happiness for the poor.

289
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.000
The smooth functioning of the Roman government was less important than it was

290
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:58.300
for the property classes because the Roman state,

291
00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:03.340
like most states in so far is it practice.
The rule of law,
uh,

292
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.700
was set up to guarantee property,
not rights.

293
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.730
And you'll see Wickham when we come to read him.

294
00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:17.910
He emphasizes in the chapter on the burden of rule and the Roman Empire.

295
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:22.630
Uh,
this September 19th,

296
00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:26.920
the Roman empire was not organized to reward ordinary people

297
00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:29.590
to different degrees.

298
00:21:29.591 --> 00:21:34.120
And at varying times it did rely on slave labor.

299
00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:38.720
This is easy to exaggerate.
It's not a slave society.
Uh,

300
00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:43.450
it's not an overwhelmingly slave owning society,
but certainly,

301
00:21:43.451 --> 00:21:45.800
uh,
it,
uh,
um,
uh,

302
00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:50.820
many of its enterprises involved slavering it's laws were designed to protect

303
00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.780
the property of the wealthy rather than to mete out equal justice.

304
00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:59.530
Rome was an imperial power.
And as I will say in a moment,

305
00:21:59.531 --> 00:22:01.990
it was an extraordinarily tolerant one,

306
00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.600
but it was tolerant as long as you conform to their image of civilization.

307
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:10.030
Like many great imperial powers,

308
00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:15.330
it assumed that there were certain areas of life that were optional.

309
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.040
They were very tolerant with regard to religion,
for example.

310
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:24.120
But their definition of civilization was being like us.

311
00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:26.320
They were generous about that.

312
00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:31.040
They would make citizens of people from the Celtic lands of Britain,
uh,

313
00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:32.650
to Egypt.

314
00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:38.110
But this meant conforming to a certain set of standards,
beliefs,

315
00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.900
assumptions,
and way of life.

316
00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:44.230
Another thing that,
um,

317
00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:49.480
we now would descent from,

318
00:22:49.481 --> 00:22:54.100
given about is the efficiency of the Roman Empire to given in the 18th century,

319
00:22:54.101 --> 00:22:57.820
the Roman Empire appeared a marvel of efficiency,

320
00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:02.170
but really how could it be efficient?

321
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:06.880
The distances were so long and travel was so slow.

322
00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:12.720
This is an empire that took weeks and weeks to traverse in the state of

323
00:23:13.661 --> 00:23:14.740
communications.

324
00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:20.490
And we know from Contemporary Times that even with great communications need

325
00:23:21.461 --> 00:23:23.470
with instantaneous communications.

326
00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:27.760
It's very hard to hold states together.
And in fact,

327
00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:32.910
one of the things that's happened in the last 50 years is the weakening of the

328
00:23:33.041 --> 00:23:35.230
state,
strangely enough,
strangely,

329
00:23:35.231 --> 00:23:38.590
because what people thought was going to happen is what had been going on in the

330
00:23:38.591 --> 00:23:41.860
20th century.
Generally,
states have become more and more powerful,

331
00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.250
more and more dictatorial,
more and more.
Um,
uh,
uh,

332
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:51.280
tyrannical and indeed George Orwell's 1984 written in the post war era in the

333
00:23:51.891 --> 00:23:52.681
late 1940.

334
00:23:52.681 --> 00:23:56.660
[inaudible] assumes that totalitarianism is what's going to be generalized.

335
00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:00.920
In fact,
it turns out that the problem is not so much the state.

336
00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:06.710
Look at the great states of the mid 20th century,
you know,
one no longer exists,

337
00:24:06.711 --> 00:24:11.450
the Soviet Union and the other,
the United States,
uh,
uh,

338
00:24:11.451 --> 00:24:14.330
you know,
whatever our strengths are,

339
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:18.410
it doesn't seem to be the extraordinary power of the central government,

340
00:24:18.411 --> 00:24:23.060
which is in fact much reduced from what it was in Saint 1950.
Uh,

341
00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.220
by,
by,
uh,
any measurement.

342
00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.520
So we have a different idea of the state.

343
00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:33.550
We're more aware of the limitations of state power in press times.

344
00:24:34.041 --> 00:24:38.600
We're more aware of the discrepancy between the rhetoric of power.
And that no,

345
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:44.110
a polity equals the Roman empire for it's ceremonies of power.

346
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:50.600
It's architecture of power,
it's culture of power,
um,

347
00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:55.130
but the emperor in fact,
however glorious,
however much in the third century,

348
00:24:55.131 --> 00:24:58.430
was worshiped as a god.
A,
his power was limited.

349
00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:02.660
His power was limited in terms of enforcement,
if not in theory,

350
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:08.270
and this will be important because right from the start we're going to assess

351
00:25:08.271 --> 00:25:12.500
the accomplishments of the emperor Diocletian at the end of the third century

352
00:25:12.501 --> 00:25:13.610
and the Emperor Constantine,

353
00:25:13.611 --> 00:25:17.720
beginning of the forts threat who may be said to have saved the empire from

354
00:25:17.721 --> 00:25:18.554
collapse.

355
00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:24.550
The thing about the Roman Empire that is indisputable and does not have a value

356
00:25:25.431 --> 00:25:27.860
judgment attached to it is that it was enduring.

357
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:33.950
The Roman empire lasted for an incredibly long time.

358
00:25:33.951 --> 00:25:38.330
It was stable
in a year for 10,

359
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:43.900
the Visigoths sacked plundered a Rome.

360
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:48.990
I entered the city of Rome's so called barbarian tribe and they pitched it.

361
00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:54.230
They pillaged it in a fairly orderly way,
but nevertheless they pillaged it.

362
00:25:55.400 --> 00:26:00.290
This was the first time this had happened in the city of Rome in something on

363
00:26:00.291 --> 00:26:02.270
the order of 800 years.

364
00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:10.370
The empire itself by this time was nearly 400 years old.

365
00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:19.860
The other indisputable accomplishment of the Roman Empire is that it controlled

366
00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:21.070
the Mediterranean.

367
00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:27.210
The Mediterranean was its center referred to often as Maray no strong as our

368
00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:31.163
<v 1>Si,</v>

369
00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:42.660
<v 0>our c because they controlled all of the shoreline of the Mediterranean.</v>

370
00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:45.270
The only power that has ever done that

371
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:51.690
there have been great empires.
The Ottoman Empire,
the Byzantine Empire,

372
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.870
the caliphate,

373
00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:59.690
but none of them controlled more than,
uh,
um,

374
00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:04.310
about 40% of the Mediterranean at any one time.

375
00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:11.600
So even if we dissent from Gibbons calm assurance that the best period of human

376
00:27:11.601 --> 00:27:14.180
history was the era of the good emperors in the second century,

377
00:27:14.181 --> 00:27:19.181
a d we shouldn't minimize the accomplishments of this empire and of this era to

378
00:27:20.001 --> 00:27:25.001
live in security with respect to both outside enemies and ex internal disorder

379
00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:33.290
essentially piece.
And the rule of law,
uh,
was unusual.

380
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:36.020
And unfortunately it remains so.

381
00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.920
Rome was an immense empire,

382
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:43.760
stretched from England to the Sahara from Spain to Armenia.

383
00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.300
It had a common language of administration,

384
00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.180
Latin and two cultural languages.

385
00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:55.210
Greek and Latin understood by the elite from one end of the empire to the other.

386
00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:00.380
The cities were not walled until the third century

387
00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:05.450
given in particular emphasizes the tolerance of Rome,

388
00:28:05.451 --> 00:28:08.630
which appealed to his innate anticlerical at some.

389
00:28:08.631 --> 00:28:10.730
And as many of you know,

390
00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:14.480
his explanation for the fall of the empire was Christianity.

391
00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:20.000
It was Christianity that weekend.
The empire weakened.
It's elite,

392
00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:25.270
turns its attention to foolish controversies over trinitarian or Christological

393
00:28:26.301 --> 00:28:29.570
concerns when they should have been concentrating on the barbarians.

394
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:34.700
But this is not,
uh,
uh,
accepted any more,
uh,

395
00:28:34.701 --> 00:28:38.300
for reasons that will become clearer in these first few weeks.

396
00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.450
And,
um,

397
00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:46.070
it's appeal though the idea of toleration is very important to give and writing

398
00:28:46.071 --> 00:28:50.180
in the 18th century when Europe had just emerged from centuries of religious

399
00:28:50.181 --> 00:28:53.870
wars,
having seen the wars of the reformation,
well not literally,

400
00:28:53.871 --> 00:28:54.740
he hadn't lived through them,

401
00:28:54.741 --> 00:28:59.741
but being the inheritor of these religious wars of the 30 years' war in Germany

402
00:29:00.051 --> 00:29:04.250
in the 17th century of religious controversy in Britain,

403
00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:09.500
a gibbon,
like many members of the enlightenment generation,

404
00:29:09.501 --> 00:29:14.150
he was part of a thought that the world would be far better if religion remain

405
00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:18.980
either a exclusively private matter or just disappeared.

406
00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:21.530
So for him,
the villain in history,

407
00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.370
and in particular the villain in Roman history is religion.

408
00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.440
But however tolerant of course,
uh,

409
00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:33.440
roam drew the line at Christianity

410
00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.490
for reasons we shall discuss.

411
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:41.030
But it is still historically quite unusual.

412
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:45.730
The empire should have permitted all of these other religions.

413
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:50.320
Indeed.
Rather than re guarding,
say the religions of Egypt as inferior,

414
00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:53.950
they simply brought those gods in Monday.

415
00:29:53.951 --> 00:29:58.330
You might worshiped Zeus and Tuesday,
Hey,
if you want it to,
uh,
you know,

416
00:29:58.331 --> 00:30:02.950
see if isis was,
they're going to help you,
uh,
with your,
um,
uh,

417
00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:07.840
impending business deal.
Why not go and see a,
um,
uh,
an Egyptian temple?

418
00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:12.580
So it's a collectors a little bit like the way Americans dine out,
you know,
uh,

419
00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:17.350
uh,
it makes no sense to most people in most of the world to say something like,

420
00:30:17.351 --> 00:30:21.880
Oh,
I don't want Japanese food.
I had that for lunch.
No,
I mean,
if you're in Japan,

421
00:30:21.881 --> 00:30:24.910
you are expected of Japanese food for lunch and for dinner.

422
00:30:24.911 --> 00:30:28.600
And same with Italian food.
The same is true of religion.

423
00:30:28.601 --> 00:30:30.430
Most people don't just say,
oh,

424
00:30:30.431 --> 00:30:32.510
I don't want to go to a Presbyterian church this weekend.
Go,

425
00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:37.600
go well worship at a Buddhist temple.
Just,
uh,
just,
uh,
for change.

426
00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:41.080
Um,
this is more in the nature of Roman religion.

427
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:44.680
So this kind of tolerance is unusual.

428
00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:51.070
Uh,
so tolerance,
tolerance is a real virtue of the empire,

429
00:30:51.071 --> 00:30:55.630
even if it's limited real virtue because it's,
it's,
it's unusual historically.

430
00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:59.180
Um,
piece,

431
00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:04.940
the Roman Empire spent half of its state budget on the army.

432
00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:08.390
On the other hand,
no empire.

433
00:31:08.391 --> 00:31:11.990
This large could be held together by military means alone.

434
00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:18.340
It was held together by any elite that shared notions of civilization that made

435
00:31:19.911 --> 00:31:24.390
certain sacrifices for the public good.
Those games,
uh,

436
00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:28.180
uh,
the,
uh,
circuses,
the competitions,
uh,

437
00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.980
the ceremonies where usually paid for by private people,

438
00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.990
not by the state for example.

439
00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:36.843
<v 1>Okay.</v>

440
00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:41.500
<v 0>It is an urban civilization with an elite that is urban.</v>

441
00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:45.673
<v 1>The cities</v>

442
00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:51.220
<v 0>held their local gods.
They had local administration,</v>

443
00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:55.120
they built aqueducts,
temples,
law courts,

444
00:31:55.121 --> 00:31:59.370
all these edifices that I mentioned earlier.
Um,

445
00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:01.840
it was a cosmopolitan way of life.

446
00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.950
So it's diverse in the sense that there are many different peoples,

447
00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:10.000
but unified in the sense that the elite shares a common language.

448
00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:14.860
And even the city planning is the same.
If you went to London or you went to Tim,

449
00:32:14.861 --> 00:32:18.910
God in what's now the Algerian desert,
you'd know your way around,

450
00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:21.000
you'd know where to find the marketplace.

451
00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.170
You'd know that it was laid out in a grid.

452
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:26.800
You'd know where the law courts would be in relation to the temples.

453
00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:32.310
You could find joy just as,
you know,
if you get off the interstate,
you know,
uh,

454
00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:36.890
but there'll be a,
a,
you know,
a Wendy's or identities or you know,

455
00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.600
a shell station.
Uh,
and uh,
yeah,

456
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.610
it would be an exceptional place that didn't have them.
And you know,

457
00:32:43.611 --> 00:32:46.010
if you couldn't find,
uh,
you know,

458
00:32:46.011 --> 00:32:49.940
a home depot even without benefit of technical,
uh,

459
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.600
AIDS getting off an exit of the average interstate highway that,
you know,
you,

460
00:32:53.601 --> 00:32:56.300
you don't live in America or you haven't been here very long.

461
00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.680
So it was the same thing.
Um,

462
00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:02.990
there's a sort of a mental picture of what a city looks like from one end of the

463
00:33:02.991 --> 00:33:05.210
empire to the other.

464
00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:12.170
But it is an empire that is centered around the Mediterranean and not just

465
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:15.920
logistically or politically,
but culturally for the Romans,

466
00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:21.550
their empire included lands where all of trees didn't grow and where in wine

467
00:33:21.591 --> 00:33:26.030
grapes didn't flourish,
but those places were not places they wanted to live.

468
00:33:26.031 --> 00:33:28.970
They wanted to control them.
But,
um,

469
00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:34.220
they were beyond civilizations.
So a government official on the Danube,

470
00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:38.720
uh,
in what's now Hungary writes home complaining that quote,

471
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:42.080
the inhabitants lead the most miserable of lives for the cultivate.

472
00:33:42.081 --> 00:33:45.980
No olives and they drink no wine.
Ended up story.

473
00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:51.080
And you can imagine there's a certain kind of east coast discourse on the order

474
00:33:51.081 --> 00:33:55.700
of they have blueberry bagels out here.
I can't live here or you know,

475
00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:02.530
little nearest Starbucks is 30 miles away and there's no substitute.

476
00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:07.130
This is an impressive empire that,
and so it's flaws.

477
00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.720
Uh,
it has,
um,

478
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:14.840
an imbalance between the urban and the rural.

479
00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.820
Not as great as historians once thought,

480
00:34:16.821 --> 00:34:21.260
but it is dominated by cities but depend on peasants.

481
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:24.500
But the tend to drain the land of its vitality.

482
00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.280
It's also imbalanced east,
west,

483
00:34:28.281 --> 00:34:30.890
strangely enough for an empire that was founded in the west,

484
00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:36.920
by the time we start the east is more prosperous,
it's more urban,

485
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:40.880
it has more trade,
it's better organized,

486
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:46.820
more commercial.
Another flaw.

487
00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:49.130
This empire is its size and you know,

488
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:52.970
it works for a long time and then when it doesn't work,

489
00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:56.720
this becomes a real problem.
And then the army,

490
00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:01.900
the army in the third century discovers that it can make and unmake emperors.

491
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:05.600
So the immediate crisis of the third century,

492
00:35:05.601 --> 00:35:10.340
which lasts from two 35 to the excession of Diocletian in two 84,

493
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:13.940
is that it has dozens and dozens of emperors.

494
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:18.950
Most rain for less than three years,
all but one die violently.

495
00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:21.500
So the two things are linked.

496
00:35:21.501 --> 00:35:26.390
The power of the army to proclaim an emperor and the inability of that emperor

497
00:35:26.391 --> 00:35:30.800
to keep his power before the army or an army somewhere in one province or

498
00:35:30.801 --> 00:35:31.970
another,
uh,

499
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:36.320
rises up another emperor and kills the former one.

500
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:42.360
So it's a durable and prior,
but an unwieldy and in certain respects,

501
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:47.170
exhausted one.
So in the first part of the course,

502
00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:52.260
we're going to look at how this empire function and we're going to look at it's

503
00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:57.310
two great crises.
The first of them,
this third century crisis,

504
00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:04.140
which involves all these many different emperors also has invasions from Persia,

505
00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:09.940
also has the first indications of barbarian invasions across the frontier of the

506
00:36:09.941 --> 00:36:11.680
Danube and the Rhine rivers.

507
00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.210
But it survives this first crisis.

508
00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:19.870
And that is the accomplishment of Diocletian about whom you're going to be

509
00:36:19.871 --> 00:36:20.704
reading.

510
00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:26.040
The second crisis that of the fifth century is similar in many respects,

511
00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:32.610
but more final in its results.
The third,

512
00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:37.560
the fifth century crisis witnesses the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West,

513
00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:42.090
the fall of the Roman empire of given that given made famous.

514
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:46.260
And that continues to inspire a certain amount of fascination and fear today.

515
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:53.390
So here are some questions that we're should be in the back of your mind at

516
00:36:54.061 --> 00:36:55.470
least a while.

517
00:36:55.471 --> 00:36:58.230
You do this reading for the first few weeks when we're talking about the

518
00:36:58.231 --> 00:37:00.360
collapse or weakening of the Roman Empire.

519
00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:03.900
Did this happen because of foreign threats or internal weakness?

520
00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:10.220
The rhetorical topo center often invoked with regard to empires in the modern

521
00:37:10.231 --> 00:37:12.090
world is internal weakness.

522
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:18.200
That's because the opponents don't seem very savage or very,
uh,
impressive,

523
00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:23.870
but,
um,
it's not necessarily a given.
Uh,

524
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:26.010
as I said before,
external enemies,

525
00:37:26.011 --> 00:37:30.470
even the don't impure to be that imposing can,
uh,

526
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:33.030
under certain circumstances,
um,

527
00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:37.320
impress their will on what would seem to be a more powerful empire to some

528
00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:37.681
extent.

529
00:37:37.681 --> 00:37:42.681
That is indeed because of internal weakness but at won't do to exaggerate that.

530
00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.570
But this is one of the,
one of the problems,

531
00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:48.540
another problem is continuity versus change.

532
00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:53.810
The East survives the east even flourishes for awhile and even for a while seems

533
00:37:54.751 --> 00:37:58.680
to be on the verge of reconquering the West from the barbarians.

534
00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:02.360
So how can we talk about the fall of the Roman Empire when,
you know,

535
00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:04.140
only part of it false.

536
00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:11.330
Another question is how did the rise of Christianity affect the political and

537
00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.910
cultural fortunes of the empire?
As I said,

538
00:38:14.911 --> 00:38:18.480
Gibbon said it affected its fortunes by you know,
or destroying it.

539
00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:22.050
But beyond that,
I think over simple explanation,

540
00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:25.470
how did Christianity change the empire?

541
00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:30.790
Was this change a catastrophe or a transformation?

542
00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:35.800
And how did Christianity triumph?

543
00:38:35.801 --> 00:38:39.580
It seems to be so alien to everything.
Roman,

544
00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:43.920
how does it become,
uh,
uh,
the,
uh,

545
00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:48.970
official religion of the empire and how does it become indeed identified with

546
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:49.983
the empire?

547
00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.520
All of these questions are currently very much debated by historians.

548
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:57.910
I'm not going to have a definitive answer for you.
I have certain opinions.

549
00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:02.860
I'll present the information basically in accord with that.
But,

550
00:39:02.861 --> 00:39:07.780
uh,
um,
this is not something that has been scientifically proven or,

551
00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:10.150
uh,
received universal acknowledgement.

552
00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.730
So we begin this course with the reign of the emperor Diocletian to 84 to three

553
00:39:15.731 --> 00:39:16.510
oh five.

554
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:20.680
And we do this because he solved a number of problems which threatened the

555
00:39:20.681 --> 00:39:23.260
survival of the empire in the third century.

556
00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:27.220
These problems,
as I said,

557
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:30.820
instability of rule Persian invasion,

558
00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:35.200
barbarian invasions,
and then one I didn't mention,
which is inflation,

559
00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.840
tremendous economic dislocation.

560
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:45.360
All of these are manifestations of the longterm flaws just mentioned.

561
00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:47.590
But the thing about longterm flows,
I mean,
you know,

562
00:39:47.591 --> 00:39:52.591
you can point to longterm flaws in the Soviet empire or longterm falls flaws in

563
00:39:53.831 --> 00:39:54.664
the British empire,

564
00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:58.810
but why do they manifest themselves when they do or to put it in another way?

565
00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:04.000
Why does the empire go on and flourished for a couple of hundred years or a few

566
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.610
decades and then collapse.
