WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.220
Uh,

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.220
it does seem as if we are back to invasions again.

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.000
We end the course,
uh,
the way we began it except they're different invaders.

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.253
Um,

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.060
one thing that I'm sure professor frank will want you to get out of the vikings

6
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:21.090
course,
and not all of you are going to take that obviously.

7
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.740
So I will mention this as they did not have horned helmets.
Uh,

8
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:27.960
the horn helmet idea,
actually,

9
00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:32.961
Roberta frank has researched where this totally inaccurate idea comes from and

10
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.440
um,
uh,
why it is a in eradicable.

11
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.390
But,
um,

12
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.380
if there's one thing you should come out of the second part of this course,

13
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.030
knowing it's that,

14
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.260
so we're discussing people from Scandinavia,

15
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.070
different parts of Scandinavia who had different destinations,

16
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.820
so different parts of Scandinavia,
Denmark,
Norway,
Sweden,

17
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.400
different destinations,

18
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.470
the Frankish empire of Charlemagne for which they'd bear some responsibility for

19
00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:08.550
unraveling.
Uh,
Russia,
the British isles,

20
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.530
Iceland,
Greenland,
the new world.
Uh,

21
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.330
they certainly got around.
They're not always the same.
Um,
uh,

22
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.280
populations,
uh,
and they have different ambitions in different places.

23
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.490
Basically those ambitions can be divided into a rating,

24
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.990
trading and settling a,
these are not mutually exclusive.

25
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.740
A old,
usually they began by rating,
uh,

26
00:01:37.741 --> 00:01:42.720
almost always if they were dealing with a place that had people thus obviously,

27
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.070
um,
uh,
Iceland when they came didn't have people at all.

28
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.600
So they came there as a explorers or settlers.

29
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.590
Uh,

30
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.590
the crucial changeover is in their attacks on the British isles and on the

31
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.390
Frankish empire,
they begin as Raiders.
That is as seaborne.

32
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.463
Um,

33
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.170
warriors who would plunder a opportunistic targets,

34
00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:13.800
monasteries,
for example,
um,
and uh,

35
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.270
then leave with their,
uh,
spoils.

36
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.140
They also,
however,
were traders,

37
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.390
and I don't want to make too much of this as if it were a timeless statement,

38
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.600
but in the period we're dealing with rating and trading warrant all that far

39
00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:37.590
apart.
Uh,
when the Vikings in the east,

40
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.590
mostly from Sweden,
we're dealing with the,
um,

41
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.930
califit in Baghdad or the Byzantine Empire,

42
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.850
they found these targets too well organized with two,
uh,

43
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.250
um,
overpowering a military presence,
uh,

44
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.270
to intimidate in the way that they were able to do with Britain and the Frankish

45
00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:06.010
empire.
So here they were more traders.
Uh,
they brought,
um,

46
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.030
uh,
various products,
particularly slaves and for,

47
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.630
to the caliphate and to the Byzantine Empire.

48
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.370
And they came back with a lot of coins among other things.
Um,

49
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:19.150
uh,

50
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.070
80,000 coins from the caliphate have been found in Sweden alone.

51
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.420
So here they're traders,
settlers,
um,

52
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.670
they would,
uh,
eventually settle in the Frankish empire.

53
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.950
And in the,
um,
Anglo Saxon,
a kingdom of England,

54
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.520
uh,
they would settle in Ireland.
Indeed,

55
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.980
the city of Dublin was founded by the Vikings.

56
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.310
They would settle in Iceland completely.

57
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:52.000
That is the people who live in Iceland now are the descendants of mostly

58
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:56.920
Norwegian,
some Danish,
uh,
a settlers,
uh,
of the,

59
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:59.680
um,
10th and 11th centuries.
Uh,

60
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.710
they would even try to settle as far a field as Newfoundland.

61
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.720
Uh,
there is,
uh,
uh,

62
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.090
a place in Newfoundland that a is unmistakably by the archeological evidence,

63
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.920
a Viking site.
Um,
uh,
this doesn't ultimately work,

64
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.630
so it is wrong to think of them exclusively as savage warriors as barbarians.

65
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.891
But then again,

66
00:04:29.891 --> 00:04:34.180
we've seen that it's wrong to think of most of the invading peoples of the

67
00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:38.230
period we were discussing as just totally savage.

68
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.520
Raiders of these are extremely skilled Raiders.

69
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.780
And as I've just gotten through saying there Raiders with several different

70
00:04:46.781 --> 00:04:49.540
possible agendas.
They're very adaptive.

71
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.840
The question remains what made Scandinavia so powerful in the ninth and 10th

72
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.560
centuries,
especially since Scandinavia tends not to be,

73
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.290
um,
a,
um,

74
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.010
a major actor in European politics of the two periods in which it is r this one,

75
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.630
basically the ninth,
10th,

76
00:05:10.631 --> 00:05:15.631
11th centuries and the 17th century when the armies of Sweden under Gustavus

77
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.130
Adolphus terrorized,
um,
central Europe.
Uh,
the,

78
00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:22.990
uh,
that,
uh,

79
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.400
effort was ultimately ended not in central Europe,
in eastern Europe,

80
00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:31.780
by Russia and the Russians defeated the sweet sufficiently in the early 18th

81
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:34.960
century so that they basically never got themselves very heavily involved in

82
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:38.140
European politics.
Again,
um,

83
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.940
part of the answer of why Scandinavia,

84
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
why now is that we're dealing with another savage or certainly less civilized

85
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.760
population who erupt from their homeland and devastate a week,

86
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.560
but relatively rich society.

87
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.160
There is nothing very unusual about that.

88
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.800
We have seen it with the Roman empire.
Uh,
and uh,
uh,

89
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.830
you can see it later with such a successful campaigns as those are the Mongols

90
00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:16.940
in the 13th century.
So,
uh,

91
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.650
the other reason besides opportunity is tactics.

92
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.370
The Vikings were masters of the sea.

93
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.820
If you ever do go to Denmark,
Sweden or Norway,

94
00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:33.020
you must go to the Viking museums there.
They're absolutely enthralling.

95
00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:38.021
And you see these ships that seem unbelievably flimsy for the voyages that they

96
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:41.270
undertook on the other hand,

97
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:46.310
by reason of their small size and particularly shallow draft,

98
00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:51.311
that is to say they're able to be stable without being so deep underneath the

99
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:54.710
ship.
You know,
having a Keogh underneath,
um,

100
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.870
that they can't sail up rivers.

101
00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.500
They can both therefore go in the Atlantic,
uh,
uh,

102
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.350
and be stable enough to make the journey and go up rivers that are no more than

103
00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:10.080
five or six feet deep at points like the sand,
uh,

104
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.440
in France or the law in France.

105
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:17.470
And so they could raid far inland with these ships and as masters of seas and

106
00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:24.590
rivers,
they,
um,
could easily outrun the clumsy,

107
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.200
slow Carolingian armies.

108
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.950
They could rate a monastery,

109
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:36.380
check out another monastery the same afternoon,
uh Oh,
there's an army there.
Well,

110
00:07:36.381 --> 00:07:39.350
we'll just get back in the ship and we'll go further down and then we'll,

111
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.970
we'll look for more tempting targets,
palaces,
towns,

112
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.500
uh,
monasteries.
They were not good at fortification.

113
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:52.040
If a place was fortified,
they tend to,
to pass it by.

114
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.310
They were not siege masters.
Uh,

115
00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:00.340
their control therefore of the water is not dissimilar to the Arabs advantage.

116
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.510
Uh,

117
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:06.680
and in the beginning of the Arab expansion that we talked about with regard to

118
00:08:06.681 --> 00:08:09.440
the desert,
the desert functions the same way,

119
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.910
an environment that these people controlled in the sense that they could

120
00:08:13.911 --> 00:08:18.911
maneuver easily in it and they're more civilized opponent with larger armies

121
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.213
could not.

122
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:27.670
The Persian and the Byzantine armies couldn't really go very far into the

123
00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:32.030
desert.
They had supply line water problems.

124
00:08:32.031 --> 00:08:36.180
They actually didn't know the desert all look the same to them.
Uh,

125
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:41.260
so this is the same or at least a similar advantage for the vikings.

126
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.940
The Vikings are different from other Raiders,
uh,

127
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:51.970
partly in their ability to construct governments not only to settle lands,

128
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:58.020
but to create governments ranging from the,
you know,

129
00:08:58.021 --> 00:09:02.970
what advertises itself with some accuracy as the world's oldest democracy,

130
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.760
Iceland,
where,
you know,

131
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:10.790
tourists are still pointed out the place where the kind of parliament of all,

132
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.160
um,
uh,

133
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:17.850
citizens took place as early as I'm a thousand years ago.

134
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:22.020
And there are also the founders of Russia,
uh,

135
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.500
probably not to be advertised as the world's oldest democracy.

136
00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:29.280
I was certainly not a country that's had a whole lot of experience with that

137
00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:31.470
particular form of government.
But in fact,

138
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:35.880
the first Christian rulers of Russia,
uh,

139
00:09:35.881 --> 00:09:40.881
the same of [inaudible] and his successors who were baptized and crowned by

140
00:09:42.001 --> 00:09:44.580
Byzantine under Byzantine auspices,

141
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.880
we're a Scandinavian and the Scandinavian groups are called the roost.

142
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.220
They quickly lose their,
um,

143
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.100
Scandinavian language and identity,
but nevertheless,

144
00:09:56.101 --> 00:10:00.660
that is the founding dynasty of the first Russian rulers.

145
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:07.220
So the Vikings,
uh,
uh,
have a fascinating culture and literature,

146
00:10:07.221 --> 00:10:08.190
uh,
uh,

147
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:13.250
amazing sagas mostly preserved through their Icelandic versions.

148
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:18.990
Um,
uh,
very interesting art,
very interesting forms of decoration.

149
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.200
Uh,
and then these magnificent,
uh,
ships,

150
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:28.320
their major contribution to the history of Europe may be geopolitical in the

151
00:10:28.321 --> 00:10:33.321
sense that they connect parts of the world that were otherwise minimally or not

152
00:10:35.371 --> 00:10:36.570
at all connected.

153
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.620
So from Central Asia to Greenland,

154
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:46.310
they build various kinds of cultural and particularly commercial,

155
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:48.210
uh,
networks.

156
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.300
They also contribute to the destroying of the Carolingian Empire to the

157
00:10:54.301 --> 00:10:57.390
destroying of what we were discussing before the vacation.

158
00:10:57.391 --> 00:11:02.100
They're not the sole cause we talked about weaknesses within the Carolingian

159
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:02.280
Empire,

160
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.560
but certainly the viking invasions of devastated at during the ninth century,
uh,

161
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.010
did not at all help.

162
00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:12.510
Where did this drive for expansion come from?
Uh,

163
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.510
besides opportunity.
Um,

164
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:19.460
and there's not a tremendous agreement on this point among scholars.
Uh,

165
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:24.500
overpopulation and land hunger are possible to this day.

166
00:11:25.441 --> 00:11:29.550
These are not densely populated countries.
Uh,

167
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:33.930
and in the pre modern period they could not support,

168
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:35.100
uh,

169
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:39.990
anything but a very small population given the fact that most of the land is not

170
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:45.090
capable of being cultivated.
So you can get to a point of overpopulation,

171
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:47.940
pretty quick light,
um,

172
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.590
opportunities afforded by the weakness of others.
I mentioned us,

173
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.350
uh,
internal feuding and the creation of exiles.

174
00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.980
Uh,
it's hard to separate legend from history,

175
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:03.460
but the legends about the founding of Iceland and Greenland in particular

176
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.120
involve people who were too rowdy for the vikings.

177
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:12.640
I pause on that cause it's a little hard to imagine what such a person would

178
00:12:12.641 --> 00:12:16.170
have been like.
Uh,
nevertheless,
the Sagas,
uh,

179
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:21.130
tell us that various people were just too mean,
uh,
for,
um,

180
00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.870
quiet,
civilized,

181
00:12:22.871 --> 00:12:27.871
old Norway or even couldn't get their energies fulfilled by plundering the

182
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:33.070
Frankish empire and went off to Iceland and places like that.

183
00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.620
Uh,
the climate conditions may have been favorable.

184
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.780
It may have been relatively warm.
Uh,

185
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.970
there's a lot of debate about the settlement of Greenland,
uh,

186
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.650
in this regard in particular.
Um,

187
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.340
we know that by the 12th and 13th centuries,

188
00:12:51.341 --> 00:12:55.660
Greenland was becoming too cold for the Scandinavians,
uh,

189
00:12:55.750 --> 00:13:00.750
and not for the Internet who were better adapted to real polar conditions.

190
00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:07.060
Um,
but,
um,
you know,

191
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:11.020
this is something that is a of crucial importance and tracing the history of

192
00:13:11.021 --> 00:13:14.470
climate,
uh,
and is a hotly debated,

193
00:13:14.471 --> 00:13:18.460
but it certainly looks as if it gets colder in the 13th,
14th century,

194
00:13:18.461 --> 00:13:23.200
14th century,
particularly,
uh,
throughout,
um,
uh,
Europe and the Atlantic.

195
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.480
And,
uh,

196
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:28.510
probably warmer in the 10th and 11th centuries when this expansion is taking

197
00:13:28.511 --> 00:13:30.790
place.
And then finally,

198
00:13:30.791 --> 00:13:35.791
there's a cultive personal valor that is even stronger than that of a early

199
00:13:36.461 --> 00:13:40.390
medieval Europe pain male cult of,
uh,

200
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.270
violent military bravery.

201
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:48.300
And the opportunity to demonstrate that a was a kind of competitive sport.

202
00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:57.190
The Viking raids in England and the continent begin around 800.

203
00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:57.911
Uh,

204
00:13:57.911 --> 00:14:02.911
one of the first stunning events is the sac of the island monastery of Linda's

205
00:14:04.781 --> 00:14:06.610
farm on the coast.

206
00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:11.620
The eastern coast of northern England monastery of Lindisfarne was sacked by the

207
00:14:13.631 --> 00:14:16.330
Vikings in seven 97.

208
00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:23.200
Charlemagne was able to,
uh,
repulse these raids,

209
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.560
uhh,
and the English as well.

210
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:33.300
But the civil wars that we were talking about among the sons of Louis,

211
00:14:33.491 --> 00:14:35.950
the pious,
um,

212
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.790
started to,
um,

213
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:44.710
encourage the vikings and directly by the disunity of the Frankish empire,

214
00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:49.840
the wasting a military resources on what was in effect,
a kind of civil war.
Um,

215
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:50.350
uh,

216
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:55.350
but also the vikings just get stronger and more ambitious because their raids on

217
00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:59.120
relatively well organized Britain,
um,
uh,

218
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:03.010
start to reach their height in,
um,
the eight 30 days.

219
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:09.470
So you start having the abandonment of monasteries,

220
00:15:09.471 --> 00:15:13.700
for example,
the abandonment of Linda's farm and the moving of its relics.

221
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:18.730
So the relics of Saint Cuthbert of York move around lot monks on the western

222
00:15:20.751 --> 00:15:25.350
coast of France,
uh,
abandoned their monasteries and,
uh,

223
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.940
move their communities and relics further inland.

224
00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:31.643
Um,

225
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.960
the vikings seem to jockey between emphasizing raids on the Frankish empire and

226
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.470
on England,
uh,
but basically they're doing both.

227
00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:47.890
They start to spend the winter what's called overwintering in the late eight

228
00:15:48.081 --> 00:15:49.610
thirties,
early eight forties.

229
00:15:49.611 --> 00:15:53.900
And that's a sinister sign from the point of view of the English Irish and,
uh,

230
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:54.530
Frank's,

231
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:59.530
because that means that they're going from rating to some form of settling.

232
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:05.010
And if they can spend the winter and not just the classic rating season,

233
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:09.980
why not just stay permanently?
So,

234
00:16:09.981 --> 00:16:13.820
um,
they start coming up the rivers.

235
00:16:13.821 --> 00:16:16.310
They start plundering,
uh,
uh,

236
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:21.190
cities that are not sufficiently fortified.
Uh,
uh,

237
00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.110
a monk in the eight sixties writes,

238
00:16:24.111 --> 00:16:28.960
the number of ships grows every year.
You have the feeling of just this,
uh,

239
00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:33.140
a complete takeover.
And now that's the monastic point of view.

240
00:16:33.141 --> 00:16:37.580
The monasteries were ideal targets because they're rich,
isolated,

241
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:42.040
uh,
and um,
minimally fortified.
Uh,

242
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:44.260
but nevertheless,
the,
um,
uh,

243
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.750
the Carolinians have no fleet to match the viking ships.

244
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:52.880
The way to stop the vikings.
And it was only really implemented,

245
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.850
um,
uh,
in the late seventies and eighties.

246
00:16:55.851 --> 00:16:58.310
The way to stop the vikings was with fortified bridges.

247
00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:01.100
If you built a bridge to the vikings,

248
00:17:01.101 --> 00:17:05.660
could not go past without fighting and fortified it sufficiently and had

249
00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:10.400
sufficient numbers of troops,
you would stymie them.
Uh,
and,

250
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:14.930
uh,
this is eventually what happens in the late 19th century.

251
00:17:14.931 --> 00:17:19.160
The Vikings are defeated at the gates of Paris in 1888.

252
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:24.320
Um,
and,
um,
uh,
eight,

253
00:17:24.321 --> 00:17:26.090
eight,
85,
eight 86,
rather.

254
00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:30.680
And they start accommodating with the,
uh,
European rulers.

255
00:17:30.681 --> 00:17:35.660
That is to say they are given lands to settle,
uh,
and then,

256
00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:40.130
um,
uh,
promised,
uh,
made to promise to stop rating.

257
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:44.800
And in effect,
they start to settle down towards the end of the ninth century,
uh,

258
00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.960
beginning of the 10th century.
So that,
for example,

259
00:17:47.961 --> 00:17:51.930
a treaty in nine 11 with the Frankish ruler,

260
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:56.700
West Frankish ruler,
the ruler,
we can start to call the king of France,
uh,

261
00:17:56.701 --> 00:18:01.701
allows them to settle in north western France in a territory that henceforth was

262
00:18:02.971 --> 00:18:07.900
called Norman Day.
Uh,
you know,
same in French,
uh,

263
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:09.180
Normandy.

264
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:14.180
The territory of the Northmen is one what they're usually referred to in the

265
00:18:15.211 --> 00:18:19.260
sources rather than Vikings.
The territory of the Northmen.

266
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:24.440
So Normandy and nine 11 was a province settled by Vikings,

267
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:30.720
nominally loyal to the King of France.

268
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:35.670
The vikings very quickly lose their language.

269
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:39.900
By the time of the Duke of Normandy,
William the conqueror,

270
00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:45.000
150 or so years later,
uh,

271
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:49.480
they are Norman.
They speak French.
Uh,

272
00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:54.330
they are more French than anything else,
although,
uh,
a bit different.

273
00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.870
Uh,
their shifts still look a bit like Viking ships.

274
00:18:57.871 --> 00:19:00.180
If you know the bed by your tapestry,

275
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:05.390
which is this embroidery that shows the history of the Norman Conquest of

276
00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:05.970
England,
uh,

277
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:10.970
their ships look very much like our image of Viking ships in England.

278
00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:17.160
Uh,
the eight sixties are the zenith of their destruction.

279
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:21.930
They actually in effect partition England between a north,
uh,

280
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.750
um,
uh,
an eastern and a western part.

281
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:29.850
The eastern part becomes a territory called the Dane law.
Uh,
the,

282
00:19:29.851 --> 00:19:33.180
uh,
uh,
place where the Danes have settled

283
00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:40.880
and they are indirect effect on England is to force the Anglo Saxon Kingdoms to

284
00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:42.443
unify.

285
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:47.430
So rather than the multiple kingdoms that we looked at at beads time,

286
00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.820
Marsha,
east,
Anglia,
North Umbria,

287
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.920
we have the western kingdom formerly called Wessex,

288
00:19:56.310 --> 00:20:01.310
which under King Alfred in the eight sixties to eight eighties,

289
00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:04.610
becomes really,
uh,

290
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:10.310
the sole Anglo Saxon Kingdom of England and gradually defeats the Vikings

291
00:20:11.431 --> 00:20:12.520
eventually,
uh,

292
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:17.600
kicking them out of the British isles altogether by about nine 30 or so.

293
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:24.860
So the conquests in the Frankish and English realms are not permanent in the

294
00:20:27.961 --> 00:20:29.870
sense that,
uh,

295
00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:35.040
there's minimal Scandinavian impact of a permanent sword on these places.

296
00:20:36.421 --> 00:20:37.380
Uh,
you know,

297
00:20:37.381 --> 00:20:42.381
they're not a lot of people speaking old Norse in either place in 1100,

298
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:47.560
but their impact is tremendous in terms of organizing these places,

299
00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:51.050
creating networks,
founding cities like,
um,

300
00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.610
a Dublin reorganizing kingdoms like Ireland,
uh,

301
00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:00.700
creating Normandy and,
uh,
really,
uh,
kind of,
uh,

302
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.550
throwing the puzzle on the floor and reforming it

303
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:09.890
in the east and in the Atlantic.
Uh,

304
00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:15.120
here you have to imagine or sort of visualized Scandinavia sitting on the top of

305
00:21:15.851 --> 00:21:20.590
Europe.
Um,
the same effect that,

306
00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.450
um,
uh,

307
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:27.480
encourages airlines to use polar routes as a shorter way to cross the globe also

308
00:21:28.301 --> 00:21:32.230
allows the Scandinavians in effect to choose their targets.

309
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:36.460
Some of this is logical.
Norway is much easier,

310
00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:39.790
much closer to the British isles than you might think.

311
00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:42.750
It's sort of sits on top of them.
Um,

312
00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:47.260
and Sweden is much closer to a of the east,

313
00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:51.700
uh,
via the north than one would think.
But even Norway,
for example,

314
00:21:51.701 --> 00:21:55.930
the modern kingdom of Norway has of border with Russia.

315
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:59.990
Uh,
it goes so far north.
Uh,

316
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.670
and then it has this very little narrow,
um,

317
00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:07.970
a piece of land that is only about 30 miles from the important Russian port of

318
00:22:08.891 --> 00:22:09.724
Murmansk.

319
00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:15.030
And all of these places are relatively warm given how far north they are because

320
00:22:16.271 --> 00:22:20.920
of the Gulf stream.
So,
um,
just as,

321
00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.350
um,
uh,
you know,

322
00:22:23.351 --> 00:22:28.260
London is surprisingly warm considering that it's on the same latitude as a

323
00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.210
Newfoundland.
So these,
uh,

324
00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:35.830
on northern parts of Scandinavia are the equivalent of,
you know,
polar,

325
00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:40.180
a waste of northern Canada.
And yet they are,

326
00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:45.400
um,
they're,
they're cold enough.
Problem with them is they're really dark,

327
00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.710
so they're dark for months at a time,

328
00:22:47.711 --> 00:22:51.310
but they're not all that coal from this vantage point.

329
00:22:51.311 --> 00:22:56.311
Then the east would be attempting source of enterprise for vikings particularly,

330
00:22:59.351 --> 00:23:04.090
but not exclusively from Scandinavia,
especially in the 10th century.

331
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:10.420
They would go via the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Finland down the Russian

332
00:23:10.421 --> 00:23:10.930
rivers,

333
00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:15.610
like the Nipper nipper with a d two,

334
00:23:15.611 --> 00:23:20.350
the,
uh,
um,
black say,

335
00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.540
and the Volga to the Caspian Sea.

336
00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:34.530
They used these rivers as ways of reaching territories of Byzantine and of a

337
00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:41.790
California influence.
They,
uh,

338
00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:46.480
uh,
traded
a when possible.

339
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.070
<v 1>Okay.</v>

340
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:53.870
<v 0>Um,
a lot of our descriptions of the Vikings by outsiders are most accurate</v>

341
00:23:53.871 --> 00:23:57.310
descriptions are from Muslim travelers,
um,

342
00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:01.910
who describe who these people are,
what their products are.
Um,

343
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:06.940
even though very little remains in this region to a test to the vikings,

344
00:24:07.551 --> 00:24:12.551
the main evidence as we set our really coins taken back to Scandinavia,

345
00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:18.610
they're base that is the Viking base in this eastern area was what would become

346
00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:22.940
Kiev in modern Ukraine.

347
00:24:22.941 --> 00:24:27.941
And Kiev would be the first Russian Scandinavian kingdom ruled by a czar.

348
00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:34.880
They had ambitions to take over Constantinople,
uh,

349
00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:39.710
a city that they called in sort of,
um,
tall can esque fashion,

350
00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:44.740
Mikel Guard Miquel

351
00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:49.890
guard meaning city Micole meaning powerful Mikel still in middle English and

352
00:24:49.901 --> 00:24:53.450
Chaucer's English means,
uh,
uh,
um,
uh,

353
00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:58.960
impressive,
uh,
powerful.
But the,

354
00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:03.220
their attacks on Mikel Guard didn't work.
They the,
and eight,
60 and nine 41.

355
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:07.990
And we've seen that Constantinople was able to fight off a more impressive

356
00:25:07.991 --> 00:25:09.740
enemies than this.
Uh,

357
00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:14.230
they therefore were dealing with wealthy and established states.

358
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:18.460
Well organized states,
better organized than the Carolingian Empire,

359
00:25:18.461 --> 00:25:23.110
the Anglo Saxon Kingdoms.
And so states that they were capable of,
um,

360
00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:27.430
well the states that were capable of defeating them.
They,
uh,

361
00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:30.100
therefore came to these areas,

362
00:25:30.101 --> 00:25:34.050
Baghdad and Constantinople or controlled by Baghdad in Constantinople,

363
00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:38.920
more his Raiders.
Uh,
I mean more as traders then as Raiders.

364
00:25:38.921 --> 00:25:40.690
What did they bring to trade with?

365
00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:44.910
They have certain classic products,
uh,

366
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:49.990
things from the North Sea like,
um,
Walrus,
ivory,

367
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.490
very highly prized,

368
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:56.040
<v 1>um,
uh,</v>

369
00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:58.200
<v 0>amber from the Baltic Sea.</v>

370
00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:03.530
Amber used in jewelry and medicine.
Uh,
uh,

371
00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.770
a stone that's not really a stone,

372
00:26:07.771 --> 00:26:12.660
a thing that's much lighter than it looks like a credited with various kinds of

373
00:26:12.661 --> 00:26:17.661
mysterious or at least medicinal properties throughout the a Roman and as law

374
00:26:18.341 --> 00:26:22.440
and formerly Roman and Islamic world,
um,
arrows and swords.

375
00:26:22.441 --> 00:26:24.270
The West was very good at metalworking,

376
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:28.980
honey hunting falcons wax.

377
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:30.660
But as I said,

378
00:26:30.661 --> 00:26:35.661
they're two great commodities were slaves and furs slaves be societies of the

379
00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:44.100
Byzantine Empire and the Califit always wanted slaves.

380
00:26:44.101 --> 00:26:49.101
They had plenty of unpleasant labor as well as domestic service shortages.

381
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:52.260
And so,
uh,

382
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:57.410
many of these slaves were Slavs Slavic populations rounded up by the vikings and

383
00:27:00.391 --> 00:27:03.900
then sold in Constantinople or Baghdad.

384
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:07.440
First on the one hand,

385
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:12.530
first like sable Martin mink that abounded in the eastern Baltic regions and in

386
00:27:14.971 --> 00:27:19.971
what's now a northern Russia were tremendously prized in a world in which

387
00:27:21.241 --> 00:27:23.100
central heating was nonexistent.

388
00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:28.290
And although we may not think of modern Istanbul as particularly cold,

389
00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:30.030
uh,
it's quite cold and damp,

390
00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:35.360
one can certainly understand the practical desire for furs for well off people

391
00:27:36.271 --> 00:27:39.540
in the Byzantine Empire,
in the caliphate.
It may seem a little stranger,

392
00:27:39.541 --> 00:27:44.310
Baghdad is more noted for unbearable heat.
Then cold.
Uh,

393
00:27:44.311 --> 00:27:49.140
on the other hand,
the caliphate includes territory's like Afghanistan,

394
00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.760
um,
eastern,
uh,
around,
uh,
and,
uh,

395
00:27:53.761 --> 00:27:58.230
also keep in mind as is the case with Palm Beach and Miami Beach,

396
00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:03.250
even as we speak now in late November,
that,
um,
uh,

397
00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:07.090
for certain people,
the prestige of the firs,
uh,

398
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:10.920
transcends any need for practical warm.

399
00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:15.120
Um,
so,
uh,
these are the two great products.

400
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:17.770
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

401
00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:22.050
<v 0>Um,
so they're plumbed or nerd,</v>

402
00:28:22.051 --> 00:28:25.420
plunderers and extortionists,
but they're fairly creative.

403
00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:29.660
Plunderers and extortionists.
Uh,
they create,
uh,

404
00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:32.110
a number of trading cities,

405
00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.840
not only Kia of a further south,

406
00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.360
but the great city of Novgorod

407
00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:45.720
sort of between the Baltic and,
um,
um,
the more modern city of Moscow.

408
00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:52.080
These cities are fortified,
uh,
leading one to assume that they weren't just,

409
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:55.530
um,
free trade zones that,
uh,

410
00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:59.520
other people rated them or that the vikings expected other people to try to

411
00:28:59.521 --> 00:29:03.780
revenge themselves on their kind of rating and trading.

412
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:05.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

413
00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.040
<v 0>So anyway,
as we've said before,</v>

414
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:12.080
tre trading and plundering are not necessarily totally distinct.

415
00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:18.543
<v 1>Okay.</v>

416
00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:23.670
<v 0>So,
um,
finally the West,</v>

417
00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:29.570
the vikings begin to explore the Atlantic mostly from Norway.

418
00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.250
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

419
00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:38.250
<v 0>And beginning after the maximum period of rating of England starts to tail off</v>

420
00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.370
in the,
um,
in the eight sixties,

421
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:46.420
these lands were uninhabited,

422
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:50.980
Iceland or minimally inhabited inhabited Greenland.

423
00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:56.670
Um,
they were very attractive for hunting and for pasturing

424
00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:02.650
where the vikings found a fair density of people.

425
00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:06.670
They tended not to stay.
This is their problem with Newfoundland.

426
00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:12.120
They have a settlement in Newfoundland at a place whose modern name is a

427
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:18.280
somewhat confusingly called [inaudible] aux meadows,

428
00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.380
sort of a French and English,
uh,

429
00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:28.330
compound loss aux meadows in Newfoundland,
one of a number of,

430
00:30:28.331 --> 00:30:31.750
certainly the most best known viking site.

431
00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:36.350
But there were,
um,
uh,
um,

432
00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:40.210
native Americans who drove them out,

433
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:45.120
not necessarily because they were superior in,
um,

434
00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:50.320
armament,
but,
uh,
it just wasn't really worth it to the Vikings,
uh,
to stay.

435
00:30:50.321 --> 00:30:53.680
So they're staying in Newfoundland is relatively brief

436
00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:01.360
in order to go from Norway to Iceland,
about 800 miles,

437
00:31:01.361 --> 00:31:05.690
and it took anywhere between one week and one month.
Uh,

438
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:10.710
the island is not as cold as its name suggests it has glaciers.

439
00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:15.970
But,
um,
you know,
in the part that don't have glaciers,
it's,
uh,

440
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.410
it's not,
uh,
it's not all that cold.
Um,

441
00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:25.060
again,
the Gulf Stream,
uh,
most of it is uninhabitable,

442
00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:27.340
but that's because of volcanic rock.

443
00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:29.200
I don't know how many of you have been to Iceland,

444
00:31:29.201 --> 00:31:34.201
but even the drive from the airport to Reykjavik is intimidating because it goes

445
00:31:35.021 --> 00:31:37.480
through this stuff called [inaudible] and you know,

446
00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:42.320
there are no trees and there's sort of no prospect of anything,
uh,
uh,

447
00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:46.940
growing there.
But on the other hand,
there are plenty of,
uh,

448
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:51.490
uh,
nice coastal strips,
mild climate,

449
00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:54.700
great pasture.
There are almost no trees now.

450
00:31:54.701 --> 00:31:57.460
And there's a lot of debate about whether there were trees,

451
00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:02.540
whether they just cut them down and they couldn't be a re,
uh,

452
00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:07.150
re cultivated.
Uh,
but in fact,
this is a very hospitable place.

453
00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:12.390
Rich pastures seem mammals everywhere until Iceland completely lost its mind in

454
00:32:14.141 --> 00:32:19.141
the speculative atmosphere of the a decade proceeding 2008,

455
00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:24.910
their main industry was cod fishing.
Uh,
they,
uh,

456
00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:30.160
you know,
then went into banking in a way that just staggers the mind,

457
00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:35.300
uh,
and,
uh,
have gotten back into cod fishing.
Uh,
uh,

458
00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:38.260
my understanding is,
um,

459
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:42.530
but they had lots and lots of other things.
Um,
uh,

460
00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:45.020
lots of seals which they killed for,

461
00:32:45.021 --> 00:32:49.790
for a Walrus skin used for cable,
for ropes,
for ships,

462
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:52.040
a Walrus,
ivory,

463
00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:56.210
another little creature called a nar whale that has a Tusk that looks like a

464
00:32:56.211 --> 00:33:00.980
unit.
Weller was taken for being a Unicorn Tusk.
Uh,
there's one in the cloisters,

465
00:33:00.981 --> 00:33:01.814
for example,

466
00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:07.800
that some of you are going to see a on the 7th of December.

467
00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:13.790
So the colonization of Iceland,
um,
uh,
begins,

468
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:18.380
uh,
in,
uh,

469
00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:23.030
in,
uh,
uh,
uh,
eight 70,
and by nine 30.

470
00:33:23.031 --> 00:33:24.410
The island is basically full.

471
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:30.590
It's habitable land.
Again,
very,

472
00:33:30.591 --> 00:33:35.120
very small percentage of the land area was,
was fully settled.

473
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:40.580
We know a lot more about Iceland than any other part of Scandinavia.
Uh,

474
00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:42.870
because of the extraordinary,
uh,

475
00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:46.640
quality and quantity of poetic stories.

476
00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:50.450
Sagas um,
in which honor,

477
00:33:50.451 --> 00:33:55.250
treasure and love of mayhem dominate.
These are very violent,

478
00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:55.551
uh,

479
00:33:55.551 --> 00:34:00.551
until a certain point were taken to be realistic portrayals of life in isolate.

480
00:34:01.621 --> 00:34:05.330
And just as if say,
1950s in 1960s,

481
00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:10.340
TV westerns were assumed to be a totally accurate portrayal of life everywhere

482
00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:14.690
in the United States in the 19th century.
Uh,

483
00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:17.510
so these are like Westerns,

484
00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:22.850
a wonderful stories of male violence with a certain amount of exaggeration,

485
00:34:22.851 --> 00:34:26.360
but nevertheless,
the reflection of customs,

486
00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:30.530
ways of speaking and social values.

487
00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:37.190
Towards the end of the 10th century,
Greenland was explored.

488
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:39.620
Um,
and they're the leadership of Eric,

489
00:34:39.621 --> 00:34:44.621
the red one of these renegades so difficult and violent that he was exiled from

490
00:34:45.021 --> 00:34:48.280
both Norway and Iceland.
Uh,

491
00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:53.240
he is the one who seems to have dubbed this new territory.

492
00:34:53.241 --> 00:34:55.190
Greenland,
um,

493
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:59.660
a pioneer of deceptive advertising.

494
00:34:59.661 --> 00:35:03.830
I think it's fair to say because warm is,
it may have been in the 10th century.

495
00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:07.490
Uh,
this doesn't seem,
this is like,
you know,
uh,

496
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:11.540
calling some housing development,
uh,
uh,
you know,

497
00:35:11.541 --> 00:35:16.310
I'm warbling acres when in fact you've just bulldozed all the trees in order to,

498
00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:20.960
to create the development.
So,
um,

499
00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:26.570
the,
uh,
western coast of Greenland had rich pasture.
Uh,

500
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:31.580
the West is warmer than the east.
Um,

501
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:35.060
settlers came and beginning of 986,
uh,

502
00:35:35.061 --> 00:35:39.440
there was even a bishopric established at a place called,
uh,
uh,

503
00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:43.560
guard are other sort of a tall can ask name.

504
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:48.260
We don't know very many bishops who actually went to guard armed.

505
00:35:48.261 --> 00:35:50.550
Most of them are old from Denmark,
uh,

506
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:55.530
and sort of basically sold their flock to get in touch with them if they needed

507
00:35:55.531 --> 00:35:59.550
them.
I gave them their office hours and,
uh,
uh,
you know,
uh,

508
00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:02.940
had a phone that took messages,
but,
um,

509
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:08.400
uh,
this,
uh,
uh,
settlement did not last.

510
00:36:08.401 --> 00:36:12.120
Greenland was more or less abandoned by 1400,

511
00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:16.420
and then would later be in modern times resettled.
Um,
uh,

512
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:21.030
but this time by Denmark.
And then finally,
Norwegians from Greenland,

513
00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:26.040
a settled what's now Labrador and Newfoundland,
late 10th,
early 11th centuries,

514
00:36:26.041 --> 00:36:30.150
they even wrote a saga called the Vin Lund Saga.
Um,

515
00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:35.640
the inland map that's in the Beinecke library that purports to show both,

516
00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:40.890
uh,
the,
uh,
Chinese Mongol Empire and,
uh,

517
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.370
uh,

518
00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:46.370
the territory's of Finland in the new world is unfortunately a fake.

519
00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.830
Um,
but,
uh,
as I said,

520
00:36:49.831 --> 00:36:54.831
these archeological finds in Markland as the Vikings called Labrador or Finland

521
00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:58.580
as they referred to,
uh,
uh,

522
00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:02.130
Newfoundland are real.

523
00:37:02.131 --> 00:37:07.131
They were settled about your 1000 and abandoned in 10 20.

524
00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:09.600
<v 1>Okay.</v>

525
00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:14.340
<v 0>So here we are,
10 20 or the year 1000.</v>

526
00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:19.160
Uh,
and uh,
I know that you will be asking,
uh,

527
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:23.910
what has been accomplished since we began with two 84.

528
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.890
And is this a fair question?
Because at first glance,

529
00:37:28.891 --> 00:37:33.891
it would seem as if we're still in a world of declining population,

530
00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.540
uh,
a rural society,

531
00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:43.980
very few urban centers,
uh,

532
00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:48.660
a society of relatively little literacy,

533
00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:54.060
relatively small amounts of commerce,
lots of violence,

534
00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:01.340
lack of governmental order,
militarized society,

535
00:38:01.341 --> 00:38:06.110
all developments that we have been tracing since,
uh,
the beginning.

536
00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:12.460
The optimistic take on this is that beginning with the material covered in the

537
00:38:12.861 --> 00:38:13.694
next course,

538
00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:18.760
there's a very rapid ascent from 1000 to about 1300.

539
00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:24.040
A tremendous growth of the European economy and a tremendous expansion of both

540
00:38:26.301 --> 00:38:30.770
population,
uh,
artistic,
political,
intellectual creativity.

541
00:38:30.771 --> 00:38:35.270
That is the central period of the Middle Ages.

542
00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:39.150
The real mystery behind this,

543
00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:44.160
the sort of historical problem is what explains the domination of Europe and the

544
00:38:44.681 --> 00:38:47.530
second millennium,
80,
the first millennium,

545
00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:51.040
most of which we've covered in this course.
Uh,

546
00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:55.330
the dominant areas are the Mediterranean at the beginning,

547
00:38:55.331 --> 00:38:59.500
which includes Europe,
but also includes North Africa,
Egypt,

548
00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:02.200
the Middle East,
uh,
and modern Turkey.

549
00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:07.920
And indeed those latter regions would out pace Europe properly speaking.

550
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:15.720
The first millennium is something of a catastrophe for Europe at least by

551
00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:21.480
measurable statistics of a per capita GNP population,

552
00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:27.490
population density,
urbanization,
uh,
um,
nature.

553
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:34.120
What then explains the domination of Europe after 1000.

554
00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:37.300
Uh,
in some ways it's a slow process.

555
00:39:37.301 --> 00:39:42.301
The first European colonies don't really get established until the aftermath of

556
00:39:42.881 --> 00:39:45.550
Columbus's voyage in 1492.
Uh,

557
00:39:45.551 --> 00:39:49.900
and then they get established incredibly rapidly and with surprisingly little

558
00:39:49.901 --> 00:39:54.070
effort,
right?
Mexico and Peru,
these huge empires of the Aztecs,

559
00:39:54.071 --> 00:39:59.071
Mayans and Incas fall to a few hundred Spanish troops and the Spanish and

560
00:40:00.521 --> 00:40:02.050
Portuguese,
uh,

561
00:40:02.051 --> 00:40:07.051
of between 1492 and 1520 are all over the world from Malacca in a modern

562
00:40:08.021 --> 00:40:09.760
Malaysia to India,

563
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.990
to the Persian Gulf to Mexico.
Um,
and,
uh,

564
00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:18.880
Peru,
well,

565
00:40:18.881 --> 00:40:22.780
we don't have to explain that and that's for another time.

566
00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:27.530
But suffice it to say that already in 10 95,
the European,
uh,

567
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:32.670
Christian population is capable of putting together an army to conquer Jerusalem

568
00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:37.570
from Islam.
I seemingly impossible job,
uh,

569
00:40:37.571 --> 00:40:42.130
and certainly one that required more than logistics and resources.

570
00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:45.910
But also a certain kind of,
um,
uh,
if not fanaticism,

571
00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:49.570
at least a real motivation,
religious motivation.
Uh,

572
00:40:49.571 --> 00:40:54.571
but nevertheless it is a sign of a certain kind of European power that one would

573
00:40:54.731 --> 00:40:58.720
not have thought in the year 1000,
uh,
was possible.

574
00:40:58.721 --> 00:41:02.800
And the year 1000,
the smart money,
the,
um,

575
00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:04.090
you know,

576
00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:09.090
Brookings Institute think tank kind of Rand Corporation,

577
00:41:09.311 --> 00:41:11.260
Bain Consulting,
you know,

578
00:41:11.261 --> 00:41:14.560
all the smart people would have said,

579
00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.970
don't put any money into Europe.
You've gotta be kidding.
Uh,

580
00:41:18.971 --> 00:41:22.510
the coming regions are the same as,
uh,

581
00:41:22.511 --> 00:41:26.380
over the last couple hundred years.
Maybe Byzantium you know,

582
00:41:26.381 --> 00:41:29.960
a cautious by definitely the Islamic kingdoms,

583
00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:32.910
even if the caliphate is having some problems.
Kwok Kala,

584
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:37.160
their successor states Fatimid in Egypt.
Awesome,
awesome.
This,

585
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:41.990
this is going to dominate the next millennium.
Uh,
our,
uh,
you know,

586
00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:47.240
algorithms agree on this and um,
and,
uh,

587
00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:52.420
all sorts of promising signs in eastern Europe with the creation of [inaudible]

588
00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:56.460
younger hot shot a year,
um,
uh,

589
00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:01.580
consultants would have identified that,
but Germany,
Italy,

590
00:42:01.581 --> 00:42:05.930
France,
uh,
um,
uh,
the British isles,
uh,

591
00:42:05.931 --> 00:42:09.230
certainly would have seemed discouraging yet.

592
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:12.530
There are some promising signs.
As it turns out,

593
00:42:12.531 --> 00:42:17.470
the vikings are the last invaders.
The Vikings,
um,

594
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:21.590
coincide with invasions from the moggy,
ours

595
00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:27.050
Magyars that's what they call themselves.
To this day,

596
00:42:27.051 --> 00:42:31.070
they're known as the Hungarians to the outside world out of a confusion between

597
00:42:31.071 --> 00:42:35.390
them and the huns.
Uh,
they actually have nothing to do with the huns,
uh,

598
00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:40.520
but they were,
um,
quite frightening land based Raiders of the 10th century.

599
00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:45.730
And there were also attacks by ships from Muslim north Africa against Europe,

600
00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:51.120
what the sources referred to as Sarah's and pirates.
Um,

601
00:42:51.121 --> 00:42:55.690
and they plunder Roman eight 43,
for example.
Uh,
so,
um,

602
00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:00.500
Europe is certainly in the 10th century faced with yet another wave of
invasions.

603
00:43:00.501 --> 00:43:03.530
And I think I warned you at the beginning of this course that it was basically

604
00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:04.950
about,
uh,

605
00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:09.290
invasions and heresies and that you do well if you just concentrated on those

606
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:14.000
things.
So we're heresy free at the moment,
but in the 10th century,

607
00:43:14.001 --> 00:43:17.060
certainly how would we send patients guy as it happens there,

608
00:43:17.061 --> 00:43:19.250
the last that western Europe would experience,

609
00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:23.690
not eastern Europe because eastern Europe would be subject to the Mongols who

610
00:43:23.691 --> 00:43:28.150
would,
for example,
score a tremendous victory over the armies of Poland,
uh,

611
00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:32.900
armies over the Christian King of Hungary,
uh,
as well in the 13th century.

612
00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:36.860
Um,
but this seems to be the end of invasions.

613
00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:40.550
The beginning of a period of population increase,

614
00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.940
better nutrition,
better harvests,

615
00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:47.720
perhaps explicable to more settled conditions,

616
00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:52.130
perhaps explainable by improved climate,
um,

617
00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:57.140
perhaps just explainable by a human determination and enterprise.

618
00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:04.280
The Christianization of Europe is one of the tremendous phenomena that

619
00:44:04.281 --> 00:44:05.660
characterizes our period.

620
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:09.770
And while as a religious movement,

621
00:44:09.771 --> 00:44:13.850
I have no investment in saying that Christianity is either an advantage or

622
00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:17.270
disadvantage in terms of creating settled,

623
00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:22.370
organized policies.
The Christianization of places like Scandinavia,

624
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:27.470
Iceland or Bohemia,
the modern Czech Republic,

625
00:44:27.471 --> 00:44:31.800
more or less,
or Hungary or Russia,

626
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.820
all of which take place in the 10th or early 11th centuries.

627
00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:40.850
All of these Christianization conversions bring these polities into a kind of

628
00:44:43.471 --> 00:44:46.140
European cultural area,

629
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:50.580
political alliances,
trade networks.

630
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.000
So Christianization is as much a sign of civilization or at least have a kind of

631
00:44:58.231 --> 00:45:03.080
economic development,
uh,
as a,
uh,
you know,
um,

632
00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:04.350
a thing in itself.

633
00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:06.893
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

634
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:11.340
<v 0>So between 201,000,
what are the big differences?</v>

635
00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:15.270
Whether these are accomplishments or not is debatable.

636
00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:21.200
Certainly the population has declined over an 800 year period.

637
00:45:21.211 --> 00:45:23.880
The population of Europe is considerably less,

638
00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.820
not only in towns like Rome,

639
00:45:26.821 --> 00:45:31.800
which has gone from something on the order of over 500,000,

640
00:45:31.801 --> 00:45:36.710
perhaps as much as a million to 30,000 maximum.

641
00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:41.940
It is a much less Mediterranean centered world.

642
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:44.460
The sort of Geo politics have changed.

643
00:45:44.461 --> 00:45:49.461
The Mediterranean has broken apart into Islamic Byzantine and Latin,

644
00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.870
uh,
regions.

645
00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:59.210
It is Christian,
most of it,
most of Europe,
part from,

646
00:45:59.480 --> 00:45:59.930
uh,

647
00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:04.930
Spain is Christian and this entails all sorts of cultural as well as religious

648
00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:08.413
changes.

649
00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:13.480
It is also less learned and the learning that there is is a monopoly of the

650
00:46:14.271 --> 00:46:15.104
church.

651
00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:20.380
There is less lay or secular learning than there was.

652
00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:24.410
There are some continuity's.
However,

653
00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:30.130
the dominant language of learning and administration remains in 1000 as it was

654
00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:33.080
in 200 Latin.

655
00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:39.490
Roman culture is still the ideal end still in effect,

656
00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:41.390
the practice,

657
00:46:41.391 --> 00:46:45.500
even though it may be adapted to things like churches,

658
00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:51.100
but what has been called Romanesque or simply Roman architecture can move out of

659
00:46:52.281 --> 00:46:57.281
the 11th and early 12th centuries Oh will indeed be based on Roman principles.

660
00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:03.500
And as we saw with Charlemagne,
the idea of Rome,

661
00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:08.560
the idea of the empire is extremely durable and although Charlemagne's empire is

662
00:47:10.191 --> 00:47:14.420
dissolved in the course of the late 19th century,

663
00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:20.800
it is at least partially revived in the 10th century under a new dynasty.

664
00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:25.880
Oh,
who's first ruler is auto,
the first auto,
the great,
uh,

665
00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:26.990
in nine 62,

666
00:47:26.991 --> 00:47:31.420
he's crowned Roman in Rome by the pope.

667
00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:35.440
His empire doesn't clue,
does not include the West.

668
00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:37.690
So it's not France,

669
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:41.800
it's more Germany than anything else.

670
00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:47.020
But this empire would endure until Napoleon,
uh,
until 1804.

671
00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:48.890
In other words,
for,
uh,
uh,

672
00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:52.180
something on the order of 850 years.

673
00:47:56.590 --> 00:47:57.423
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

674
00:47:57.790 --> 00:48:00.760
<v 0>So to some extent,
um,</v>

675
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:04.750
we are what we have accomplished as we've arrived at the point of the emergence

676
00:48:04.751 --> 00:48:08.200
of something that can be called Europe,
other than a geographical term,

677
00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:11.560
something that can be called Christendom.
Uh,

678
00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:14.110
not using that in its triumphalist sense,

679
00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:18.430
but simply as a kind of cultural description of a certain part of the world.

680
00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:19.923
Um,

681
00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:24.370
and we've reached the point where we can start to talk about the west,

682
00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:26.350
this very funny term,

683
00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:30.650
still used particularly in popular geopolitical,
uh,

684
00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:34.820
tracks like the west and the rest of these kinds of,
uh,
uh,

685
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:37.510
statements of the West or the decline of the West.

686
00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:42.780
We're at the point of the rise of the west and that's where I am going to leave

687
00:48:43.481 --> 00:48:47.500
you with a thanks for your participation in this course.

688
00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:50.170
Thanks for making this a wonderful semester for me.

689
00:48:50.171 --> 00:48:52.120
I hope a lot of fun for you as well.

690
00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:58.260
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
