WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.110
Yeah.

2
00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:07.110
<v 1>Today we're going to talk about what is arguably the most important event of the</v>

3
00:00:08.231 --> 00:00:10.780
first part of our course.
The conversion of Constantine,

4
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.810
the Roman emperor to Christianity important not because of Constantine's own

5
00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:21.580
particular opinions.
The fact that he embraced Christianity is as we'll see,

6
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.270
a little hard to explain on purely strategic grounds,

7
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.230
but its importance is that it represents a permanent change.

8
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.640
It represents the beginning of the Christianization of the Roman Empire,

9
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.970
a very unexpected result because not only had Christianity had been illegal in

10
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.550
the,
uh,
uh,

11
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.080
prior history of the empire that is to say for over 250 years.

12
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.050
But of course the,
uh,

13
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.140
God man Jesus had been put to death by the forces of the Roman Empire.

14
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.560
And as we've discussed Roman religion with its emphasis on what we've called

15
00:01:02.141 --> 00:01:07.141
civic polytheism or the performance of ceremonies in public ceremonies that have

16
00:01:08.381 --> 00:01:12.220
to do with local patriotism,
emperor worship,

17
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.400
the tradition of the Olympian gods.
And above all,

18
00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:19.060
polytheism was very foreign to Christianity.

19
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.630
The Christian religion thus seemed to be a kind of annoying at the phenomenon of

20
00:01:28.151 --> 00:01:33.151
Roman society when in fact with this event Constantine's conversion,

21
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.340
uh,
it becomes,
uh,
the first a tolerated religion,

22
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.910
then a favored religion and very quickly,

23
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.040
uh,
within the course of the fourth century Aad,

24
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.380
the official and almost the only religion of the Roman Empire.

25
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.000
How can this be?

26
00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.400
We'll discuss both the specific events today and uh,

27
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.960
their meaning and how they play out.
Uh,

28
00:02:04.961 --> 00:02:09.310
we recall then that what is called paganism that traditional religion of the

29
00:02:09.311 --> 00:02:12.040
Roman empire was polytheistic,

30
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.310
not as many gods ceremonial had a lot of local variation and it was eclectic.

31
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.380
<v 0>Okay.</v>

32
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.380
<v 1>Eclectic meaning that you could worship different gods and different places,</v>

33
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.880
different gods for different purposes,

34
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.510
different Gods for different times of your life.

35
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.510
There was a certain emotional vacuum or at least a perceived vacuum in this

36
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:50.601
religion because it seemed to deny individual a longing and longing in general.

37
00:02:53.071 --> 00:02:53.910
That longing,

38
00:02:53.911 --> 00:02:58.911
that sense internally that there is more to life than there appears to be.

39
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.230
So that many adherence of other religions including but not limited to

40
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:10.040
Christianity,
believed that some part of their,
uh,

41
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.440
body,
uh,

42
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:16.441
was immortal or the soul was immortal or that the immortal soul had to be healed

43
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:20.710
by religion and not,
um,
uh,

44
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:25.711
that religion should simply be a pathway to good fortune or to easing the

45
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:27.850
anxieties of the material world.

46
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.840
So Christianity we've said is not so much other worldly focused on heaven.

47
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.230
It is that,
but even more important perhaps is it's inner ness.

48
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.000
It's inner worldliness,

49
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:48.001
the sense that people have a interior soul that yearns for something eternal and

50
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:55.830
more significant.
And then Christianity was accompanied by others,

51
00:03:55.831 --> 00:03:57.460
so called mystery religions,

52
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.670
religions that also spoke to an immaterial heroic,

53
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.620
um,
non civic,

54
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:10.330
non urban type of Pie attain Mithra Ism for example,

55
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:14.770
or the worship of the mother goddess,
uh,
Sibley.

56
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.910
Christianity had certain advantages in terms of reaching a population,

57
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.710
the promise of an afterlife,
the commitment that it demanded of people,

58
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.880
uh,

59
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.590
a religion that appealed both to the elite and to the common people and a very

60
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:34.450
strong local organization.

61
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.340
But Christianity was alien to the Roman Empire.

62
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.450
The Romans did not always persecute Christianity as they did under Diocletian,

63
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.680
but they found Christianity Alien.
Uh,

64
00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:53.500
they didn't like the fact that Christianity was intolerant.

65
00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:58.300
Every other religion of the Roman Empire with one exception accepted other gods.

66
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.070
If you worship Isis,
you had nothing against other people worshiping Jupiter.

67
00:05:03.071 --> 00:05:07.300
If you worship a Sibley,
you had nothing against other people worshiping Mithra.

68
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.510
But Christianity of course,
ridiculed all of these gods.

69
00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:13.270
The only other religion that was like this was Judaism,

70
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.380
but Judaism made some accommodations with the Roman Empire,

71
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.660
recognize the authority of the Roman emperor and um,

72
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.800
did not defy the state in the way that Christianity at least appeared to.

73
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.540
And Christianity was not a Roman religion in many of the ways that it rejected

74
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.610
worldliness,

75
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.640
rejected engagement in or enjoyment of the material world,

76
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.930
the pleasures of the theater,
the circus,

77
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.150
the celebrations of civic paganism,
emperor worship,

78
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.960
law courts.
Well,
law courts may not be pleasurable,

79
00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:01.140
but the sort of civic involvement of the emperor and the empire are rejected by

80
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:03.830
Christianity.
Christianity,

81
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.130
when you see what Roman pagans right about it is a kind of killed your religion.

82
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:14.411
It's a religion of people who seem to have their eyes focused on anything but

83
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.640
the actual process of getting ahead in Roman society.

84
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.790
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

85
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.410
<v 1>All of this,
not withstanding,</v>

86
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.580
it should be emphasized that Christianity was not persecuted constantly,

87
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:30.000
nor was the persecution.
Very intense.

88
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.390
We have Niro in the late sixties,

89
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.320
d the Dessi and persecution of the mid third century.

90
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.040
And of course the great persecution under Diocletian

91
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.340
Christianity received just enough persecution when might say to,
uh,

92
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.120
fortify it's spirit to give it some backbone,

93
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.530
but not enough to break it.

94
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.830
Constantine emerged from the chaos following Diocletian's abdication.

95
00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:09.810
Diocletian as you'll recall,
had created this four man rule,

96
00:07:09.811 --> 00:07:14.811
the tetrarchy in order to divide what was perceived as an excessively large

97
00:07:16.891 --> 00:07:21.720
empire with an excessively large administrative structure.
But the tetrarchy,

98
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:26.750
uh,
was at least we can say with hindsight,
doom to failure.
Uh,

99
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.020
these four emperors would not cooperate.
They would tend to be rivals.

100
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:37.000
Constantine was the son of one of the CAESARS and one of the subordinates,

101
00:07:37.001 --> 00:07:40.660
remember there are two August die to Caesars.
His father was,

102
00:07:40.661 --> 00:07:45.490
Constantine has Cloris who was appointed when the tetrarchy began in the west.

103
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:50.680
And two 93,
so there was an Augustus of the West and the Caesar of the West,

104
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:54.400
the Caesar of the West was constant.
Tineas.
Cloris,

105
00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.780
the young constant team was sent east to serve the eastern Augustus who

106
00:08:01.751 --> 00:08:04.330
succeeded Diocletian,
uh,

107
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.860
<v 0>go [inaudible]</v>

108
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:19.030
<v 1>Constantine was left out of the succession when Diocletian abdicated.</v>

109
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:25.640
Gillary is appointed somebody else.
And Constantine rebelled.

110
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.600
Constantine,
uh,
in three Oh six,

111
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.410
raised an army in faraway Britain,

112
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:38.710
marched on Gaul and eventually was grudgingly recognized by goal areas as

113
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.200
Caesar.
At the same time,

114
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:47.230
another disinherited son of an Augustus man named Max [inaudible] rebelled

115
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.080
<v 0>in Rome.
Okay.</v>

116
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.920
<v 1>And I will not burden you with the whole,
uh,
uh,</v>

117
00:08:59.921 --> 00:09:04.240
working out of these intrigues of the findings of armies of the corals of

118
00:09:04.241 --> 00:09:08.150
Augusta and Caesar's.
But basically,
um,

119
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.580
in the,
uh,

120
00:09:09.581 --> 00:09:13.900
in three 11 Gillary us who had been ill with cancer,

121
00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.340
died and Clarius,
uh,

122
00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:21.670
was succeeded by an emperor in the east,
uh,
named Las sinneas

123
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:28.330
and lascivious allowed Constantine to deal with the user per Max Census in the

124
00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:34.250
West.
So we have [inaudible] in the east and three 11,
and then in the west,

125
00:09:34.251 --> 00:09:38.790
Constantine.
And Max Census fighting it out.
Galleriest has dot.

126
00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:44.060
Constantine defeated Max sense just out of battle,

127
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.550
not far from Rome.
The Battle of the mill vion bridge

128
00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.010
battle,

129
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:04.010
the [inaudible] bridge in three 12 and Constantine was now Augustus in the west

130
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.140
La [inaudible] Augustus in the east.

131
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:12.650
The Battle of the mill vion bridge is the context for whatever it happened that

132
00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:17.700
changed Constantine's mind about his religious orientation.

133
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.190
Just before the battle of the Melvin bridge,
something happened.

134
00:10:23.191 --> 00:10:26.850
There are two stories that purport to explain the event.

135
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:32.210
One is that Constantine had a dream and in this dream an angel spoke to him and

136
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:38.690
ordered him to paint a a symbol combining the Greek letter chi and the Greek

137
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:46.050
letter row on his um,
uh,

138
00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.590
right,
uh,
on his,
uh,

139
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:56.040
soldiers shields the row the are in Greek and the Chi,
uh,

140
00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.750
written as an x.
The two letters,
uh,

141
00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:04.810
symbolize or at least are taken later to symbolize Christ whose first,

142
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:09.320
uh,
the first letter being a Chi,
the second row,

143
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.950
the second version,

144
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:19.370
which is later met his later in circulation as a story but seems perhaps to have

145
00:11:21.421 --> 00:11:25.560
been attested by the emperor himself to,
uh,
his biographer.

146
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:29.960
Eusebius.
Uh,
according to Ucbs,
uh,

147
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:35.060
Constantine was marching with his army before the battle and he,

148
00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:40.401
along with the army saw across in the sky and super imposed on the sun against

149
00:11:43.681 --> 00:11:45.480
which background the cross appeared,

150
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:49.080
where the words in this sign you will conquer,

151
00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:56.750
uh,
hard to say which version if either,
uh,

152
00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.940
is um,
what Constantine thought happened to him.

153
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.950
The argument for the second one is partly Eusebius is description,

154
00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:10.951
partly the fact that angels in a dream or a standard kind of story.

155
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.170
Uh,
on the other hand,

156
00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:17.800
the Chi Rho symbol is not previously a sign of Christianity.

157
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:25.230
So that the very fact that there isn't a background to that,

158
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.010
that,
uh,

159
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:32.320
this is something that we hear of now for the first time might indicate that

160
00:12:32.321 --> 00:12:36.520
that's the true story.
But more important than what actually happened,

161
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:37.930
uh,

162
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:42.930
is that there's no reason to doubt Constantine's sincerity.

163
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:48.370
There is no reason to believe that this was a calculating,

164
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:53.350
cynical or politically astute move.

165
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.910
This is not because Constantine wasn't devious,
he was,

166
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:03.900
but because it's hard to imagine any emperor thinking that Christianity was a

167
00:13:04.121 --> 00:13:04.960
good idea

168
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:12.600
because Christianity was subversive of Roman values and it was purse

169
00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:17.730
particularly subversive of the values of the Roman army whose crucial aid

170
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.370
Constantine depended on and of which Constantine had to be the leader,

171
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.950
not only in order to defeat Mac sensuous,

172
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.100
but simply to survive in power.

173
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:34.030
Christianity was pacifist at this time.

174
00:13:34.031 --> 00:13:36.460
It took more literally than it would later.

175
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:40.570
The admonitions of Christ in the gospels,

176
00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:44.830
not to fight,
not to,
uh,
uh,

177
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.060
hit back,

178
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:51.120
not to engage oneself in the pursuit of worldly gain by means of violence.

179
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:59.850
But it's hard to imagine anything more unlikely than an emperor becoming

180
00:14:01.271 --> 00:14:06.271
Christian and gaining the support of his followers.

181
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:07.661
Now,

182
00:14:07.661 --> 00:14:12.661
that doesn't mean that Constantine became some sort of monk interpreted.

183
00:14:12.971 --> 00:14:16.930
The gospels,
literally told his soldiers to put down their weapons.

184
00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:20.710
It's clear the Constantine regarded the Christian God,

185
00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.620
much as other emperors had regarded,
say,

186
00:14:23.621 --> 00:14:28.621
the invincible son or the genius of the divine emperor or any other Pagan Deity

187
00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:34.570
that brought victory in war.
Constant team like all emperors,

188
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.970
saw himself as a child of fortune.

189
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:42.210
As someone who was favored by fortune depended on fortune and who needed to

190
00:14:44.111 --> 00:14:47.080
placate to mollify,

191
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:51.740
to please whatever God it was the controlled fortune.

192
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:57.500
What's unusual is that he would deem the Christian God to be this sort of God,

193
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.420
a leader of war,
a giver,
a victory in battle,

194
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:08.250
a companion to the emperor.
Uh,

195
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.780
none of this would seem at first glance to be likely in Christianity.

196
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.200
The fact that not only does it work,

197
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:20.230
but that it would work for centuries later is just part of the cataclysmic

198
00:15:20.361 --> 00:15:23.900
nature of this event.
Or if not cataclysmic,

199
00:15:23.901 --> 00:15:25.550
at least unexpected.

200
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.210
Constantine was not ignorant.
He's someone who had studied philosophy,

201
00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:36.830
uh,
who was quite literate,
knew Greek,
pretty well,

202
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.990
familiar with Latin literature,

203
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:44.030
but nevertheless he was obviously a man of affairs is not a,
you know,
he's not a,

204
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:48.770
uh,
an intellectual contemplative person pouring over philosophy books.

205
00:15:48.771 --> 00:15:53.750
He's a man of power,
decisiveness strategy,
uh,
and not,

206
00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.360
uh,
a little cruelty and brutality.

207
00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.760
And we can see that after his conversion experience,

208
00:16:01.761 --> 00:16:05.210
and indeed I should point out he did beat Max Centers.

209
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.250
He accepted the Christian God.

210
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:13.120
He went to battle with the usurper and he defeated him.

211
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.720
But even after his victory,

212
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:22.810
he doesn't become in every respect a totally committed Christian,

213
00:16:23.481 --> 00:16:27.710
at least in terms of the symbols of power of his office.

214
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:29.780
His coins,
for example,

215
00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:34.781
which are a very good mark of propaganda and self or regard,

216
00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:40.960
his coins kept the imagery of the earlier pagan deity associated with the

217
00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:46.040
emperor,
the invincible son after a little while.

218
00:16:46.041 --> 00:16:50.060
And you start to see the invincible sun on one side of the coin and the cross on

219
00:16:50.061 --> 00:16:50.894
the other.

220
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:55.280
And only later in his reign do we have just the cross

221
00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.760
Constantine's first substantive act as a Christian or as someone who favored the

222
00:17:06.521 --> 00:17:10.270
Christian Church was the edict of tolerance.

223
00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:15.450
The edict of tolerance or edict of toleration issued at Milan in three 13 was

224
00:17:17.021 --> 00:17:19.900
jointly the product of Constantine and Lavania.

225
00:17:19.901 --> 00:17:24.901
So now the two last guys standing the Augustus of the East [inaudible] and uh,

226
00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:27.850
Constantine,

227
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:33.300
the Augustus of the West [inaudible] was a pagan and no did not share

228
00:17:35.261 --> 00:17:38.080
Constantine's bizarre enthusiasm,
but all right.
You know,

229
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:42.910
if he wanted to tolerate Christianity,
this was fun.
This was part of their,
um,

230
00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:47.170
I'm sorry.
It's not Lavania is Bonnie.
This is a philosopher.

231
00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:49.263
Sinneas

232
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.120
<v 0>okay.</v>

233
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.070
<v 1>Listen to his Constantine and listening.
Yes.
Listen,
this was a pagan,</v>

234
00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:02.430
but he was willing to go along with toleration at this point of Christianity was

235
00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.370
legalized.

236
00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:07.910
<v 0>Okay.</v>

237
00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:08.780
<v 1>But in the West,</v>

238
00:18:08.781 --> 00:18:13.781
constant team came to favor the church and do more than merely accepted as

239
00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:19.020
legal.
For example,
he returned property confiscated in the dye,

240
00:18:19.021 --> 00:18:20.980
queasy Yanik persecution.

241
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:26.950
He exempted the church from state taxation and incredible gift and allowed

242
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.920
church officials,
bishops,

243
00:18:30.921 --> 00:18:34.460
and others to use the imperial communications system,

244
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:39.500
the so called post system whereby they could get fresh horses to go from one

245
00:18:39.501 --> 00:18:40.490
place to another,

246
00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:45.520
greatly speeding up their journeys and uh,
um,

247
00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:49.610
making the journeys,
uh,
an effect chargeable to the state.

248
00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:56.050
Constantine left the pagan and ceremonial center of Rome alone for the time

249
00:18:57.411 --> 00:19:01.700
being at least,
and built two great basilicas on its outskirts.

250
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.620
One Saint Peters,

251
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:08.420
the Saint Peters that stands today is of course a product of the renaissance and

252
00:19:08.421 --> 00:19:13.100
the Baroque.
But the old church,
uh,
that was,
um,

253
00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:17.990
I've destroyed in the 16th century,
uh,
was a bat of Constantine.

254
00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:23.240
And he also built the latter and basilica both of these outside the walls of

255
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:27.130
Rome
as we'll discuss.

256
00:19:27.131 --> 00:19:31.990
He also attempted to mediate in disputes involving the church.

257
00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.333
<v 0>Okay.</v>

258
00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.980
<v 1>He never,
however,
completely marginalized the old religions.</v>

259
00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.910
He emphasize the diversity of religious practice.

260
00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.520
He didn't require a single form of worship,

261
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.370
but by the time he died in three 37,
uh,

262
00:19:49.371 --> 00:19:52.190
the pace of conversions was such that,
uh,

263
00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:55.970
perhaps as much as half of the empire had,
uh,

264
00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:57.430
embraced Christianity.

265
00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:04.740
And this brings us to a crucial question,
of course,

266
00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.370
that we'll be discussing really throughout the semester.

267
00:20:08.371 --> 00:20:13.371
And that is what was the effect of Constantine's conversion on the church or

268
00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:17.730
beyond the mirror event of three 12.

269
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:23.210
What did it mean for the church to go from persecuted minority to established

270
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:24.773
majority?

271
00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:31.920
What explains Constantine's ability not only to change the course of the Roman

272
00:20:34.541 --> 00:20:37.810
religious practice and tendencies,

273
00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:42.260
but to do so permanently for the church?

274
00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:43.580
Was this turnaround,

275
00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:48.850
a providential sign or a kind of Trojan horse gift in which the Church would now

276
00:20:50.741 --> 00:20:55.741
be so tied to the official culture that it would never be able to shake off Rome

277
00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:03.210
administration and bureaucracy to get back to its original charismatic

278
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:07.600
individual powerful foundations.

279
00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:09.770
<v 0>Okay.</v>

280
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:14.770
<v 1>The era of Constantine establishes the problem of the Church and the world for</v>

281
00:21:15.651 --> 00:21:19.130
the Middle Ages and indeed beyond this problem is,

282
00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:24.280
is the church a collection of special people who have their eyes fixed on heaven

283
00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:29.690
or is it a kind of universal society?
Uh,

284
00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:34.720
that is hard to distinguish from just worldliness and engagement with the world

285
00:21:35.721 --> 00:21:40.670
of business life,
death,
uh,
and other banalities,

286
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:41.961
uh,

287
00:21:41.961 --> 00:21:46.940
it is Saint Augustine who is going to deal with this most forcibly in terms of

288
00:21:46.941 --> 00:21:51.500
theory,
but that's a century later.
So 75 years later,

289
00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.020
externally,

290
00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:58.680
the church adopted very quickly to success.

291
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:04.110
We can see this in terms of the pace of conversion.
As I said,

292
00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.630
not only were 50% of the people,

293
00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:12.000
perhaps Christian by three 37 when Constantine died,
but by three,

294
00:22:12.001 --> 00:22:16.440
nine day,
the time,
uh,
of the Emperor Theodosius or,
uh,

295
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:18.540
on his death,
three 95.

296
00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:20.200
<v 0>Okay.</v>

297
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:24.700
<v 1>Probably 90% of the population was at least nominally Christian.</v>

298
00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.670
The reasons for this success,
in other words,

299
00:22:30.671 --> 00:22:35.671
how could Constantine's particular gesture have such a decisive impact?

300
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.433
Um,

301
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:43.210
some of this has to do with Christianity's willingness to adopt to the customs

302
00:22:43.211 --> 00:22:44.230
of the empire.

303
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:49.930
Some of it may have to do with the weakness of the official religion of Rome and

304
00:22:49.931 --> 00:22:52.630
of the urban elites who were it's chief support.

305
00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:55.753
<v 0>MMM.</v>

306
00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:01.140
<v 1>Those who held out against Christianity were on the one hand,</v>

307
00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.440
people in the rural areas.

308
00:23:04.441 --> 00:23:09.441
So peasants who is fundamental beliefs tended to be directed to agriculture,

309
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.250
local deities,

310
00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.030
deities that controlled the weather and water and things like that.

311
00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:20.040
The army for reasons I've just said that is the,
um,
uh,

312
00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:24.930
Christianity is not at first glance congenial to people who fight for a living.

313
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.610
And then the third group that held out where the intelligentsia,

314
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.500
particularly of Rome and Athens,

315
00:23:31.501 --> 00:23:36.501
the people who had a substantial cultural investment in a Greek and Roman

316
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:41.370
philosophy,
the intellectual side of the old elite,

317
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:46.910
well,

318
00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:51.590
Konstantin fell out with [inaudible] and after some small skirmishes,

319
00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:55.850
a Constantine managed to defeat him at a,
a place called Christopolous.

320
00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:59.840
And three 24,
he listened.
He has fled from the battlefield.

321
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.700
Constantine's forces caught up with him and listen to yes.
Was executed.

322
00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:11.060
Um,
this event,
this battle of Cassopolis

323
00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.960
important in itself.

324
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.033
<v 0>Okay.</v>

325
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:21.121
<v 1>Oh No.</v>

326
00:24:21.121 --> 00:24:26.121
I longer important in itself was even more important because it showed

327
00:24:27.251 --> 00:24:32.251
Constantine the importance of the small fortress city of Byzantine,

328
00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.250
not far away Byzantium

329
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:43.480
<v 0>who</v>

330
00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.250
<v 1>is,
uh,
the,
uh,</v>

331
00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:50.370
ancestor of the city that Constantine would found their constant to no bull

332
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.940
and of course modern Istanbul and it's

333
00:24:58.170 --> 00:24:58.700
<v 0>okay.</v>

334
00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.780
<v 1>20th,
21st century incarnation.</v>

335
00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:08.310
Byzantium commanded a strategic point of access east,

336
00:25:09.011 --> 00:25:10.720
west and north south.

337
00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:15.180
It was the point of access between the uh,
uh,

338
00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.430
Black Sea and the Mediterranean.

339
00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:23.560
The boss for us is a narrow straight that separates Europe from Asia,

340
00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.500
Byzantium Constantinople,

341
00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:31.150
Istanbul a stands on the,
uh,
West Bank,

342
00:25:31.151 --> 00:25:32.530
the European side,

343
00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:37.740
but it commands and controls the channel by which anyone would go from the

344
00:25:38.201 --> 00:25:40.060
Mediterranean to the Black Sea.

345
00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:45.010
And since the Black Sea is the gateway to Central Asia in an effect,

346
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:50.070
controls communication between two commercial strategic and military zones.

347
00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:57.660
It also controls the route from the Balkans,

348
00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:03.400
southeastern Europe into Asia into specifically in this case,

349
00:26:03.401 --> 00:26:07.330
Asia minor or the Asian part of what's now Turkey.

350
00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:14.650
Byzantium is there for strategically located in terms of communication and at

351
00:26:16.971 --> 00:26:21.971
the same time located so that an army can get to two of the most dangerous

352
00:26:23.871 --> 00:26:28.760
frontiers of the Roman Empire in a reasonable amount of time without having to

353
00:26:28.761 --> 00:26:31.310
commit itself to one or the other.
Totally.

354
00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:36.410
It is not far from the Danube frontier,
which was,

355
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:37.011
as we said,

356
00:26:37.011 --> 00:26:42.011
one of the points at which the empire met the barbarian tribes and which the

357
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:47.900
Empire had sort of decided on as its natural frontier and Constantinople was

358
00:26:48.871 --> 00:26:52.860
also not that far from the eastern frontier of the Roman Empire,

359
00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:57.990
the frontier with Persia which ran along what's now eastern Turkey,

360
00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:02.640
Armenia,
western Iran and Iraq.

361
00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:10.730
It was the city also within the richest part of the empire.

362
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:16.620
As we said,
one of the problems of the empire in it's later years,

363
00:27:16.621 --> 00:27:21.300
it's later centuries,
was that the east was becoming richer,
more urban,

364
00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:25.620
more commercial of the West was lagging behind,
more rural,

365
00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.900
less successful in its commerce.

366
00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:34.280
Constant team wanted an eastern capital for both strategic and for economic

367
00:27:35.521 --> 00:27:37.560
reasons,
for strategic reasons,

368
00:27:37.561 --> 00:27:41.160
having to do with the movement of the armies and the protection of the frontier

369
00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:46.170
for economic reasons having to do with taxation and administration.

370
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.790
The city of Rome itself was somewhat isolated,

371
00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:54.870
strangely enough,
since of course the whole empire had grown up around Rome,

372
00:27:55.530 --> 00:28:00.530
but Rome was the historical origin of the empire,

373
00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.130
but not in the fourth century.

374
00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:07.920
And it's actual living capital.

375
00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.040
Uh,
it,
it,

376
00:28:09.041 --> 00:28:14.040
it would be too much to compare it say to the relationship between Portugal and

377
00:28:14.041 --> 00:28:17.850
Brazil.
It's not quite that lopsided,
but you know,

378
00:28:17.851 --> 00:28:20.970
Brazil is a former colony of Portugal.

379
00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:25.320
They speak the language of Portugal.
Yet on the world stage,

380
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:29.550
Brazil is larger than Portugal,
more important than Portugal,

381
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.260
richer now,
uh,
than Portugal.
Uh,

382
00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:38.270
so whatever preeminence Portugal or its capital Lisbon has within the world of

383
00:28:38.881 --> 00:28:39.714
culture,

384
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:44.870
no Brazilian would take Lisbon to be the be all and end all of the Portuguese

385
00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.860
cultural world.
So similarly,
by this time,

386
00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.680
Rome has become less important,

387
00:28:52.681 --> 00:28:57.681
even within the western empire and this relocation of the capitol to

388
00:29:00.091 --> 00:29:01.170
Constantinople.

389
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:05.940
The relocation of the Capitol to the East is significant because it shows us

390
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.560
the,
um,

391
00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:11.400
permanent result of the tetrarchy as we've said,

392
00:29:11.401 --> 00:29:16.401
Diocletian's experiment was a failure in the sense that the emperors and

393
00:29:16.861 --> 00:29:21.480
Caesar's would not cooperate and such a scheme was never tried again.

394
00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:26.690
But the division of the empire between East and West would be something that

395
00:29:28.651 --> 00:29:31.110
would eventually become permanent.

396
00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:36.060
It's first traces are with Diocletian and that's one reason why we begin the

397
00:29:36.061 --> 00:29:36.894
course with him.

398
00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:42.530
It is also something that continues under Constantine without the addition of

399
00:29:44.441 --> 00:29:48.400
the Caesars.
Constantine ruled over the whole empire.

400
00:29:48.401 --> 00:29:50.080
He did not divided himself,

401
00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:55.290
but he facilitated it's conceptual and eventually real political division by

402
00:29:55.901 --> 00:30:00.460
creating a new realm,
a new capital in,
uh,

403
00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:03.460
the former fortress of Byzantium,

404
00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:08.110
a town that he modestly named after himself.

405
00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.440
Constantinople as this town was called,

406
00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:15.910
was planned to be a new Rome like Rome.

407
00:30:15.911 --> 00:30:20.140
It would have a forum,
it would have civic spaces.

408
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:24.100
It would have,
uh,
races and sporting events.

409
00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:27.670
It would have imperial palaces and gardens.
Uh,

410
00:30:27.671 --> 00:30:31.780
it would have victory columns,
triumphal arches,

411
00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:36.850
aqueducts,
the whole panoply of classical civilization.

412
00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:39.460
It wouldn't have a whole lot of temples.

413
00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:42.940
Churches would be more important than temple's,
not the constant team,

414
00:30:42.941 --> 00:30:46.000
totally banned tempos from Constantinople.

415
00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:48.880
But these were knocked the highlights of the city.

416
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:52.000
It is a,

417
00:30:52.001 --> 00:30:57.001
an ideological statement like other planned great in perio sites.

418
00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:02.260
So we could compare it to in the modern world,

419
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:07.350
Saint Petersburg created by the czar's as a certain kind of statement with a

420
00:31:07.931 --> 00:31:12.931
certain kind of plan and a certain kind of look evoking western Europe in

421
00:31:13.931 --> 00:31:18.220
particular or they're cy,
not a town at all,

422
00:31:18.221 --> 00:31:23.221
but rather a kind of palace city fit for the King of France.

423
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.000
At this point,

424
00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:35.510
Constantine becomes a considerably more devout and somewhat more intolerant.

425
00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:43.910
We start to see him interact with the Christian Church in its most intimate way.

426
00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.550
That is to say doctrine.

427
00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:51.890
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

428
00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:56.890
<v 1>Constantine is appealed to by the Donna tests schismatics or what we're calling</v>

429
00:31:59.661 --> 00:32:04.160
them schismatics or heretics as they were decided to be from North Africa.

430
00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:11.180
But Donna tests taught that the,
uh,

431
00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.260
priests who had,
uh,

432
00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:22.190
given over the scriptures under persecution at the time of Diocletian were not

433
00:32:22.191 --> 00:32:26.270
legitimate priests.
And we'll talk later about the implications of this.

434
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:30.530
The implications briefly are that,
um,

435
00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:35.560
the church cannot cover for priests that the office is not greater than a man.

436
00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:38.870
If the man has,
can mitigate a,

437
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:42.290
such as what was called treason,

438
00:32:42.291 --> 00:32:45.140
the handing over of the scriptures to the persecutors,

439
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.900
he no longer can baptize validly.

440
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.410
He no longer can perform the sacraments with validity.

441
00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:56.960
A donatism then implies that a,
the church itself,

442
00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:57.741
uh,

443
00:32:57.741 --> 00:33:02.741
is really just as good as the character of its officials.

444
00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:09.170
The donnas just we're strong in north Africa and they appeal to Constantine

445
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:14.230
against decisions that had been made against them within the church.

446
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:20.470
The fact that Christians are appealing to the emperor already as early as three

447
00:33:20.961 --> 00:33:25.961
17 shows the acceptance of the emperor as a Christian arbiter,

448
00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:30.590
but it also shows a kind of in retrospect,

449
00:33:30.591 --> 00:33:35.591
dangerous intermingling of what we would consider to be church and state.

450
00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:38.121
Similarly,

451
00:33:38.121 --> 00:33:43.121
Constantine would get involved in controversies over the relationship between

452
00:33:43.491 --> 00:33:46.940
God,
the father and Christ,
the son.

453
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:51.410
This too,
we'll go into in more detail,

454
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:56.470
but this is the Aryan heresy Arion with an I not with a y at named after a

455
00:33:58.191 --> 00:34:01.280
priest named areas who taught that

456
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:05.270
while Christ is God,

457
00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:09.920
he is in some sense subordinate to God the father.

458
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:15.730
This is a controversy over the nature of the Trinity in which Christ is seen as

459
00:34:18.231 --> 00:34:21.590
coming from God as emanating from God.

460
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:26.210
And uh,
as I think I warned at the beginning of the course,

461
00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:31.220
if you don't like doctrinal and theological controversy,
uh,
you know,

462
00:34:31.221 --> 00:34:33.710
I'll try to spare you all its ins and outs,

463
00:34:33.711 --> 00:34:37.610
but you can't teach this course without it.
Again,

464
00:34:37.611 --> 00:34:42.080
what we're talking about now is not the content of Arianism who embraced it,

465
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:43.123
why,

466
00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:48.220
but the fact that the emperor gets involved in these controversies.

467
00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:50.090
On the one hand,

468
00:34:50.091 --> 00:34:55.091
this shows the quick adaptation of the church to imperial rule.

469
00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:57.470
On the other hand,

470
00:34:57.471 --> 00:35:02.090
because Constantine was able to solve neither the donotist nor the Aryan

471
00:35:02.091 --> 00:35:05.660
division,
at least not definitively,
and at least not yet.

472
00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:10.160
It shows how difficult it was for an emperor who could conquer all of his

473
00:35:10.161 --> 00:35:15.161
secular rivals who could control this vast realm from Gibraltar to the Tigris

474
00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:18.410
and Euphrates,
uh,

475
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:23.000
but couldn't get a bunch of North African peasants to obey his orders about how

476
00:35:23.001 --> 00:35:26.390
to worship or Egyptian priests either.

477
00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:34.060
Constantine we can see is frustrated by this.

478
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:39.790
Can See in the reading from Jones his difficulties in dealing with this in the

479
00:35:41.611 --> 00:35:46.560
usual way,
the usual way being the emperor has petitioned by people.

480
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:49.170
He appoints some arbiter's or judges.

481
00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:53.370
The judges make a decision and then the emperor announces to these people that

482
00:35:53.371 --> 00:35:54.540
that's what it's going to be.

483
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.980
Problem is that of course people like the dinosaurs were already used to

484
00:35:58.981 --> 00:36:03.720
martyrdom,
threatening them with imprisonment,
threatening them with torture,

485
00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:07.960
denouncing them,
trying to use the,
uh,

486
00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:11.740
awesome awe inspiring power of the emperor against them.
Oh,

487
00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:16.470
it was not going to be sufficient.
Nevertheless,

488
00:36:16.471 --> 00:36:17.310
constant team,

489
00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:22.340
far from abandoned and Christianity and frustration becomes more and more

490
00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:25.830
engaged in trying to,

491
00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:30.230
if not officially Christianize the empire at least,
um,

492
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:33.720
legislate as a Christian emperor.

493
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:37.740
By three 30,
he has come to see himself,

494
00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:43.020
not merely as an emperor who has a kind of peculiar favor or a peculiar God that

495
00:36:44.161 --> 00:36:45.060
is following him,

496
00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:50.040
but as the implementer of the mission of the church.

497
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:51.090
So for example,

498
00:36:51.091 --> 00:36:56.091
he starts promulgating laws against married men having concubines ineffective or

499
00:36:58.381 --> 00:37:03.381
the seduction of wards by their guardians or a punishing rape by burning all

500
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:12.200
orientation towards sexual crimes that shows a more Christian horror of them

501
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:17.040
have.
Then the more easygoing Roman attitude,

502
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:24.180
Constantine favors the church in acts,

503
00:37:24.181 --> 00:37:28.710
legislation recommended by the church,
favors the bishops.

504
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:31.330
And even uh,
in uh,

505
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:36.390
three 20 or the three twenties presides over the first Ecumenical Council of

506
00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:42.890
bishops of the church called at Nascio across the boss for us from

507
00:37:43.741 --> 00:37:44.940
Constantinople,

508
00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:50.840
the Ecumenical Council of Nicea cold to deal with the area and controversy.

509
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:56.690
And here we see Constantine as something,
uh,

510
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:58.770
different from an emperor,

511
00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:01.950
nearly the companion of Christ or the companion of God,

512
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:07.080
but the emperor as in some sense head of the church,

513
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:09.870
Constantine appears up the council,

514
00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:13.950
he is a deferred to by the bishops.

515
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:18.190
Nevertheless,
he is not himself a bishop.

516
00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:21.880
He is not himself.
However imperial,

517
00:38:21.881 --> 00:38:26.881
the church may look able to legislate by himself for the church because unlike

518
00:38:29.591 --> 00:38:33.010
many other religions,
and certainly when we come to Islam,

519
00:38:33.011 --> 00:38:34.060
you'll see the contrast.

520
00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:39.300
The political of the Roman Empire is not the designated leader of the religious

521
00:38:41.291 --> 00:38:42.580
practice of the church.

522
00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:44.110
<v 0>Okay.</v>

523
00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:47.610
<v 1>Because he is not a priest.
Now,
uh,</v>

524
00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:51.340
who is the designator leader of the church is not clear yet.

525
00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:54.790
Certainly it's not yet the pope.
And in,
uh,
the three twenties,

526
00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:59.200
it is the collectivity of bishops.
But in that case,

527
00:38:59.201 --> 00:39:03.790
then some bishops have more power than others.
Nevertheless,

528
00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:08.880
this is the beginning of an era in which we have a blending but not a total a

529
00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:16.390
equivalency of secular rule,

530
00:39:16.391 --> 00:39:21.391
imperial rule on the one hand and spiritual or church rural on the other.

531
00:39:21.491 --> 00:39:25.500
And that's one of the things that of course characterizes our image of the

532
00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:30.340
Middle Ages,
a period in which the church and the state were overlapping,

533
00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.380
if not actually fused

534
00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:37.210
Constantine in relation to Diocletian to conclude,

535
00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:41.110
uh,
differences and similarities.

536
00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:45.970
Obviously there's similarities are great.

537
00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:51.210
Both Diocletian and Constantine remade the Roman empire as a much more tightly

538
00:39:54.221 --> 00:39:58.720
administered state,
a more bureaucratically complicated state,

539
00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:01.120
and a more militarized state.

540
00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:07.350
Constantine continued Diocletian's military and administrative structure

541
00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:16.910
like Diocletian.
In order to do this,
he had to rely on very heavy taxation.

542
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:19.760
If anything,
has taxation,

543
00:40:19.761 --> 00:40:24.590
had to be greater because he had exempted the church and it's clergy and someone

544
00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:27.260
was going to have to make up the difference.

545
00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:32.990
But Diocletian had persecuted the Catholic Church,

546
00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:37.040
whereas a Constantine would favorite.

547
00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:42.530
And that is of course a crucial difference.
On the other hand,

548
00:40:42.531 --> 00:40:47.450
even here,
there are some connections under Diocletian.
The emperor was a god.

549
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:51.470
The emperor was a distantly glimpsed figure.

550
00:40:51.471 --> 00:40:53.870
He was no longer even in pretense,

551
00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:59.020
first citizen God just like you and me handshaker baby kiss her or anything like

552
00:40:59.751 --> 00:41:03.800
that.
But this was also true with Constantine.

553
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:06.920
Constantine.
Uh,
uh,

554
00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:11.980
two had a ceremonial distant and because of his association with the Church,

555
00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:17.510
semi sacred status,

556
00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:21.320
he couldn't be worshiped as a god to be sure,

557
00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:27.040
but he was something a bit more than a merely a,

558
00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:30.320
a follower of Christianity.

559
00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:34.700
Constantine the tetrarchy.

560
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:40.010
But he really set the seal on the division of the Empire East and West,

561
00:41:40.011 --> 00:41:43.130
as we've just said,
by the establishment of Constantinople.

562
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:47.570
And finally,
counseling team was a little more successful economically.

563
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:50.920
Diocletian,
uh,

564
00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:55.960
did not have the means available to Constantine who had a certain amount from

565
00:41:56.601 --> 00:42:00.560
the old pagan temple treasures that he was able to confiscate.

566
00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:03.450
And also,
uh,

567
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:08.240
by virtue of his victory over listen as he was able to rule,

568
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.850
uh,
a pretty tightly over the empire.

569
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:16.990
The fourth century often is seen as a period of decline because we're focused.

570
00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:26.500
We historians are focused on the collapse of the Roman Empire in the late fifth

571
00:42:26.571 --> 00:42:31.280
century,
but obviously people in three 37,
the year that Constantine died,

572
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:35.570
did not know that enforced 76 the western empire would collapse.

573
00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.550
They did not know that in four 10,

574
00:42:37.551 --> 00:42:41.070
Visigoths would invade and plunder the city of Rome.
Uh,

575
00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.670
no more than we have the faintest idea of what's going to happen.

576
00:42:43.671 --> 00:42:45.530
75 or a hundred years from now,

577
00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:51.560
from their point of view of the empire had been restored.
The empire,

578
00:42:51.561 --> 00:42:55.970
which had been endangered in the third century by invasions,
inflation,

579
00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:59.660
uh,
armed forces out of control,

580
00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:03.380
chaotic imperial succession was now stable,

581
00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:05.900
was clear who the emperor was.

582
00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.890
The barbarians had been pushed back behind the frontiers.

583
00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:14.720
Trade culture,
civilization seemingly flourished.

584
00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:19.280
And if we trust the,
uh,
impressions we have of contemporaries,

585
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:25.150
both formal written work and informal things like the slogans that people put in

586
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:30.230
their dining room,
mosaics,
for example,

587
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:35.030
a good times had been restored.
This seems to be the constant theme,

588
00:43:35.031 --> 00:43:37.730
and I emphasize this because again,

589
00:43:37.731 --> 00:43:42.731
it's a lesson in how the history cannot be seen from the front backwards.

590
00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:49.121
You can't use hindsight to tell what people should have felt.

591
00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:53.210
People in the fourth century,
at the time of Constantine,

592
00:43:53.211 --> 00:43:55.100
we're optimistic no more.

593
00:43:55.101 --> 00:43:59.150
So those people who would embrace Christianity as the coming thing,

594
00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:03.740
as the religion of,
uh,
not only truth,
but if success,

595
00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.560
what is odd is of course,

596
00:44:06.561 --> 00:44:10.070
that thus far Christianity would have seemed to be unlikely.

597
00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:13.490
Christianity would have seemed to be alien from the empire.

598
00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:18.860
And even if some emperor embraced it for weird reasons of its own,

599
00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:23.870
his own wouldn't have seemed to have been the most favorable,

600
00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:27.680
uh,
context for the preservation of the empire.

601
00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:29.720
And indeed,
of course,

602
00:44:29.721 --> 00:44:34.110
the empire would fail in the West within a century and a half or so of the

603
00:44:34.111 --> 00:44:38.490
embrace of Christianity.
And it's no surprise then that the Roman,
uh,

604
00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:41.070
English historian of the Roman Empire,
Edward Gibbon,

605
00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:42.990
who's decline and fall of the Roman empire,

606
00:44:42.991 --> 00:44:46.230
sort of sets the agenda for any course like this one.

607
00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:50.760
It's no accident that gibbon blame Christianity for the fall of the empire,

608
00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:53.460
but indeed in the fourth century,

609
00:44:53.461 --> 00:44:57.480
it seemed that Christianity was one of the forces that had saved the empire.

610
00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:00.900
And not only that,
as we will see as this course unfolds,

611
00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:06.650
much of what was preserved from the debacle of four 76 and successive problems

612
00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:13.580
