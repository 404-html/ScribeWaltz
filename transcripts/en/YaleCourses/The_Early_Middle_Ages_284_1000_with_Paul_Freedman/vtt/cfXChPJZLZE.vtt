WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:01.591
All right.

2
00:00:01.591 --> 00:00:06.591
So today the question we're going to deal with is the survival of the Roman

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.130
Empire in the east.

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.840
Why did the empire based in Constantinople survive?

5
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.990
Whereas as we saw last week,

6
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.140
the western empire based nominally in Rome Times in Milan and times in Ravenna

7
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.430
collapsed in the fifth century,

8
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.240
we're going to take a long view of survival in the east.

9
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.770
That is from the fifth century to the mid 19th century.

10
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.620
Uh,
after the mid 19th century,

11
00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:39.480
the eastern Roman empire flourishes and has a period,
uh,

12
00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:44.160
that we will discuss in a few weeks of great splendor and prosperity.

13
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.230
Uh,
but,
uh,

14
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.320
this long view is justified by the fact that four for 400 years or so,

15
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.680
this eastern Roman empire faced tremendous threats of invasion,

16
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.110
uh,
sieges

17
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.610
difficulties dealing with all sorts of nations and peoples and at the same time,

18
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:12.540
internal division because of religious controversy or what are the people who

19
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:14.580
one called heresies?

20
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.160
I remind you that while we call it the eastern Roman empire or the Byzantine

21
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.460
Empire,
they called themselves the Roman Empire.

22
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.690
No adjective,
no qualification.

23
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.550
They were the successor to,
and if they were the only successor,

24
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:36.120
tough luck.
They were the successor to the empire of Augustus,

25
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.460
the empire of Diocletian,

26
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.700
the empire of constant team in their base

27
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.860
before the seventh century.
They were,

28
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:51.540
as you see on the map,

29
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.720
the map really shows the more or less at their height eastern Roman empire.

30
00:01:57.721 --> 00:01:59.910
Notice that it goes as far as Spain

31
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.940
in the Mediterranean.

32
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.690
This was the accomplishment of Justinian an emperor of the sixth century who,

33
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.170
whose reign Mark's a kind of apogee height of power of this empire,

34
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.320
uh,
within this period of crisis.

35
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.630
So while I'm saying that we're dealing with,
uh,

36
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.310
about four centuries worth of sieges and crises.

37
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.460
There is this a period in the sixth century in the reign of Justinian,

38
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.730
uh,
who,
uh,

39
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.860
represents a kind of brief but very important reconquest of the West.

40
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.360
And that's partly what you're seeing,
at least the leftovers of it in this map.

41
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.990
Uh,
that shows you the Byzantine or Rome,

42
00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:53.160
eastern Roman Empire in the year 600 extending including Spain,

43
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.840
North Africa,
the coast of what's now Libya,
uh,
Egypt,

44
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.660
the Mediterranean,
Middle East.
That is modern Israel,
uh,

45
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.780
Syria,
Lebanon,
Anatolia,

46
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.400
that is to say Asia minor,

47
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.030
modern Turkey and the Balkans,

48
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:14.860
Greece and the Aegean islands.

49
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.440
This empire was held together by Constantinople,
which as you see,

50
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:21.910
and as we've already spoken about,

51
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.090
is strategically placed to control access between Europe and Asia across the

52
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.200
Bosphorus Straits and also between the Black Sea,

53
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:37.201
which is the access point to Central Asia and the Mediterranean Sea.

54
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.240
This city,

55
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.270
modern Istanbul still has the walls built by Theodocia is the second in the

56
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.300
early fifth century.
The so-called Theodosian walls rather,
uh,

57
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.580
nastily restored recently are a,

58
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.990
an incredible monument,
uh,

59
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.040
still in their ruined state to the power of Constantinople as they

60
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.170
were built on the landward side.
Constantinople,

61
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.400
very difficult to attack from the sea and because of the walls,

62
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.020
very difficult to attack from the land.
Uh,
until very recently,
that is,

63
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.890
I would say,
until the 1980s,
the Theodosian walls,

64
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.630
we're not reached by the urban agglomeration of Istanbul.
That is,

65
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:30.631
they were so big and so far from the main center of the city that only in recent

66
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.690
decades has Istanbul,

67
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:39.691
which is one of the fastest growing and most prosperous cities in the region has

68
00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:41.430
the city sort of,
uh,

69
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.570
leapfrogged over the walls and the walls are now kind of in the midst of a new

70
00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:49.130
part of the city.
Nevertheless,
uh,

71
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.150
extremely impressive accomplishment and the period we're dealing with is mostly

72
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:59.470
sieges of Constantinople and heresies.

73
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.360
And if you could just hold that in your mind,

74
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.710
this somewhat one event after another that I never heard of quality that this

75
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:08.650
will have,
I think will be,
if not alleviated,

76
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.040
at least rendered comprehensible.
Before we go on,

77
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.780
let me just say a few words about pro copious who has read the secret history

78
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:21.310
before.
Okay,
so not,
not too much,

79
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.140
and you should have started it.
I should have warned you.
It has,
um,
uh,

80
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.850
disturbing a,
even a weirdly pornographic parts.
Um,

81
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.300
it is a diatribe against the emperor Justinian.

82
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.530
I don't think I'm giving anything away by saying that pro copious,

83
00:05:38.531 --> 00:05:42.200
his theory about Justinian is that he's a demon or devil.
Uh,

84
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.630
a representative of how,

85
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.880
what makes this text interesting is it's an intimate portrayal even if it may

86
00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:53.020
not be an accurate one,
but we will pay a certain price.

87
00:05:53.021 --> 00:05:56.500
We are willing to pay a certain price for intimacy,
for immediacy,

88
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.050
for the sense of an extremely sinister court.

89
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.000
It's a little bit like reading about Stalin or some other capricious,

90
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:06.350
extremely powerful,

91
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.370
a hard working but bloodthirsty ruler.

92
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.750
I think what you have to ask yourself is,
uh,

93
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:19.220
how could a ruler of this particular time and polity not be blood thirsty?

94
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.830
What seems to be per copious as problem?
And uh,
you know,

95
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:29.000
I don't expect anything but will elucidate some answers on Wednesday per copious

96
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:34.030
in part is interesting because all of his other works are lavish in their praise

97
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.710
of Justinian.
This is a,

98
00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:41.711
an historian who knows nothing between panegyric and,

99
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.410
uh,
diatribe.

100
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.630
Nothing between lavish survival praise and,

101
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.460
um,
the harshest imaginable criticism.
The two go together.

102
00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.910
The two are phenomena again of absolute test courts from that of Louis the 14th,

103
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:07.100
uh,
to that of,
um,
20th century dictators.

104
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.940
The same kind of enforced praise,
uh,

105
00:07:10.941 --> 00:07:15.941
can create a kind of humiliation and a rage that comes out in other forms.

106
00:07:16.821 --> 00:07:21.821
The secret history had to be secret because had the authorities read a few words

107
00:07:22.281 --> 00:07:26.840
of this per copious would have not died in bed as indeed he did.

108
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.990
We know this from one manuscript in the Vatican found in the 17th century.

109
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.000
Okay.
So that's my introduction to prick opiates.

110
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.090
When we talk about survival of the east,

111
00:07:38.091 --> 00:07:43.091
we're talking about survival under several different kinds of circumstances.

112
00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:44.840
So our,
um,

113
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:50.060
our first concern is how did the east survive the fifth century,

114
00:07:50.061 --> 00:07:54.080
which destroyed the western Roman Empire?

115
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:59.180
Part of the answer is geography.
The east was easier to defend,

116
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.590
especially as I've just said,
the position of Constantinople,

117
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:08.000
both as an impregnable site and as a,
uh,

118
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.880
commercial city with very,

119
00:08:10.881 --> 00:08:15.881
very extensive trade and as a base to defend the two core territories of the

120
00:08:16.491 --> 00:08:20.290
empire.
By core territories,
I mean that,
you know,

121
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.720
really the essential parts of this empire,
which are the Balkans,

122
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.340
including Greece under that rubric for the moment and Asia Minor.

123
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.650
And of course,
Constantinople is ideally placed to protect both of them.

124
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:40.070
Other advantages of the east over the West,
a bit richer,
more urbanized,

125
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:46.460
produced,
more taxable revenues than the West.
It's army didn't fall apart.
Uh,

126
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.270
it's civilian structure of administration remained intact

127
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:59.430
with the exception Justinian very few of these emperors are that outstanding in

128
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:01.350
their abilities,
but

129
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.390
their subordinates were very capable,
but government worked well.

130
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:09.870
And,
uh,

131
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.850
the east survived a number of powerful threats from the outside,

132
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.960
from the outside,

133
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:20.961
meaning it had the same problem as the Roman Empire in an admittedly smaller and

134
00:09:23.191 --> 00:09:27.360
more defensible space.
It had an eastern frontier and it had a northern frontier,

135
00:09:27.361 --> 00:09:31.740
both of which were a
fragile,

136
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.760
the eastern frontier with Persia or talking about them,

137
00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:40.230
talked about them and the northern frontier along the Danube river,

138
00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:45.220
more or less,
uh,
with all sorts of different peoples from the Avrs,

139
00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.790
Slavs,
bull,
gars,
all sorts of,
uh,
um,

140
00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.700
nations that would attack it.

141
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:57.240
It also had the disadvantage of internal religious dissent,

142
00:09:57.241 --> 00:10:00.030
and we're going to be talking more about this.

143
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:06.300
These problems eventually did affect the east adversely.

144
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:10.740
It would have a period of pretty radical decline,

145
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:15.920
not so different from that of the West beginning in the seventh century,

146
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:24.050
this decline can be seen in the abandonment of many cities or they're much

147
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.640
smaller population.

148
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:31.260
We've already seen that as a feature of the West in the loss of territory.

149
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.630
We're going to be talking about Islam and the Arab conquests,

150
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:42.050
but they begin in the seventh century and very quickly result in the loss from

151
00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:47.871
the Byzantine point of view of Egypt and the Mediterranean Near East,

152
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.350
but unlike the west of the Byzantine or east Roman government never collapsed in

153
00:10:58.351 --> 00:10:59.670
the face of these threats.

154
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:03.870
Although it is a kind of period of cultural decline,

155
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:09.380
certainly a period of military defeats of sieges of political problems and of

156
00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:13.920
religious dissent.
Nevertheless,
the empire would survive.

157
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:15.743
<v 1>Hm.</v>

158
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.820
<v 0>In general,
during this period,
what unites these 400 years?</v>

159
00:11:21.821 --> 00:11:26.740
We're talking about roughly four 50 to eight 50 is the ability of the empire to

160
00:11:26.741 --> 00:11:28.180
resist invasions.

161
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:34.240
It's willingness to accept the loss of certain provinces while protecting
others.

162
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:44.170
And it's a domination of Constantinople over its region.

163
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:45.940
At the opening of our periods,

164
00:11:45.941 --> 00:11:49.730
cities like Alexandria and Antioch are extremely important,
uh,

165
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.220
their importance within the byzantine empire declines.

166
00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:55.813
<v 1>Okay.</v>

167
00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.720
<v 0>But in order to understand some of the internal problems,</v>

168
00:11:59.721 --> 00:12:02.780
we're going to have to talk about Harris Cs.

169
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:06.470
I think I already apologized for having to talk about heresies and I think I

170
00:12:06.471 --> 00:12:11.120
already explained why it's important.
Questions,

171
00:12:11.121 --> 00:12:15.890
remarks.
Denunciations um,
okay.

172
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:20.510
Representatives of the,
uh,
iconic class defense fund.

173
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.760
Wanna claim equal time.
Okay.
Um,

174
00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:30.320
this is just a selection of Harrison's,
right?
I mean,
we're just,

175
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.290
we're just this the proverbial tip of the iceberg,

176
00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:38.270
the proverbial icing on the cake.
Uh,
the proverbial,
um,

177
00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.900
what do you call it?
A,
you know,
crust on the chocolate pudding.

178
00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.920
But having said that,
uh,

179
00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:50.570
these two are what are called Christological controversies there about the

180
00:12:50.571 --> 00:12:52.130
nature of Christ

181
00:12:55.010 --> 00:13:00.010
is the relationship of his human to divine nature and grossly to oversimplify,

182
00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:06.830
then historians emphasize Christ's divine nature and the Manasseh sites,

183
00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:08.240
Christ's human nature.

184
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:13.990
The beginning of this controversy is with the historians.

185
00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.830
The patriarch named after the Patriarch Nestorius,

186
00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:23.090
the Bishop Patriarch of Constantinople.

187
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:27.130
<v 1>Okay.</v>

188
00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:32.130
<v 0>Nestorius seemed to teach and he's patriarch in the,</v>

189
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:38.710
uh,
uh,
for 30 days,
four twenties.

190
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:44.110
And the stories would be deposed in four 30.
One as patriarch,

191
00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:49.000
his followers seemed to teach that,
uh,

192
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:50.980
Christ was fully human

193
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:57.570
and that his divine nature was either separate from his human nature or,

194
00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:02.890
uh,
uh,
it was,
um,
nonexistent or irrelevant.

195
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:09.330
I should remind you that the problem is posed by Christ being God and yet being

196
00:14:12.041 --> 00:14:14.920
crucified and suffering and dying.

197
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:22.790
So this is a problem that logically arises out of an understanding of who Christ

198
00:14:24.721 --> 00:14:27.750
is and what he does for humanity.

199
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:34.720
Mysteries was deposed by the third ecumenical council of Constantinople.

200
00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.740
Uh,
um,
I'm sorry,
third Ecumenical Council,

201
00:14:38.741 --> 00:14:43.741
which meets in FSS on the western shore of Asia Minor Council of FSS Ecumenical

202
00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.620
Council.
The third one in four 31,

203
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.560
the first two had dealt with Arianism.

204
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:58.460
I'll remind you that Arianism is a different problem because it deals not with

205
00:14:58.461 --> 00:15:02.600
the nature of Christ,
but the relationship of Christ to God.

206
00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:05.600
The father here,
we're now just concentrating on Christ.

207
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:11.960
The Manasseh sites in opposing the historians naturally emphasized Christ's

208
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:15.920
divine nature as the historians had,
in their opinion,

209
00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:20.210
overemphasized the human nature.

210
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.640
But from the point of view of the

211
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.210
group that we can call Orthodox,

212
00:15:26.211 --> 00:15:31.211
the people who believed neither in the story in Ism nor monophysitism both sides

213
00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:33.650
were extremists.

214
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:38.030
The Manasseh Sites overdid Christ's divine nature.

215
00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:45.520
If the historians taught that Christ had two natures.

216
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:48.390
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

217
00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:50.610
<v 0>A kind of human,</v>

218
00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:55.650
fully human one and a fully divine one that were separate.

219
00:15:56.100 --> 00:16:01.100
The Manasseh sites seemed to be teaching or did teach that Christ had one nature

220
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.150
and that essentially divine

221
00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.820
the relationship of the,
um,

222
00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.890
human and divine natures and monophysitism was denounced by their opponents as

223
00:16:16.891 --> 00:16:20.430
if you threw a bucket of water into the ocean.

224
00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.130
The bucket of water representing the human part.

225
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:26.593
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

226
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:31.690
<v 0>What's at stake in this and why it's important is how Christ saves people.</v>

227
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:37.740
If he is to human,

228
00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.730
then he's just a human elevated by God,

229
00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:44.280
like some kind of ancient world hero

230
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:50.690
and he doesn't seem then to have the power to save people from the devil.

231
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.760
Hell original sin,

232
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:57.790
all of these terrible things that God has saved the followers of Christ from.

233
00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.450
If he's divine,
completely divine,

234
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.740
then what's the point of distinguishing him from God the Father?

235
00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.860
And then how did he suffer on the cross?

236
00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.770
What's his suffering real?

237
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:17.510
Can God with no human elements suffer?

238
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.233
<v 1>Okay.</v>

239
00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.480
<v 0>Questions about this so far?</v>

240
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.110
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

241
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:29.430
<v 0>we understand the difference then.</v>

242
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:33.240
And we sort of understand what's at stake sort of,

243
00:17:33.241 --> 00:17:35.160
because maybe we're thinking,

244
00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.520
I hope not because you're not in the medieval frame of mind.

245
00:17:38.521 --> 00:17:43.110
If you're thinking this,
you may be thinking vo nonetheless.
Well,

246
00:17:43.111 --> 00:17:45.240
why don't they just agree to disagree

247
00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.950
or something like,
Hey,

248
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.300
you can believe in one nature all believe in too.

249
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.400
Or you can believe in two separate nature's all believe in two natures,
uh,

250
00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:03.570
coexisting and you know,

251
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:07.770
um,
God will reward your good intentions.

252
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:14.100
That's really the problem is that we live in a society in which,
uh,

253
00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.330
at least two.

254
00:18:15.331 --> 00:18:20.331
So we may think enlightened people don't really impose their beliefs.

255
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.720
Uh,
um,
in detail on others.

256
00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:28.980
We're not really interested in theology that much,

257
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.960
but the Bible I've got to admit,

258
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:38.990
does say that it is important to have the right belief,

259
00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.720
but by boat particularly,
but not exclusively.

260
00:18:42.721 --> 00:18:47.160
The Old Testament is very bad on rewarding good intentions.

261
00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.100
The further back you go in the Bible,

262
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.820
the less our good intentions rewarded.

263
00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.000
Lot's wife was told not to look back.
She looked back,

264
00:19:00.001 --> 00:19:03.150
she was turned into a pillar of salt.
Nobody said,
oh,
okay.

265
00:19:03.151 --> 00:19:07.200
You didn't mean to look back,
you know,
or,
or human weakness.
That's just it.

266
00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:12.420
Or The guy.
Now I'm betraying my ignorance.
Who,
um,
uh,

267
00:19:12.421 --> 00:19:13.560
drops the,

268
00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:18.000
where he stumbles as they're carrying the tabernacle back to Jerusalem from

269
00:19:18.001 --> 00:19:22.890
captivity,
uh,
with the Philistines.
Is it a desire?
Uh,
well,
anyway,

270
00:19:22.891 --> 00:19:25.050
I shouldn't get started on things I'm not sure of,

271
00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.440
but the guy stumbles and god strikes him dead.

272
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.850
He stumbled.
Nobody asks him,
Oh,
I'm sorry.
You know,

273
00:19:34.851 --> 00:19:38.280
I didn't mean to stumble.
Or,
you know,
a little rabbit ran in front of me.

274
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.430
He stumbles,
he dies.
That's it.

275
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:47.080
God wants you to understand what's going on in so far as uh,

276
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.170
you don't make errors.
Therefore,

277
00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.830
the right understanding of Christ's nature is important.

278
00:19:52.831 --> 00:19:57.510
It's not just a matter of convincing other people.
You know,
that um,

279
00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:04.070
one band is better than another or one kind of game is better enough there or in

280
00:20:04.081 --> 00:20:07.290
one team is better than a not there it is crucial.

281
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:11.010
Gregory of Mysa himself,

282
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:16.040
a theologian writes about a 500 a day or so that the mood of theological

283
00:20:22.981 --> 00:20:26.910
controversy is so great that uh,

284
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:30.840
if you go into a shop and you ask about your change,

285
00:20:30.841 --> 00:20:35.670
he says the shopkeeper fell off the philosophizes about the begotten and the

286
00:20:35.671 --> 00:20:39.000
unbegotten.
If you inquire about a loaf of bread,

287
00:20:39.001 --> 00:20:43.290
the baker will reply that the sun is inferior and the father is superior.

288
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.020
And if you ask if your bath is ready,

289
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.610
the attendance says the sun is made out of nothing.

290
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.100
Now all of this is a satiric,

291
00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:56.390
a remark about the way in which ordinary people are caught up in this religious

292
00:20:56.651 --> 00:20:57.341
controversy.

293
00:20:57.341 --> 00:21:01.780
It is not exclusively a matter of intellectuals or clergy,

294
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.420
but it's a political problem as well.

295
00:21:04.421 --> 00:21:07.390
And that's the reason that it really preoccupies us

296
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:13.360
in the council of Kelsey done in four 51,

297
00:21:13.361 --> 00:21:14.500
four 54.

298
00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:19.530
So ethicists for 31 cal Seaton

299
00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:25.250
for a 51 to four cal season,

300
00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:30.120
also on the other side of Constantinople on the Asian side,
uh,

301
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:34.480
of uh,
what's now Turkey.
The Council of cal CDN,

302
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:38.690
uh,
denounced them an office sites.

303
00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:45.410
It basically says that Christ has two natures.

304
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:50.580
They are both perfect.
They are indivisible,
but they are separate.

305
00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.520
Two natures,
one person,

306
00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:58.610
one hypostasis hypostasis is a thing that exists in its own right.

307
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:09.550
This solution was suggested by Rome,

308
00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:15.010
by the pope,
the same Pope Leo,
the great who had negotiated with the hands,

309
00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:22.380
but west had the advantage of not experiencing these kinds of controversies.

310
00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:24.270
And so,
um,

311
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:30.300
constant and opal far more powerful than Rome in the before fifties roam about

312
00:22:31.301 --> 00:22:32.500
to collapse completely,

313
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:37.830
nevertheless is beholden to Rome for at least what would be the majority

314
00:22:38.291 --> 00:22:42.550
solution to the problem of monophysitism.
Of course,

315
00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:47.610
actually it's not a solution because not everybody acknowledges the council of

316
00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:52.330
Calcium.
It provokes a,
um,

317
00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:54.693
split.

318
00:22:56.410 --> 00:23:01.410
The Patriarch of Alexandria would be the leader of those resisting the council

319
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.360
and Egypt,
Syria.

320
00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:13.710
And to some extent Lebanon and Palestine would be,
uh,

321
00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:16.320
Manasseh side steadfastly.

322
00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:18.560
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

323
00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:22.520
<v 0>Indeed.
The survivors of the Manasseh sites that,</v>

324
00:23:22.521 --> 00:23:27.480
that is the modern day representatives of this,
uh,

325
00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:27.800
uh,

326
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:32.800
part of Christianity are the Copts in Egypt who formed 10% of the population

327
00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:40.030
Christian in office side and the Christians of Ethiopia who form a little more

328
00:23:42.861 --> 00:23:45.890
than 50% of the population of Ethiopia.

329
00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:50.891
These so called Coptic Christians are the descendants of the monopoly sites.

330
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:56.780
The historians also have some scattered followers in the modern world.

331
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:59.360
They were very strong in central Asia.

332
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.960
And if you've studied things like the voyages of Marco Polo and other Western

333
00:24:05.301 --> 00:24:09.980
travelers in the 13th century,
the people who interpret for them,
who help them,

334
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:15.250
who sort of acquaint them with central Asia and the Chinese Mongol Empire are

335
00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:16.693
historians.

336
00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:19.790
But we're kind of going to leave them out because they're not a political

337
00:24:19.791 --> 00:24:23.480
problem for the Byzantine Empire.
They're pretty much exiled,

338
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:26.520
but comps are an internal problem.
And the the,

339
00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:30.380
the Manasseh sites or cops do not like the Orthodox,

340
00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:33.470
the Byzantine emperors,
the Byzantine emperors,

341
00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:35.930
try to compromise with them.

342
00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:40.323
<v 1>Okay.</v>

343
00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:44.750
<v 0>And I'll mention a couple of these compromises.
The emperor,
uh,</v>

344
00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:46.100
uh,Z now

345
00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:52.300
from a four 74,

346
00:24:55.260 --> 00:25:00.210
two,
491 issued a document called the hypnotic icon.

347
00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:04.733
<v 1>Okay.</v>

348
00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.270
<v 0>We're back to emperors.</v>

349
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:12.630
As with we saw as far back as Constantine emperor is trying to intervene to

350
00:25:12.761 --> 00:25:17.740
solve religious controversies,
right?
The Hanoda con,
um,
says,

351
00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:19.380
<v 1>okay,</v>

352
00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:23.610
<v 0>one of the trinity was incarnate and we're not going to discuss it anymore.</v>

353
00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:25.710
<v 1>Okay.</v>

354
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:29.490
<v 0>So first it says this rather noncommittal statement.</v>

355
00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:31.380
One of the trinity was incarnate

356
00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:37.230
and then it also outlaws.
Any further discussion?

357
00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:40.380
Nobody liked this.

358
00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:43.563
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

359
00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:48.640
<v 0>Xena was succeeded by Anastasia's who was a Manasseh side.</v>

360
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:59.190
And then as we'll see,

361
00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:03.990
the great emperor of the Sixth Century Justinian and we're going to be looking

362
00:26:03.991 --> 00:26:08.760
at much more closely,
oh,
was a fierce anti Manasseh site or,

363
00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:11.250
or Calcitonin Orthodox.

364
00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:13.810
But his wife was sort of [inaudible] office side.

365
00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:20.010
This may have been politic since they were both effective rulers.
Um,

366
00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:24.240
the people who were in an office side could orient themselves to Theodora the

367
00:26:24.241 --> 00:26:29.241
emperors and the Orthodox to just an N.

368
00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.170
Ultimately this problem would be solved,

369
00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:40.550
quote solved because the Arab Muslim invasion of the seventh century would take

370
00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:44.580
over the side territories.

371
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.351
Again,

372
00:26:48.351 --> 00:26:53.351
I hope I'm not giving away a secret by saying that are the most,

373
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:55.610
uh,
striking,

374
00:26:55.611 --> 00:27:00.611
sweeping and dramatic event of the Mediterranean world or of the Eurasian

375
00:27:03.231 --> 00:27:08.231
landmass of the period that we're dealing with arguably is the rise of Islam.

376
00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:14.900
Mohammed's had hijera is,
uh,
in the,
um,

377
00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.380
six,
uh,
six 30 to six 33.

378
00:27:18.381 --> 00:27:23.330
I can't remember anybody know offhand.
Um,
anyone want to look it up off hand.

379
00:27:23.331 --> 00:27:24.670
H,
e,
g,
I r m

380
00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:31.720
six 22 six 22 by six 60,

381
00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:36.860
um,
Egypt,
Syria,
uh,
uh,
Palestine,
Lebanon,

382
00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:37.550
ah,

383
00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:42.550
have fallen to the Muslim to Muslim rule and um,

384
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:45.770
uh,
they are,
uh,

385
00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:50.800
extending their power as far west as North Africa and as far east as a

386
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:53.690
Afghanistan.
How this happens,

387
00:27:53.691 --> 00:27:57.290
why this happens is the subject for discussion a little later.
But again,

388
00:27:57.291 --> 00:28:01.930
if you refer to the map in 600,
this is before the,
uh,

389
00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:04.820
Islamic takeover.
And again,
if you look further east,

390
00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:08.360
but eastern Roman Empire or consists of all these parts,

391
00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.030
many of which are about to be taken away from it

392
00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.190
and the parts that were taken away from it,

393
00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:21.540
we're pretty much the Manasseh side parts.

394
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

395
00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:31.670
<v 0>So the fifth century is the story of the survival of the eastern Roman Empire.</v>

396
00:28:32.971 --> 00:28:36.720
Despite these religious controversies,
the early sixth century,

397
00:28:36.721 --> 00:28:38.340
which we'll talk about in more detail,

398
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:43.580
is the story of the expansion of the empire to make a stab at reuniting by

399
00:28:46.141 --> 00:28:49.320
conquering the West.
What had been the,
uh,

400
00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:54.890
the single Roman Empire Justinian's empire

401
00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:04.230
was overextended,
at least in retrospect,

402
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:08.700
this is a re conquest that at least,
uh,

403
00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:12.570
consultants from a later generation would have said was a mistake.

404
00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.670
And overexpansion

405
00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:21.420
initially the main enemy of the Byzantine Empire after Justinian.

406
00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:29.800
So in the late sixth century,
early seventh century would be Persia.

407
00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:36.813
<v 1>Okay.</v>

408
00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.080
<v 0>But also at the same time,</v>

409
00:29:39.081 --> 00:29:44.081
the Byzantine Empire would start experiencing Danubian frontier incursions

410
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:49.720
attacks from the Balkans.
And here again,

411
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:52.580
as I said,
it's all invaders and heresies,
uh,

412
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:58.350
invasions from Slavs and a vars in the Balkans and the Persians in the east.

413
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:20.160
Okay.
In a five 91,

414
00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:22.800
a revolution toppled.

415
00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:27.240
The Persian ruler who peculiar oddly enough,

416
00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:31.050
fled to Byzantium for refuge where the emperor,

417
00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:36.570
the Emperor Maurice
helped him gain his threatened back

418
00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:40.380
in five 91,

419
00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:45.180
there was a peace between Persia and Byzantium and Byzantium seemed to have come

420
00:30:45.181 --> 00:30:50.181
out of this terrible period of warfare of the late sixth century.

421
00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:55.940
This allowed Maurice to turn his attention to his other front is Western

422
00:30:56.611 --> 00:31:01.170
northern front,
where the vars were,
um,
uh,

423
00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:03.840
uh,
a tremendous threat to him.

424
00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:07.980
The [inaudible] a central Asiatic people,
um,

425
00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:13.290
who come in through Central Asia into the Balkans and they carry with them to

426
00:31:13.291 --> 00:31:16.170
some extent the slobs.
Uh,

427
00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.680
the conventional portrayal used to be that the [inaudible] sort of lead the

428
00:31:19.681 --> 00:31:22.650
Slavs the latter are kind of passive.
Uh,

429
00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:27.680
it's a little more complicated than that be a vars had taken,

430
00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:29.270
um,
uh,

431
00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:33.360
the great cities of the Balkans and in four 92,

432
00:31:33.361 --> 00:31:37.530
Maurice turns to deal with them,
to push them back against the Danube.

433
00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.910
His army rebels against him and,
um,

434
00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:45.150
uh,
he's overthrown and killed.

435
00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:53.320
The beginning of the seventh century is the period of the maximum danger of

436
00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:55.123
Byzantium.

437
00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:59.990
It lasts with intermittent flashes from six o two,

438
00:31:59.991 --> 00:32:02.600
the overthrow of Maurice to seven 17,

439
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:05.000
the Arab siege of Constantinople.

440
00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:07.973
<v 1>Okay.</v>

441
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:11.130
<v 0>Immediately,
this new emperor focus</v>

442
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.240
is attacked by Persia,

443
00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:20.070
the Persian king claiming to revenge the murder of his benefactor,

444
00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:23.850
but in fact simply reopening the war with Constantinople

445
00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:29.020
in,
um,

446
00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.830
six Oh eight six oh nine,

447
00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:39.280
the Persians and the [inaudible] are allied.

448
00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:49.020
And the Persians are really on the march.
By six 17.
They have taken Egypt.

449
00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:53.880
They have taken Syria,
they've taken Jerusalem,
and the relic of the Holy Cross,

450
00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:57.570
uh,
has been taken back to the Persian capital.

451
00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:02.130
The emperor at this time [inaudible]

452
00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:07.123
<v 1>okay.</v>

453
00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:12.520
<v 0>Whom Wickham is not very impressed by admittedly a heretically is,
uh,</v>

454
00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:17.580
leads a resistance as does the patriarch to a siege bad is on both sides of the

455
00:33:21.221 --> 00:33:25.450
city of Constantinople.
On the one side,
the land side,

456
00:33:25.451 --> 00:33:30.451
the Theodore ocean walls or the vars and the Slavs on the boss for us across the

457
00:33:31.181 --> 00:33:35.710
city on the Asian side of the Bosphorus are the Persians.

458
00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:38.770
And what [inaudible] does is to confine,

459
00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:43.920
confide the city in the care of the patriarch and uh,

460
00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:47.200
go off and attack the Persians from the rear.

461
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:52.660
The patriarch defends the city,
not only by organizing the army,

462
00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:57.840
but by putting wonder working icons on the walls to face the enemy on icon is a

463
00:33:59.861 --> 00:34:04.030
painting of a sacred figure.
Uh,
it's,

464
00:34:04.031 --> 00:34:09.031
so then it is not a statue but a painting and it portrays a saint or Mary or

465
00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:16.780
Christ and in what has come to be called the orthodox tradition.

466
00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:20.230
These remain today a figure of the church,

467
00:34:20.231 --> 00:34:25.231
a very distinct kind of aspect of the piety of the east.

468
00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:29.710
The church,

469
00:34:29.711 --> 00:34:34.600
the patriarch a ordered that the church melt down all of the treasures that had

470
00:34:34.601 --> 00:34:38.800
been given to it to decorate it in order to pay for troops.

471
00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:44.980
Uh,
so,
uh,
the combination of the icons,
the money,
the,
uh,

472
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:46.510
uh,
uh,

473
00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:51.160
spirit of the populace and military means,

474
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:55.690
oh,
we're able to withstand this prolonged siege,

475
00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.590
uh,
at times a double siege of the Persians on the one side,

476
00:34:59.591 --> 00:35:01.510
the vars and the Slavs on the other side,

477
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:06.370
after many years of fighting in the east,

478
00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:10.600
Heraclitus succeeded in overthrowing the Persians

479
00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:16.240
at the battle of Nineveh in six 27.

480
00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:19.090
So this is a 17 year war or so.

481
00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:24.713
<v 1>Yes,</v>

482
00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:29.180
<v 0>I'm sorry.
Nineveh,</v>

483
00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:34.290
e h paraclese defeats the Persians and the Persian empire is virtually,

484
00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.270
uh,
uh,
uh,
it's crippled.

485
00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:47.920
Six 27 is an team would have seem to have been triumphant the first Arab

486
00:35:50.211 --> 00:35:51.230
attacks.
However,

487
00:35:51.231 --> 00:35:55.250
we're in six 30 for 12 years after Mohammed's had gyra

488
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:03.510
by six 36,
Syria had been taken by six 38.

489
00:36:03.511 --> 00:36:08.500
Jerusalem had been taken and the true cross again,
uh,
in this case,
um,

490
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.040
uh,
we lose sight of it.

491
00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:18.960
Persia itself would collapse in six 40 and pass under Arab rule.

492
00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:25.870
Egypt would fall in six 45.

493
00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:32.750
What's left of the empire then?
Is

494
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:38.570
the Balkans,
Anatolia,
some Armenian,

495
00:36:38.571 --> 00:36:43.100
some Slavic,
uh,
elements.
So weak.

496
00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:47.330
Is this empire so beset by enemies?

497
00:36:47.331 --> 00:36:48.410
Does it seem to be

498
00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:55.460
that a successor of heretically as the emperor Konstanz the second moved the

499
00:36:56.701 --> 00:36:59.820
capital to Sicily to the west

500
00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:07.770
calm stands the second ruled from Syracuse,
Syracuse,

501
00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.890
Sicily,
obviously the original Syracuse,

502
00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:16.320
he would be the last emperor to visit Rome.

503
00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:20.510
And he was actually the first,
since four 76.

504
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:27.660
So in six 62,
when he moved the capital to Sicily,

505
00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:33.990
we have the spectacle of a kind of ghost emperor visiting a ghost city

506
00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:39.450
visit of constant is the second to Rome and the,
um,

507
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:44.510
severe crisis of the eastern empire beset as it was now a particularly but not

508
00:37:46.981 --> 00:37:51.270
exclusively by the Arabs.
And indeed in six 74,

509
00:37:51.271 --> 00:37:53.790
the Arab fleet appeared off Constantinople

510
00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.930
in six 78 we here,
uh,

511
00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:02.960
for the first time of the weapon of the Greeks against the Arab fleets,

512
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:06.450
a weapon called Greek fire.

513
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:11.310
Greek fire is some kind of flaming projectile.
Now their words,

514
00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:15.930
something that you can shoot with a catapult or some other propulsion device

515
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:18.870
that will burst into flame.
Obviously you,

516
00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.450
you can't launch it if it's already burning.

517
00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:27.090
You have to have something that,
I mean,
yeah,
this is the essence of,
uh,

518
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:32.340
um,
basic,
uh,
bomb throwing.
You have to have something that is,
uh,

519
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:37.480
not going to,
uh,
you know,
that will explode on impact.
Uh,

520
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:40.390
Greek fire,
uh,
was,
um,

521
00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:44.860
particularly effective on wooden ships and on rigging and sales.

522
00:38:44.861 --> 00:38:47.120
It would set the ship's on fire.
Uh,

523
00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:50.800
and it's a weapon that seems to have been a unique,

524
00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:52.840
at least for awhile to the Byzantines,

525
00:38:52.841 --> 00:38:57.460
but paranthetically how was it that the Arabs have a navy in the first place?

526
00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:02.730
These people who decades before had never seen a river that flowed all year

527
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:06.520
long,
uh,
who had no experience with,
uh,

528
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:09.970
the c for whom the desert was the sea.

529
00:39:09.971 --> 00:39:14.530
It is an example of this kind of very rapid adaptability that we'll emphasize

530
00:39:14.531 --> 00:39:17.020
when we come to talk about the Islamic invasions.

531
00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:22.330
The East did survive even this attack

532
00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:26.440
the seventh century.

533
00:39:26.441 --> 00:39:31.300
We will be dealing with in more detail is a crucial turning point.
By this time,

534
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:36.390
the eastern Roman empire were talking about as the East is pretty much a Greek

535
00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:37.923
empire,

536
00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:42.220
Justinian would be the last emperor to speak Latin

537
00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:48.930
and the truncation of the empire with the loss of Egypt and the Near East means

538
00:39:50.021 --> 00:39:53.080
that it is pretty much a Greek empire.

539
00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:57.190
And also pretty much an orthodox empire.

540
00:39:57.191 --> 00:40:02.191
Orthodoxy is the Christian faith that stands between Nestorianism and

541
00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:08.290
monophysitism for the time the Orthodox world and the east and the Catholic

542
00:40:08.291 --> 00:40:10.060
world in the West are the same.

543
00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:15.070
They're official break won't I'm until 10 54.
And as you know,

544
00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:19.780
uh,
to this day the Orthodox churches of Russia,

545
00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:24.040
Greece,
uh,
and so forth look very different.

546
00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:29.710
Um,
and they also have certain duct trinal differences,
uh,
with the,

547
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:34.630
um,
the west.
That's not our subject for the time being.
We do have,

548
00:40:34.631 --> 00:40:37.660
however,
before the close of business,
one more heresy,

549
00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:42.970
a heresy that starts to divide the Byzantine Empire in the late seventh century.

550
00:40:43.751 --> 00:40:45.220
And that is iconoclasm

551
00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:52.050
iconoclasm which Wickham talks about in some detail and which he tells us to

552
00:40:52.451 --> 00:40:53.570
take seriously.

553
00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:59.160
What he means by that is that iconoclasm seems to be something that must not be

554
00:41:00.821 --> 00:41:04.390
about what it seems to be.
It's got to be about something else.

555
00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:11.580
ICONOCLASM is the belief that image is like icons in particular,

556
00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:12.791
uh,

557
00:41:12.791 --> 00:41:17.791
are dangerous and that bay lead to inappropriate worship of the image rather

558
00:41:18.881 --> 00:41:21.190
than what the image symbolizes.

559
00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:23.810
<v 1>Okay?</v>

560
00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:28.770
<v 0>So the iconoclasts believe in banning images of persons,</v>

561
00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:30.960
<v 1>okay,</v>

562
00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:35.690
<v 0>Lacrosse is fine,
but not a picture of a saint.</v>

563
00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:41.420
Even in some circles,
pictures of Christ would be suspect.

564
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:46.870
The danger of this reverence paid to icons is that the icon then becomes a

565
00:41:48.771 --> 00:41:53.360
sacred thing in itself and you're,
you fallen into idolatry,

566
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:57.030
you're worshiping multiple,
uh,

567
00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:58.580
representatives of the divine.

568
00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:01.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

569
00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:06.090
<v 0>Now it's certainly seems logical that this must have something to do with Islam</v>

570
00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:12.840
because Islam in its most monotheist manifestations frowns on and bands the

571
00:42:18.701 --> 00:42:23.701
representation of a purportedly divine figures.

572
00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:30.060
And it indeed doesn't like figure all representation at all in decoration of

573
00:42:30.671 --> 00:42:31.900
sacred spaces,

574
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:38.520
lest this be interpreted as exalting figures.

575
00:42:38.521 --> 00:42:42.630
Even the prophet at especially the Prophet himself,

576
00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:49.260
there are no pictures of Muhammad for home consumption,

577
00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:51.390
for mosque display.

578
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:59.230
And so it seems logical that this is a response to criticism from Islam that um,

579
00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:00.830
uh,

580
00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:05.420
Christianity is really not monifieth and monotheist that it's a form of idolatry

581
00:43:05.421 --> 00:43:09.590
because it has so many sacred figures and that the success of Islam and the

582
00:43:09.591 --> 00:43:14.591
success of the Arabs against Byzantium now might be caused by the abandonment of

583
00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.060
Mano a Mano,

584
00:43:17.061 --> 00:43:22.061
atheism and the abandonment of the worship of one God and the proliferation of

585
00:43:22.161 --> 00:43:26.210
multiple gods.
The problem is that there's no real evidence of this

586
00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:31.840
and um,

587
00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:35.380
you don't have to have Islam to force this kind of thing.

588
00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:40.990
If you look around the churches of much of northern Europe,

589
00:43:40.991 --> 00:43:45.991
you will see statues that have been decapitated by Protestants in the 16th and

590
00:43:47.321 --> 00:43:52.321
17th century or stained glass that was destroyed by Protestants.

591
00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:57.670
Protestantism is icon of clastic in many of its forms.

592
00:43:57.671 --> 00:44:01.510
In that it believed that the Catholic Church was superstitious,

593
00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:06.810
paid reverence to all of these saints and human figures and forgot in the

594
00:44:06.911 --> 00:44:11.140
process to concentrate on the single God.

595
00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:17.240
ICONOCLASM is a crisis of the empire.

596
00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:23.160
It is also like these other heresies,

597
00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:28.490
a recurrence of this problem of how to represent the connection between God and

598
00:44:28.651 --> 00:44:33.090
human beings.
What connects the divine with the human?

599
00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:35.040
Are there intermediaries?

600
00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:40.050
Is Christ an intermediary or is he god,
and if he's God,

601
00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:44.640
how is their intermediation?
Why does God care about us?

602
00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.670
How does God care about us?
How many

603
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:51.090
ways are there to approach him?

604
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:59.100
It took until eight 43 to settle this controversy.
I mean,

605
00:44:59.101 --> 00:45:02.490
it had many periods of settlement and then a record essence.

606
00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:08.420
It's a controversy that lasts then something on the order of 150 160 years at

607
00:45:08.821 --> 00:45:12.540
times and divides the empire completely.
At times not.

608
00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:15.510
It tends to be supported by the emperor.

609
00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:19.440
The emperor isn't iconoclast.
It tends to wane.

610
00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:21.570
It's supported by the emperors,

611
00:45:21.571 --> 00:45:26.571
partly as a way of trying to unify on mobilize the empire around the figure of

612
00:45:27.451 --> 00:45:32.451
the emperor instead of dissipating the energies around the various saintly

613
00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:37.490
figures.
So where are we with this,
uh,

614
00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:42.830
empire that seems to consist of only sieges and barbarian peoples and heresies

615
00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:50.250
in the ninth century would seem that the cities with the exception of

616
00:45:50.251 --> 00:45:55.251
Constantinople itself have declined to become little more than fortresses.

617
00:45:56.550 --> 00:46:01.200
We seem to be at the end of classical antiquity in some fundamental way of that

618
00:46:01.201 --> 00:46:05.790
society built around Mediterranean cities.
Society,

619
00:46:05.791 --> 00:46:08.610
even here as in the West is rural.

620
00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:14.670
There's not a whole lot of trade.
They're still our libraries with books in them,

621
00:46:14.671 --> 00:46:18.960
but they don't seem to be read very much.
We have very few texts from this era.

622
00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:22.110
It's a militarized society.

623
00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:25.650
It's an intensely religious one.

624
00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:33.500
There's very little secular literature really at the end of Greco Roman pagan

625
00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:37.890
knowledge
as it happens.
However,

626
00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:43.470
this period would usher in an era of surprising,

627
00:46:43.471 --> 00:46:47.640
at least in retrospect,
prosperity,
uh,
uh,

628
00:46:47.641 --> 00:46:49.260
for the Byzantine Empire.

629
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:54.360
And we will be talking about that later on Wednesday.

630
00:46:54.361 --> 00:46:57.230
We're going to discuss the reign of Justinian,
uh,

631
00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:01.530
through copious and in as a thing in itself.

632
00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:06.120
And then we will turn to the postdrome and world of the West subsequently.

633
00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:08.430
Thanks very much.
