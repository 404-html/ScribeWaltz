1
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.620
Today we're going to talk about the transformation of the Roman Empire.

2
00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:09.360
And I use the,
uh,
somewhat neutral,

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.270
an undramatic word transformation.

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.890
It can be fall of the Roman Empire collapse of the Roman Empire.

5
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.140
Be Clear that we're talking about the fall of the western empire.

6
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.610
Next week we'll talk about the survival of the eastern empire.

7
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.050
From four 10 to four 80,

8
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.440
the western Roman empire disintegrated.

9
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.940
It was dismembered by barbarian groups who were,

10
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.300
except for the huns,
not really very barbarian.
That is,

11
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:48.660
they were not intent on May ham and destruction.

12
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.980
All they really wanted to do was to be part of the empire,

13
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.160
to share in its wealth and accomplishments rather than to destroy it.

14
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.951
Nevertheless,

15
00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:06.951
for 76 is the conventional date for the end of the western empire.

16
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:09.450
Because,
uh,
in that year,

17
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.590
a barbarian chieftain deposed a Roman emperor.

18
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.890
Nothing very new about this for the fifth century.

19
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.100
What was new is that this chieftain whose name is spelled all sorts of different

20
00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:27.300
ways,
but in Wickham,

21
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.860
it's Oda Vase or sometimes these notice Oh,
away,
sir,
I would have a car.

22
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.880
Uh,
Odoacer a,
uh,

23
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.060
we don't even aren't even sure what so called tribe.

24
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:44.061
He belonged to a barbarian general deposed the child emperor Romulus Augustus,

25
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.780
who by an interesting coincidence has the names of both the founder of the city

26
00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:59.220
of Rome and the founder of the Roman emperor.

27
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.450
The US on the end is little.
It's a diminutive,
uh,

28
00:02:03.451 --> 00:02:08.190
so a man with this grandiose name,
a child deposed in four 76,

29
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:11.340
and instead of imposing another emperor,

30
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.980
Odoacer simply wrote to Constantinople it and said,
uh,

31
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.580
we're going to be loyal to you.

32
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.750
We will recognize you as the sole emperor.

33
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.600
Constantinople,
however,

34
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.540
was far away and while of symbolic significance,

35
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.810
this pledge of loyalty by Odoacer had no practical significance.

36
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.790
For all intents and purposes,

37
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.060
the western empire had enforced 76 become a collection of barbarian kingdom.

38
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.090
A kingdom is smaller than an empire.

39
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.680
We use the term empire to mean a multinational,

40
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.510
a very large state ruled from one center,

41
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:57.120
but consisting of many different kinds of pieces.

42
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.570
Kings and then term and title king is of German origin.

43
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.950
Kings are very powerful but over a more limited territory.

44
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:10.600
So there was a king of Italy.

45
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.620
Now there would be a king of the Franks or uh,
um,

46
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.910
France Franzia the former Roman goal.

47
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.660
There would be a king of the lombards later in northern Italy,

48
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.590
a king of the Visigoths,
first in southern France and Spain.

49
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:31.591
And we'll go over who is where at the beginning of next class for now.

50
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.570
We're going to talk about this collapse and its consequences and we're going to

51
00:03:39.571 --> 00:03:43.800
orient ourselves around three big questions.
One,

52
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.170
why did the west fall apart

53
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.130
as it kind of corollary to that question,

54
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.270
was this because of the external pressure of invasions or the internal problems

55
00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.130
of institutional decline?

56
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.650
Did it fall of its own accord or was it pushed,

57
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.960
in other words,
question number two or you know,
big question number two,

58
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.430
who were these barbarians and how romanized or how different from Rome worthy,

59
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.413
and that's,

60
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.520
we're going to talk about more in on Wednesday,
next class

61
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.950
and three,

62
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.760
does this transformation mark a gradual shift to another civilization or is it

63
00:04:35.071 --> 00:04:40.071
the cataclysmic end of the prevailing form of civilization ushering in a

64
00:04:41.641 --> 00:04:45.270
prolonged period of what used to be called?
The dark ages,

65
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.090
the dark ages,

66
00:04:48.091 --> 00:04:53.010
roughly the sixth to 11th century.

67
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.040
This is a term we don't like to use.
Uh,

68
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.540
it implies a value judgment that is not only not necessarily accurate,

69
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
but also expresses a certain kind of point of view of what are good periods in

70
00:05:11.491 --> 00:05:14.100
history and what are bad periods in history.

71
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.850
But I'd like to just probe this third question first.

72
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.070
And that is how severe a catastrophe was this.

73
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.540
So is it the end of civilization,

74
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.580
a La Planet of the apes or,
uh,
uh,

75
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.740
blade runner or any other kind of apocalyptic image we have?

76
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.770
Or is it merely a shift in power and the survival of Roman institutions such as

77
00:05:46.251 --> 00:05:50.720
the church,
while Roman political,
uh,
infrastructure,

78
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.700
the emperor,
the console's,
the Praetorian prefects,
uh,

79
00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.180
and so forth,
while that collapses,
uh,

80
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.670
a medieval historian named Roger Collins in a book called the early Middle Ages,

81
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:05.504
writes,

82
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.920
the fall of the Roman empire in the West was not the disappearance of a

83
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:10.850
civilization.

84
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.810
It was merely the breakdown of a governmental apparatus that could no longer be

85
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.800
sustained.
The key word here is merely

86
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.720
the destruction of the Roman political apparatus may simply mean that the Roman

87
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:32.930
state ceased to function,

88
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.200
but that everything else continued.

89
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.950
But really the question is could everything else continue in the absence of a

90
00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:46.430
state and have a political order?

91
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.660
The destruction of the political order also means after all the destruction of

92
00:06:52.661 --> 00:06:54.130
the military system.

93
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.190
When we opened this class,

94
00:07:00.191 --> 00:07:03.820
we talked about a civilization built on such things as the rule of law and the

95
00:07:03.821 --> 00:07:04.960
maintenance of peace.

96
00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:11.370
These are no longer possible if there is no military governmental structure,

97
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.560
as we'll say a little later.
To some extent,

98
00:07:17.561 --> 00:07:20.530
people didn't know that it was the end

99
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.860
because for a while things have seemed to go on as before.

100
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:31.090
People were speaking Latin,
they were living in cities.

101
00:07:31.091 --> 00:07:34.960
The cities were much less populated,
but nevertheless,

102
00:07:34.961 --> 00:07:38.920
they were still there.
There were still rich people.
There were still poor people.

103
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:44.350
Um,
in retrospect though,
we can see that things really did change.

104
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:48.910
How much they changed is the subject of a lot of historical controversy.

105
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:54.690
The world of late Roman historians is divided roughly speaking between

106
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:58.690
catastrophist and continuous.

107
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.120
As you may guess,

108
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.780
the catastrophist think the fall of the Roman empire,

109
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.710
whether we dated for 76 or there's some reasons to date it,

110
00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.460
really five 50 for reasons we'll learn in the next week.

111
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.990
Between four 50 and five 50,
a catastrophe happened.

112
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:22.060
A civilization was wiped out.
And,
uh,

113
00:08:22.061 --> 00:08:26.560
really,
um,
uh,
if not literally a dark ages,

114
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:31.210
a more primitive,
uh,
more warlike,

115
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:36.280
uh,
more illiterate and more rural period was ushered him.

116
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:39.783
<v 1>Okay.</v>

117
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.910
<v 0>The disappearance of ancient texts,</v>

118
00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:47.540
things that the Romans knew from that last Hortencia is dialogue of Cicero that

119
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.690
Augustine was so fond of,
uh,
to,
uh,

120
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.870
many other kinds of works that,
um,

121
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.240
had been known to the Roman world.
Right?

122
00:08:57.241 --> 00:09:00.210
I can't remember exactly how many plays aesculus rope,

123
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:04.350
but it's something on the order of 60.
And we have three.
Um,

124
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.740
so the disappearance of texts,
the end of literacy,

125
00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:12.270
except for a very small portion of the Christian clergy,

126
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.690
a more primitive architecture,

127
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:21.030
the end of grand civic projects like,
aqueducts,

128
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:26.430
coliseums theaters,
Babs,

129
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:32.010
a more isolated society without these urban centers.

130
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.090
I diminished population spread across the country side,

131
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.590
mostly engaged in subsistence,
hence the,

132
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:44.760
if not end of trade,
the radical diminution of trade.

133
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:51.170
The continuous people like Collins who might just quoted see the political

134
00:09:51.871 --> 00:09:53.610
changes as dramatical,
right,

135
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:57.900
but as essentially surface phenomenon based,

136
00:09:57.901 --> 00:10:02.850
partly on archeology and partly on a more sympathetic understanding of Christian

137
00:10:02.851 --> 00:10:06.960
practices.
In other words,
they don't think that the proliferation of churches,

138
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:11.340
saints Colts is necessarily a sign of primitiveness.

139
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.180
So based on both archaeology and an understanding of Christianity,

140
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:19.080
these continuous point to the survival of trade,

141
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:22.003
<v 1>the</v>

142
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.720
<v 0>role of bishops and other church officials as replacing the Roman governors,</v>

143
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:35.590
the Roman political order may have collapsed in terms of staffing by lay people

144
00:10:36.951 --> 00:10:38.690
and military people.

145
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:42.110
But the bishops were now the rulers of the city.

146
00:10:42.111 --> 00:10:47.111
The bishops would now do things like ensure the food supply Rally v uh,

147
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:52.850
local population against barbarian invasions,
educate the populace

148
00:10:55.370 --> 00:11:00.370
and the barbarian kings themselves try with some success to perpetuate the Roman

149
00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:09.400
order.
They collect taxes,
for example,
may or may not be a good thing.

150
00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:15.550
They engage in some kind of public works,
some kind of maintenance of order.

151
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:22.060
The civilization of the sixth and seventh centuries in what,

152
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:23.143
uh,

153
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:28.710
comes to be considered western Europe rather than the western Roman empire is

154
00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:34.410
not radically more Barb arised or primitive that in the late Roman Empire bus.

155
00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:40.150
The continuous my own position,
but I don't hold to it.

156
00:11:40.151 --> 00:11:45.151
Dogmatically is that of a moderate catastrophist uh,

157
00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:48.790
I,
uh,

158
00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.400
I,
something really happened,

159
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.050
<v 1>I think it's pretty radical.
Um,
and uh,</v>

160
00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.110
<v 0>it didn't happen all at once.
However,</v>

161
00:12:03.111 --> 00:12:06.660
for 76 is not the year of collapse a,

162
00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.180
it is a process.

163
00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:13.010
I'm fascinated by the degree to which people were and were not aware of the

164
00:12:13.011 --> 00:12:16.730
cataclysm,
but I believe there is a cataclysm Wickham,

165
00:12:16.731 --> 00:12:20.450
the author of this book that we're starting now,
the inheritance of Rome.

166
00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.380
Chris Wickham straddles the fence as you've seen,

167
00:12:24.381 --> 00:12:29.381
his chapter that you were to read for today is entitled crisis and continuity

168
00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.440
400 to five 15.
Um,

169
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.830
I would never use a chapter title like that cause it's really frustrating,

170
00:12:36.831 --> 00:12:41.060
you know,
which is it dude.
I mean he's,
he's,
he's the,

171
00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:45.290
he's the leading medieval historian in the English speaking world.
Uh,

172
00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.560
he is a cicily professor at all souls Oxford.

173
00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:53.330
And if that doesn't sound impressive,
uh,
you're not a while.

174
00:12:53.331 --> 00:12:56.340
It takes a lot to impress you.
He's a very great historian.
Uh,

175
00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.720
but I don't like that chapter title.
As I said,

176
00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:04.840
I would emphasize that crisis or change or cataclysm.

177
00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:07.041
Well,

178
00:13:07.041 --> 00:13:11.180
let's ask what happened beginning with the gradual involvement of the barbarians

179
00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.820
in the military and their entrance into the empire.

180
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:16.700
We're using the term barbarians,

181
00:13:16.701 --> 00:13:19.820
which goes back to the Greek term applied to outsiders,

182
00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:25.550
people outside,
but threatening
the Greeks,

183
00:13:25.551 --> 00:13:30.551
defined barbarians as uncivilized by reason of their speech,

184
00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:36.010
which sounded to them in coherent by reason of the fact that they're nomads.

185
00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:42.060
People who lead settled lives don't trust no nomads,

186
00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.570
almost extinct in our world,
once,
uh,

187
00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.470
dominated many geographical regions,

188
00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:53.800
and we're frightening because they moved around to people who liked order and

189
00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:58.130
familiarity.
They didn't live in cities,

190
00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:01.640
whether there were nomadic or not.
Barbarians were illiterate.

191
00:14:01.641 --> 00:14:04.850
This is the Greek idea of barbarians.

192
00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.460
In the case of Rome,

193
00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:14.040
there is no single definition of barbarian society.

194
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:20.360
We can say that Rome was overthrown by a warlike,

195
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.860
but not very fierce group of enemies.

196
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:31.440
And I use enemies in a very mild sense.
The Romans perceived them as enemies.

197
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:36.690
The barbarians perceived Rome as simply a nicer place to live,

198
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:37.853
<v 1>okay?</v>

199
00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:44.740
<v 0>But there is no Mongol hoard kind of event here.</v>

200
00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:52.310
They're not that frightening.
The Romans had known them centuries.

201
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:57.950
Most of them weren't even Christians.
Heretical Christians,
okay?

202
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.960
They're Ariens a R.
I.
A.
N.
S.
I remind you,
but they're not,

203
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.620
uh,
uh,
unfamiliar again,
even in their religion.

204
00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:08.900
<v 1>Okay?</v>

205
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.360
<v 0>They had been at the borders of the Roman Empire for forever,</v>

206
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:17.780
like most empires.

207
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:21.620
Rome was that the one hand very aggressive and on the other hand,

208
00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:23.120
thought of itself as peace loving.

209
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.790
It maintained the Daniel Bryan frontier as a kind of natural frontier every so

210
00:15:28.791 --> 00:15:33.791
often crossing those rivers to punish German tribes who were probing the

211
00:15:34.041 --> 00:15:36.380
frontiers of the empire.
But generally speaking,

212
00:15:36.381 --> 00:15:41.381
the Romans were not interested in what they perceived somewhat inaccurately as

213
00:15:41.541 --> 00:15:44.360
endless forests inhabited by primitive

214
00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:45.453
<v 1>people.</v>

215
00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:53.460
<v 0>The continuous argue with some justice that between two 50 and 600,</v>

216
00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:58.410
what changed was not that primitive warriors conquered a civilized state in a

217
00:15:58.411 --> 00:16:03.060
way that say the Mongols conquered China in the 13th century,

218
00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:07.170
but that the ancient world became the medieval world.

219
00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:11.580
That is an urban culture became more rural,

220
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.930
a Latin culture became al amalgamated to a German one.

221
00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:22.480
Pagan Society became Christian.
Having said this,

222
00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:27.040
it's nevertheless true that the most dramatic event of the fifth century is that

223
00:16:27.041 --> 00:16:29.410
people who had been outside the empire,
we're now in it.

224
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.720
If we ask why the western empire collapsed,

225
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:41.050
the simple most immediate answer is it was taken over by German confederations

226
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.680
tribes.
They came not so much as conquerors,

227
00:16:45.681 --> 00:16:50.681
as military recruits or as allies or as refugees.

228
00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:57.580
So rather than as guys with knives in their teeth hacking and slashing and

229
00:16:58.641 --> 00:16:59.474
burning,

230
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:04.490
they came as pathetic refugees and maybe doing some hacking,

231
00:17:04.491 --> 00:17:06.960
slashing and burning,
uh,

232
00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:12.020
as military recruits and as military allies.

233
00:17:12.021 --> 00:17:16.730
Again,
not without a certain amount of HSP

234
00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:23.210
hacking and slashing and burning,
but,
uh,
you know,
not a cataclysmic amount.

235
00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.460
They admired Rome.

236
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:31.850
They want it to continue its institutions.
They regarded Rome as rich,

237
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.090
and that's civil law.

238
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.440
The last thing they wanted was to still live in kind of little huts in the

239
00:17:38.601 --> 00:17:39.434
forest.

240
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.970
They were not the bringers of a revolution.

241
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:49.450
They were not even that numerous amounting to some tens of thousands.

242
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.210
<v 1>Okay?</v>

243
00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:56.740
<v 0>Nevertheless,
they ended.</v>

244
00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:01.590
Roman government accelerated the changes we've already described towards deep

245
00:18:01.591 --> 00:18:04.960
population.
De-Centralization ruralization

246
00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.580
a more,
uh,
uh,

247
00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:15.670
a less cultivated,
less literate,
less Mediterranean centered society.

248
00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:22.600
So I want to be given the description of this process by the changes in the

249
00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:23.434
Roman army.

250
00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:28.560
We saw the Diocletian around 300 d militarizes.

251
00:18:28.661 --> 00:18:31.750
Roman government pays for the,

252
00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:37.410
perhaps doubling of the military presence of the Roman army by,

253
00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.690
uh,
changing the taxation system.

254
00:18:40.691 --> 00:18:43.810
So the twin pillars of the empire in the fourth century,

255
00:18:43.811 --> 00:18:46.810
our army and taxation,

256
00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:50.260
the latter requiring a civilian governmental apparatus.

257
00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:57.790
The army was a problem in terms of the recruiting of soldiers.

258
00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.400
This may have to do with the population,

259
00:19:00.401 --> 00:19:03.820
it may have to do with the unattractive nature of military life.

260
00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:08.470
But nevertheless,
there was already in the fourth century,

261
00:19:08.471 --> 00:19:12.040
a tendency to get,
uh,

262
00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:17.130
the more familiar barbarians into the army as Roman soldiers because they were

263
00:19:19.601 --> 00:19:23.140
available.
They weren't near the frontiers.

264
00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.760
This may seem odd,

265
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:30.990
why hire your potential enemy to be soldiers?

266
00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:34.660
But there's a lot of precedent.

267
00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:39.990
Very often empires don't really want to supply their own manpower.

268
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:47.310
And the people who are the best soldiers are also the people who may in the

269
00:19:47.501 --> 00:19:52.300
future be most threatening.
I don't want to pursue this similarly,

270
00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:57.450
but the Afghan mujahideen were trained by Americans because at one time they

271
00:19:59.501 --> 00:20:04.360
were opposed to the Russian occupation of Afghanistan as it happened.

272
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:07.180
In retrospect,
that had some bad consequences.

273
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:10.270
But at the time it seemed like a good idea.

274
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:14.710
So in the three,
seven days,

275
00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:20.970
a group called the Visigoths asks to be admitted to the Roman Empire as an

276
00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:25.600
allied army.
In other words,
the whole group

277
00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:33.300
will be federated with the Romans and Federer.

278
00:20:33.751 --> 00:20:38.751
Rati is the term given for barbarian troops serving under the Roman empire.

279
00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:50.140
Why were they on the move?
These not really nomadic people.
They don't,
you know,

280
00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:54.660
they don't travel and live in Yurts or uh,
uh,

281
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:59.140
travel across Central Asia.
They tend to be settled in villages.

282
00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:01.960
They have dairy cattle rather than,
you know,

283
00:21:01.961 --> 00:21:05.950
some kind of a nomadic sheep or something like that.
Uh,

284
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:09.760
they're pretty settled.
Nevertheless,
in three 78,

285
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:13.600
they were on the move and uh,

286
00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:19.680
we don't know why some enemy pushing them across the Danube into what's now

287
00:21:21.521 --> 00:21:22.354
Romania,

288
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:28.150
maybe the weakness of the empire,

289
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.580
they may have seen that the empire was not so strong and made a proposition kind

290
00:21:33.581 --> 00:21:36.340
of like a,
a takeover,
you know,

291
00:21:36.341 --> 00:21:41.270
you don't seem to be doing so well in your,
uh,
uh,
uh,

292
00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:44.770
stock or your,
um,
finances.
So we're going to,

293
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:49.150
we're going to infuse some capital a.
N.
T.
U.
A.
N.
I.
E.

294
00:21:49.151 --> 00:21:50.140
Our soldiers.

295
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:54.550
They also may have been hungry certainly once they crossed the frontier,

296
00:21:54.551 --> 00:21:58.510
the Romans were rather inept in feeding them and supplying them and the

297
00:21:58.511 --> 00:21:59.680
Visigoths rebelled.

298
00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:01.680
<v 1>Okay.</v>

299
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.500
<v 0>Thus far,
nothing incredibly knew.</v>

300
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:09.950
What really was new was that the emperor came and with an army to suppress them

301
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:15.780
and rather to his surprise and everybody else's,
the emperor valence was defeated

302
00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:24.860
at the battle of Adrian nopal defeated by the barbarians.

303
00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:30.650
Yup.
Being allowed in this federal,

304
00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:33.360
what did they get from the Roman Empire?

305
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.820
Like did they agree to fight for that land?

306
00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:39.660
May agreed to fight for them and they got a combination of land or supposed to

307
00:22:39.661 --> 00:22:43.490
get land or territory and,
um,

308
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.770
some kind of maintenance in kind and or money.

309
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.310
The question was about the,

310
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:54.770
what the Visigoths as federal rotting got out of this deal or we're supposed to

311
00:22:54.931 --> 00:22:55.764
get,

312
00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:01.150
<v 1>mmm.</v>

313
00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:06.150
<v 0>The defeat of valence was not immediately cataclysmic because even though he was</v>

314
00:23:06.851 --> 00:23:11.170
killed at this battle,
even though it sent shock waves throughout the empire,

315
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:15.850
um,
in fact,
it would not be this area that succumbed to the barbarians.

316
00:23:15.851 --> 00:23:17.680
The east Romania

317
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:24.070
or the Balkans would be part of the eastern empire.

318
00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:28.360
And indeed both Adrian,
opal,
the city and Constantinople,

319
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:33.390
the even greater city would withstand visit gothic attempts to take them in

320
00:23:34.271 --> 00:23:37.840
three 82 the Visigoths were officially recognized and they were allowed to

321
00:23:37.841 --> 00:23:42.580
settle in the Balkans as federal rati and in fact they were reasonably useful

322
00:23:42.581 --> 00:23:46.710
troops to the Roman Empire in the three eighties and three nine days.

323
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:51.440
What this does show,
however,

324
00:23:51.441 --> 00:23:56.441
is the Barbara's one of the army and another aspect of that is that the army

325
00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:01.570
tended to be commanded.
Now more and more by barbarian generals.

326
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:08.620
These barbarian generals at the top bore the title McGeester militant master of

327
00:24:11.571 --> 00:24:12.560
the soldiers,

328
00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:18.670
so I'm using the term general as a anachronistic one since that's what we're

329
00:24:21.201 --> 00:24:23.900
familiar with,
these mid guests tree,

330
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:27.740
we're powerful leaders,

331
00:24:27.741 --> 00:24:32.741
charismatic leaders of German or other tribal groups

332
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:41.710
who then ruled in the name of or behind the throne of the emperor.

333
00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:48.350
They couldn't be emperors themselves.
At least in these years.

334
00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:52.220
It was impossible to envisage a barbarian emperor,

335
00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:56.390
but they held more power than the emperors.

336
00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:04.510
Two of these generals or war leaders [inaudible] still echo

337
00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:11.660
and Alaric still echo was a vandal Alaric was a visit Goff Alaric wanted

338
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:18.590
territory food treasure from Rome.

339
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:23.510
The Visigoths were moving from the Balkans into Greece,

340
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:25.670
eventually into Italy.

341
00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:32.390
Still Echo played a kind of game with Alaric trying to keep him in check in the

342
00:25:32.391 --> 00:25:36.410
name of the Western emperor,
but also negotiating with him.

343
00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:39.813
<v 1>Okay.</v>

344
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:44.870
<v 0>The emperor's moved from Milan in the north to Ravenna,</v>

345
00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.310
a little bit to the east.

346
00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:51.340
Ravenna then was in the marshes and impossible for a barbarian army to take mrs

347
00:25:54.021 --> 00:25:56.990
the last capital of the western Roman Empire.

348
00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:03.610
Kind of romantic but and mysterious but strange as a place to end up.

349
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

350
00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:14.370
<v 0>These are the Visigoths then who are on the move in the three nineties and the</v>

351
00:26:14.371 --> 00:26:17.490
four arts eventually

352
00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:24.140
still echo would be executed by the Roman emperor of the west and our wreck

353
00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:28.020
would invade and plunder Rome.

354
00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:33.080
In four 10 it was the Visigoths who engineered the so called sack of Rome that

355
00:26:35.741 --> 00:26:39.060
so shocked Augustine and his contemporaries

356
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:49.530
where you might be asking in all of this was the Roman army.

357
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Alaric was wandering around the Balkans and Italy for two decades before he

358
00:26:57.061 --> 00:26:57.894
sacked Rome.

359
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:05.990
The army which had consumed so much of the resources of the Roman Empire is

360
00:27:06.631 --> 00:27:11.631
curiously absent in the history of the fifth century.

361
00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:14.340
This is not,
you know,

362
00:27:14.341 --> 00:27:18.360
the the eastern front in World War II.

363
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:21.990
This is something altogether different.

364
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:27.020
The collapse of an empire that expended huge amounts of treasure on its army.

365
00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:33.320
It's army seems to be invisible and supports to some extent or that fact

366
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:37.650
supports to some extent the argument that the Roman Empire collapsed of its own

367
00:27:37.651 --> 00:27:39.330
internal disorders.

368
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:44.490
Since we don't see it losing pitched battles to outside barbarians

369
00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.600
or maybe the army doesn't disappear,

370
00:27:49.601 --> 00:27:51.940
it becomes indistinguishable from the invaders.

371
00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:57.400
The army is the invaders
creepier.

372
00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:03.520
Now within this,
there are some real barbarians.
The hands,

373
00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:08.380
the hands are kind of nomadic.
Okay.

374
00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:12.940
They didn't actually cook their meat by holding it between their thigh and the

375
00:28:12.941 --> 00:28:17.530
horse,
uh,
hide and the sweat and heat of the horse heated up the meat.

376
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:22.000
This is a widespread myth of nomadic peoples though that Chinese say this about

377
00:28:22.001 --> 00:28:26.710
the Hmong goals.
Uh,
the Romans about the huns,
but they were pretty,

378
00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:31.000
they were pretty mean.
Um,
they were interested in the Roman Empire,

379
00:28:31.001 --> 00:28:35.650
mostly for plunder,
and they didn't care if that destroyed,
uh,

380
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:40.390
the,
uh,
economic base because they weren't thinking in such terms.

381
00:28:40.391 --> 00:28:45.391
And indeed they may have frightened the rather nice German tribes that stood

382
00:28:46.661 --> 00:28:49.870
between them and the Roman Empire in the four fifties.

383
00:28:49.871 --> 00:28:53.620
The hunts where United under the leadership of a tele,

384
00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:57.140
Eh,
and,
uh,

385
00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:01.780
Attila certainly threatened

386
00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:08.790
the eastern empire first,

387
00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:13.890
but the eastern emperor defeated the Huns,
discontinued tribute to them.

388
00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:17.940
And in a pattern that we'll see repeated again and again.

389
00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:22.440
The huns decided that Constantinople was too tough,

390
00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:27.810
that the eastern empire as a whole access to which was more or less controlled

391
00:29:27.811 --> 00:29:29.010
by Constantinople,

392
00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:34.610
was too well guarded and they turned to the West instead.

393
00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:38.340
Not as rich maybe,
but much easier pickings.

394
00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.070
They show up in Gaul in four 50.

395
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:47.430
They were defeated by an army of Visigoths allied with uh,

396
00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:52.850
Romans
are they then went to Italy.

397
00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:55.100
They went into the heart of the empire,

398
00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:59.330
sacked cities in the northeast of Italy

399
00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:05.750
and there's no army.
The emperor is holed up in Ravenna,
basically shuts the door,

400
00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.000
gets under the bed and waits for it to go away.

401
00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:13.810
But one power of Italy willing to try to deal with a teller is the bishop of

402
00:30:16.851 --> 00:30:19.400
Rome whom we haven't heard of yet.

403
00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.520
What we're going to be hearing about him a lot.

404
00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:26.960
And indeed in the course that follows this even more,
the bishop of Rome,

405
00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:30.260
the Pope,
Pope Leo the first,

406
00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:35.690
along with two senators from the Roman Senate,

407
00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:41.500
goes up to northern Italy to Ramon straight with a teller to visit the leader of

408
00:30:42.801 --> 00:30:47.801
this barbarian tribe in four 53 to try to get him to stop plundering Adelai

409
00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:55.260
whether they were successful or not,
doesn't much matter because until it died,

410
00:30:55.290 --> 00:31:00.180
shortly thereafter of a brain hemorrhage and with his charismatic leadership,

411
00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:04.620
the huns came to an end as a military force.

412
00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:08.800
That is with the end of his leadership,
the Huns,
uh,

413
00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:13.850
no longer had a as imposing a military force and quickly disintegrated.

414
00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:20.640
What's significant is that it's the pope who is taking over what we would think

415
00:31:20.641 --> 00:31:23.610
of as the Roman imperial responsibilities.

416
00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:27.360
And this will be a pattern not only in the assertion of paypal power,

417
00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:32.660
but in the way in which the church starts to take over many of the roles

418
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:36.960
abandoned by the empire.

419
00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:42.723
<v 1>Okay.</v>

420
00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:43.573
<v 0>MMM.</v>

421
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:45.740
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

422
00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:49.550
<v 0>After this,
the barbarian generals in effect take charge.</v>

423
00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:54.740
The hunter defeated,
but the other groups now pour in to the empire.

424
00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:00.050
The vandals have taken over north Africa by this time,

425
00:32:00.051 --> 00:32:04.340
by four 30 cutting off the grain supply to Rome.

426
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:10.520
They are unusual among the barbarian groups in the bay have a navy,

427
00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:11.690
I know how to use boats,

428
00:32:11.691 --> 00:32:16.040
and indeed they plunder the city of Rome in four 55 in a sack.

429
00:32:16.041 --> 00:32:18.560
That might've been worse than that of four 10.

430
00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:20.593
<v 1>Okay.</v>

431
00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:25.790
<v 0>By four 70,
the Visigoths control southern gall,</v>

432
00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.380
what's now southern France,

433
00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:31.070
a group called the Swayze are in Spain.

434
00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:34.403
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

435
00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:36.520
<v 0>The vandals in North Africa.</v>

436
00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:41.750
A group called the Ostrogoths in what's now Hungary,

437
00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.290
the angles and the Saxons in Britain,

438
00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:58.290
all that effectively remainder of the western empire.

439
00:32:58.291 --> 00:33:03.291
When Odoacer overthrew Romulus Augustus was Italy and enforced 76

440
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:06.143
<v 1>that's it.</v>

441
00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:10.420
<v 0>A little Coda.
However,
in for 93,</v>

442
00:33:10.421 --> 00:33:14.980
the eastern emperor in Constantinople convinced the Ostrogoths

443
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:23.830
to get out of Hungary and stop threatening the eastern empire and take Italy

444
00:33:24.591 --> 00:33:27.860
from Odoacer.
Once again,

445
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:32.950
the eastern empire is capable of deflecting barbarians into the West because

446
00:33:34.041 --> 00:33:38.210
they're too strong.
So in four 93,

447
00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:42.970
our friend Odoacer was overthrown by the physical,
uh,

448
00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:47.360
Ostrogoths
and their leader Theodoric.

449
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:57.870
So what's the impact of all of us
on the ground?

450
00:33:57.930 --> 00:34:01.950
If you were looking around in four eighties for nineties,

451
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.440
you would see a kind of accommodation.

452
00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:10.070
The Roman elite accommodated themselves to compromised with negotiated with

453
00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:16.650
their new rulers.
So for example,

454
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:28.270
a member of a very wealthy Roman family man named Snowdonia Cipolla narrows in

455
00:34:29.721 --> 00:34:30.860
southern France.

456
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:43.670
It was eight bishop and a great land owner.

457
00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:45.560
And we have a lot of letters of his,

458
00:34:45.561 --> 00:34:49.730
the tell us about his negotiations with the visit.
Gothic King,
you're a wreck.

459
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:55.400
He found the visit,
golfs,
uncouth,
hard to deal with.

460
00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:01.130
Not Knowledgeable of the Latin classics,

461
00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.470
but not very frightening either.

462
00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:09.370
Not particularly formidable.
So accommodation,

463
00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:12.560
uh,
improvisation.

464
00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:19.780
We have a saint's life that is a biography of a saint,

465
00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:24.860
a man named,
I'm sorry that I'm writing on the board so much today.

466
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:29.210
Usually as you know,
I'm a little more in control,

467
00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.230
but these are great names and,

468
00:35:31.231 --> 00:35:36.130
and some of them are good cat names or dog names to several wryness of Nora Cup.

469
00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:40.170
You know,
stop scratching the furniture,
set rightness,
that kind of thing.

470
00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:45.660
Several dryness of [inaudible] a saint in what's now more or less Austria.

471
00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:52.700
His life tells us,
uh,
that,
um,

472
00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:57.930
he learned of the end of the Roman Empire this way.

473
00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:02.620
At the time when the Roman empire was still in existence,

474
00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:07.870
the soldiers of many towns were supported by public money to guard the frontier.

475
00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.240
When this arrangement ceased,

476
00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:13.930
the military formations were dissolved and the frontier vanished.

477
00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:19.180
The garrison of Pasa cause still a town in modern Bavaria.

478
00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:25.300
The garrison at pal out,
however,

479
00:36:25.301 --> 00:36:30.301
still held out some of the men had gone to Italy to fetch for their comrades,

480
00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:36.310
their last payment.
This resembles,
you know,
a corporation.

481
00:36:36.311 --> 00:36:39.910
Somebody actually was telling me yesterday they'd worked for Eastern Airlines.

482
00:36:39.911 --> 00:36:44.770
I company that went out of business in 1990 and so sudden was the collapse of

483
00:36:44.771 --> 00:36:47.950
eastern even though it had been predicted that,
um,

484
00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:52.450
she was a flight attendant and had to get on another airline in order to get

485
00:36:52.451 --> 00:36:55.750
home that she lived in New York.
She was in Florida.

486
00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:59.890
Eastern cease to exist.
So these soldiers are in the same position.

487
00:36:59.891 --> 00:37:04.630
They want to get their last paycheck.
They were never heard from again.

488
00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:09.790
Nobody knew that they in fact were killed by barbarians on the way.

489
00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:13.900
One day when saint several wryness was reading in his cell,

490
00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:18.930
he suddenly closed the book and began to saw the river he said was now red with

491
00:37:19.481 --> 00:37:21.760
human blood.
At that moment,

492
00:37:21.761 --> 00:37:25.660
the news arrived at the soldiers had been washed ashore by the current.

493
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:31.480
Interestingly enough,
he doesn't just stay in his cell and pray.

494
00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:35.710
He starts to organize this society.

495
00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:40.890
He is active although some of it involves some miracles in poor relief.

496
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.920
He deals with the local barbarian king,
King of the alimony.

497
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:52.743
<v 1>Okay.</v>

498
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:57.660
<v 0>Vermont's straights with him.
He helps in diverting,</v>

499
00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.330
owed away Sar into Italy.

500
00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:03.013
<v 1>Okay.</v>

501
00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.980
<v 0>Again,
like Pope Leo,</v>

502
00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:08.820
we have a member of the church and in this case somebody that you would think

503
00:38:08.821 --> 00:38:12.570
was a wreck lose indeed had been living like a reckless.

504
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:17.990
Nevertheless taking over the responsibilities for a population abandoned by its

505
00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:22.860
civilian government.

506
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:27.510
That is then one of the forms of accommodation.

507
00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:33.250
Another aspect of this era,
however,
is declined.

508
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:38.620
The urban population declines.

509
00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:41.890
The society and economy experience.

510
00:38:41.891 --> 00:38:46.891
What Wickham euphemistically calls a radical material simplification

511
00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:53.840
term.
He uses,
I believe on page 95 and one o five radical materials.

512
00:38:53.841 --> 00:38:58.750
Simplification means that your standard of living plummets,

513
00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:01.510
crude or ceramics.

514
00:39:01.511 --> 00:39:06.511
Instead of that Nice North African red slip where you've got kind of mud that

515
00:39:06.521 --> 00:39:10.210
you baked at home.
Fewer imports,

516
00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.273
no pepper,

517
00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:18.010
more homemade crude building materials,

518
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:20.980
fewer luxury goods.

519
00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:26.730
The vandal control of North Africa met the,

520
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:30.160
meant the end of the Roman wheat supply.

521
00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:37.890
The countryside of Rome had not grown enough wheat to feed the city since 200 a

522
00:39:38.591 --> 00:39:39.940
d a BC.

523
00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:46.110
So for 600 years minimum Rome was dependent on other sources of supply.

524
00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:51.340
Southern Italy,
Sicily,
North Africa.

525
00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:56.290
The moment the vandal supply of the vandals cut the supply,

526
00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:02.140
the city could no longer support its massive population,

527
00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:04.300
could not feed everybody.

528
00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:07.960
When you multiply this phenomenon,

529
00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:13.410
it's not a surprise that the city's decline in population and that the society

530
00:40:13.631 --> 00:40:18.310
becomes more rural,
more agricultural,
more subsistence.

531
00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:23.340
And here's where I think Collins is naive to speak of merely a political decline

532
00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:28.930
without a government and military structure.

533
00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:34.380
Trade could not take place on the scale it had before and without that trade,

534
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:36.760
cities could not serve off.

535
00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:43.060
There is no denying a decline in culture,
economy,

536
00:40:43.061 --> 00:40:44.050
and population.

537
00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:50.410
Let's just look at Roman population figures

538
00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:57.300
based on things like pork supply figures,
public,
I mean,

539
00:40:57.301 --> 00:40:59.240
nobody took a census in rumps.
I mean,
you know,

540
00:40:59.241 --> 00:41:03.070
we don't really know exactly how many people live there at any given time,

541
00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:08.410
but historians and archaeologists looking at things like food supply,

542
00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.300
public welfare payments,

543
00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:15.690
water delivery figures for aqueducts and the abandonment of houses and of

544
00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:20.410
building sites.
Probably in five BC,

545
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:27.480
the Roman population was 800,000 that would be a fairly conservative estimate,

546
00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:30.040
maybe as much as a million,

547
00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:35.980
but definitely 800,005 BC.
Yup.
Is it just the city of Rome?

548
00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:38.840
Just the city of Rome?
Yes.
Just the city of Rome

549
00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:46.720
at the time of Constantine,
sort of where we begin the course more or less,

550
00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:50.140
three early fourth century,

551
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:54.370
the population had declined probably to 600,000

552
00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:02.110
after the sack of Rome in four 19 probably

553
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:08.140
300 to 500,000 obviously these are very rough figures,

554
00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:10.810
but after the sack of Rome,

555
00:42:11.350 --> 00:42:16.350
more than half of the population that had existed in five BC is gone

556
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:22.910
with the declared the end of grain shipments from North Africa.

557
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:26.240
We don't really know immediately.

558
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:35.510
We can estimate that by five 90 there could not have been more than a 150,000

559
00:42:37.171 --> 00:42:42.060
people in Rome.
This is after not only the vandals,

560
00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.720
but after a catastrophic war in Italy,

561
00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:48.000
launched by the Byzantine Emperor.

562
00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:50.370
Justinian can we'll be talking about next week.

563
00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:53.450
<v 1>Okay.</v>

564
00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:55.850
<v 0>In 800 on Christmas Day,</v>

565
00:42:55.851 --> 00:43:00.851
Charlemagne was crowned in Saint Peter's in Rome as Roman emperor by the pope,

566
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:06.530
an act who's implications we will be exploring towards the end of the class.

567
00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:08.060
On that day,

568
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:13.340
Rome must've had maximum maximum,

569
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.820
most optimistic estimate,
30,000 people.

570
00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:25.430
This does not necessarily mean that they were primitive,

571
00:43:25.431 --> 00:43:30.110
but they were living in the coliseum.
For example,
people built houses in there.

572
00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:33.050
They use the walls of the coliseum as a fort.

573
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:36.770
There is a certain planet of the apes quality.
In fact,

574
00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:41.480
Rome still to this day is filled with picture rescue ruins.

575
00:43:41.481 --> 00:43:45.380
Even though it is a city of two and a half,
3 million people.

576
00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:53.140
As I said,
people were not necessarily aware of this change.

577
00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:54.220
For example,

578
00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:58.240
lots of churches were built at this time and some of them have mosaic payments

579
00:43:58.241 --> 00:44:02.880
that pavements that have mottoes about the grand juror of the Roman name.

580
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:05.290
Usual classical kind of mottoes.

581
00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:06.883
<v 1>Okay,</v>

582
00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:11.480
<v 0>but then again,
people often aren't aware of what's happening to them.
I mean,</v>

583
00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:16.960
what if somebody in the future points to the fact that new haven in 1920 had far

584
00:44:18.411 --> 00:44:20.930
more people living in it than it does now.

585
00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:27.420
New Haven lost a third of its population between 1950 and 1980

586
00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:33.840
what if some future historian is scandalized at the fact that in order to get

587
00:44:33.841 --> 00:44:37.740
into Yale a hundred years ago,
you had to know Greek and Latin?

588
00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:44.240
If you look at what those gentlemen see students had to study or we're

589
00:44:46.051 --> 00:44:50.040
responsible for in say,
1925,

590
00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:54.000
it's extraordinary.
It's not very impressive in the sciences,

591
00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:56.430
but the decline of the humanities,

592
00:44:57.630 --> 00:45:02.630
if by decline we mean things like knowledge of classical literature is stunning.

593
00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:07.970
Somebody may decide in a few hundred years that the dark ages began in about

594
00:45:09.751 --> 00:45:14.751
1950 and that those pathetic people in say 2011 impressed with their little

595
00:45:20.641 --> 00:45:24.540
technological toys.
Nonetheless,
didn't know anything.

596
00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:29.100
Now,
I don't actually believe that there are some people who do.

597
00:45:29.101 --> 00:45:33.030
There's a philosopher at Notre Dame and a Alister McIntyre,
who,

598
00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:37.170
who really believes that the dark ages began a long time ago,

599
00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:41.700
and we simply don't know.
We simply refuse to recognize this.
Uh,

600
00:45:41.701 --> 00:45:45.600
I was impressed by an obituary for men and Patrick Leigh Fermor,

601
00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:50.160
uh,
who died at the age of 96,
um,
earlier this year.

602
00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:52.500
Uh,

603
00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:57.500
this is the last of the Great British characters of the 20th century.

604
00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:03.360
He not only was classically trained,
wrote a lot about Greece,

605
00:46:03.361 --> 00:46:07.520
lived in Greece.
Uh,
he in World War II,

606
00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:09.660
um,
uh,

607
00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:13.800
disguised himself as a Greek shepherd in Crete,

608
00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:19.200
engineered the capture of a German general and the delivery of that general

609
00:46:19.201 --> 00:46:22.290
after three weeks of hiking through the mountains of creek to a British

610
00:46:22.291 --> 00:46:26.130
destroyer.
Um,
it's in a movie called,
um,

611
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:30.840
ill met by moonlight if you ever want to check this out.
Not a great movie,

612
00:46:30.841 --> 00:46:35.340
but Patrick Leigh Fermor also wrote two books out of a projected three about

613
00:46:35.341 --> 00:46:39.420
walking from Holland to Constantinople,

614
00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:44.040
Constantinople or Baghdad actually I think in the 1930s.
Um,

615
00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:47.400
but the obituary describes,

616
00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:51.720
uh,
a conversation he had with this general,

617
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:54.690
this German general whom he is,
you know,

618
00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:59.840
kind of trying to get across Crete and the general at one point over some fire

619
00:47:00.541 --> 00:47:04.290
in the wilderness quotes aligned from Horace,

620
00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:09.680
the Roman poet that then Patrick Leigh fermor finishes for him and indeed quotes

621
00:47:10.321 --> 00:47:13.620
the next two stanzas.
Uh,

622
00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:18.460
well that world is over.
That world is over.
Uh,

623
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:22.920
I don't pretend to be part of that world either.
Um,

624
00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:29.130
and that's a world that would have existed in the time of Horace,

625
00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:34.290
the years after Horace who lives,
um,
at the time of Augustus,
uh,

626
00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:39.600
this would have existed in 300 d it would have existed at least in a few

627
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:40.900
monasteries in 880.

628
00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:45.970
It would have flourished in the Britain of the 18th and 19th and early 20th

629
00:47:45.971 --> 00:47:46.804
centuries.

630
00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:48.550
<v 1>Okay.</v>

631
00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:50.120
<v 0>So,
uh,
again,
I,</v>

632
00:47:50.121 --> 00:47:55.121
I don't think that civilizations but civilization came to an end.

633
00:47:57.250 --> 00:47:58.083
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

634
00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:00.230
<v 0>What came to an end was a civilization,</v>

635
00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:03.410
a certain kind of society.

636
00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:07.840
It has some EHRs,
however,

637
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:11.050
like all dead entities,

638
00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.170
there are four heirs to the Roman empire.

639
00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:17.590
One is the Byzantine Empire,

640
00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:22.340
the eastern Roman Empire,

641
00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:26.270
which calls itself Vo Roman Empire doesn't call itself the eastern,

642
00:48:26.271 --> 00:48:27.650
doesn't call itself the Byzantine.

643
00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:30.800
It calls itself the Roman Empire even though it does.
So in Greek.

644
00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:37.730
Second air are the barbarian kings.
We'll be talking about them on Wednesday.

645
00:48:37.731 --> 00:48:42.731
They are attempting to a prop up the remanence of Roman culture,

646
00:48:44.301 --> 00:48:47.780
civilization and material society.

647
00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:53.480
The third air in some ways is Islam,

648
00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:58.550
which we meet in the seventh century,
the century of its invention.

649
00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:02.670
And the fourth area is the church.

650
00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:08.620
Even though the church grew up in opposition to the Roman Empire,

651
00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:12.640
it will preserve Latin cities,

652
00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:18.310
learning classical civilization.
Okay,

653
00:49:18.311 --> 00:49:20.260
so barbarians on Wednesday.
