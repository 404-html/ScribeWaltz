1
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.550
We're gonna talk about monasticism today,
uh,
and um,

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.730
monasticism in the popular imagination and accurately is linked to learning.

3
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.670
We all have this image of,
you know,
monks quietly copying manuscripts,

4
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.510
uh,
and those manuscripts being,
uh,

5
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.620
how the learning of the ancient world was transmitted.

6
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.890
We're going to talk a little more about that when we come to the near the end of

7
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:31.890
the course on intellectuals in the court of Charlemagne,

8
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.730
but monasticism and learning our linkedin our mind,

9
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:37.980
but they are not intrinsically linked.

10
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.810
There is no logical reason why monks should copy manuscripts.

11
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.850
They should pray.

12
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.210
They should live in some kind of a renunciation of the world.

13
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.680
Uh,
generally speaking in the medieval west,
they live in communities,

14
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.210
generally speaking.

15
00:00:57.211 --> 00:01:01.290
They're engaged in a kind of corporate rather than individual prayer.

16
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.440
All of these things follow from the way monasticism was conceived and the major

17
00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:11.460
text though not the only one,

18
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.530
but the most influential text about how monasticism was conceived is the sixth

19
00:01:16.531 --> 00:01:18.690
century rule of Saint Benedict.

20
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.130
The rule of saint benedict has some possible references to sacred reading as it

21
00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:27.924
calls it,

22
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.020
or to some kind of a program of knowledge.

23
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:36.750
It assumes that the monks are literate,
for example,

24
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.070
a lot to assume at the time.
But no,

25
00:01:40.071 --> 00:01:43.980
where does benedict say police preserve the classical tradition by,
uh,

26
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.300
being scribes and writing in the scriptorium?
So how does this come about?

27
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.130
Is One of the problems,
uh,
that we will deal with.

28
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.630
But what we're really interested is monasticism without the learning.

29
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.840
And the reason we're interested in that is not only is this the prevailing

30
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:06.690
spiritual movement of the early Middle Ages,

31
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.350
but it has a tremendous influence on society outside the monastic walls.

32
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.850
Because central to our discussion is a paradox.

33
00:02:17.851 --> 00:02:22.380
The paradox is that while the monks are trying to escape the world,

34
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.650
the world is following them.

35
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.910
The world is very interested in their prayers because their prayers are thought

36
00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:36.240
to have a powerful real world.

37
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.910
This world effect.

38
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.870
So as the monks become more distant from society,

39
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.730
God hears their prayers with more and more sympathy.
Therefore,

40
00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:51.510
their prayers have a kind of power,
uh,

41
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.760
power to benefit others.

42
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.140
This notion of power is like some kind of a,
you know,

43
00:02:58.141 --> 00:03:00.070
almost electrical utility.

44
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.000
They're building up an incredible amount of electricity,

45
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.980
if you want to call it that,
or let's say spiritual energy to be more accurate,

46
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.620
way more than they need,
way more than they can consume.

47
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.190
You know,
they're there like some little,
a

48
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.730
Persian Gulf state that is producing 10% of the world's oil.

49
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.500
There's no way they can use all of that.
Um,
in this case then,

50
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:32.230
how does the surplus get distributed?

51
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.810
It gets distributed through the generosity of people outside the world,

52
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:42.310
worried about the condition of their souls.
The notion that I,

53
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.490
possessor of spiritual reserves and spiritual power can pray for you.

54
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.210
Sinful night,
sinful king,

55
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.830
sinful merchant is called intercession

56
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.420
notion that I can intercede for you.
And we've already seen this,

57
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:05.254
haven't we?

58
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.290
We've seen this with the saints in Gregory of tour and in other texts we tried

59
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:14.470
to emphasize how important the saints are,

60
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.860
not just for our understanding of medieval religion,

61
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.630
but for an our understanding of medieval society member that I tried to

62
00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:27.130
emphasize that one of the problems once you're done with the Roman Empire is how

63
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:30.820
society is held together in the Roman Empire.
It's pretty clear.

64
00:04:30.821 --> 00:04:34.480
It's held together by institutions that are known though not the same of our as

65
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:38.350
our own are translatable to our own law,

66
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.810
administrative structure,

67
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.080
land holding the whole panoply of,

68
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.520
uh,
what passes for civilized life.
But in the early Middle Ages,

69
00:04:51.521 --> 00:04:54.060
after the collapse of the Roman Empire,
Oh,

70
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.180
we've seen the society does not have as much literacy,

71
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.700
does not have very good records of the kings are thugs.
Uh,

72
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.210
the political order is very unstable.
There's an awful lot of warfare.

73
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.400
There's a lot of this order.

74
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.150
You can't just dial nine one one and expect a response.

75
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.950
So the question then becomes what holds that society together?

76
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.030
And we mentioned some things including the church.

77
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.730
And here we're looking at a particular instance of how that works because the

78
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:32.731
monks far from being kind of out there in the forest or a desert or some remote

79
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:35.794
region,

80
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.440
or even if they are in the forest or desert and some remote region are extremely

81
00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:45.340
important to how society functions.

82
00:05:45.341 --> 00:05:49.750
Because this is a society in which the spiritual,
the military,

83
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.070
the political,

84
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.810
the economic are not easily conceptually separated.

85
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.510
This is the Middle Ages.
Okay?
Do you love the Middle Ages?

86
00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:03.170
Otherwise we wouldn't be here together,
but this is the part of the Middle Ages,

87
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.680
um,
that is perhaps most medieval.

88
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.380
What could be more meaningful than monasticism?
When I started teaching,

89
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.170
which wasn't that long after the Middle Ages,

90
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.320
but when I started teaching monasticism was a real problem because it was so

91
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:25.280
alien.
What are these?
What are these people doing?
In a way,

92
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.300
the situation is better because monasticism is sort of chic,

93
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.180
at least temporary.
We can monasticism.

94
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.910
People think of monasteries,
sort of like spa and you go there to get cleansed.

95
00:06:37.911 --> 00:06:38.241
In fact,

96
00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:43.241
a lot of monasteries have taken on a lot of new business with retreats and

97
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.720
detoxification and pilgrimage and these kinds of concepts.

98
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.800
But at the same time,

99
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.840
while I think we understand the desire to renounce the world,

100
00:06:56.841 --> 00:07:00.620
or to take time off from the world,
or to,
you know,

101
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:05.621
leave the personal digital devices at home and think about something for more

102
00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:10.450
than three seconds at a time,
um,

103
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.560
all of this is temporary.

104
00:07:12.561 --> 00:07:16.790
The whole point of detoxification is that you then go and you know,
uh,

105
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.750
retox sify yourself or normal,
you know,
go back to normal life.
Uh,

106
00:07:20.751 --> 00:07:25.550
what we have to understand here are people who have decided to,
uh,

107
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:31.150
embrace a world renouncing way of life for good.

108
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.730
Now,
monks,
therefore our clergy,

109
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.000
they are members of the professional members of the church,

110
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.690
but they're not priests.
It's key that you understand the difference.

111
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.520
Priests interact with the Laity.

112
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:54.110
Laymen Laity are people who are ordinary people,

113
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.360
believers,
but not clergy,

114
00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:58.400
<v 1>okay?</v>

115
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.400
<v 0>The priests interact with the laity through a mass,</v>

116
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:05.940
<v 1>okay?</v>

117
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.650
<v 0>The performance of the sacraments,</v>

118
00:08:07.651 --> 00:08:12.390
things like baptism little bit later than this period.
Confession,

119
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:15.963
<v 1>okay.</v>

120
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.760
<v 0>Um,
anointment of the sick.</v>

121
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:26.500
These are things in which the sacred is conveyed from the spiritual world to lay

122
00:08:28.791 --> 00:08:33.170
people via priests.
Priests are in that sense,

123
00:08:33.171 --> 00:08:38.171
the intermediaries between the divine and the material,

124
00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.140
but because priests are involved in the world,

125
00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:49.010
there are certain aspects of their differentiation from the world and there's a

126
00:08:49.261 --> 00:08:53.550
lot of debate in the church at various times over whether that includes
celibacy,

127
00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.900
not getting in the era that we're dealing with.

128
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:03.290
There are married priests or there are priests who are more or less married.

129
00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.540
Uh,
and then there are pre sewer Sullivan,

130
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:10.680
but monks are not supposed to interact with the world.

131
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:14.790
They are leading a life of contemplation and self denial.

132
00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:17.590
True.

133
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:22.590
They cannot focus only on their own salvation because that would've been

134
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.700
ignoring the Christian's duty to others.

135
00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:32.920
One of the problems about being a contemplative in the Christian tradition is as

136
00:09:32.921 --> 00:09:35.200
soon as you say something like,
boy,

137
00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:40.240
I am really contemplating great today.
Or,

138
00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:44.830
wow,
I am really seeing the mysteries of the universe.
Or,

139
00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:49.090
I can't believe I haven't had anything to eat or drink for three days and I'm

140
00:09:49.091 --> 00:09:53.870
feeling great.
Your you are falling off,
you're falling away,
you're selfish,

141
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.870
you're taking pride in your own accomplishments.

142
00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.370
So from the beginning is the notion that,
um,

143
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:05.500
the monks have to abandon everything,
including self satisfaction.

144
00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.460
In fact,
even most importantly,
self satisfaction.

145
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:15.030
And this is where Benedict's notion of humility comes from cause very strong in

146
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.380
the rule of Saint Benedict.

147
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:20.263
<v 1>Okay.</v>

148
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.490
<v 0>Where does this desire to rid oneself of the world come from?</v>

149
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.300
It's very strong in Christianity.

150
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.270
It's all over the new testament.

151
00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.790
That is actually part of the Christian message.
It's,

152
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:40.400
it's awkward because most people don't follow that,

153
00:10:40.401 --> 00:10:44.880
including most people who are believers.
They don't in fact give away everything,

154
00:10:44.881 --> 00:10:49.370
may have to the poor and follow Christ.
Um,
you know,

155
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:54.260
they don't renounce,
uh,
the,
uh,
pleasures of life,

156
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.670
of the flesh and so forth.

157
00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.570
But that is sort of what they are telling you to do.

158
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.920
The first monk,
the first guy who,

159
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.113
um,

160
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:10.510
we know of to decide to run away to the desert and lead a life of contemplation

161
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.150
is Saint Anthony of Egypt.
While Anthony,
you know how to spell that,

162
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:17.660
he lived from two 51 to three 56.

163
00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.620
I have trouble believing this.
The sources are pretty good.

164
00:11:21.621 --> 00:11:26.621
I a trouble believing that anybody could live to be 105 in the Roman empire or

165
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:35.330
indeed a at anytime before 10 years ago or so.

166
00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.850
Uh,
but there it is.
Um,
at least we know that in two,

167
00:11:38.851 --> 00:11:43.851
seven day he heard the saying of Jesus in a church,

168
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:49.100
go sell all you have,
give to the poor and follow me.

169
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.760
And he followed this literally he established as a solitary hermit in Egypt.

170
00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:04.010
An Egypt is a great place for monasticism because Egypt has a very narrow strip

171
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.990
of incredibly fertile land on either side of the Nile,

172
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:11.011
the Nile,

173
00:12:11.011 --> 00:12:16.011
which until the building of the Aswan dam flooded every year and it's silt that

174
00:12:17.431 --> 00:12:22.431
it brought down from it's sources was so rich that it created this marvelous

175
00:12:24.421 --> 00:12:27.570
soil on which all sorts of things could grow.

176
00:12:27.571 --> 00:12:32.220
But once you got beyond that limit,
you were in the desert.

177
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:37.080
So you have absolute and total release,
you know,
kind of Sahara,
like desert,

178
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.050
very close to fertile land,

179
00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:45.060
the best land of the Mediterranean so that you could have a kind of interaction

180
00:12:45.061 --> 00:12:45.780
between,

181
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:49.920
I mean it's not like you decide that you want to be a hermit and you live in

182
00:12:49.921 --> 00:12:53.240
Manhattan and you drive in,
you drive and you drive and you know,

183
00:12:53.241 --> 00:12:56.180
you're just looking at them on an island and you're in the suburbs and then

184
00:12:56.181 --> 00:12:59.730
you're in the excerpts and then you're in sort of gas stations and strip malls

185
00:12:59.731 --> 00:13:02.790
and then you're in the Hamptons.
You know,
it's very,
very hard.

186
00:13:02.791 --> 00:13:07.740
I mean you can actually,
if you go north,
pretty soon you'll get,

187
00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:12.330
if not hermit country,
at least,
um,
a decent,
uh,
uh,

188
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:16.560
isolation.
Of course,
the problem with New York is it's really cold.

189
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:21.210
It's great to be a hermit in a,
you know,

190
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.720
September.
But,
uh,

191
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:29.070
the Adirondack hermitage is present problems in the winter.

192
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:33.950
Uh,
Egypt is hot.
All right,
but certainly no,
um,
uh,

193
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:36.240
exposure to cold problem anyway,

194
00:13:36.241 --> 00:13:40.140
the first monks are in Egypt and they're known as the desert fathers.

195
00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:45.330
Often they live alone as hermits,
but sometimes they live in communities.

196
00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.820
They have their own cells in these communities,

197
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.200
but they can come together for prayer or for some sort of spiritual

198
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.310
companionship.

199
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.840
What's interesting is that right from the start,

200
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:03.870
these hermits or first monks appealed to the people who had no plans to become

201
00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:06.123
monks.

202
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:11.410
They appealed to the people of the cities of Alexandria or thieves,

203
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:13.360
et Cetera of Egypt.

204
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.000
The reason is,

205
00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:26.070
and the reason why people would become monks is the establishment of the church

206
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.080
as the official Church of the Roman Empire.

207
00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:33.980
There are no monks in the first years of Christianity because just being a

208
00:14:34.081 --> 00:14:39.081
Christian means denying the world the threat of death at the hands of the Roman

209
00:14:40.051 --> 00:14:42.240
authorities.
Uh,

210
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:47.270
and the illegality of the religion means that you are already in a world

211
00:14:49.141 --> 00:14:53.450
renouncing position.
But once the church becomes established,

212
00:14:53.451 --> 00:14:57.650
once all sorts of people start joining it for motives that have nothing to do

213
00:14:57.651 --> 00:15:02.651
with spiritual reasons or maybe 10% spiritual 90%,

214
00:15:03.101 --> 00:15:06.080
and it's time my career,
uh,
you know,

215
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:11.110
I want my kids to grow up in the sorta right faith then those of real spiritual

216
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:19.690
bent devotion desire half to present themselves as more than merely attending

217
00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:28.720
church as serious about Christianity in some sense.

218
00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:33.760
So monasticism has to be understood in its earliest years as a reaction against

219
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:40.390
the compromises and comfort of official Christianity.

220
00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:42.493
And

221
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:49.480
we see this in Augustine's confessions where you will recall the emotional

222
00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:54.860
crisis that finally tipped Augustine over the edge into his conversion

223
00:15:54.861 --> 00:15:55.670
experience,

224
00:15:55.670 --> 00:16:00.670
was hearing about the monks of Egypt from someone who had come to Milan and had

225
00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:07.421
been in Egypt and described these men and actually women who were not well

226
00:16:10.611 --> 00:16:11.444
educated.

227
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:17.650
We're certainly not trained in rhetoric law and the classics to the extent of

228
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:23.510
Augustine.
Yet nevertheless,

229
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.590
they had,
in Augustine's words,
stormed the gates of heaven.

230
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.540
They had by their spiritual renunciation,

231
00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:38.020
hence their spiritual power become close to God in ways that he Augustine and

232
00:16:40.011 --> 00:16:42.830
his friends with all their knowledge had not.

233
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:48.610
And this contrast is what decides Augustine to embrace a way of life.

234
00:16:49.521 --> 00:16:54.521
That although not monastic and much more active in the world is a renunciation

235
00:16:54.831 --> 00:16:56.390
of the standard career,

236
00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:01.870
the standard definitions of success in the Roman Empire and involvement in the

237
00:17:02.211 --> 00:17:07.040
world in things like marriage,
property owning,
et cetera.

238
00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:13.640
So in fact,
if the monks are these not very well educated people,

239
00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:20.050
if embracing their values means giving up Cicero and the,

240
00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.700
uh,
classical tradition,

241
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:26.810
it looks as if monasticism isn't anti intellectual movement.

242
00:17:26.811 --> 00:17:31.490
And come back to this paradox of the monks as custodians of learning.

243
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:35.930
It's not quite the Fox as the protector of the hands,

244
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:39.650
but it is,
um,
uh,

245
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:44.720
it is not automatic that the monks would find themselves in the position of

246
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:46.730
copying down Cicero.

247
00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:56.220
So the first forms of monasticism are those of the Egyptian desert.

248
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:03.260
There's a kind of tension from the start between a septic individualism and

249
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:07.440
collective monasticism.

250
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:12.770
Ascetic individualism means one person engaging in practices that dramatize the

251
00:18:14.071 --> 00:18:19.020
renunciation of the world.
A classic example is not from Egypt,

252
00:18:19.021 --> 00:18:20.040
but from Syria.

253
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.760
These are the saints who sit on top of pillars for decades at a time.

254
00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:32.430
Individual,
right?
Beth are there.
They're alone on this pillar.
You know,

255
00:18:32.431 --> 00:18:37.140
maybe it's this wide or maybe this wide at the top.
Um,

256
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.780
30 feet,
high,
50 feet high.

257
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:42.670
These saints collectively are known as stylized.

258
00:18:42.671 --> 00:18:47.220
He's a stylized is a pillar and the most famous of them,

259
00:18:47.221 --> 00:18:50.520
Saint Simon of the desert or Saint Simon ladies

260
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:57.120
lived on top of this pillar four,
what is it,

261
00:18:57.121 --> 00:18:59.160
35 years,
something like that.

262
00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:04.410
35 years up there in the rain,
in the sun.

263
00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:09.150
Imagine the sanitary or range.
Imagine this.

264
00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:12.570
I mean,
this is world renunciation,

265
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:19.040
but he was not alone.
He was alone on top of the pillar.

266
00:19:19.041 --> 00:19:22.280
He was a hermit,
but people came and visited him.

267
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.970
There are pictures of ladders going up to him,

268
00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:29.450
people climbing these ladders,
sometimes delivering the little message.

269
00:19:29.451 --> 00:19:32.660
Would you pray for my child who was dying of,
uh,
well,

270
00:19:32.661 --> 00:19:37.060
I don't know what he's dying off,
you know,
or,
uh,
um,
uh,

271
00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.790
asking for things,
uh,
in the world.

272
00:19:40.791 --> 00:19:43.430
Please deliver me from a bankruptcy.

273
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:47.450
Please deliver me from illness.
Um,

274
00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.700
please protect me on this voyage.

275
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:52.880
Why don't they ask God themselves?

276
00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:55.470
<v 1>Okay.</v>

277
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:58.110
<v 0>Save a trip to the desert out of Antioch.</v>

278
00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:02.850
Save perhaps a donation to the Saint Simon.
Stay Ladies Foundation

279
00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:09.780
because God is going to listen to Simon Ryan.
Why

280
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.360
<v 1>he's worthy to speak to them</v>

281
00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:16.960
<v 0>and why is he worthy?</v>

282
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.710
What does he done to make himself worthy or you're quite right.

283
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:25.050
He's renounced the world and he knows what

284
00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:31.570
he's not unbelievably cultivated.
Probably Syriac in this case,

285
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:35.800
probably those notes are in Syriac,
but um,

286
00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:37.470
<v 1>okay.</v>

287
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:40.740
<v 0>His world renunciation has imbued him with power.</v>

288
00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:44.730
This is not unique to Christianity,
right?
Shamanism.

289
00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.770
The idea of a,
uh,

290
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:52.860
person who is an outcast in society or who has renounced the normal comforts of

291
00:20:54.101 --> 00:20:58.930
society,
what's the problem with just getting married,
having kids,

292
00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:02.470
having a job,
wondering what's for dinner

293
00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.580
from the Christian point of view,

294
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.440
that's what most practitioners are doing.

295
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.660
Focusing on the world.
You have to focus on the world.

296
00:21:16.661 --> 00:21:18.340
Supposing you wake up one morning and say,

297
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:21.250
I'm going to be a much more spiritual person and then you know,

298
00:21:21.251 --> 00:21:26.251
there's whaling from your kids and your spouse a is nagging you about fixing the

299
00:21:27.851 --> 00:21:31.900
dripping faucet.
I mean,
this is stuff you've got to look forward to.

300
00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:36.310
Most of you,
I don't expect you to go into monasteries.
Uh,

301
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:37.660
but um,

302
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:41.650
this is a distraction from what the New Testament tells you to do.

303
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:46.330
The New Testament doesn't say go ahead,
be happy,
amass property,

304
00:21:46.331 --> 00:21:50.020
get a great job,
make a lot of contacts,
get ahead,

305
00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:54.580
have bunches of children,
uh,
get them into good schools,
you know,

306
00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:59.440
get them coaches for the sats and,
and so forth.
And so what,
um,

307
00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:03.970
if you have done that because you know,
you just got trapped,
you just,
well,

308
00:22:03.971 --> 00:22:08.971
one thing led to another and here you are if so far is you have spiritual

309
00:22:09.071 --> 00:22:11.800
anxieties and desires,
then you're going to want to have a patron.

310
00:22:11.801 --> 00:22:15.700
You're gonna want to have someone who can intervene with you just like way back

311
00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:19.210
when you had somebody write a letter of recommendation because they were on the

312
00:22:19.211 --> 00:22:24.000
board of some,
a company or they uh,
um,
you know,

313
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:25.710
they had some influence here.

314
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:30.250
Your patron is a spiritual patron and it is monks or hermits.

315
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:36.750
So the role of the holy man in society is of somebody who has a heroic ability

316
00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.960
denied to most ordinary people.

317
00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:49.020
This is a spiritual superhero who like comic books.

318
00:22:49.571 --> 00:22:53.140
Superheroes isn't just a superhero for his own benefit.

319
00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:57.430
It doesn't just fly around cause he likes the sensation of flying around.

320
00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:01.780
But who helps those who are weaker than him

321
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.300
and the intervention of somebody on here,
very important.
St like Simon stylized,

322
00:23:08.301 --> 00:23:12.580
he's transcended the merely curative.

323
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:18.340
Simon was without fear of the emperor,

324
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:19.061
for example.

325
00:23:19.061 --> 00:23:22.270
What could the emperor due to him that was worse than living at the top of the

326
00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:26.830
pillar are after all,
um,
the emperor Constantz yes,

327
00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:31.120
one of the sons of Constantine in the early fourth century was going to punish

328
00:23:31.121 --> 00:23:34.220
the city of Antioch for defying.
Um,

329
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:38.770
the tax collectors tax had been collected in Antioch.
There had been a riot.

330
00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:42.380
Lots of people were killed.
Normally you'd expect,
uh,

331
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:47.640
the wrath of the emperor to come down on this city and punish it very severely.

332
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:55.270
Simon was able to intervene with Konstanz just to prevent this from happening.

333
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.850
Constantio is listened to him because he was a little scared of him.

334
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:06.990
People are a little scared of those who are not only not playing the game,

335
00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.190
but who are,
um,

336
00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:15.850
playing a different game according to unique and very difficult to imitate
rules.

337
00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.090
So there's a paradox here.
Again,

338
00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:23.890
as the withdrawal from society becomes more dramatic,

339
00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.160
the imputed spiritual power becomes greater.

340
00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:32.940
If Simon's renunciation we're limited to something kind of like,

341
00:24:33.491 --> 00:24:34.324
um,

342
00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:38.290
<v 1>small,</v>

343
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:42.920
<v 0>uh,
I,
I'm,
I'm,
you know,
suppose he became a Vegan,</v>

344
00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:46.910
uh,
would people believe in his power?

345
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:51.290
And then this brings up the question of then,

346
00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.840
what is the power of the rule of Saint Benedict?

347
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.450
If you read the rule of Saint Benedict,

348
00:24:56.451 --> 00:24:59.990
there's nothing in there about living outdoors all the time.

349
00:24:59.991 --> 00:25:01.070
At the top of a pillar,

350
00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:06.340
there's nothing about extreme asceticism yet benedictine monasticism would prove

351
00:25:07.401 --> 00:25:09.140
more durable than pillar sitting.

352
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:12.710
It would prove more durable than the deserts saints,
even

353
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:21.060
monasticism was brought to the West in several forms.

354
00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.580
But generally speaking,
although there are lots of hermits,

355
00:25:29.581 --> 00:25:32.880
we hear more about the communities of monks.

356
00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:37.830
Monks who live in an establishment

357
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:44.060
and beginning in the sixth,
late sixth and particularly in the seventh century,

358
00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:49.240
a lot of monasteries were established in rural parts of Europe,

359
00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.150
rural or small town parts of Europe,

360
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:58.190
places like Saint Alban's in England,

361
00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:03.050
which is not far from London or beads,

362
00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:07.700
monastery of Gero in North Umbria,

363
00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.920
more remote or folder

364
00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:16.130
in the,
in Germany,
uh,
right canal,

365
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:23.710
a monastery in south western Germany on a little island in like con stones.

366
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:33.610
These monasteries owned property and indeed many of them became very rich

367
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:39.400
because one way of affiliating yourself with the monastery was to give to them

368
00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:44.910
to donate land,
money,
serfs,

369
00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:47.580
coins,
booty,
whatever.

370
00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:55.780
And the reason people donate it is because of the violence of their lives.

371
00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:01.180
The people who had the stuff to donate usually had gotten it by violence because

372
00:27:01.181 --> 00:27:05.380
it's a society that as you've seen in the pages of Gregory of tour particularly,

373
00:27:05.381 --> 00:27:09.580
but not exclusively.
It is a society organized around warfare.

374
00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:15.600
All of these guys in Gregory of tour have blood on their hands.

375
00:27:16.001 --> 00:27:21.001
You cannot be successful without a certain amount of the infliction of pain on

376
00:27:22.811 --> 00:27:23.644
other people.

377
00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:29.580
And although the rich and wealthy in any society do not believe themselves to

378
00:27:29.771 --> 00:27:31.190
be,
um,

379
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:36.100
rich and wealthy for a vicious reasons,

380
00:27:36.101 --> 00:27:38.500
indeed the rich and wealthy generally speaking,

381
00:27:38.501 --> 00:27:43.120
think they're great in this society.
The rich and wealthy think they're great.

382
00:27:43.121 --> 00:27:46.810
All right,
but they're also very anxious.
Uh,

383
00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.460
it's not just a question of,
you know,

384
00:27:48.461 --> 00:27:52.200
what is the phrase that's often used by donors to universities?
Um,

385
00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:56.200
give back to Yale,
for example,
or give back to society.

386
00:27:56.470 --> 00:28:00.100
It's not just a question of giving back to society.
Yes,
I made $40 billion.

387
00:28:00.101 --> 00:28:04.090
So I feel I need to give back something.
It's a question of,

388
00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:07.510
um,
I'm going to hell at what can I do?

389
00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:11.320
I know I'm going to hell because,
um,
you know,

390
00:28:11.321 --> 00:28:13.660
I killed 80 people in the course of just,
you know,

391
00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:18.550
business deals or the closing of this deal required the 10 people be killed,

392
00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:22.030
um,
or you know,

393
00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:24.760
500 or 2000.

394
00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:32.150
So there is a symbiosis to be cynical about it.
And as you know,

395
00:28:32.151 --> 00:28:33.830
I'm not really very cynical person.

396
00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.560
I hope that has come through hope it's come through that and I'm really

397
00:28:36.561 --> 00:28:40.490
idealistic,
even naive.
Um,

398
00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:42.650
but if you'll forgive a moment of cynicism,

399
00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:47.980
there is a symbiosis between the monks who are amassing this huge quantity of

400
00:28:49.971 --> 00:28:54.470
spiritual energy and the leaders of society who are amassing this huge quantity

401
00:28:54.471 --> 00:28:59.120
of sins.
It's a natural trade agreement.

402
00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:04.380
So there are paradoxical consequences of monastic wealth.

403
00:29:04.381 --> 00:29:07.820
As these places get richer and richer,
uh,

404
00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:11.590
they become too important to the kings,

405
00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:12.970
the leaders of society,

406
00:29:12.971 --> 00:29:17.800
just to be left to a bunch of weird world renouncing hermits.

407
00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:20.420
They start to be,
um,

408
00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:25.890
administered by people who themselves are from high families of high lineage in

409
00:29:30.041 --> 00:29:33.690
order to become a monk add folder or rationale.

410
00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:38.290
And you can't just wander in and say,
I'm renouncing the world.
You've got to be,

411
00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:43.180
uh,
from a good family.
Got to come with an endowment.

412
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.740
Generally speaking,
to get into Ryka now as a month,

413
00:29:47.741 --> 00:29:52.741
the family's going to have to pay a huge amount of property money,

414
00:29:55.090 --> 00:30:00.090
some form of wealth that endows that mom.

415
00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:01.223
<v 1>Okay.</v>

416
00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:07.580
<v 0>So at some point maybe people will stop believing that Reichi now is such a</v>

417
00:30:07.581 --> 00:30:11.930
great place.
Maybe they'll stop believing in its spiritual energy.

418
00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:18.200
This would happen later,
but uh,
not yet.

419
00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:19.851
Not yet.
They,

420
00:30:19.851 --> 00:30:24.851
the preservation of the monasteries and their growth and success is due to the

421
00:30:25.401 --> 00:30:26.450
rule of Saint Benedict,

422
00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:32.150
the most important development of western monasticism and that there are all

423
00:30:32.151 --> 00:30:35.120
kinds of other monasticism in the Christian world.

424
00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:40.210
But the monasticism that would characterize western Europe is the rule of Saint

425
00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.230
Benedict,
late sixth century,

426
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:47.710
who devised a set of regulations for communal monasticism.

427
00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:57.100
So the rule of think benedict is a manual for the monastic life.

428
00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:02.150
How to set up and run a monastery.
It's not the first,

429
00:31:02.151 --> 00:31:05.810
it's based on an older a rule.
Uh,

430
00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:10.910
we don't have to go into sort of who is responsible for inventing benedictine

431
00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:15.890
monasticism as it's called,
but the monasteries of the West would be,

432
00:31:15.891 --> 00:31:19.670
for the most part,
Benedictine until the 12th century.

433
00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.370
When you start to have other orders that is,

434
00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:26.810
there would be thousands of monasteries throughout Europe and they would follow

435
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:30.290
more or less the rule that you have read.

436
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:36.140
Why is this rule so successful?

437
00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:40.610
For one thing,
it is moderate.

438
00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:46.060
It is reproducible on a large scale.
It is ascetic.

439
00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:49.850
All right?
It does involve giving up a lot of things,

440
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.220
but not to an extreme,

441
00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:57.250
not to be compared to the life of a desert hermit or a desert pillar sitter or

442
00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:04.310
the harsh monasticism of the Irish tradition.

443
00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:08.270
You don't have to go to some little island that's,
you know,

444
00:32:08.271 --> 00:32:13.271
one square kilometer large and out in the middle of the Windy Irish Sea,

445
00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:16.970
uh,
and build some little beehive hot and live their

446
00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:23.090
aesthetic.
Monasticism of the extreme sword is all over the place because hostile

447
00:32:23.091 --> 00:32:24.860
environments are all over the place.
Now.

448
00:32:24.861 --> 00:32:28.810
It's not as if benedictine monasteries are all located in cure,

449
00:32:28.811 --> 00:32:32.990
full Hillary fertile countryside,
but a lot of them are,

450
00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:37.430
a lot of them are located in,
uh,
um,
productive land,

451
00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:41.060
but more than that,
they require,

452
00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:42.730
<v 1>yeah,</v>

453
00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:44.870
<v 0>a certain kind of a set of CISM.</v>

454
00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:50.040
The asceticism of a Benedictine monotonous monastery is renunciation of self in

455
00:32:51.101 --> 00:32:55.930
favor of the community.
In that sense,
it's almost a,

456
00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:57.213
um,

457
00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:02.400
an opposite of the kind of monasticism that hermits or pillar saints practice.

458
00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:06.130
<v 1>Okay.</v>

459
00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:11.130
<v 0>What is acidic about a Benedictine monastery is not only the celibacy part or</v>

460
00:33:12.401 --> 00:33:16.810
the prayer part or the isolation from worldly stimulus part,

461
00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:20.350
but the fact that you're not alone most of the time.

462
00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:23.020
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

463
00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:27.340
<v 0>You have to subordinate your will to communal rituals and life.</v>

464
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:31.510
You have to subordinate your will to the Abbot.

465
00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:36.010
Remember how much benedict emphasizes obedience.

466
00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:41.680
This is not just a good management tool for making it clear who's in charge.

467
00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:46.920
It is a form of self abnegation,

468
00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:50.200
a form of renunciation.

469
00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:53.140
Benedict also

470
00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:58.220
enjoins manual labor.

471
00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.000
This is a penitential tool,

472
00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:07.040
but it's also something that has perhaps something to do with the economic

473
00:34:07.041 --> 00:34:08.210
success of these founders.

474
00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:13.250
These are monks who are engaged in primarily two activities.

475
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:14.990
Labor and prayer.

476
00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:21.790
Prayer we'll talk about in a moment and it's quite understandable,

477
00:34:21.791 --> 00:34:26.791
but labor is more interesting and innovative because the ancient world despised

478
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:29.583
labor.

479
00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:34.830
The whole idea of how you should live in preconversion Augustine's opinion,

480
00:34:35.831 --> 00:34:40.090
which reflects that of late Roman society is what was called,

481
00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:42.910
um,
leisure with dignity.

482
00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:48.180
Leisure with dignity is what most professors aspire to.

483
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:52.660
That is to say,
um,
leisure,

484
00:34:52.661 --> 00:34:55.990
but not just to take naps and you know,
uh,

485
00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.990
play with your dog or uh,
you know,

486
00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:03.280
surf various dubious sites on the Internet,
uh,

487
00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:06.460
leisure it to read,
to think,

488
00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:11.410
to engage in a kind of genteel contemplation.

489
00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:16.570
And this is the ideal of those Roman senators who are,
you know,

490
00:35:16.571 --> 00:35:18.460
writing philosophical dialogues.

491
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:20.940
<v 1>Okay.</v>

492
00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:25.320
<v 0>But work actual work is degrading,</v>

493
00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:31.340
horrible in the ancient world not to be engaged in by anybody who could call

494
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:37.890
himself a gentleman.
So by making people work,

495
00:35:37.891 --> 00:35:39.870
including people who come from the upper classes.

496
00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:44.871
This is a penitential Labor indeep can we labor with your hands though?

497
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:50.300
Other kinds of labor were envisaged a in section 48 benedict talks about labor

498
00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:58.760
and sacred reading and this is one of those places where you can draw out from

499
00:35:59.971 --> 00:36:04.971
its meaning that copying manuscripts as a form of labor reading texts is a form

500
00:36:05.371 --> 00:36:06.204
of labor.

501
00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:08.483
<v 1>Okay,</v>

502
00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:13.570
<v 0>so the transformation or at least the addition of learning as part of the</v>

503
00:36:14.901 --> 00:36:18.110
mission statement of monasteries is implicit here,

504
00:36:18.111 --> 00:36:20.300
but certainly not drawn out by Benetech

505
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:24.383
<v 1>prayer.</v>

506
00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.940
<v 0>One of the things that is involved in this surrendering of your will to the</v>

507
00:36:30.941 --> 00:36:34.810
greater communal good is the performance of prayers.

508
00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.660
Benedict emphasizes humility.

509
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:43.610
<v 1>Okay.</v>

510
00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:46.280
<v 0>The monk's life as a ladder of humility,</v>

511
00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:50.580
humility is encouraged by obedience.

512
00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:52.150
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

513
00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:55.570
<v 0>Silence.
In Benedictine monasteries,</v>

514
00:36:55.571 --> 00:36:57.280
you weren't silent all the time,

515
00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:01.390
but there is a discouragement against mirror chatter,

516
00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:07.480
labor.
All of these are penitential activities in which the individual will is

517
00:37:07.481 --> 00:37:08.314
suppressed.

518
00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:13.300
And if you think of experiences in which the individual will is suppressed so

519
00:37:13.301 --> 00:37:17.800
that the person focuses on the community.
We are all familiar.
In fact,

520
00:37:17.801 --> 00:37:22.660
you are more familiar than I am probably more immediately with such activities.

521
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:24.063
Um,

522
00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:29.320
any kind of training or boot camp like thing or uh,
you know,

523
00:37:29.321 --> 00:37:33.100
I'm a senior society or um,

524
00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:38.610
an acapella group makes you do stuff with the group that may be unpleasant,

525
00:37:40.241 --> 00:37:44.500
difficult self sacrificing,
but that reinforces the Esprit de Corps.

526
00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.720
This is the heart of the military.

527
00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:52.710
Military beats you up in order to make you focus on the group and many other

528
00:37:53.891 --> 00:37:56.560
organizations,
including businesses,
you know,
the,

529
00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:00.580
this idea of going out into the mountains and uh,
um,
you know,

530
00:38:00.581 --> 00:38:04.350
turning you loose with a tent and some rope,
uh,

531
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:08.740
and seeing which groups are able to survive or you know,
whatever they do.
Um,

532
00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:13.060
this is part of this kind of training.
It's not just to train you into,

533
00:38:13.061 --> 00:38:14.380
depending on other people.

534
00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:19.560
It's to train you into focusing on the success of the organization or group as

535
00:38:20.561 --> 00:38:22.420
opposed to your own aggrandizement.

536
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:26.090
But a difference again is you come back from the little,
uh,

537
00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:30.820
upward bound experience where you come back from the retreat or you come back

538
00:38:30.821 --> 00:38:34.210
from the scavenger hunt.
In this case,
this is your life.

539
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:40.000
But in addition to obedience,
labor,
silence,

540
00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:44.020
prayer is the most important renunciatory activity.

541
00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:47.440
Cause these are not just prayers.
Like,
okay,

542
00:38:47.441 --> 00:38:50.950
I'm going to go in for five minutes and recite some prayers.

543
00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:55.660
These are prayers that go on all day with some breaks.

544
00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:01.990
One of the psalms seems to suggest that you should make,
um,
prayers,

545
00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:04.090
uh,
uh,
seven times a day.

546
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:05.750
<v 1>Okay?</v>

547
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:08.510
<v 0>So they begin a little bit after midnight,</v>

548
00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:14.970
let me go to sleep for a little while and then they get up a little before dawn.

549
00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.720
They pray and then they go back to sleep for a little while and then they have,

550
00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:19.930
uh,
uh,

551
00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:24.930
a kind of early morning session and so forth and so on,

552
00:39:24.931 --> 00:39:26.280
seven times a day.

553
00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:32.430
And these are prayers that go through the psalms.
Primarily

554
00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.320
different monasteries have different liturgies.

555
00:39:37.321 --> 00:39:40.800
A liturgy is a kind of ritual cycle.

556
00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:46.550
Some monasteries have more prayer and less contemplation or less prayer and more

557
00:39:47.761 --> 00:39:48.594
work,

558
00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:54.060
but they all are engaged in the performance of group prayers,

559
00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:57.360
not individual,
but the community.

560
00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:02.900
And these go on and on and on and they take on a kind of rhythm or a monotony or

561
00:40:04.891 --> 00:40:09.891
a kind of visionary power that such experiences can convey.

562
00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:16.110
And it is these prayers better what are really storing up those spiritual

563
00:40:16.111 --> 00:40:20.810
reserves I was talking about as characteristic of monastery there,

564
00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:25.880
this tremendous power that all of these repeated prayers have that cannot be

565
00:40:26.131 --> 00:40:29.490
duplicated outside the walls of the monastery.

566
00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:35.600
So this heavy round of prayer involves a significant sacrifice of comfort and of

567
00:40:36.661 --> 00:40:37.494
the self.

568
00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:42.660
This is a kind of sleep deprivation amongst never really quite make up.

569
00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:48.050
The sleep deficiencies is they sort of stagger into a Mastin's as one the first

570
00:40:48.421 --> 00:40:51.750
hours or called or lauds the pre sunrise hour.

571
00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:57.270
But this is very impressive to the outside world,
the outside world.

572
00:40:57.271 --> 00:40:59.850
The donors love this.

573
00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:04.500
They love the buildup of these prayers and they will like the prayers to take

574
00:41:04.501 --> 00:41:08.760
place in a nice space rather than having the monastery church being some kind
of,

575
00:41:08.761 --> 00:41:11.050
you know,
Dank,
uh,

576
00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:14.370
or a fire trap wooden structure.

577
00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:19.200
They'll build beautiful churches for them and beautiful dormitories for them as

578
00:41:19.201 --> 00:41:21.690
well and beautiful refractories for them.

579
00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:25.460
If you're a donor,

580
00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:30.440
you would rather that the stuff that you're donating for take place in Nice

581
00:41:30.441 --> 00:41:34.070
surroundings.
Donors like it.

582
00:41:34.071 --> 00:41:38.470
If the lawns at Yale are well clipped.
Ryan and,

583
00:41:38.471 --> 00:41:41.420
and I think I've said this before,

584
00:41:41.421 --> 00:41:45.380
the closest thing to a monastery is a college

585
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:51.950
with some obvious differences,
but communal living.

586
00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:57.560
The quadrangle is like the cloister,
uh,
focused in on itself.

587
00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:58.910
Um,

588
00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:03.910
the emphasis on the group identification with the institution,

589
00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:08.300
uh,
the notion that your activities will benefit society,

590
00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:13.940
not so much your prayers,
but all that great research were allegedly doing.

591
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:20.390
Um,
are you okay?
The parallel does not,
uh,
carry,

592
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:22.190
uh,
perfectly,

593
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:28.160
but it is no accident that this university looks a little bit like a monastery

594
00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:33.470
is to evoke a tradition of contemplation.

595
00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:37.910
Isolation.
People speak about the Yale bubble,

596
00:42:37.911 --> 00:42:42.500
but it's supposed to be a bit of a bubble.
It was constructed that way.

597
00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:47.660
That is the ideal.
Now,
you may not have chosen to go to the places that really,

598
00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:53.340
uh,
reproduce the,
um,
the monastic ideal.
Oh,

599
00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:56.390
I went to the University of California at Santa Cruz.
Uh,
you know,

600
00:42:56.391 --> 00:43:01.370
it was like up on a hill in a redwood forest that was sort of like a monastery

601
00:43:01.371 --> 00:43:03.030
or Irlam college and you know,

602
00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:07.670
in Indiana or Marlboro College in Vermont.
Right?

603
00:43:07.671 --> 00:43:09.380
I know you rejected these places.

604
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:12.380
I know you just laughed at them just thinking about going to them,

605
00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:15.330
but their heart,
people who have decided to go,
no

606
00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:20.510
devastated that you didn't get into or alum.
Yeah.
Well,
okay,

607
00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:24.560
but this is an American ideal that is similar

608
00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.650
to the monastic ideal.

609
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:32.360
It is a sort of renunciatory ideal and is an ideal of learning.

610
00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.870
So how do we get to learning in the last few minutes?

611
00:43:35.871 --> 00:43:40.430
I just want to trace these connections.
The Benedictine rule,

612
00:43:40.431 --> 00:43:43.340
as you will have noticed,
does not encourage learning.

613
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:48.410
And Benedict himself did not regard this as a primary duty of monks.

614
00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:51.020
He did expect the monks to read the Bible.

615
00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:56.560
He expected them to listen to readings from the church fathers and very key.

616
00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:03.700
He says that the monks should take out a book from what he calls the Biblioteca.

617
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:08.540
Biblioteca is the Latin word for library.

618
00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:22.010
It's not clear when monasteries had libraries,

619
00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:29.970
but really the idea of collecting books and copying them comes from a late Roman

620
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:37.280
culture from a desire to understand the Bible.

621
00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:42.193
<v 1>Okay.</v>

622
00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:46.650
<v 0>And from a transformation of that world of cultivated leisure wear,</v>

623
00:44:46.651 --> 00:44:51.651
the intellectuals like Augustine and his mentors were the custodians of learning

624
00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:57.270
to a world in which the clergy,
and particularly the monastic clergy,

625
00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:02.480
were the custodians of learning because the monks had two key,

626
00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:07.830
three key elements.
They had learning that as they were literate,

627
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:11.160
they had time.
Even though the prayers consumed a lot,

628
00:45:11.161 --> 00:45:13.260
they're not in the world and they had wealth.

629
00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:19.220
It's not inevitable that time learning and wealth should lead to a cultural

630
00:45:19.861 --> 00:45:24.660
efflorescence,
but they are certainly favorable conditions.

631
00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:27.133
<v 1>Okay,</v>

632
00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:31.280
<v 0>so I leave you with that implication of the rule.</v>

633
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:34.040
We will develop it further in a few weeks.

634
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:38.720
What we're going to be talking about beginning on Monday of next week is Islam.

635
00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:44.350
So we are moving into a different post Rome

636
00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:48.080
reality.
Thanks.
