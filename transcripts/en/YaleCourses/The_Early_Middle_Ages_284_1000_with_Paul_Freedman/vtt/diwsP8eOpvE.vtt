WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.170
Today,
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.250
we move back to northern Europe to the northern part of the former Roman empire.

3
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.910
And,
uh,
since you've done the reading,

4
00:00:13.911 --> 00:00:18.380
I won't be giving anything away by saying that the culmination of what we're

5
00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:21.140
talking about is Charlemagne and Charlemagne,

6
00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:26.141
his coronation in Rome at the hands of the pope in the year 800,

7
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.690
uh,
as emperor.

8
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.690
We'll talk about what that title means.

9
00:00:32.691 --> 00:00:37.691
A title that had not been seen in 325 years in the West,

10
00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:41.810
at least not in an the agreed upon

11
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.040
by everyone in western Europe.

12
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.360
Charlemagne at this time didn't control quite everything in western Europe.

13
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.490
You have a map in the Wickham book of his empire,
uh,

14
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.440
bequeath to his successors,
uh,

15
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.250
in the year eight 43 the year that it is partitioned.
This,

16
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.200
uh,
is,
uh,
does not include the British isles.
Uh,

17
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.640
it does not include most of Spain,
which was in Islamic hands.

18
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.940
Uh,
but it is a,
um,

19
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.460
pretty convincing effort at the restoration of the Roman empire,

20
00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:21.920
even though it's base.
In other words,

21
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.330
where Charlemagne and his ancestors lands were,

22
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.750
where their wealth came from,
where they lived,

23
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.680
where their followers came from,
was uh,

24
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.130
at what had been the borders of the Roman Empire.
Uh,

25
00:01:37.131 --> 00:01:40.820
what's now northeastern France,
Belgium,

26
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.190
the Netherlands,
west north western Germany,

27
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.640
a territory known at this time as our Straw Zia Charlemagne,

28
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.570
his ancestors were great men.

29
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.160
Major nobles of the region of our straws.
Yeah.
Again,
eastern France,

30
00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:06.290
western Germany,
the low country.

31
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.340
They were nominal servants of the mirror.

32
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.700
Vingean rulers

33
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.270
and rose to prominence with eight title of my or and Wickham preserves just the

34
00:02:23.341 --> 00:02:27.660
Latin [inaudible] major,
larger,
great man.

35
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.450
The mire of the palace,

36
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.960
the mayor of the palace is how this is usually translated.

37
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.850
And of course our word mayor,
it applies to a municipal official.

38
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.480
So mayor of the palace is a rather funny title,

39
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.690
but it's really a kind of prime minister or leader of the soldiers,

40
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.440
prime minister and defense secretary or a minister.

41
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.010
And this title tended to be hereditary.

42
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.890
One of the problems of rulers in the mirror.

43
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:09.070
Vingean world in the Lombard world,
in,

44
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.100
in all of western Europe is controlling their mighty servants.

45
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.570
Because these people were not just easy to fire.

46
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.020
You couldn't just cut their salaries.
I mean,
or you know,

47
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:28.990
stopped their paycheck because they're not getting a paycheck.

48
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.670
They're the leaders of soldiers.
They young castles,
fortifications.

49
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.850
But most of all they own land and those land owners and as established powers

50
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.860
within the society,

51
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.070
their power rivals and in the case of Charlemagne's ancestors would exceed the

52
00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:50.140
power of the king.

53
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.460
So these are not people who are easy to dislodge and they are people who tend to

54
00:03:57.041 --> 00:04:01.240
want their power to be not appointive but hereditary.

55
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.673
In other words,

56
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.160
to be queef titles like mayor of the palace to their sons

57
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.800
will,

58
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.720
I mentioned this now because next week we'll see this is a problem that

59
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.840
Charlemagne,
his descendants would have.

60
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.270
They would have the same problem.

61
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.480
How do you make your officials that you've appointed listen to you obey your

62
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:34.930
orders if you don't have sufficient coercive power to remove them?

63
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.080
The reason you don't have sufficient course of power to remove them again is

64
00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:45.320
because they aren't military officials.
They have their own followers,

65
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.650
they are well established in various territories and so they're hard to tame.

66
00:04:51.171 --> 00:04:54.320
They are becoming little kings themselves.

67
00:04:54.321 --> 00:04:57.770
And the key aspect of the ability to become a local ruler,

68
00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.760
even though officially you're subject to the real king

69
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.230
of a large realm,
uh,

70
00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.080
is because it's become hereditary.

71
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.570
It's become a family property.

72
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.440
This tendency to decentralization inheritance and we can,

73
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.170
royal power is often called feudalism,

74
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.240
a word that you may as well write down.

75
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.940
You've heard of it.
Uh,

76
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.600
but which we're not going to use and we're not going to use it for couple of

77
00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:38.630
reasons.
One of which is,
uh,

78
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.000
nobody uses the term at the time.

79
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.060
It carries a lot of other overtones that are not,
are not relevant to us.

80
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.770
And it really in so far as it has use,
it's describes a later period,

81
00:05:51.771 --> 00:05:55.460
a history to 11 kind of reality.

82
00:05:55.461 --> 00:05:57.200
A post year 1000.

83
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.370
But what is to be recalled is that once you no longer have an official state

84
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:10.151
apparatus with an administrative structure or bureaucracy like Diocletian,

85
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.930
like Constantine,

86
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.760
like Justinian or even like those Byzantine emperors we were talking about,

87
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.760
or like the avast had collar fet.

88
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.540
All of those are complex structures of state bureaucracies funded by taxation.

89
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.610
Here we have something that is not that sort of politics.

90
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.420
It is more personal.
It is more military.

91
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.130
It depends more on plunder,
on expansion,

92
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.980
on charisma,
that is personal ability to get people to obey you.

93
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.520
It has a very rudimentary structure and the success of a state is judged on the

94
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:05.090
basis of its ability to survive.
Even if the ruler doesn't have charisma,

95
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.110
even if the ruler is not all that great,

96
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.960
because people obey the state,
they obey its officials,

97
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:15.630
they will be at bay.

98
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:20.540
The idea of the state and not the individual personality.

99
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.090
So we're going to talk about Charlemagne,
his ancestors,

100
00:07:26.091 --> 00:07:29.060
and how they got into power,

101
00:07:29.061 --> 00:07:32.900
how they went from being a mighty servants,

102
00:07:32.901 --> 00:07:37.760
but servants nonetheless to kings of France.

103
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.020
And eventually in 800 emperors,

104
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.700
what happened to the Merovingians last time we checked,

105
00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:50.930
the mayor of Indians were certainly kicking people around,
uh,
Frankia,

106
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.590
um,
warring with each other,
um,

107
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.550
occasionally regretting it,
burning the tax roles,

108
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.670
but pretty quickly returning to the old,
uh,

109
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:06.770
plunder in killing people and having fun kind of barbarian economy.

110
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.360
The late mayor of,

111
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:14.300
and the mayor of engine dynasty lasts to the mid eighth century,

112
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.310
but for its last hundred years,
roughly six 52,
seven 50.

113
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:25.340
Um,
its rulers are ineffective.
They have the title kings,

114
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:31.180
they have great prestige,
but they are weak.

115
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:36.670
A lot of our understanding of their position really is simply a gloss or an

116
00:08:38.991 --> 00:08:42.740
elaboration of a few lines of Einhard.

117
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:47.770
The biographer of Charlemagne whom you've read the family of the mayor of

118
00:08:47.871 --> 00:08:48.321
engines.

119
00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:53.321
He says on page 16 of this book from which the Franks used to make their kings

120
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.930
is thought to have lasted down to king killed Derek,

121
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:03.110
whom Pope Steven ordered deposed his long hair was short and he was forced into

122
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:05.070
a monastery.
Remember,

123
00:09:05.071 --> 00:09:10.071
one of the symbols of Merovingian familial prestige was this long hair.

124
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.960
The Carolingian had short hair and wore mustaches.

125
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:19.500
They kind of broke with the mirror of engine look,

126
00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:22.080
but of course this is not just a male fashion statement,

127
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.510
although it might seem that the marriage of engine family ended with him.

128
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.440
It had in fact been without any vitality for a long time.

129
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.420
The Mirror of engines,

130
00:09:33.421 --> 00:09:38.070
we're just given a little shock because they were already basically finished.

131
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.480
There was nothing of any worth

132
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.090
<v 1>okay</v>

133
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.450
<v 0>in it except for the empty name of King.</v>

134
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.640
For both the riches and power of the kingdom were in possession of the prefix of

135
00:09:52.641 --> 00:09:55.250
the palace.
This is how he's translating it,

136
00:09:55.490 --> 00:10:00.260
who were called the mayors of the pals and to them fell the highest command.

137
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.880
Nothing was left for the king to do except just sit on his throne with his hair

138
00:10:04.881 --> 00:10:06.560
long and his beard uncut,

139
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:10.640
satisfied to hold the name of king only and pretending to rule,

140
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.620
except for the empty name of King and a meager living allowance,

141
00:10:16.621 --> 00:10:18.750
which the Prophet of the court extended to him.

142
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:22.890
He possessed nothing else of his own,
but one the state in a very small income.

143
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:27.530
Now,
so much depends on these words of iron,

144
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:32.110
who then goes on to describe them going around in these ceremonial cards.
Uh,

145
00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:35.620
people are claiming them,
but everybody knows that if they want anything done,

146
00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:39.160
the person to talk to is the mayor of the palace.

147
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.400
It's too Einhard's interest,

148
00:10:42.401 --> 00:10:45.910
or at least to the interest of the Carolingian is for whom he's writing to make

149
00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:50.020
it appear as if the mayor of engines,
we're already finished.
But nevertheless,

150
00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:54.430
it's clear that they were much weaker than the people we've been reading about

151
00:10:54.431 --> 00:10:58.420
in Gregory of tour.
What happened to them?
Well,

152
00:10:58.421 --> 00:11:00.650
one possibility that,
uh,

153
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:05.500
Einhard in effect sort of encourages as that they,
they just,
you know,

154
00:11:05.501 --> 00:11:07.810
something happened to the family.
They,
they,
uh,

155
00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.500
they were weak personalities and you know,

156
00:11:11.501 --> 00:11:15.170
maybe they had some hereditary yeah.
Degeneration,

157
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.350
um,
or they ran out of money.

158
00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:26.080
They did not have lands to reward their followers anymore.

159
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:29.890
Remember that in this economy,
uh,

160
00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:34.950
this is not something in which tax revenues are funding the state.

161
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:38.750
I mean,
up to a point they are because we saw,
uh,

162
00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:43.770
that a Fred a guns and kill Parak had tax revenues and these tax records to

163
00:11:45.431 --> 00:11:49.330
burn.
But as the inheritance of Rome,

164
00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.200
Roman administration,
Roman literacy,

165
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.070
Roman organization frayed,

166
00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.280
has that inheritance became further and further degraded.

167
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:05.520
The ability to tax the population rural dispersed,

168
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.470
uh,
dwindled.

169
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.820
So it's not only a question of the administrative decline,

170
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.960
but if the economic decline or at least the economic decentralization of the way

171
00:12:16.961 --> 00:12:17.794
people lived,

172
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:23.130
the mirror of Indians had depended on awful lot on war and on the plunder

173
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:29.370
received from the more you'll remember that when we were talking about a Clo

174
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:33.190
Tar,
uh,
the son of Clovis,

175
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.600
that his men rebelled when he didn't want to fight the Saxons.

176
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:42.930
That's not just because they're war like savages or in so far is there war like

177
00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:48.650
savages?
They're also in it for treasure plunder bay.

178
00:12:48.651 --> 00:12:53.500
A Wolf is a plunder driven world.

179
00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.930
The author of Beowulf is well aware that this is stupid in a way,
right?

180
00:12:58.931 --> 00:13:03.220
The dragon has all this plunder and what does he do with it?
You know,

181
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:07.180
dragons are not consumers.
Uh,
he,
you know,

182
00:13:07.181 --> 00:13:09.870
he lies on beds of uh,
uh,

183
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:14.940
gold coins and you know,
beautiful armor and,
uh,
uh,

184
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.610
all sorts of things that have been seized has absolutely no use for all of this

185
00:13:18.611 --> 00:13:19.180
stuff.

186
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:24.180
And yet stealing just a little tiny ring or a little bit of it enrages him.

187
00:13:24.401 --> 00:13:29.401
And so he starts his depredations out of anger at that the Merovingians,

188
00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:31.870
once they stop expanding,

189
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:37.200
don't have the opportunities to keep their economy going,

190
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:42.550
their source of income going and in particular,
they lose the ability.

191
00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.960
So it would seem to reward their followers,
their followers,

192
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.870
their nights to call them that anachronistic way.

193
00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.330
Their military entourage

194
00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:58.760
does not flourish by being paid because there's very little in the way of

195
00:13:58.761 --> 00:14:02.930
coinage.
There's very little in the way of revenues.

196
00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:04.993
<v 1>Okay?</v>

197
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.610
<v 0>They benefit from things like land,</v>

198
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.910
but as you are running out of plunder and giving away land,

199
00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:13.920
then sooner or later you yourself,

200
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:17.220
the giver of land will not have any more to give.

201
00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:21.770
That's another hypothesis about,
uh,

202
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.220
Merovingian decline.
In fact,

203
00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.670
uh,
there is a,

204
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:34.970
an effort by a mayor of the palace of the late seventh century to depose the

205
00:14:35.881 --> 00:14:36.870
mayor of engine king,

206
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:43.440
um,
Amanda and grim old

207
00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:50.760
who is an ancestor of Charlemagne.
Uh,
but,
uh,

208
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.280
this unsuccessful,

209
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.330
<v 1>okay?</v>

210
00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:59.330
<v 0>He tries to depose a mirror of engine ruler and even though the Merovingians are</v>

211
00:14:59.341 --> 00:15:02.880
weak,
there are other followers prevent grim old from succeeding.

212
00:15:02.881 --> 00:15:04.110
And indeed he's executed.

213
00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:10.100
The prestige of the Merovingians was suck that even if they were not effective,

214
00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:15.180
they were still the kings because the blood of Clovis float in their veins.

215
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:20.280
And this was symbolized by their familial distinctiveness.

216
00:15:20.281 --> 00:15:24.940
We concluded the long hair,
the uncut beard,
the traveling around in carcass.

217
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.193
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

218
00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:34.530
<v 0>This is important because it means that you could not succeed by direct action</v>

219
00:15:36.281 --> 00:15:40.700
against the Merovingians,
at least not in six 61 when old.
Uh,

220
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:43.720
was,
um,
uh,
killed

221
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:50.030
in order to make this happen.
Now,

222
00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.380
other words,
even though he was killed,
his successors remained as mayors.

223
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:58.540
The palace,
they were a tightly enough ensconced or,

224
00:15:58.541 --> 00:15:59.800
um,
uh,

225
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:04.060
inserted into the structures of power and successful enough as a family,

226
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.500
but they were able to survive.

227
00:16:05.501 --> 00:16:09.070
But as mayors of the palace looked at from the long term,

228
00:16:09.071 --> 00:16:13.120
that is from the perspective of seven 51 the year when Pepin,

229
00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:14.470
uh,

230
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:19.270
declared himself king of the Franks and deposed that last Merovingian ruler

231
00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.070
looked at from that perspective,

232
00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.030
the strategy of the dynasty,

233
00:16:25.031 --> 00:16:29.500
which we can call Carolinians even though we're not yet at Charlemagne,

234
00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:35.220
the strategy of the Carolingian was to come up with another rationale,

235
00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:43.380
another rationale for why they should be kings and not the mayor of income,

236
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.210
what we can call legitimacy.

237
00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:51.930
Legitimacy in politics is the sense that the people who are ruling our ruling

238
00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.080
for good reasons,
that their rule is legitimate.

239
00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:01.840
This can be on the basis of an election.
I may not like the president,

240
00:17:01.841 --> 00:17:04.810
but he was elected in a fair election.
Therefore,

241
00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:09.490
accept the fact that he's president.
It may be,
um,
uh,

242
00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.780
triumph and war.

243
00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:12.843
<v 1>Okay.</v>

244
00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:14.830
<v 0>This emperor came to power,</v>

245
00:17:14.831 --> 00:17:19.450
deposed his predecessor and got the Bulgars off our back.

246
00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:24.700
Therefore,
his rule is legitimate.
Uh,
it may be economic benefit.

247
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.780
Uh,
this guy has a,
uh,
um,

248
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:32.440
made my life easier economically,
or,
you know,

249
00:17:32.441 --> 00:17:36.370
I have the feeling that things are going right.
It may be dynasty.

250
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:43.030
This,
uh,
is,
uh,
the oldest son of the former king,

251
00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:44.561
or you know,

252
00:17:44.561 --> 00:17:49.380
the British rulers just changed to admit,
uh,

253
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:53.760
um,
to end discrimination between men and women in the succession.
So,

254
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:59.160
uh,
the,
um,
you know,

255
00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:04.850
obviously Britain has a queen rather than a king and has for the last 60 years,

256
00:18:05.581 --> 00:18:07.830
but,
um,
uh,

257
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:12.630
the favored candidate would be a male child.

258
00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:17.190
The circumstances of Elizabeth's succession don't need to detain us,
but,
uh,

259
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:21.090
she was not the logical eldest,
uh,
um,

260
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.640
obviously not the eldest male child.

261
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.100
So there all sorts of ways of having legitimacy as a ruler.

262
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:33.900
The challenge for the mayors of the palace was to,

263
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.630
um,
create this legitimacy

264
00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:42.440
and they did it by several different means.

265
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:47.390
Uh,
it's not that there's this project where they set out in year six,

266
00:18:47.391 --> 00:18:48.620
62 and say,

267
00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:53.140
within 90 years we're coming to power and here's how we're going to do it.
Uh,

268
00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:57.350
it is historians who impose that rational strategy,
but nevertheless,

269
00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:00.740
it is discernible.
In fact,

270
00:19:00.741 --> 00:19:05.120
there are mayors of the palace of several different pieces because the mirror of

271
00:19:05.121 --> 00:19:08.690
engine realm was not unified.
It was in particular pieces.

272
00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.800
So these guys are the mayors of the palace of all straws.
Yeah.

273
00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:18.730
So there were opponents include the other kingdoms,

274
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.250
particularly new Austria,

275
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:27.200
which is more or less the region of Paris,
the sen,

276
00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:33.110
the central to northern part of modern France,
but further west.

277
00:19:33.111 --> 00:19:36.050
And then I'll straws here.
So I'll,
Strozzi is northeast,

278
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.650
new street is more central,
uh,
and slightly south.

279
00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:42.470
<v 1>Okay.</v>

280
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.740
<v 0>So there are lots of rivals.
It's a very dangerous situation.</v>

281
00:19:45.741 --> 00:19:49.190
It's a very violent world.
But this is their plan.

282
00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:53.210
A lot of what they,
um,

283
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:58.270
that is the Carolingian ancestors of Charlemagne accomplished was military.

284
00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:04.540
This is the bottom line of leadership in the period where dealing with without

285
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:08.780
military prestige and military success,

286
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.650
it's very hard to craft a polity,

287
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:16.430
let alone hand that down to your descendants.

288
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:19.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

289
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.560
<v 0>What is more unusual than military leadership?
However,</v>

290
00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:27.890
is that the Carolingian allied themselves to the church,

291
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:36.770
their legitimacy as rulers would be based very much on an alliance with the

292
00:20:37.561 --> 00:20:41.400
church.
And in particular with the papacy,

293
00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:46.620
the bishop of Rome is someone whom we haven't talked about very much.

294
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:52.330
We mentioned Leo the first back in the fifth century,

295
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:57.610
who was responsible for negotiating with the huns in the absence of the emperor

296
00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:02.340
and who also upheld Doc Trinal,
uh,

297
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.840
orthodoxy against monophysitism.

298
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.210
But the pope was not inevitably the sole ruler of the church and the way he

299
00:21:10.211 --> 00:21:13.030
would become in the modern world within the Catholic Church.

300
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:19.240
The pope was a,
the bishop of Rome.

301
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:24.460
He was the guardian of some of the chief relics of the Christian world,

302
00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:27.700
the relics of Saint Peter and Saint Paul.
The apostle's.

303
00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:30.230
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

304
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:33.860
<v 0>He was the inheritor of the aura of the city of Rome,</v>

305
00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:35.510
the imperial city.

306
00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:41.120
He even had appropriated some titles from the Roman emperor such as Pontifex

307
00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.860
Maximus,
an old pagan title.

308
00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:48.170
So the pope is the inheritor of a lot of Roman imperial prestige,

309
00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.440
but he is a beleaguered inheritor of that.
In fact,

310
00:21:51.441 --> 00:21:56.240
the pope's life in Rome was dangerous.
He was often,

311
00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:57.590
um,
uh,

312
00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.580
eclipsed by or threatened by the Lombards,

313
00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:05.270
the Lombards,
a barbarian tribe who had invaded Italy.

314
00:22:05.271 --> 00:22:08.480
We talked about them last time.
Uh,

315
00:22:08.481 --> 00:22:13.280
they invaded in five 68.
They took most of Italy from Justinian's heirs.

316
00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.440
Uh,
they were airing on for a longer time than other barbarian tribes.

317
00:22:18.441 --> 00:22:22.730
And even when they cease to be Arion,
they were eager to seize Rome.

318
00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:25.730
They weren't overwhelmingly eager to see run because they never did it,

319
00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:26.930
but they threatened

320
00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:27.903
<v 1>the pope.</v>

321
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:33.820
<v 0>During the seventh century,</v>

322
00:22:33.821 --> 00:22:38.170
the pope considered himself the ally of the Byzantine Empire.

323
00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:44.220
The emperor is continue to intervene to debate various stock trinal things.

324
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:50.830
But as the Lombard threat grew,

325
00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:55.690
as the Byzantine emperors were iconoclast,

326
00:22:55.990 --> 00:23:00.990
the pope cast around for a new protector beginning in really the seven twenties,

327
00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:04.960
seven 30.

328
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:11.400
And so the alliance between Carolingian and popes is natural in the sense that

329
00:23:13.541 --> 00:23:16.300
they both want something out of the other.

330
00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:21.430
But Carolingian owns the mayors of the palace want legitimacy.

331
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:26.730
They want to be sacred figures within the Christian world to Trump the pre

332
00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:31.030
Christian or a of the mayor of engines.

333
00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:36.240
And the pope out of the Carolingian wants protection from the lombards and a

334
00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:38.770
sense of,
uh,

335
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:42.970
rule over most of Europe that will favor the church and allow the church to

336
00:23:42.971 --> 00:23:43.990
advance its work.

337
00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:50.420
The means of cementing this alliance,
however,

338
00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.510
are interestingly enough,
mom,

339
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:58.970
the people who are the shock troops of the Christianization of Europe,

340
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:01.200
the expansion of Europe,
uh,

341
00:24:01.201 --> 00:24:06.201
of the church and the furtherance of its mission are monks.

342
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:12.700
Many of them from Ireland and Britain who would try to convert the countryside,

343
00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:18.860
either those places that were minimally Christian or beginning of the seventh,

344
00:24:18.861 --> 00:24:20.690
late seventh and early 18th centuries,

345
00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:25.740
extend Christianity to places like Holland or,
um,

346
00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.380
central Germany

347
00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:34.030
that were not part of the Roman empire and had never been Christian.

348
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:41.550
So these monastic settlements not only converted the countryside,

349
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
but they served as photo psi for economic and social development.

350
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:54.110
There was an alliance between the mayors of the palace and monks such as the

351
00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:58.440
English monk,
St Barna Fests,
apostle to the Germans.

352
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:06.110
Saint Bonhoeffer's in the eighth century would convert a lot of the Germans in

353
00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:08.610
an east of the Rhine.

354
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:14.510
He would receive support from the mayors of the Palace of Australia because this

355
00:25:15.721 --> 00:25:20.580
is east of where they are and they're interested in expanding and settling there

356
00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:25.850
and he received support from the pope who is interested in the conversion of

357
00:25:26.221 --> 00:25:31.221
Christians and so it's through intermediaries like Saint Boniface and other

358
00:25:33.541 --> 00:25:34.374
monks.

359
00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:39.470
The countryside gets converted and that the Carroll and jeans and the pope

360
00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:44.930
approach each other.
Why monks?
Who are these guys?

361
00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:49.060
When we looked at the benedictine role,

362
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:52.850
didn't it seem as if monks are supposed to be enclosed in their monasteries and

363
00:25:52.851 --> 00:25:57.710
not wander around?
These are somewhat special monks.
These are wandering monks.

364
00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:02.770
The Irish tradition was different from the Benedictine tradition and encourage

365
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.300
wandering as a form of penance.

366
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:11.950
If you want it to do penance or to experience the power of God and randomness in

367
00:26:11.961 --> 00:26:12.794
the world,

368
00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:17.240
which would you rather do pray seven times a day in the same place for decades?

369
00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.210
Or just kind of like,
um,

370
00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:21.900
<v 1>okay.</v>

371
00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:25.730
<v 0>Wander around,
try to convert people and see if you could get martyred.
Uh,</v>

372
00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:30.540
certainly the latter is dangerous.
The ladder is truly dangerous.
Uh,

373
00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:34.770
but his are very enterprising guys.
You know,
we just,
we just have this idea,

374
00:26:34.771 --> 00:26:35.041
oh yeah,

375
00:26:35.041 --> 00:26:38.310
amongst pray or are they copying manuscripts or they wander around and convert

376
00:26:38.311 --> 00:26:41.040
people,
all of which are insanely difficult things to do.

377
00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:45.780
And you really have to admire these guys.
Um,
so,
uh,

378
00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:47.581
there are,

379
00:26:47.581 --> 00:26:51.570
many of them are from Ireland or from recently converted Anglo Saxon England.

380
00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:56.760
Saxon England combines a benedictine structure with some of this inheritance of

381
00:26:57.391 --> 00:26:59.160
Irish,
uh,
wandering.

382
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:06.110
But it is these monasteries that are founded in the countryside of Germany,

383
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.310
of the Netherlands.
Um,

384
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:14.630
and the alliances between the mayors of the palace and the papacy that are key

385
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:16.673
in

386
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.690
creating the Carolingian dynasty,

387
00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:25.570
<v 1>uh,</v>

388
00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:30.570
<v 0>the mayors of the palace of a Straw Zia come to preeminence in the mirror</v>

389
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.480
vingean realms in the early eighth century.

390
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:39.750
One of the key events here is one that we've looked at from several sides now,

391
00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.340
and that will be,
I hope,
familiar to you.

392
00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:47.610
And that is the battle of Poitier in seven 33 also known as the battle of tour.

393
00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:58.140
This is the battle in which the Arabs were defeated in northern France and

394
00:27:59.171 --> 00:28:01.000
eventually retreated to Spain.

395
00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:06.240
Seven 33 marks the high water point of Arab incursions into Europe and is in a

396
00:28:10.361 --> 00:28:13.120
sense of parallel to seven 17,

397
00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:16.120
the defeat of the siege of Constantinople.

398
00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:21.290
<v 1>Okay.</v>

399
00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:25.480
<v 0>The victor at Poitier was the mayor of the Palace of Australia,</v>

400
00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:29.930
a man named Charles Martel,
the hammer.

401
00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.540
He doesn't have a last name.
It's sort of a

402
00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:39.200
Charles Martel.
And he gained tremendous prestige,

403
00:28:39.201 --> 00:28:44.201
firmness that legitimation that we said comes from military leadership.

404
00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:47.960
Certainly,
uh,
was his,

405
00:28:47.961 --> 00:28:50.870
the Merovingian king was nowhere to be seen at that battle.

406
00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:55.650
It was led by the mayor of the palace,
Charles,

407
00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.090
his son,

408
00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:02.930
Pepin the short started really to put together these aspects of a rule,

409
00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:11.280
Pepin the short,
um,
seven 41 to seven 68.

410
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:17.670
Now there's something going on here that I don't have an explanation for.

411
00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:19.893
<v 1>Uh,</v>

412
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:25.740
<v 0>if he really was short yet,
we know from a,
um,</v>

413
00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.910
digging up his body that Charlemagne was on the order of six,
seven.

414
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:33.730
Charlemagne is really tall,
uh,

415
00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:38.290
for a premodern people.
He's really,
really trying to,

416
00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:41.920
I'm the 900 describes him as tall.
Einhard says,
you know,

417
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:46.210
his voice was kind of squeaky and high given just how huge he was.

418
00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.850
I Dunno how that works.
Um,

419
00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:53.140
many of you are more advanced in the science in genetics and name,
but,
uh,

420
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:57.850
my pet theory since pepins body hasn't been fat is that actually he was really

421
00:29:57.851 --> 00:30:02.440
tall too,
and that he's called Pepin the short as a kind of joke.
You know,

422
00:30:02.441 --> 00:30:06.280
like guys nicknamed tiny,
uh,
are often,
you know,

423
00:30:06.281 --> 00:30:08.050
like 350 pounders.

424
00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:12.820
I'm just saying,
uh,

425
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:18.520
Pepin the short is the person who crystallizes this potential alliance among

426
00:30:18.521 --> 00:30:22.570
papacy,
missionaries and mayors of the palace.
And in doing so,

427
00:30:22.571 --> 00:30:26.680
he transforms Europe.
He favored the church.

428
00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:32.250
He could mobilize his new power and legitimacy through this alliance with the

429
00:30:34.751 --> 00:30:35.500
church.

430
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:40.500
He encouraged various kinds of monastic reforms or by Saint Barnabas,

431
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.890
which meant better discipline over a priests,

432
00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:47.530
more councils of bishops.

433
00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:50.573
<v 1>Okay.</v>

434
00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:53.230
<v 0>The restoration of lands to the church</v>

435
00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:58.430
and a role for the king as the Guardian and protector of the church.

436
00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.113
<v 1>Okay.</v>

437
00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:07.390
<v 0>It may be at manifests as in,
um,</v>

438
00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:11.290
instigation that Pepin wrote to the pope.

439
00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.560
Zacharias at this time asking,

440
00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:20.040
is it right for the man who holds the power not to wear the crown while the

441
00:31:20.201 --> 00:31:24.190
person who wrote where's the crown does not hold the power.

442
00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:25.790
<v 1>Okay.</v>

443
00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:30.140
<v 0>He asks this as if it was a hypothetical question.
Oh,
you know,</v>

444
00:31:30.141 --> 00:31:33.800
we were just discussing this last night and wonder what you think.
Uh,

445
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:38.830
but of course the pope is quite aware of what's at stake and says it is wrong

446
00:31:38.841 --> 00:31:41.390
for the person who holds the power not to hold the crown.

447
00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:47.440
Where upon in seven 51 Pepin had himself elected king of the Franks,

448
00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:51.933
<v 1>okay.</v>

449
00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:54.970
<v 0>Deposed and put in a monastery.</v>

450
00:31:55.750 --> 00:32:00.520
The last Merovingian king and by is being put in the monastery.

451
00:32:00.521 --> 00:32:05.350
He was Tom Shirt.
That is to say his,
uh,
much of his hair was cut off.

452
00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:06.970
D sacralizing him

453
00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:12.580
and unlike grim olds failed coup d'etat,

454
00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:16.450
this was totally peacefully,
no problem.

455
00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.300
Greeted by everybody,
uh,
successful.

456
00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:24.010
In seven 53,
two years later,
the new pope,

457
00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.740
Steven made an unprecedented,

458
00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:29.860
literally unprecedented journey across the Alps.

459
00:32:29.861 --> 00:32:34.240
No pope had ever been in northern Europe until this year.

460
00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.760
And he crowned Peppa,

461
00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:44.200
he was desperate over the situation with the lombards

462
00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:47.110
and in return,

463
00:32:47.111 --> 00:32:52.111
Pepin led an expedition that although not the definitive invasion of Italy that

464
00:32:54.071 --> 00:32:56.400
Charlemagne would undertake a,

465
00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:59.950
at least gave the pope some breathing room and defeated the lombards.

466
00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:03.613
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

467
00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:06.090
<v 0>At pepins death in seven 68,</v>

468
00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:11.390
he was succeeded by his son Charles and his other son Carmen Charles the future.

469
00:33:14.371 --> 00:33:16.160
Charles the Great Charlotte [inaudible].

470
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:19.183
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

471
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:24.080
<v 0>Carla man died in [inaudible] 70 [inaudible] 71.
Uh,
maybe naturally,</v>

472
00:33:24.081 --> 00:33:28.130
maybe not leaving Charlemagne as the sole ruler.

473
00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:33.880
Charlemagne at this point is king of the Franks inheritor of the title and

474
00:33:34.221 --> 00:33:36.260
accomplishments of his father.

475
00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:42.670
He was the beneficiary then of well over a hundred years of,

476
00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:47.210
uh,
Carolingian ascent.

477
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:52.300
And let's just review the factors that had aided his predecessors.

478
00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.130
The weakness of the mayor of engines,

479
00:33:57.410 --> 00:33:59.450
their position is mayors of the palace.

480
00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:01.480
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

481
00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.010
<v 0>The activity of monks,</v>

482
00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:08.070
missionaries to Germany and the eastern part of the Frankish World

483
00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:14.620
Byzantine weakness and the Lombard threat.

484
00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:23.490
And of course Byzantine flirting with,
uh,

485
00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:25.560
heresies like iconoclasm.

486
00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:32.810
The result is then a kind of geopolitical shift of the papacy towards the north,

487
00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:39.050
another chapter in that long book of the end of Mediterranean hegemony instead

488
00:34:40.681 --> 00:34:45.510
of looking to the eastern Mediterranean for protection and for the ruler who was

489
00:34:45.511 --> 00:34:46.620
his natural ally,

490
00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:51.720
the pope now looks to a northern Trans Alpine ruler.

491
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:57.150
Charlemagne you've read about,
uh,

492
00:34:57.151 --> 00:35:01.890
and you've read Einhard's biography of him.
It is,
uh,

493
00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:06.120
in some sense,
at least a seemingly artless biography.

494
00:35:06.121 --> 00:35:11.070
He obviously likes him admire somebody,
describes him as a real person.
I mean,

495
00:35:11.071 --> 00:35:15.640
we learned that he liked baths,
uh,
and a roast meat,
uh,

496
00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:20.700
that he had a high voice,
uh,
that he loved having his daughters around him,

497
00:35:20.701 --> 00:35:23.700
but probably kind of mistreated them by not allowing them to marry.

498
00:35:23.701 --> 00:35:27.510
And then 900 scandalized that since they couldn't marry,
they had all sorts of,

499
00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:30.990
you know,
guys hanging around.
Um,

500
00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:35.910
we get a sense of Charlemagne.
His personality.
Charlemagne is,
Amen.

501
00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:38.310
Very much at in his time.

502
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:43.350
He is comfortable with being a warrior.

503
00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:48.860
He would lead campaigns year after year after year at the same time.

504
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:54.710
He is a person of learning or at least a person who believes learning is

505
00:35:56.131 --> 00:35:57.090
important.

506
00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:02.990
Einhard tells us that he never quite really learned to read and write that he

507
00:36:03.061 --> 00:36:07.470
tried,
but he slept with Augustine's city of God by his side,

508
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:12.360
which is an impressive thing to do as a bedtime reading.

509
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:17.370
Um,
and we also know that he's pious.

510
00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:22.940
His piety does not interfere with his enjoyment of life or with his,

511
00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:28.710
uh,
uh,
harsh,
uh,
prosecution of military campaigns.

512
00:36:28.711 --> 00:36:32.670
He's not a sensitive person.
He's not an,
uh,
self,

513
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:37.440
um,
uh,
examining kind of character.

514
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:44.270
But very important is that his notion of leadership combines the what might be

515
00:36:45.901 --> 00:36:48.990
thought of three available forms of legitimacy of this era.

516
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.050
One is,

517
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:57.510
and the most important is military prestige and power

518
00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:00.210
war leadership.

519
00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:08.190
And he conquered lots of peoples.

520
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:12.120
It was not just a question of war leadership with no results.

521
00:37:12.121 --> 00:37:13.740
He had tremendous results.

522
00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:18.890
He conquered the Lombards in Italy in seven 74 he conquered the Avon ours in the

523
00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:26.250
70s.
So much treasure did he sees from that.

524
00:37:26.251 --> 00:37:29.190
Remember we saw the vars as procedures of Constantinople.

525
00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:31.920
By this time they're in more or less modern Hungary.

526
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.300
He sees so much treasure that the entire economy of his empire,

527
00:37:36.301 --> 00:37:41.301
basically a was financed on the basis of this plunder until his death in eight

528
00:37:41.851 --> 00:37:44.970
14.
So for nearly 20 years,

529
00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:48.450
he conquered the Bavarians.

530
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:53.730
He conquered the Saxons in northern eastern Germany.
Very,

531
00:37:53.731 --> 00:37:58.731
very difficult series of campaigns from seven 74 to eight oh six that involved,

532
00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.490
um,
uh,

533
00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:06.630
large numbers of civilian casualties,

534
00:38:06.631 --> 00:38:10.740
virtual exterminations of peoples and forced conversion.

535
00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:16.140
It was the first real sustained campaign of forced conversion to Christianity in

536
00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:20.790
European history.
Brutal,

537
00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:25.260
but successful opening up really the definition of modern Germany.

538
00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.860
Much of what the modern German state is,
uh,

539
00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:32.880
in its central and eastern parts in the north is Saxon.

540
00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:37.480
There is a part called Saxony,
still a province of the former East Germany,

541
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:39.210
but in fact,
uh,
uh,

542
00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:43.120
a province of the former or alarmed as they're called of the former West Germany

543
00:38:43.121 --> 00:38:46.340
is called Kneaders oxen Lower Saxony.
Uh,

544
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:51.390
so the Saxons are spread throughout northern Germany and by Charlemagne his

545
00:38:51.851 --> 00:38:56.810
death,
Germany or the eastern Frankish realm starts to look something like,
uh,

546
00:38:57.010 --> 00:39:00.580
uh,
something familiar.
Uh,

547
00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:04.090
he conquers a bit in Spain against the Muslims.

548
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:08.440
His forces would seize Barcelona in the year eight Oh one,

549
00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:13.900
but he does not get as far as he had hoped.
In particular,

550
00:39:13.901 --> 00:39:15.680
he had hoped to take Sarah Gosa.

551
00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:20.830
His army was defeated by a actually Basques,

552
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:26.190
but their defeat weeds to the literary triumph known as the song of Roland,

553
00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:30.190
one of the great works of the Middle Ages in which the enemy are Muslims.

554
00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:35.290
And the song of Roland is a great sort of crusade ideology text,

555
00:39:35.291 --> 00:39:39.880
which shows in its own words that Christians are right.
Pagans are wrong.

556
00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:42.700
Of course they call the Muslims Pagans.

557
00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:47.650
They depict them as worshiping Apollo and term of guns and other,
uh,

558
00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:51.460
gods.
They know that the Muslims are not literally pagans,

559
00:39:51.461 --> 00:39:55.260
but uh,
it has higher rhetorical valued.

560
00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:59.410
Charlemagne is tremendously successful as a ward leader.

561
00:39:59.411 --> 00:40:04.411
Then his second form of power and legitimacy is as a Christian ruler.

562
00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:14.640
He is a man with a vision of a Christian polity

563
00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:23.670
of alliance with the church and as seeing himself as responsible for the

564
00:40:27.041 --> 00:40:31.450
spiritual health of his people.
This is important,

565
00:40:31.451 --> 00:40:35.380
this latter responsibility because it has a lot to do with the program of

566
00:40:35.381 --> 00:40:38.500
education that we'll be talking about next week.

567
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:43.450
The intellectual heir of his court.
He believes himself,

568
00:40:43.451 --> 00:40:48.430
therefore to be not just somebody who is supposed to convert the Saxons

569
00:40:48.431 --> 00:40:49.264
forcibly,

570
00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:54.420
but it's supposed to educate as population into becoming a Christians have a

571
00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:56.400
real sword.

572
00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:02.070
This also means that he is allied with the pope and believes that the pope is

573
00:41:02.831 --> 00:41:07.300
capable of aiding him in more than merely symbolic way.

574
00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:13.630
The third aspect of power and legitimacy is the legacy of Rome,

575
00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:18.310
which is the thing that unifies this entire course.
Charlemagne,

576
00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:23.800
according to Einhard,
went to Rome to rescue the pope,

577
00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:27.790
yet again.
Now,
not this time from the lombards in 800,

578
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:32.500
but from the Roman factions.
Pope Leo the third

579
00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:37.940
was rescued by Charlemagne,
put back in Rome.

580
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:40.820
Charlemagne Einhard tells us,

581
00:41:40.821 --> 00:41:45.170
went to Saint Peter's on Christmas Day to pray.

582
00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:47.300
And Lo and behold,

583
00:41:47.301 --> 00:41:51.350
the pope jumped out from behind a pillar and put the crown on his head.

584
00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.990
And he was a claimed Roman emperor.

585
00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:58.430
Charlemagne said later he wouldn't have gone,

586
00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:00.110
even though it was Christmas.

587
00:42:00.111 --> 00:42:02.660
He wouldn't have gone to church at all if he'd known this was going to happen.

588
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:04.281
Uh,

589
00:42:04.281 --> 00:42:09.281
we can be cynical about the surprise aspect of this or about Charlemagne's

590
00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:13.760
uncharacteristic modesty.
Nevertheless,

591
00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:19.070
we have to think about the implications of the pope crowning the Emperor

592
00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:22.940
Constantine wasn't crowned by a pope.

593
00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:29.353
Um,

594
00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:35.220
the problem with having someone crown you is that it could be implied that he is

595
00:42:35.411 --> 00:42:40.390
the one who bestows the crown and could decide not to crown someone in the

596
00:42:40.391 --> 00:42:45.190
future.
It looks as if he's the more powerful one.
He's standing,

597
00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:50.280
he's putting the crown on you and you're kneeling indeed as an avocation of this

598
00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:55.650
almost exactly 1000 years later in 1804 when Napoleon had himself crowned by the

599
00:42:57.821 --> 00:42:59.830
Pope,
uh,

600
00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:04.840
Napoleon sees the crown from the pope's hands and put it on his himself,

601
00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:09.700
put it on his own head in a direct reference to Charlemagne.

602
00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:15.960
So Roman Christian and military leadership of these,

603
00:43:17.861 --> 00:43:22.450
the Roman is the most impressive and the most sort of historically dramatic,

604
00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:25.720
but probably the least significant.
At the time,

605
00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:31.510
Charlemagne did not consider his empire to be exactly the same thing as the

606
00:43:31.511 --> 00:43:34.290
Roman empire.
He would divide it.
Uh,

607
00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:38.980
the fact that he handed it over to one son is that he only ended up having one

608
00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:43.830
surviving son,
but he had plans to divided.

609
00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:46.720
It's not clear if he regarded the imperial titles,
anything that would,

610
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:51.730
we're really survive.
Nevertheless,
he was an emperor,

611
00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:56.140
an emperor,
meaning that he ruled over many peoples.

612
00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:00.040
He was more than just the king of the Franks because he now ruled over

613
00:44:00.041 --> 00:44:03.760
barbarians.
A Varas visit.
Goffs Lombard's.

614
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:11.230
He had made a good stab at restoring the Roman Empire in the west,

615
00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:16.640
but
it's a different Roman empire.

616
00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:22.660
It's base is not really in Rome nor even in Milan or Ravenna,

617
00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:29.210
the late Roman imperial capitols of the fifth century.
It is in

618
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:35.130
a city,
um,
in Australia,

619
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:39.330
uh,
where,
uh,
uh,

620
00:44:39.331 --> 00:44:42.750
remains of his palace chapel still stand.

621
00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:49.710
His lands,
influence cronies,

622
00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:54.270
family,
political base,
economic base,

623
00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.750
military recruiting base are all in northern Europe.

624
00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:03.380
Charlemagne is then in some sense the reviver of the Roman empire,

625
00:45:03.601 --> 00:45:08.340
but he is also the founder of Europe as something,

626
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:12.990
not just a geographical expression,
but a cultural expression,

627
00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.850
whether it is a sociopolitical expression.
Um,

628
00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:20.610
time will tell when the European Union,

629
00:45:20.611 --> 00:45:23.680
the euro and all these things that are sort of semi unraveling.

630
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:28.730
Now we're cemented in their current form in the early 19 nine days in the,

631
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.113
uh,

632
00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:35.120
the treaties that established that we're deliberately made in the territories

633
00:45:36.961 --> 00:45:40.140
that are neither French nor German entirely,

634
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:45.320
but are really part of the old Carolingian patrimony that treaties in places

635
00:45:46.111 --> 00:45:48.210
like Maastricht,
uh,

636
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:52.200
the location of Brussels as the capital of the European Union.

637
00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:56.940
All of this is really evocative of the empire of Charlemagne.

638
00:45:57.090 --> 00:46:00.480
These are the lands of,
uh,
um,
uh,

639
00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:05.570
the Carolingian and this is in the next thousand years in certain respects,

640
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:09.870
the center of Europe.

641
00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:13.440
We'll talk more about the Carolinians next week.
