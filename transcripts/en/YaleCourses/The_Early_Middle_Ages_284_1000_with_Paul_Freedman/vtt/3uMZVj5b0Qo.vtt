1
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.540
Gregory of tour.

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.770
Here we enter into a further into a stranger world.

3
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:13.290
As I told you at the outset of the course,

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.530
it begins fairly reasonably as if it's another history course with great powers,

5
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.890
states recognizable theories of government and practices of government.

6
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.670
Now we're into what certainly seems like a combination of thugs and miracles and

7
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.400
I hope that you'll see,

8
00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:42.120
if you haven't seen already that far from being contradictory.

9
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.600
Thugs and miracles go together.
Historically,

10
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.410
we've already entered into a somewhat strange realm with pro copious,

11
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.130
copious secret history certainly is a strange story with strange theories of

12
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:06.480
causality and a strange cast of characters,

13
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.660
but it is narrated in a high classical style in so far as the pieces are a bit

14
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:16.590
jumbled.
It's because it wasn't completed,

15
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.930
but as a you will have seen,
if you think about per copious,

16
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.010
he is easy to read because he's leading you on.

17
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.010
He has a set several points to make and he makes them with great rhetorical

18
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.413
power.

19
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.570
His secret history is in the classical tradition of the invective.

20
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:41.731
And in a way,

21
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:46.731
we are better able to understand this because our own political discourse has

22
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:52.041
gotten much more crude and extreme in the last 30 years or so.

23
00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.200
So political invective historical invective stylistically well composed is not

24
00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:06.450
unfamiliar to us,
but Gregory of tour is in a way,

25
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:11.451
I've cheated by giving you the assignment from this edition of Alexander Murray

26
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.710
because he rearranges and excerpts things.

27
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.860
The full work is much fatter.

28
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.310
And Marie tries to make the story fairly coherent with headings,

29
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.820
grouping things together,

30
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.740
explaining a little what's going on to say nothing of the Nice maps and

31
00:02:34.741 --> 00:02:37.140
genealogical tables in the back,

32
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.280
but that loses some of the random quality or seemingly random quality that

33
00:02:46.051 --> 00:02:47.430
Gregory has.

34
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.550
He has this funny way of seeming to move from one thing to another without any

35
00:02:55.591 --> 00:02:58.620
kind of transition or for no apparent purpose.

36
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.890
So in one of the,
uh,
little,
um,
uh,

37
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:05.530
sections of book three that's not in Murray.

38
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.370
He's,
um,

39
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.800
he's telling us now we have an a miracle there.

40
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:17.470
Lived at the city of long grow Saint Gregory,

41
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.220
that priest of God fame foreign wide for his miracles in virtuous deeds.

42
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.380
While I am talking about this bishop,

43
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:26.470
I thought you would like me to tell you something of the town of [inaudible]

44
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.720
where he spent his youth.
Well,
wait a minute.
Did I ask about Dijon?

45
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.990
Do I even know where Dijon is?

46
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.120
Weren't we talking about Theodoric and low thought cloth are and their feud?

47
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.650
How have we gotten into,
first of all,
a story of a saint and second,

48
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.670
a little travel log about Dijon.
So that is Greg,

49
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.700
you've got to like this and I think we are better equipped you,

50
00:03:54.311 --> 00:03:59.311
especially because we're not so linear as we used to be.

51
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:04.270
You know,
magazines used to be,
you know,
just a set of articles and that was it.

52
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.050
And then about 20 years ago they started just breaking up into these

53
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:11.110
miscellaneous things,
little observations.

54
00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:15.670
And here's what's happening in Wichita falls.
But you know,
I don't live there,

55
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.750
but so what,
you know,

56
00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:21.640
food festival in Colorado Springs and um,

57
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.150
uh,
you know,
what about this train trip in New Zealand?
Well,

58
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:27.280
I'm not in New Zealand either.
You know what I mean?

59
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:31.900
This kind of a little offers from all over the place.
Little possibilities,

60
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.690
observations,
wit and wisdom.

61
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.080
This is the experience of modern media.

62
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.650
So I wouldn't say that Gregory has ahead of his time,

63
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.550
but I don't want you to complain to me.
Well,
I mean you can,

64
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.230
but I will not be incredibly sympathetic with Wade.

65
00:04:49.231 --> 00:04:52.420
I don't know where this stops and begins or wait,

66
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.020
are we responsible for theater,
Burt visit versus the uterus?

67
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.660
The answer to that is no.
Okay.
I'm not going to give you a short answer about,
um,

68
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.750
uh,
you know,
uh,

69
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.870
which of these dames is best for your cat or,
uh,

70
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.870
you know,
who our name,
at least five of Clovis has grandchildren.

71
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.420
But the rhythm,
the rhythm of this,
uh,

72
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.030
the um,
uh,

73
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.490
power of these rulers there thuggery or their violence,

74
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.010
uh,
their internet seen violence,

75
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.890
their respect for miracles,

76
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.130
Gregory's sense of God's intervention is very important to grasp.

77
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.680
And we will talk about the actual historical importance of this people that

78
00:05:44.621 --> 00:05:46.780
Gregory chronicles the Franks,

79
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.030
the chief thing about the Franks from Gregory's point of view is that they are

80
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.540
Catholic Christians.
They never,

81
00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:59.960
unlike almost all other of the invaders of the Roman empire,

82
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:02.480
they never go through a period of area aneurysm.

83
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.380
Clovis converts from Paganism to regular Guy Roman Christianity and from Clovis

84
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:12.801
has point of view.

85
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:16.820
That is what is up Keefe importance now from Gregory's point of view,

86
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:19.730
Gregory of tour,

87
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.760
the author is writing in the late sixth century.

88
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.870
So around the same time,
a few decades later perhaps then per copious,

89
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.040
Gregory lived from five 39 to 594 in his time.

90
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.380
There was still a distinction between Romans and barbarians and Gregory,

91
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.950
which very conscious of himself as a Roman.

92
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.820
He was from a distinguished Roman senatorial family.

93
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.330
Note that he uses the word senatorial,

94
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.330
a rank of the Roman empire,

95
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.400
even though the Roman Empire from our point of view certainly hasn't existed for

96
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.050
a hundred years or so.

97
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.270
He notes that 18 bishops of tour,
his see,

98
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.310
uh,
of the 18 bishops of tour,
all but five were related to him.

99
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.360
That shows you that being a bishop was a Roman office,

100
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.800
any elite Roman office even in the barbarian period.

101
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:30.650
And also you'll see that Gregory's behavior shows us that the bishops to some

102
00:07:30.651 --> 00:07:35.651
extent have inherited Roman offices and Roman responsibilities.

103
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.740
They are part of the government and in a sense opposed to the more brutal

104
00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:48.080
aspects of Merovingian Frankish government.

105
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:55.630
Gregory became bishop of tour in five 73 and so he was bishop for 21 years.

106
00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.350
He probably began writing this book,
um,

107
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.340
which is actually just called the book of the histories shortly after his

108
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:08.790
election.
So he's writing the five seventies to early five,

109
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.680
nine days.
He begins book one,

110
00:08:13.681 --> 00:08:17.940
which we haven't read with the story of creation and takes it to the depth of

111
00:08:17.941 --> 00:08:21.600
Saint Martin,
the great patron of tour.

112
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:28.590
And then he begins properly speaking with at least the legendary history of the

113
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:29.850
dynasty of the Frankish kings,

114
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:35.120
but descendants of a certain mirror avec hence Merovingians the name for this

115
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.630
dynasty.
Greg,

116
00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:43.530
we also wrote a number of saint's lives and murder stories.

117
00:08:43.531 --> 00:08:48.531
He was very attached to a Saint Martin at one point in one of those episodes,

118
00:08:50.731 --> 00:08:54.780
not in Murray.
He says,
if you celebrate the feast of Saint Martin faithfully,

119
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:59.100
you will gain the protection of the saintly bishop in this world and the next,

120
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:05.460
and indeed that's very important.
Remember when Clovis,

121
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:11.270
and this is in Murray on page 17 when Clovis decides he's going to attack the

122
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:13.643
Visigoths.

123
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.680
Now he says he's attacking them because he can't stand to have a Ariens

124
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.490
occupying goal.
This is on page 16 then Clovis said to his men,

125
00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:26.910
I take it very badly that these areas hold part of God with God's help.

126
00:09:26.911 --> 00:09:30.090
Let's go and conquered them and bring the land under his authority,

127
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.530
and a soldier seizes,
hey,

128
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.750
from a poor peasant,

129
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:42.750
this is just the way soldiers are.
They need the Hay.
The civilian has the,

130
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:45.360
hey,
they're on the march.
He grabs it.

131
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:50.990
But this peasant is on the lands of Saint Martin of uh,

132
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:55.980
uh,
land,
uh,
belonging to tour.

133
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.730
And the king thug,
though he is,

134
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.760
has issued an order saying the troops were not to take anything except fodder in

135
00:10:05.851 --> 00:10:10.410
water.
And in fact sort of,
hey is fodder nevertheless

136
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:16.740
the king who quicker than it takes to say it had him put to the sword

137
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.040
guy,
you've made a mistake and he's killed.

138
00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:25.570
<v 1>Okay.</v>

139
00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.330
<v 0>And Clovis says of this incident,</v>

140
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:33.130
how shall there be hope of victory if we all offend the blessing,

141
00:10:33.131 --> 00:10:36.940
Martin?
So you've got to take seriously,

142
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.520
if you want to call it superstition,
fine.

143
00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:44.850
But the Frankish rulers are at least amenable to influence from the priests,

144
00:10:46.961 --> 00:10:50.320
bishops,
guardians of the saints.
And notice,

145
00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:52.900
because we're going to come back to this a lot,

146
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:58.720
you're going to see it everywhere in the early Middle Ages Post Roman world,

147
00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.700
the saint is not dead.

148
00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:06.360
It's not like Martin is some just kind of presence the way you know.

149
00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:10.390
Um,
uh,
you know,

150
00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.970
the happy dead who are indifferent to us.

151
00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:17.800
Martin is an angry st or potentially angry.
In fact,

152
00:11:17.801 --> 00:11:22.801
all saints worth anything in the early Middle Ages are very touchy.

153
00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:28.570
If you sees,
hey,
from land belonging to their church,

154
00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:33.310
they'll strike you dead or they will see to it that you die in battle.

155
00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:39.390
And Gregory is indeed full of incidents in which holy figures,

156
00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:45.450
alive or dead have this kind of ability to mobilize supernatural power.

157
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:54.743
<v 1>Okay.</v>

158
00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.750
<v 0>What is his historical model?</v>

159
00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.940
I mean if per copious im in the wars models himself after,

160
00:12:01.941 --> 00:12:06.941
through acidities and if in the secret history he models himself after a

161
00:12:06.951 --> 00:12:11.490
tradition of invective.
What is Gregory's model?
Um,

162
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.220
we don't really know his sources.

163
00:12:13.221 --> 00:12:17.990
One reason why he's so important is that for an awful lot of the history of the

164
00:12:17.991 --> 00:12:18.741
mayor of engines,

165
00:12:18.741 --> 00:12:23.741
he's about all we have and all though disorganized quote,

166
00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:27.110
disorganized from our point of view,
he's very detailed.

167
00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.180
But he does have a model.
And that model is the Bible,

168
00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.730
the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament.

169
00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.480
If you read the Old Testament,

170
00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:41.030
it is as I think I've said before,

171
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:45.500
full of violence and full of miracles.

172
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.850
<v 1>Okay.</v>

173
00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.130
<v 0>And they are sort of jumbled up.</v>

174
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:55.160
The hand of God is very apparent in the Bible and generally speaking,

175
00:12:56.821 --> 00:12:59.610
those who disobey God are punished.

176
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:02.790
<v 1>Okay?</v>

177
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:05.310
<v 0>The same is true in Gregory,</v>

178
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:10.370
although the hand of God is a little more mediated by those holy figures,

179
00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:15.540
saints,
Hermits,
bishops that we just discussed.

180
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.900
There is a little bit more of a priestly power.
But then again,

181
00:13:21.901 --> 00:13:25.890
the Bible has figures like Moses who are able to,
uh,
uh,

182
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.060
Joshua who is able to stop the sun,
um,

183
00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:32.490
priestly figures indeed.

184
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.250
So from Gregory's point of view,

185
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:41.990
there is a continuity between biblical history and the history of his times.

186
00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:48.460
He describes in the prologue to book two is not in Murray that his plan is to

187
00:13:52.011 --> 00:13:57.011
describe the holy deeds of the saints and the way in which whole races of people

188
00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:01.430
were butchered.
Okay.
You got a problem with that.

189
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:06.440
At least.
The second part,
we all know is what history is about.

190
00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.420
It's the first that's a little tough.
The holy deeds of the saints,

191
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.380
and particularly as they're not off on the side,

192
00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:21.520
the popular imagination loves what might be called holy deeds of the saints.

193
00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:28.180
If you look at a gossip magazines of the lower sort or you know,

194
00:14:30.051 --> 00:14:34.040
kind of,
uh,
internet folklore,
um,

195
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:39.230
weird births,
raining frogs,
uh,

196
00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.850
space aliens,

197
00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:46.390
all sorts of supernatural events clog them along with,

198
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:52.730
um,
you know,
stars that is movie or you know,
media stars,

199
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:56.060
gossip.
Uh,
and a little bit of history,

200
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:58.730
a little bit of current events.

201
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.860
This is not so dissimilar in that sense.

202
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:11.230
Gregory is both a historian and a political actor.

203
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:17.320
He does not have either the luxury or the irrelevance of most historians now who

204
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.890
sit comfortably or in my case,

205
00:15:21.891 --> 00:15:24.890
not very comfortably since I'm in an unrenovated office,

206
00:15:24.891 --> 00:15:28.370
but comfortably enough and uh,
you know,

207
00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:31.820
universities and I'm maybe comment on what's going on.
No,

208
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.040
Gregory is very,

209
00:15:34.041 --> 00:15:39.041
very involved with the mirror vingean rulers and he has to display courage.

210
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:46.330
He refuses to surrender fugitives who have sought asylum in his cathedral when

211
00:15:47.031 --> 00:15:49.370
they are demanded by royal officials.

212
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.250
He defends his fellow bishop,

213
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:55.650
probably tech starters who was accused by the king of treason.

214
00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:57.890
You'll be reading about this for next week.

215
00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:03.490
He'll have arguments again in your reading for next week with the king himself.

216
00:16:04.281 --> 00:16:09.281
About the trinity and has to defend himself against the charge of slandering the

217
00:16:11.331 --> 00:16:15.320
king's concubine or really hear the word concubine isn't quite right because

218
00:16:15.321 --> 00:16:18.560
these things are kind of polygamous against one of the kings.

219
00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:23.430
The king's favorite,
Fred [inaudible] and Gregory is,
is tried,
uh,

220
00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:26.810
for defaming her,
uh,
he resists taxes.

221
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.930
He seems to have been a small man.
He suffered ill health,

222
00:16:32.931 --> 00:16:36.260
or at least he took an ignoring and an interest in his own health.

223
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:41.590
He was a great believer in potions made with dust from the relics and tombs of

224
00:16:42.231 --> 00:16:43.064
holy men.

225
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:48.670
A medicine prescribed as Pocito day pull Verey support cray dust from,

226
00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:55.790
uh,
a potion made from [inaudible] dust,

227
00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.680
but it's gotta be at the right kind of people.

228
00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:01.403
<v 1>Okay.</v>

229
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.090
<v 0>What is his attitude towards the Franks?</v>

230
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:07.690
I've said he regards them as thugs and barbarians,

231
00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:14.070
but at the same time he regards them as the people of Israel re born as a race

232
00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.670
favored by God.

233
00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:26.380
The Franks claimed,
or at least their spokespersons,
they're learning.

234
00:17:26.381 --> 00:17:31.381
Spokespersons claimed to be descended from refugees have fallen Troy.

235
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:38.460
Thus like the Romans.
In fact,

236
00:17:38.461 --> 00:17:42.480
we don't really know anything about them until they appear in Roman sources in

237
00:17:42.481 --> 00:17:45.720
the third century.
Uh,

238
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:50.070
we don't know what held them together.
We're back to this problem of genesis.

239
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:54.330
Do they speak a common language?
Do they just travel in a pack together?

240
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:59.490
Do they regard themselves as a people having a common ancestor?

241
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.540
Well,
we don't really know.

242
00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.930
Constantine's father at the end of the third century dealt with them and settled

243
00:18:09.931 --> 00:18:13.600
them in what's now the low countries,
Holland and Belgium,

244
00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:15.630
they were federal rati.

245
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:19.510
Rick you remember means allied armies of the empire.

246
00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:25.740
They served the empire actually fairly loyal in the early fourth century and

247
00:18:26.591 --> 00:18:28.840
maybe came rich doing so

248
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:37.640
we don't really know if the supposed ancestors of Clovis Moravec Avec himself,

249
00:18:38.281 --> 00:18:40.890
for example,
were real or legendary.

250
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:46.290
Supposedly MORAVEC is Clovis.
His grandfather,
we don't know if he existed,

251
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.650
but we do know something about his father.
She'll Parak.

252
00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:58.240
Oh,
well it's a chocolates day.
So the guy's name is kill Peric,
c.

253
00:18:58.241 --> 00:19:00.340
H.
I.
L.
P.
E.
R.
I.
C.

254
00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:06.120
We know about him because his grave was dug up in the 17th century.

255
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:11.410
Uh,
unfortunately all the stuff that was in his grave,

256
00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.290
most of it was stolen in 1831,

257
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:20.290
but drawings had been made before that and may show,

258
00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:21.693
um,

259
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:27.670
that he owned or was buried with a cloak embroidered with Cicadas,

260
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:31.990
a crystal globe of gold bracelet,

261
00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.830
a Frankish amulet.
Ah,
his,

262
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:41.070
what we assume it's his horses head was buried with him and it was covered with

263
00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:42.310
precious metal.

264
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:48.970
He was also buried with a hundred gold coins and 200 silver ones and a signet

265
00:19:48.971 --> 00:19:49.630
ring,

266
00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:54.630
but it shows him with long hair and the ring is inscribed in case we wondered

267
00:19:55.121 --> 00:19:59.770
who this was.
King Chill Parak the long hair is important.

268
00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:04.830
It is a symbol of the power of these rulers in is a kind of dynastic charisma.

269
00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:12.120
And indeed one of the best books about these rulers by the English history and

270
00:20:12.491 --> 00:20:14.980
English historian is called long haired kings.

271
00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:22.030
What does all this stuff,
the stuff that's buried with him,

272
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:26.860
a lot of it comes from Byzantium.
A lot of this would have been,

273
00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.850
uh,
bribes or,
um,

274
00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:35.910
goodwill gestures by the emperor interested in,

275
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:38.350
uh,

276
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:42.970
keeping some nominal loyalty on the part of the barbarian tribes,

277
00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.930
uh,
in the collapse of the western.

278
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:50.260
<v 1>Okay.</v>

279
00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:55.260
<v 0>Clovis succeeded chill Parak his father as the head of this federated tribe of</v>

280
00:20:56.771 --> 00:20:58.630
now a nonexistent empire.

281
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:06.480
All the remains of the empire is a Roman commander.

282
00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:12.040
Remember we mentioned in,
uh,
the life of,
um,

283
00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:17.770
of Saint Antonio lists of Nora come that uh,

284
00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:22.540
uh,
an emissary was sent from a Roman army to try to get paid and discovered that

285
00:21:22.541 --> 00:21:27.220
the empire no longer existed,
that there was nobody to pay them a Cya,

286
00:21:27.221 --> 00:21:31.690
angry s s y a g r I u s is a little bit like this.

287
00:21:31.691 --> 00:21:35.980
He's a general in northern goal of the Roman Empire.

288
00:21:35.981 --> 00:21:38.170
And now the Roman empire ceases to exist.

289
00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:43.000
He's on his own and he is a rifle for Clovis.

290
00:21:43.001 --> 00:21:47.690
And one of the first targets of his expansion,
uh,

291
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:51.460
Gregory calls him king of the Romans.
What does that mean?

292
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:57.680
Rumsey didn't have kings.
Oh,
we don't really know what title he used.

293
00:21:57.681 --> 00:22:00.350
We have no documents from him,
no coins,

294
00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:06.050
probably Byzantium the eastern Roman Empire didn't like him and probably they

295
00:22:06.051 --> 00:22:09.260
supported Clovis.
At any rate,
uh,

296
00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:14.390
he was killed in four 86 and Clovis,

297
00:22:14.391 --> 00:22:19.391
his next target of expansion was the Visigoths those areas that Gregory tells us

298
00:22:19.701 --> 00:22:24.350
about in the passage that I mentioned to you,
uh,
just a little while ago,

299
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.550
what kind of personality does Clovis have?

300
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:35.770
Have we met his tight before?
Is there any difference?
Anybody

301
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:38.440
have a sense of him?

302
00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.280
How does he strike you?
Just another,

303
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.880
another one of these characters of the early Middle Ages or is there something

304
00:22:48.881 --> 00:22:49.714
unusual?

305
00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:54.860
<v 1>We're going to miss fame.</v>

306
00:22:55.990 --> 00:23:00.040
<v 0>He kills off everybody.
Including his family members.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

307
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:04.150
This is unfortunately not unusual.
And,
and why

308
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.400
<v 1>it doesn't want any family member.</v>

309
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:14.010
<v 0>Yeah.
Wouldn't you think he'd be dynastically?
Uh,
um,</v>

310
00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.630
conscious,
uh,
Constantia is the emperor in the fourth century did the same thing.

311
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:19.470
Uh,

312
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:23.790
only his nephew's Dallas and Julian survived and indeed Julian defeated him.

313
00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:26.743
MMM.

314
00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:37.080
Is He then just a,
uh,
I mean,
uh,

315
00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:42.890
is he then just the same kind of a violent character or randomly violin?

316
00:23:44.011 --> 00:23:47.390
Carrie,
is there a plan besides expansion,

317
00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.830
at least in Gregory's portrayal?

318
00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.660
<v 1>Sorry.
Christianity forcing.</v>

319
00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:06.100
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
He is Christian Christianity.</v>

320
00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.410
He doesn't force conversion,
but a,

321
00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:12.310
he himself converts and his men with him.

322
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:18.750
We know his piety even before the conversion because of this incident with the

323
00:24:19.341 --> 00:24:22.600
silver liturgical bowl or you were

324
00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:33.530
right on page 27,
I am page seven and eight and two 27

325
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:37.303
<v 1>stories.</v>

326
00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:43.140
<v 0>The story seems dubious.
Um,
the story being that,</v>

327
00:24:43.141 --> 00:24:46.890
uh,
uh,
they plundered this church,

328
00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:52.170
um,
the church up around us,
they are,
uh,
the Bishop,

329
00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.950
uh,
asks Clovis for this,

330
00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:59.580
a silver bowl to be returned.

331
00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.310
Clovis says he's got a consult his men,

332
00:25:02.311 --> 00:25:06.800
because they have a kind of booty split hand muster.

333
00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:12.320
Notice that this shows a certain leader follower relationship rather than

334
00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.840
absolute ruler follower relationship.

335
00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:22.400
Clovis says to his men,
something on the order of me,

336
00:25:22.401 --> 00:25:27.320
Hardy's,
uh,
or uh,
my good men you harvest.
Maybe he's a little too pirate,

337
00:25:27.321 --> 00:25:31.070
like,
uh,
so he begins.

338
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:36.880
So I want that you were to return it to the church in addition to my share of

339
00:25:36.981 --> 00:25:41.750
half.
And one soldier says,
no,

340
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.620
you get half of that.
Just like everything else takes out his acts.

341
00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:50.650
One of the important weapons of the Franks and splits the silver thing in half.

342
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:56.340
And Clovis doesn't do anything immediately.
You know,

343
00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:00.830
later muster,
he says to the guy,
recognizing him,
you know,
your,

344
00:26:00.831 --> 00:26:02.750
your kit is a mess.
Your Shield,

345
00:26:02.751 --> 00:26:07.070
you call that a shield and he knocked something down and as the guy picks it up,

346
00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:11.990
Clovis takes up his own acts and splits the guy's head saying as he does.

347
00:26:11.991 --> 00:26:16.490
So Gus,
you did to my car or my basin in Swa song.

348
00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:17.500
Yeah.

349
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:22.500
Do be a story but interesting because it shows both the power of the ruler and

350
00:26:25.161 --> 00:26:30.161
some limitations as well as his type of piety power.

351
00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:37.150
Uh,
actually,
um,
you know,
the,

352
00:26:37.151 --> 00:26:40.150
the president of the United States actually does it.
The power to kill people.

353
00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:42.020
We've seen it in action,
um,

354
00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:47.280
though a distance and under certain very special circumstances,

355
00:26:47.281 --> 00:26:49.560
but basically,
um,

356
00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:53.550
it takes a certain kind of ruler to be able to kill someone outright like that.

357
00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:55.980
It still happens.
But you know,

358
00:26:55.981 --> 00:27:00.060
we're talking about people like Kadafi or deaths,
pots.

359
00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.430
So certainly as with um,

360
00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:10.340
killing the guy who stole the Hay from Saint Martins land,
Clovis is,

361
00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:11.623
uh,

362
00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:17.170
following a certain set of leadership tips that basically amounts to winning by

363
00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.570
maximum intimidation.
I think it's fair to say,

364
00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:27.250
but he's got to do this in a careful way because his followers are very

365
00:27:28.761 --> 00:27:31.190
important.
They are powerful.

366
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:36.310
He does depend on them and he's got to give at least the impression of being the

367
00:27:36.711 --> 00:27:41.711
leader of a band and not the kind of ruler of a state that we might be more

368
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:43.783
familiar with.

369
00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:46.500
<v 1>Okay.</v>

370
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.150
<v 0>Leadership is personal,</v>

371
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:55.880
but there is a kind of tribal sense or tribal sense of democracy.

372
00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:00.180
The other thing about this story of course,
is once again,

373
00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:05.690
the controversy is over piety towards things of the church.

374
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.590
Even before Clovis has,
at least according to Gregory,
officially converted.

375
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:12.110
<v 1>Okay.</v>

376
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:17.110
<v 0>It's not that you should be nice to the church because it's good to be a nice</v>

377
00:28:17.151 --> 00:28:17.984
person.

378
00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:22.760
It's that you've got to be nice to the church because the church is in command

379
00:28:22.761 --> 00:28:27.740
of supernatural weapons that will overcome the weapons of this world,

380
00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:32.870
the supernatural interpenetrates,

381
00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:39.010
the physical or historical at every point in Gregory's narrative.

382
00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:44.530
So the overwhelming fact for Gregory's I said before is that he is Orthodox or

383
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:49.340
Catholic,
I.
E not area.

384
00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:51.790
<v 1>Okay.</v>

385
00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:55.630
<v 0>Clovis is in Gregory's eyes.
The new Constantine,</v>

386
00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:02.910
someone who has miraculously been turned thuggish though he is,

387
00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:07.560
and Constantine was as well
to,
uh,

388
00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:11.230
advance God's work.
Of course,

389
00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.620
Gregory regards him as a barbarian and he shows him as a barbarian.

390
00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:17.350
He portrays him honestly,

391
00:29:17.351 --> 00:29:22.270
or at least unflatteringly as was said,
he murdered his family.

392
00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:27.580
And then moreover,
if you remember on pages 19 and 20,

393
00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:32.830
he pretends to be really sorry that he can't find anybody that he's related to.

394
00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:38.300
He's he always searching,
uh,
find my family.com or,
uh,

395
00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:43.250
you know,
genealogy or a high school classmates,
uh,

396
00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:47.440
anybody who could be his friend,

397
00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.110
but in fact,
um,

398
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:55.663
<v 1>uh,</v>

399
00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.890
<v 0>uh,
he is,
um,</v>

400
00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:07.010
just circling them out to Kelvin and he's got all sorts of tricks to kill his

401
00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.540
relatives.
Nevertheless,

402
00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:13.570
in the same chapter that describes his trick on,

403
00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:16.080
uh,
uh,

404
00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:21.370
Clo Dereck Gregory tells us,

405
00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.630
having inquired the kingdom of city to,
and it's treasury,

406
00:30:24.631 --> 00:30:28.440
he also received those people under his dominion for daily.

407
00:30:28.441 --> 00:30:32.130
The Lord laid his enemies low under his hand and increased his kingdom because

408
00:30:32.131 --> 00:30:35.790
he walked before him with an upright heart and did what was pleasing in his

409
00:30:35.791 --> 00:30:39.860
sight.
Right.

410
00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:41.750
This is just after Clovis,

411
00:30:41.751 --> 00:30:45.650
after the death of CG Burt calls all the people together

412
00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.950
says,
I don't know what happened.
Uh,
but,
uh,

413
00:30:50.951 --> 00:30:54.690
the sons of [inaudible] seems to have died as they were showing my invoices.

414
00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:59.410
Treasure a here's my proposal,
make me king.
And they say,

415
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:03.610
oh,
okay,
great.
Yeah.
Um,

416
00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.630
step on the shield and a will lift you up just like the Roman emperors.

417
00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:09.163
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

418
00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:14.580
<v 0>It's Gregory a comedian
or is he saying,</v>

419
00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:19.050
and I think this is more likely,
although he is hilarious to read.
I mean,

420
00:31:19.051 --> 00:31:20.970
I hope he's amused you.

421
00:31:20.971 --> 00:31:25.020
I hope while you were cursing me for giving you this assignment or at least

422
00:31:25.021 --> 00:31:29.200
praying to some saints to strike me a dumb or uh,

423
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:31.970
to erupt and boils or,
um,

424
00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:35.430
probably not anything very strong like,
um,

425
00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:39.120
you'll notice that occasionally people,

426
00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:44.310
people lose their intestines when they go to the bathroom.
Uh,
probably not,
uh,

427
00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:47.360
the,
the heretic areas for example.
Um,

428
00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:51.990
and others who betray the saints.
Anyway,

429
00:31:51.991 --> 00:31:55.950
whatever curses you were,
um,
uh,
summoning up to me.

430
00:31:55.951 --> 00:31:59.910
I hope you actually,
uh,
found this a fun,

431
00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:04.730
this of course is fun as I think I told you way back in,
uh,

432
00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:10.050
the beginning of September.
So,

433
00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:13.080
um,
what was the part from the fun angle?

434
00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:18.650
The people are instruments of the Lord and they walk in the sight of the Lord

435
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:22.380
even if they are not themselves.
Good people.

436
00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:30.030
The Lord makes use of instruments of people who are forceful.

437
00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:33.160
It's important to be forceful.

438
00:32:33.161 --> 00:32:38.161
If Clovis was a nice guy and we'll see and have already seen some examples of

439
00:32:38.261 --> 00:32:42.080
rulers who nice,
often intellectual and ineffectual.

440
00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:47.380
Gregory prefers effectual with some violent touches to ineffective school

441
00:32:48.441 --> 00:32:53.441
because being a ruler is a hard job and a barbarian world in a fallen world,

442
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:58.640
Gregory in the census like Augusta,
the world is fallen.
The world is corrupt.

443
00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:03.260
There are no good people in power,

444
00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:05.210
and if they are in power,

445
00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:09.980
it is either unusual or they're not going to be in power for long.
Therefore,

446
00:33:09.981 --> 00:33:11.780
it is important to be violent.

447
00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:14.450
It is important to be able to intimidate your troops.

448
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:19.630
It is important to seek out those who would oppose you and if they've got to be

449
00:33:21.441 --> 00:33:24.110
killed,
they've got to be killed.

450
00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:31.970
The reason for this is that the work of the Lord has to be advanced according to

451
00:33:32.581 --> 00:33:35.070
Gregory and the church has to be protected.

452
00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.480
For Gregory is

453
00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:45.780
exemplifying what I said would happen as predicted by Saint Augustine.

454
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:49.200
The empire might cease,
but the church would not.

455
00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:54.870
The Church would deal with whatever successors came up.
B,

456
00:33:54.871 --> 00:33:59.871
they Arian or preferably not be they cultivated or more likely barbarian,

457
00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:06.180
and as barbarian leaders go,

458
00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:10.440
Clovis and his sons were not so bad.

459
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:14.783
<v 1>Okay.</v>

460
00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:20.370
<v 0>We're not really sure how Clovis converted because Gregory is invested in a</v>

461
00:34:21.491 --> 00:34:24.760
story that likens Clovis to Constantine.

462
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.830
We have the same kind of thing,
uh,
before a battle.

463
00:34:30.490 --> 00:34:35.020
He,
uh,
makes a deal with God that if he wins the battle,
he will convert.

464
00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:36.423
Um,

465
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.800
we don't really know if he was converted before this battle and four 94 as

466
00:34:41.801 --> 00:34:46.330
Gregory reports or maybe in a battle against the Visigoths and five oh six,

467
00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:50.290
but it doesn't really,
uh,
uh,
it doesn't really matter.

468
00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:54.220
It's very important that the Ariens be defeated.

469
00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:58.710
He's got a story that's not in,
uh,
Marie,
uh,

470
00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:03.780
in a book to chapter 23 in which an Aerion bishop named Crayola,

471
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:09.730
y,
O l I,
Crayola,
Crayola,

472
00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:14.760
crayola creole law is angry because he sees the Catholic bishops performing

473
00:35:16.451 --> 00:35:17.800
miracles all over the place.

474
00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:22.950
So he pays a guy to pretend to be blind and then to greet him as he comes to

475
00:35:25.211 --> 00:35:28.900
church and beg him to heal his site and then to say,

476
00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:33.860
oh my gosh,
I've been healed.
My,
I can say,
uh,

477
00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:38.050
but God punishes this by,
uh,

478
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:41.640
making him actually blind at this point.

479
00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:45.000
And then the guy very helpfully from the Catholic point of view said,
oh,

480
00:35:45.001 --> 00:35:46.230
I wasn't blind.

481
00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:50.880
This evil bishop crayola bribed me in order to pretend to be blind.

482
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.540
But now God in his saints,
Saint Martin in particular,
have punished me,
uh,

483
00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:56.480
and um,

484
00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:01.200
so that it takes a Catholic bishop to heal him back to site.

485
00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:06.030
So this is Gregory's attitudes towards the areas.
On the other hand,

486
00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:11.090
he does report that this Frank's besieged Sarah Gosa.

487
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:16.440
This is a on pages 41 42,
the Spanish city of Sarah goes,

488
00:36:16.441 --> 00:36:20.070
so they've gotten that far in their attacks on the Visigoths,

489
00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:26.160
but the Ariens,
we're able to,
uh,
fight them off.

490
00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:31.580
They circled the walls carrying the tunic of Saint Vincent and singing songs

491
00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:36.700
with the women dressed in black.

492
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:40.650
Their hair covered with their hair hanging loose,
covered in ashes,

493
00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:42.000
lamented

494
00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:46.260
seeing the situation for you to Bert returned.

495
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:51.510
He gave up the siege.
The Aryans may be heretics,

496
00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.240
but they've got the tunic of Saint Vincent.

497
00:36:55.620 --> 00:37:00.620
And the power of that relic is so great that even in the hands of Ms Grants,

498
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:06.780
it's not to be opposed to St Vincent,

499
00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:12.160
a very important St uh,
um,
and the patron of Sara Khosa.

500
00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.730
So the Aryans are fakes,

501
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:18.570
but they are not completely without spiritual power either.

502
00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:23.620
And this is a kind of universe in which there are natural and supernatural

503
00:37:25.441 --> 00:37:30.441
forces and it's not the one trumps the other exactly,

504
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.810
but that they both have to be taken into account.

505
00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:43.340
So Clovis consolidates a large kingdom in,
uh,

506
00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:48.070
most of what would become France,
Roman gall,

507
00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:52.180
medieval France,
France named after this group.
The Franks,

508
00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:58.050
the Visigoths now were pushed out into Spain and uh,

509
00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:01.540
um,
just that part of France bordering on Spain.

510
00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:08.910
Clovis received the favor of the church because he was Catholic.

511
00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:14.460
His conversion,

512
00:38:14.461 --> 00:38:19.461
let's say around 500 is 90 years before the Visigoths become Catholic.

513
00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:26.660
And this aids him greatly because the church is in possession of learned people,

514
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:34.110
financial resources and spiritual power.

515
00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:40.030
So we
followed the Franks and we will follow them up through Charlemagne and his

516
00:38:40.031 --> 00:38:44.740
successors because they are successful

517
00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:50.120
and because their own self consciousness is as uh,

518
00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:54.400
the rightful rulers of the former western empire.

519
00:38:54.401 --> 00:38:59.080
A claim that in various generations is more or less of a reality

520
00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.380
and that is by no means inevitable,

521
00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:08.080
but is something that they will eventually make good on for the time being.

522
00:39:08.081 --> 00:39:13.081
Clovis considers himself a representative of the Byzantine Empire,

523
00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:17.650
but a representative who very conveniently doesn't have and to do anything,

524
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:22.120
the Byzantine Emperor sends him the title of Console.

525
00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:27.390
He's very pleased at this,
but it doesn't,
yeah,

526
00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.010
it doesn't a bind him really.

527
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:31.263
<v 1>Okay.</v>

528
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:37.680
<v 0>So much for Clovis.
Establishment of Frankish had Gemini,</v>

529
00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.370
the prominence of the Franks in the post Roman west,

530
00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:46.340
the first Catholic people among the,
uh,

531
00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:47.520
barbarian invaders.

532
00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:51.810
Now we turn briefly to his sons.

533
00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:57.540
He divided his kingdom equally and you have a map in the back,

534
00:39:57.541 --> 00:40:01.320
but it shows the division of the realm under Clovis,

535
00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:05.700
his sons Clo,
Thar shoulder bird,

536
00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:07.560
clo dumber,
and Theo Dereck.

537
00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:09.560
<v 1>Okay.</v>

538
00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:12.170
<v 0>This practice of division is dangerous.</v>

539
00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:17.200
It is usually a better idea to give it to one son because then you don't divide

540
00:40:21.141 --> 00:40:23.420
the kingdom.
On the other hand,

541
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:28.750
if you have four sons who are all militarily competent,

542
00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:32.750
uh,
they're gonna fight with each other.
And in fact they fight with each other.

543
00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:36.890
As Gregory describes in book three,
even though they've been given divisions,

544
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:41.610
the violence of Clovis,

545
00:40:41.611 --> 00:40:45.690
his sons is crude and even ludicrous.

546
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:51.320
So,
um,
for example,

547
00:40:51.321 --> 00:40:56.321
this awful incident of closed immers sons being protected by Clovis is Queen Clo

548
00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:03.830
Tilda and her sons,
the boys,

549
00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:08.920
uncles cloth are and Theodoric invite the boys to come for a visit.

550
00:41:09.171 --> 00:41:14.171
And Clotilde though who seems rather credulous says great idea once they are in

551
00:41:15.051 --> 00:41:20.051
the power of these two brothers who of course like Clovis want to kill their

552
00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:22.850
relative,
particularly their younger relatives,

553
00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:28.910
they send a sword and a pair of scissors,
right?

554
00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.680
Which will it be?

555
00:41:30.681 --> 00:41:35.270
The Messenger asks the queen cut off their hair or kill them,

556
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:40.160
cutting off their hair will symbolize that they're no longer eligible for

557
00:41:40.161 --> 00:41:40.820
rulership.

558
00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:44.180
And it may lead to them being put away in a monastery or something like that.

559
00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:48.710
But they're taking early retirement there,
12,

560
00:41:48.711 --> 00:41:53.420
14 years old,
but they've had an,
and Khloe Tilda is so angry,

561
00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:57.930
at least according to Gregory that she says she'd rather see them die and then

562
00:41:57.931 --> 00:42:02.120
may killed them.
They killed them in this ludicrous way because,
um,

563
00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.830
uh,
one of them,

564
00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:08.000
it gets cold feet and the other is furious and takes up the sword and just kills

565
00:42:08.001 --> 00:42:12.980
them even though they're begging.
And I mean,
it's,
it's a rather gruesome scene.

566
00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:18.560
Meanwhile,
in a scene that we haven't got in Murray's edition,

567
00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:23.750
um,
for you to,
Rick attempts to kill Clo Tarr.
He invites him.

568
00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:29.940
Uh,
but he's got,
and he's got men waiting to ambush him,
but the,

569
00:42:29.941 --> 00:42:34.340
the,
the cloth isn't low enough down.
They're sort of behind a partition,

570
00:42:34.341 --> 00:42:37.340
a cloth partition,
but cloth are,
can see their feet.

571
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:40.610
And so he kind of turns back,
uh,

572
00:42:40.611 --> 00:42:45.560
and starts to walk out of the hall and then for you to,
Bert says,

573
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:48.890
no,
no,
no,
I just invited you to give you a gift.
And he gives him a silver,

574
00:42:48.891 --> 00:42:53.420
you know,
goblet or something like that.
So cloth are escapes from this,

575
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:58.010
but a theater bird is so angry at having been tricked that he then sends a

576
00:42:58.011 --> 00:43:00.770
messenger saying it was a mistake and to give back the goblet.

577
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:03.650
So I mean these guys,
um,

578
00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:09.280
what can I say yet beneath the barbarian acts is a society that is still being

579
00:43:16.551 --> 00:43:18.800
governed fairly closely.

580
00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:23.600
There is a fairly sophisticated administration still.
There's a gold coin edge,

581
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:26.030
which takes a lot of resources to maintain.

582
00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:31.940
These rulers are collecting taxes and they are collecting taxes according to

583
00:43:31.941 --> 00:43:33.500
written records.

584
00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:37.290
There's public land,

585
00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:40.920
there's revenue from land belonging to the king.

586
00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:47.420
The kings are reasonably conscientious about the appointment of bishops.

587
00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

588
00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:55.000
<v 0>What is Gregory's attitude towards these sons of Clovis?</v>

589
00:43:56.230 --> 00:44:00.850
He certainly portrays them as uh,
fratricidal.

590
00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.130
Nevertheless,
on page 26,

591
00:44:05.131 --> 00:44:10.131
he tells us that the brothers were endowed with great courage and had

592
00:44:10.231 --> 00:44:13.800
considerable military resources.
Once again,

593
00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:16.020
their power

594
00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:21.090
is directed more for good and then for bad.

595
00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:25.230
And a lot of their power for bad is merely directed at each other.

596
00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:28.623
<v 1>Okay.</v>

597
00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:32.940
<v 0>He considers them,
in other words,
appropriate for savage times.</v>

598
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:43.420
At one point,
uh,

599
00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:46.920
two of the brothers make war against a third,
specifically children,

600
00:44:46.921 --> 00:44:50.160
Burton theater,
rec against clothes.
Our clothes are,

601
00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:54.520
is the guy who was just been depicted by Gregory as the tough one,

602
00:44:54.521 --> 00:44:56.950
the one who killed the two nephews

603
00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:00.493
<v 1>and yet</v>

604
00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:07.300
<v 0>not,
oh,
he was also an adulterer and yet faced with his brothers armies,</v>

605
00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:10.840
he prays to God and his mother,

606
00:45:10.841 --> 00:45:14.050
Queen Clo tilled up praise to Saint Martin.

607
00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:20.520
So powerful are these prayers that the two brothers are unsuccessful,

608
00:45:21.791 --> 00:45:25.330
a hailstorm,
pelts,
their troops,

609
00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:29.980
spares cloth are and cloth are,
is victorious.

610
00:45:29.981 --> 00:45:32.710
The brothers do not succeed in dislodging them

611
00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:40.200
here then we have the power of the mayor of Indians and the limitations on that

612
00:45:41.861 --> 00:45:45.850
power.
The limitations are partly military,

613
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:50.020
partly that have fratricidal intrigue of people getting killed,

614
00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:53.440
but they're also partly supernatural.

615
00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:59.890
And as you read further into the grandsons of Clovis,

616
00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:02.860
people whom Gregory himself has dealings with,

617
00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:07.180
particularly the way word,
uh,
chill Parak,

618
00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:13.020
you'll see rulers that Gregory considers to be evil and rulers who are really

619
00:46:13.781 --> 00:46:16.150
falling away from the example.

620
00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:21.700
But what interests us in our readings for next week is the nature of this

621
00:46:21.701 --> 00:46:26.080
society.
What's holding it together?
If it's rulers are so violent,

622
00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:28.390
why isn't it not?

623
00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:33.520
Why is it not just falling apart into fragments and shattering?

624
00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:38.820
How could this dynasty rule over a polity for,

625
00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:44.620
um,
something on the order of 250 years?

626
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:51.890
Oh,
have fun with the papers.
Have Fun with Gregory and we'll talk next week.

627
00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:52.480
Thanks.
