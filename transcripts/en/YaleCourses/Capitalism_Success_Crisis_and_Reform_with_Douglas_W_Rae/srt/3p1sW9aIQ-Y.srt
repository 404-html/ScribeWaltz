1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,940
Since we are still in the shopping period.

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,470
And, uh, some turnover.

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,560
I thought it might be good if I
spent the first three or four minutes

4
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:17,350
recapitulating from meeting one.
Uh,

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,340
and then a little more on meeting too.

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,030
And then we'll feather
that into today's topic,

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,200
which is,
uh,

8
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,270
the great work of economics and the great
and most greatest and most thoughtful,

9
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,890
a normative tracked about
markets and capitalism.

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,270
I will, uh, I'll begin,

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,940
as I said with the recapitulation,

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,780
then we'll talk about some basic
components of Smith's argument.

13
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,310
Uh,
then we'll,

14
00:00:56,311 --> 00:01:00,840
I'll turn the slides off for a while
and we will talk informally and I'll

15
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:05,841
include a Jim Alexander in
the conversation about the
way Smith and Smith Ism,

16
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,350
uh,

17
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,350
plays out in today's world and how
it contradicts in many respects.

18
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,210
Uh, what the great man
actually said and meant to say.

19
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,700
Okay. Before meeting to meeting one
meeting, one really just said this,

20
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,630
that the enormous surge in human wealth
over the past 250 years has a great deal

21
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:42,720
to do with capital,

22
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,460
with the intelligent use of
accumulated wealth in fresh production.

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,560
That capitalism is a subset of
the ways you can use capital.

24
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,440
Even socialism uses capital, uh, even,

25
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,770
uh, fascism uses capital, uh,

26
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,940
even squirrels and spiders in
some sense or another use capital.

27
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,720
But capitalism is the subspecies where
wealth accumulated is deployed so as to

28
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,780
create new wealth and to do so
in a competitive environment.

29
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,440
And that second,
second piece,

30
00:02:31,441 --> 00:02:36,441
capitalism was not invented by
some smart guy like Adam Smith,

31
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:42,230
but rather evolved organically by
trial and error by experimentation,

32
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,520
uh, by failure. Uh, indeed,

33
00:02:47,521 --> 00:02:49,050
if you look at a market society,

34
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:54,051
one of its great features is that
it's history is littered with failure

35
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,680
and learning to uh,

36
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,950
two analyze past success and past
failure becomes a key part of it.

37
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,680
That's the one last point.
And the is a mitten.

38
00:03:10,681 --> 00:03:15,681
Capitalism is not something which
originally was invented by its friends,

39
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,380
but rather by its enemies.
Uh,

40
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,450
it was Marxism and other,
uh,

41
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:28,510
left wing movements in the
early and middle 19th century
when the writer Rick of

42
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:34,320
capitalism appeared indeed the
word had no appearance, whatever.

43
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,630
Uh,
before that era

44
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,310
in meeting two,

45
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,910
we looked at the kinetic kinetic
structure of the world economy,

46
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,270
uh, with this Hans Rolling, uh,

47
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,960
diagram animated I,
it's still today,

48
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,560
but animated so that life expectancy
and a income per capita could be seen

49
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,550
moving dynamically across years. And, uh,

50
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,620
we discovered that the typical story
is a surge north in the diagram

51
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:26,190
representing increased life expectancy
with slow progress in income per capita,

52
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,370
and then a surge around the,
around the horn, so to speak,

53
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,900
into the area,

54
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,960
upper right of long lives
and relative affluence.

55
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,520
And I asserted,

56
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:47,521
and many of you agreed that there's
something unambiguously good about that

57
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:48,784
change,

58
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,230
that the world is a better place
because that change happened.

59
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,540
Now, I didn't in the, in
the, in the lecture, uh,

60
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,200
lay any great stress on the caveats
that people might attached to that.

61
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,920
One of them is that it was accomplished
in considerable measure through capital

62
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:12,740
intensive, uh, industry, uh,

63
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,990
and Hiogly in capital intensive
forms of transportation.

64
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,580
And that these were,
uh,

65
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,770
first of all disruptive of
the natural environment.

66
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,650
There could be no doubt,
whatever,

67
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,690
that the revolution in the world economy,

68
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,700
uh, left the planet more
fragile than it found it. Uh,

69
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,880
indeed,
uh,

70
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,120
poverty is a marvelous
environmental policy

71
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,670
because where there is no demand,
there is very little disruption.

72
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,213
Now

73
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,920
we also looked at the world
demographic transition,

74
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,830
the world demographic transition
representing changes in rates of birth and

75
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:04,664
death,

76
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,880
death here in purple and birth in
green and the old Malthusian world,

77
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,240
uh,

78
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,070
which still exists on parts of the globe
but hasn't existed in the Western world

79
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:24,071
for a couple of hundred years was
characterized by very high birth rates and

80
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:25,580
very high death rates.

81
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:31,390
So you have essentially static total
population and very few people live to be

82
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:32,774
old.

83
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:33,840
Yeah.

84
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,840
Then you have the change in the death
rate occasion by infrastructure,

85
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,630
most of all related to clean water.

86
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,410
And when the death rate falls,
the birth rate doesn't track with it.

87
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:53,450
The birth rate lags in its change.
So there is a period,

88
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:58,451
phase two here when deaths are falling
sharply and births are statically high

89
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:05,690
and in that period you get any normous
surge you get indeed population growth.

90
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,960
At an increasing rate.
So you get,

91
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,720
you get the spike,

92
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,810
which brought world population to its
present level is occasion largely by phase

93
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:19,934
two.

94
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,560
Phase three

95
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,680
is the period during which the birth
rate adjusts to the death rate and you

96
00:07:31,681 --> 00:07:35,220
still get growing population.
But now at a diminishing rate

97
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,610
and at stage four,

98
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:43,670
there's an equilibrium between births
and deaths and both have lower rate.

99
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:49,260
So population is again,
static,

100
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,920
uh,
and lives are much longer.

101
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:55,010
Okay.

102
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:59,060
Underneath that,
underneath that process,

103
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:02,270
and this I merely hinted
at in meeting two,

104
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,290
is a surge in the supply of labor,

105
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:12,490
which occurs in stages two and three and
create a buyer's market for employers.

106
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,550
And by creating a buyer
buyer's market for employers,

107
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,740
it drives down wages.
Real wages are really quite low.

108
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,240
Uh, during Stage two and stage
three in the history of a country,

109
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,150
uh,
and capitol,

110
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,260
which is only in part
related to demography,

111
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,480
it has an independent life of its own,

112
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:44,290
but capitol begins to appreciate and be
agglomerated in large quantities only

113
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:47,030
late in this history.

114
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,990
So the places where you get huge buildup
of capital are typically places which

115
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,740
beginning or well into stage four.

116
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,390
And if you want to be precise about it,
there is a stage five,

117
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,400
which is where the birth rate has
actually fallen below the death rate.

118
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,230
So that as with Japan, Italy,
Russia, and much of eastern Europe,

119
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,170
you have falling total population.

120
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,390
Now there's another aspect of this
that we'll pick up a month from now,

121
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,290
which has to do with the age
profile of the existing population.

122
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,390
And you can ask yourself what percentage
of all the people in a country are of

123
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:31,224
working age.

124
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,810
And you can figure from that
a so called dependency ratio.

125
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,150
How many people too old to work and too
young to work have to be supported by

126
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:44,880
those who can work,
who are of working age.

127
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:51,170
And that ratio turns out to be a
big determinant of economic growth.

128
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:57,450
Where as with China,
a China today,

129
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,610
Ireland in the very recent past,

130
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,240
you have a demographic sweet spot where
there are relatively few old and young

131
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:10,320
people and almost everybody is
in the working years. Uh, it's,

132
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,090
that's a,
that's a really a low resistance profile.

133
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,240
And then at the other side,

134
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:22,260
the Japanese were the number of elderly
people who need to be supported,

135
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,690
uh, is out of proportion to the
size of the actual workforce

136
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,800
beneath beneath this,
uh,

137
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:39,560
these curves related to capital and labor,
uh,

138
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,840
are, uh, just a few other
things you want to think about.

139
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:47,841
One is that you get much higher incomes
in phase four than in earlier phases.

140
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,590
And it's partly because of
capital concentration, uh,

141
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:55,980
but it's also because human capital,

142
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,760
human capital in the form of
trained ability educated people,

143
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,510
uh,

144
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:08,510
because it becomes much easier to
build a massive educational apparatus,

145
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,860
a formula apparatus,

146
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:16,070
and also an applied apparatus
in the workforce where in
40 years of working in a

147
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:20,460
given trade,
people get really good at it.

148
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,460
So that,
uh,

149
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,360
that's another way in which the later
stages of the world demographic transition

150
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,810
are profitable, quite
literally to a country. Uh,

151
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,860
any quality tends to be highest in the
emerging markets because typically what

152
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:44,991
you get is a mass of very poor
people and a relatively small elite,

153
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:50,010
which has found its way
into capitalist development.

154
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:55,210
Uh, labor, abundant capital scarce,

155
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:56,320
we talked about that.

156
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,513
Uh,

157
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,750
insourcing and outsourcing.
This is a very obvious point.

158
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:10,110
Stage four countries outsource tasks
to stage two and three countries,

159
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,950
uh, because labor is much cheaper. I,

160
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:18,100
and um,
and the,

161
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:20,860
the adverse of that is
insourcing at the other end.

162
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,320
And the main movement in Stage two and
three countries actually has two parts.

163
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:31,321
One is from countryside to city because
the opportunities of capital intensive

164
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:38,401
enterprise are concentrated in cities
and from an out of stage two and three

165
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:42,700
countries into stage four countries.

166
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,480
And this is a classic pattern
which is highly visible today with,

167
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:49,580
uh,

168
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:54,580
the borders of the United States and
Europe being a crowded and not entirely

169
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:56,230
controlled.

170
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,740
And it was the same story a hundred years
ago when southern and Eastern Europe,

171
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:08,130
we're in a stage three in the United
States was approaching stage four.

172
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:12,040
And immigration, uh, was enormous.

173
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:17,041
My own family on my father's side were
immigrants in the early 20th century.

174
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,420
Okay.
So Smith's invisible hand.

175
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,163
MMM.

176
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,900
The question is,
if it's invisible,

177
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,030
how can we know it's there?

178
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,860
And there are various,

179
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,370
there are several good New Yorker
cartoons about that problem.

180
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,800
One shows a group of well dressed people
gathered in a farm field near Darien,

181
00:13:49,801 --> 00:13:54,030
Connecticut looking out with
binoculars to fly the invisible hand,

182
00:13:54,031 --> 00:13:57,030
which has been reported to
have appeared there. Uh,

183
00:13:57,031 --> 00:14:02,031
another is a store with a sign across the
front store closing and then a caption

184
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:07,350
under the store closing sign,
bitch slapped by the invisible hand.

185
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:13,790
Um,
the,

186
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,260
the,
the

187
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:24,780
condition under which
the invisible hand works,

188
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,980
uh, is actually, there are several things
that have to be there for it to happen.

189
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:31,680
And let's just kind of
kind of inventory those.

190
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,870
First is you have to have an open market,

191
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,780
has to be a market where people can come
in and begin to produce our arrive in,

192
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:47,730
begin to consume. If it
is regulated, for example,

193
00:14:47,731 --> 00:14:50,790
by tariffs,
uh,

194
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,600
or buy a mafia,
uh,

195
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,680
then that is the visible hand and the
invisible hand is blocked from its work.

196
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:02,803
Okay.

197
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,720
There needs to be no seller
big enough to drive down to,

198
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,040
to control prices by say,
withholding product.

199
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:18,750
There needs third to be no buyer.
Uh,

200
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,090
I've left out a step,

201
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,820
no sour and no buyer
able to control prices.

202
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,920
And what would make that,

203
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:37,190
what kind of distribution of production
and buying would be required to do that?

204
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:44,190
Somebody, somebody near a mic.
Got a mic. Where's the mic guys?

205
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,553
Okay.

206
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,810
A
okay.

207
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,870
Those are the things you don't want if
you want the invisible hand to work,

208
00:15:58,871 --> 00:16:01,900
right.
What you want is somebody else.

209
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,563
Yes.

210
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,330
Okay.
And perfect competition occurs when one

211
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:15,360
k but that's circular.
Okay?

212
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:18,030
So we need to put one
step in between there.

213
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:23,903
Well,

214
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:24,970
that's,
that's,

215
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,970
that's work at this what I showed a
picture when I started this of a wheat

216
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:32,600
field.
Uh,

217
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:37,601
and I didn't show a picture
of a car factory or Microsoft.

218
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,280
Uh,

219
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:45,280
the key fact is that you have a fine
grain division of production and

220
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:49,970
consumption. So there are thousands
and thousands of producers,

221
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,130
thousands and thousands of consumers.

222
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,360
No one of them big enough
to gain the market,

223
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,650
right? If you're a, if you're making,

224
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:05,770
if you're producing wheat or rice
and you say the world prices too low,

225
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,970
I'm going to drive it up by withholding
this year's crop from my hundred acres.

226
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:17,570
That's like hit my hand because
you have no market power.

227
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,890
Uh, no producer holds a pivotal,
pivotal private technology.

228
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,430
Uh,
and

229
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,410
it's pretty obvious what's meant by that.

230
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,140
A patented technology or a trade secret,

231
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,740
which allows one producer to differentiate
him or herself from other producers

232
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,740
and dominate the market.
Are there,

233
00:17:42,741 --> 00:17:47,420
is there the buyers and
perfect information,

234
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:52,440
more or less truthful information
across the whole market?

235
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,703
Yeah,

236
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,970
and government to enforce
property and contract.

237
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:04,270
So with all those conditions in place,
what,

238
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,950
what Smith's says about the
invisible hand is more or less true.

239
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,730
See if I can find the quote.

240
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,500
And he talks about producers who are in
this and many other cases led by by an

241
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:27,480
invisible hand to promote the end,
which,

242
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,850
which they have no part of an
intention by pursuing his own interest.

243
00:18:32,851 --> 00:18:37,470
He frequently promotes that of
society more effectually then when he,

244
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,750
when he really intends to promote it.

245
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,430
I have never known much good to come
from people trading in the name of the

246
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:48,240
public good.
So the,

247
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,660
on both the producer
and the consumer side,

248
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:56,820
there is a peculiar power vacuum.

249
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:02,630
There is no one who can be said to have
set the price of the good or determined

250
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:07,890
it's quality.
It is decided collectively.

251
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:13,610
And the Smithian idea there is actually
the idea of general equilibrium in a

252
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:20,160
market economy. The next phase of
economic theory, neoclassical economics,

253
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,380
uh, formalizes this idea and
makes it mathematically precise.

254
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:29,670
And we will look at it in a little while,
but here,

255
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:31,620
uh,

256
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:36,620
it's important first just to get the
context in which Smith writes about the

257
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:42,270
invisible hand in the wealth of nations.

258
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,080
Anybody able to provide us with the
exact point he's trying to prove?

259
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,410
Is there a hand somewhere?

260
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,020
You're trying to set this guy up?
I know that,

261
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,860
but was there wave at please?

262
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,513
Okay,

263
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:14,240
yes. You need the mic.
Where's it? Come on guys.

264
00:20:14,241 --> 00:20:16,100
We gotta manage the mic better here,
whereas it

265
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,420
just,
it doesn't work without them.

266
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:25,310
Would one of you guys just kind of
stay standing and get it to people?

267
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,293
Wow.

268
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,510
It shouldn't impose tariffs.
Okay.

269
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:44,460
He's arguing against tariffs and
for free trade. Right. And why,

270
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,360
why do, why is that an
argumentative point for him?

271
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,190
Why are they're terrorists?
Uh,

272
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:54,700
because the nation's thought that they
were protecting their economies by

273
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,510
enforcing. Okay. And who were
they helped to reach that?

274
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,210
Who helped the nations
to reach that conclusion?

275
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:07,650
Other economists? Well, yeah, sure. No,

276
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:12,670
I'm fishing for something
a little different. Let's
pass the Mike over to the,

277
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,090
is it the violin question?
The Viola question? Okay.

278
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,460
My wife is a violist. Great. Um,

279
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,230
I guess the predominant economic
philosophy at the time when Adam Smith was

280
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:27,580
writing was mercantilism mercantilism
market to listen, which is, you know, uh,

281
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,950
accumulate as much gold as possible,
become the richest, you know,

282
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,670
individual through that
regard. Which means, you know,

283
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:39,250
not really importing much and really
focusing on supporting domestic and,

284
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,500
okay, go ahead. So that's excellent.

285
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:44,860
So Smith was anti mercantilist,

286
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:50,220
he was a free trader and the people who
had a concrete interest in tariff and

287
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,840
tariff tariff in possession,
who would,

288
00:21:55,841 --> 00:21:59,230
who would have a strong self interest
in that? Let's get the mic over here.

289
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:04,620
I think one of UTS really needs to just
stand up and MC they thing a domestic

290
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:09,670
merchants and manufacturers, well
certainly manufacturers, right?

291
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,700
Domestic manufacturers who are in some
way or another not competitive with

292
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:19,300
imports. Right? And, and Smith
has this wonderful passage,

293
00:22:19,301 --> 00:22:22,210
I think it's near this,
where he talks about how you could,

294
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,300
you could in Scotland produce good one,

295
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,480
right? You'd have to have hot houses and
many other special and very expensive

296
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,830
accouterments.

297
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:38,050
But for about 30 times the price
of the production price of France,

298
00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:41,350
Spain or Italy,
you could produce Scottish wine.

299
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:47,550
But it would be a foolish betrayal of
the public interest to put up a tariff so

300
00:22:48,941 --> 00:22:53,941
that you could then sell that wine worth
$2 for $200 and that's the center of

301
00:22:57,671 --> 00:23:00,490
his argument, right? And he begins,

302
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:05,500
he begins at the micro level with the
butcher, the baker and the brewer.

303
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,960
Uh, which is a metaphor that
rings true for most of us, right?

304
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,760
Why are the,

305
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:17,680
why is the produce fresh in the little
market on Orange Street in new haven?

306
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:23,380
And the main reason is because there
are two little markets in new haven.

307
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,400
If we're just one 36 hour old,

308
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,240
lettuce would be marketable,
but with two,

309
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:36,270
one of whom drives to New York every
morning at three that just doesn't work.

310
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:42,030
So that Smith talks about the self
interest axiom as the driver for promoting

311
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,330
the common good.

312
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,730
Now I'm going to invite Jim Alexander

313
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:57,980
come on up and we'll just stand
and let's actually sit and talk.

314
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:05,360
Some of you who have been very
adept introduced to Jim Alexander,

315
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:09,380
uh, and for others, I'll introduce him.

316
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:13,820
Now a Jim is a good friend and,

317
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,800
uh, was, had a 20 year
career in investment banking.

318
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,410
And after that,

319
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:26,830
a stint as chief financial officer
of Enron global power and pipeline,

320
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:32,710
uh, which was indeed one of
the famous partnerships, uh,

321
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,730
in the Enron meltdown.

322
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,370
He was a straight shooter,
uh,

323
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,190
as the best book on the Enron meltdown,

324
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:48,080
calls him the fly in the
ointment, uh, and went off,

325
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,850
uh,
to cofound spinnaker exploration,

326
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,480
which later became a public company.
Um,

327
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,370
and Jim is going to be part of
this course from time to time.

328
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,600
And I thought maybe to bring the,
uh,

329
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:09,080
the discussion down from the clouds here,

330
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,180
I would ask Jim,

331
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:17,170
is the ghost of Adam Smith
alive in the boardroom,

332
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:22,820
uh, in corporate America? Well,

333
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:23,654
the

334
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,130
self image of Adam Smith is alive.

335
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:32,300
The ideology that would be
espoused is that of Adam Smith.

336
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:36,770
The substance is not there.

337
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,800
Uh,

338
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,710
I believe that most of the people
would pass the polygraph test that they

339
00:25:42,711 --> 00:25:47,360
believe it's there. Okay, that's good.
Now, let's, here's an interesting,

340
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,980
interesting exercise. There are
about a dozen Mbas in the group here.

341
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:56,330
Uh,
every MBA,

342
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,750
every MBA period, uh, has
learned the porter forces.

343
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,050
And what are the porter forces?

344
00:26:06,051 --> 00:26:11,051
The porter forces are the rules of thumb
you need to make above average profits

345
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:16,100
with a firm. Okay? And one
of them is, you know, what,

346
00:26:16,101 --> 00:26:20,660
too much competition, direct competition,
direct competition. He roads profits.

347
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,470
You want high barriers to entry.
Uh,

348
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:30,380
you don't want powerful buyers who
can drive down your price through

349
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:34,130
negotiating. For example,
tire companies, space,

350
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,070
very powerful buyers in
automobile manufacturers.

351
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,220
You want to avoid situations like that.

352
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:45,610
You also want to be able to control your
supplier so they can't see you making

353
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:48,420
profits and then demand their share.

354
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,690
Now just think for a second,

355
00:26:51,691 --> 00:26:55,950
how do the porter forces
aligned with the conditions, uh,

356
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,670
that I sketch five minutes ago for
the operation, the invisible hand

357
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,480
in the back,
you gotta be really loud because

358
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,980
they are essentially the exact opposite.

359
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:15,910
The name in business speak for operating
under the control of the invisible hand

360
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,470
is commodity hell

361
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:23,230
okay.

362
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:23,531
Right?

363
00:27:23,531 --> 00:27:28,531
Commodity hell being that you're producing
something which thousands of other

364
00:27:29,771 --> 00:27:34,000
people can produce and they can produce
it as cheaply. And as well as you can.

365
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:39,840
And so the available pricing strategies
to you are not of them involve high

366
00:27:40,541 --> 00:27:44,230
profits. Right? So one of the,

367
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,770
one of the fundamental axiom,
so business management,

368
00:27:47,771 --> 00:27:50,470
and I'm not making a moral condemnation,

369
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:53,830
I'm just making an observation
that there is a strong tension here

370
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,850
that the,
the,

371
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:01,400
the pursuit of actual act,

372
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:06,660
the actual submission to the invisible
hand is contrary to the very basis of

373
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:13,600
corporate strategy. Uh, Jim,

374
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:18,760
we'll talk, I would talk a little
from your experience about,

375
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,120
uh,
the

376
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,310
intelligent use of the porter
forces by management strategist

377
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,220
or intelligent,

378
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,600
well, the latter, but,

379
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:35,490
but basically a no one ever wants to
get into a Adam Smith's type of market.

380
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:39,670
And if you, if you're in it, you get out
of it. I mean, because there's a, it,

381
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,070
it's ruinous. Uh, and uh,

382
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,860
the only way you can, uh, affect,

383
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,330
affect change in,

384
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:54,510
in that that type of market is to do
what Adam Smith suggested in that is make

385
00:28:55,621 --> 00:28:58,650
some sort of national security argument.

386
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,770
Why in fact,
wow,

387
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,100
Smith's views are very
well and fine in general.

388
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:10,490
You need in the country more of especially
needs to have a defense against a

389
00:29:12,121 --> 00:29:14,610
foreign imports or ruinous competition.

390
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,210
I think the sugar producers were able
to pull that off pretty neatly and make

391
00:29:18,211 --> 00:29:22,380
them make a national security
argument for, for sugar quotas. Uh,

392
00:29:22,381 --> 00:29:27,330
but that's uh, but you never tolerate a
and Adam Smith a level of competition.

393
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:30,310
Okay.
And if you look at,

394
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:36,790
I ordered a thank you for smoking Chris
Christopher Buckley's book as an option

395
00:29:37,131 --> 00:29:40,790
for this course, but I'm told
all of you have seen the movie,

396
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:46,030
which I haven't. It's
a movie any good. Okay.

397
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,470
So you should all look at the movie.

398
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:52,360
And the book is all about the way,
uh,

399
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:57,550
corporations, including those which
make, in this case, cigarettes,

400
00:29:57,551 --> 00:30:01,600
booze and a firearms,
but mostly cigarettes,

401
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,303
uh,

402
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:08,120
have elaborate representation in
Washington and promote their own interests

403
00:30:08,121 --> 00:30:10,150
through the law.
It's not a big surprise,

404
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:16,080
but the tension between the idealized
theory of the market and that practice is

405
00:30:21,941 --> 00:30:23,920
a very strong one.
And incidentally,

406
00:30:23,921 --> 00:30:27,640
Smith was very critical of the
corporations which existed in his time,

407
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:29,810
uh,
knots.

408
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:35,040
And he was critical of them for partly
the reason we just articulated that they

409
00:30:35,891 --> 00:30:39,460
can control pricing,
uh,

410
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:43,420
and impose their product, uh, by,

411
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,020
by that method.
Uh,

412
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:51,070
but more Smith thought that the
people running the corporations,

413
00:30:51,071 --> 00:30:53,680
which existed at that time
were thoroughly and competent.

414
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:59,040
And that's of course because the Yale
School of management had not yet been

415
00:30:59,041 --> 00:30:59,874
founded.

416
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:05,490
But it in actual fact there is a
fundamental problem about corporations and

417
00:31:07,151 --> 00:31:10,780
their management called the
principal agency problem.

418
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,210
And the gist of that,

419
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:18,270
of that problem is that managers
left to their own devices,

420
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:25,110
will tend to take a company where in
a direction which is best for them

421
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:30,070
individually and not necessarily
for the broad body of shareholders.

422
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And so the control over that
tendency gets to be one of the major,

423
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:41,680
uh, dramatic themes in business life. Jim,

424
00:31:41,681 --> 00:31:44,680
you've been near some management which

425
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:49,600
had a rent seeking tendencies.

426
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:55,630
Well, let me come back to something
else and that is that, uh,

427
00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:00,490
at least one of the
sections Smith has, uh, uh,

428
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:04,390
revolves around, uh, the butcher,
the brewer and the baker. Yup.

429
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,300
And what's much more reliable to

430
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:13,690
rely on their self interest than
their benevolence, which is true.

431
00:32:13,691 --> 00:32:15,300
But there's, there's, there's a, uh,

432
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:20,020
I think there's an embedded assumption
which he doesn't go into and that is,

433
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:24,840
he cites examples of what her,

434
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:28,090
at least at the time were,
were single proprietor,

435
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:33,410
a sort of businesses marketing a
product which was directly consumed by

436
00:32:34,751 --> 00:32:39,751
individuals who knew the proprietors well
and understood what good meat was from

437
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:45,050
Meta wasn't good. Right.
Uh, and, uh, that,

438
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,480
that also is increasingly irrelevant,
uh,

439
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:55,070
since his time because one of the most
important things I thought in one of your

440
00:32:55,071 --> 00:32:59,240
slides was that there'd
be perfect information.

441
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:04,640
And on top of that and embedded assumption
there is that there has to be perfect

442
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:09,170
information. Perfectly understood.
Absolutely. And, and in fact,

443
00:33:09,171 --> 00:33:11,900
one of the, um, you know, I
haven't come from finance,

444
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,100
it's sort of the highest form
of art is to have information,

445
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:20,150
which in retrospect can
be defended as reliable,

446
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:23,780
but prospectively ha as
virtually meaningless. Uh,

447
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,060
so one of the ways you can, uh, that,

448
00:33:26,061 --> 00:33:28,310
that it really becomes
very important in practice,

449
00:33:28,311 --> 00:33:32,930
right yet about the Smithian ideals is
to make sure that you have colorable

450
00:33:32,931 --> 00:33:37,280
information colorable of
voluntary transactions.

451
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,110
But in fact they're, uh, they
are practically speaking,

452
00:33:42,111 --> 00:33:45,770
not voluntary and practically speaking,
not informed.

453
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:50,390
You can, on top of that, you start
having principal agent issues.

454
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,570
Let's take the,
the butcher for example,

455
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,740
one butcher in a little village
deals with people he knows.

456
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,590
So there's social
constraints and there's also,

457
00:34:00,591 --> 00:34:05,210
it's fairly easy if it's one
butcher to trace the s uh, any,

458
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:09,110
any illnesses that result it match.
And,

459
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:12,860
and he is,
has a relatively non marketable asset,

460
00:34:12,861 --> 00:34:17,060
which is his interest in his private.
What's your shop? Very hard to sell.

461
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:21,800
So he must count on long
term profit maximization, uh,

462
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:25,220
to not short term but long term.
Now let's imagine you had a,

463
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:28,640
I don't think I would be
processors as public at this point,

464
00:34:28,641 --> 00:34:33,350
but let's imagine that
you had a, uh, a, uh, uh,

465
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:38,060
a butcher business,
which was owned by the public,

466
00:34:38,061 --> 00:34:42,590
controlled by a small group of
managers. And furthermore, uh,

467
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,191
let's assume,

468
00:34:43,191 --> 00:34:47,570
and it's actually a pretty good
assumption that you had a group of semi

469
00:34:47,571 --> 00:34:51,920
knowledgeable and mutual fund managers
who rewarded people with huge gains in

470
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:56,540
their share value if they were able to
reliably to hit their quarterly earnings

471
00:34:56,541 --> 00:34:59,360
estimates and punish them.
Of course,

472
00:34:59,361 --> 00:35:02,600
if anything went wrong
under those circumstances,

473
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:08,240
assuming that the investing public really
didn't understand the dynamics of the

474
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:13,241
business and assuming that you could
make satisfactory short term goals,

475
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,590
maybe making maybe a hundred times the
average income of the typical worker

476
00:35:21,591 --> 00:35:24,290
every couple of weeks,
um,

477
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:29,590
then you would be incentivized
unless you are very risk averse to,

478
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:30,471
for example,

479
00:35:30,471 --> 00:35:35,471
being able to buy tainted meat and then
be able to make some extra pennies,

480
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:39,060
beat your numbers,
get a big up a upgrade in your stock.

481
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:42,480
If you have a lot of options, you have
a very highly leveraged well situation,

482
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,860
then make enough money in the
short term where you could live,

483
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:51,180
you could maybe buy a small country or
liberal it with gravy for the rest of

484
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:56,160
your life on a basis, which was
sufficiently confusing that you,

485
00:35:56,161 --> 00:35:58,080
you'd be unlikely to be prosecuted.
Right?

486
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:01,800
That's my experience as to how it works.
I realize that it's,

487
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:05,820
that it's a small sliver and
it is oriented toward finance,

488
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:08,490
which is the worst part
of American business.

489
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:13,800
But that's in fact how I've seen it work.
Uh, no theories. It's just how it works.

490
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,090
Uh,
you know,

491
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:20,091
so people believe and yet the same
people who would do this would spout and

492
00:36:20,371 --> 00:36:25,260
believe every bit of it. The same type
of Smithy and idealism you see here,

493
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,590
invisible hand. Well, my experience,

494
00:36:27,591 --> 00:36:31,650
the invisible hand typically is picking
someone's pocket, not creating value.

495
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,790
And in fact, you know, I'll
get off of this, but the last

496
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:39,570
I remember,
uh,

497
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:44,660
talking to the senior Republican staff
are at the House Energy and Commerce

498
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:49,530
Committee and making the answer is by
the way, I believe you are a Republican.

499
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:53,400
Used to be. It used to be, um,

500
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,350
this is how I used to be.

501
00:36:55,950 --> 00:37:00,420
I remember talking to the lead Republican
staffer or the House Energy and

502
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:04,170
Commerce Committee and saying at one
point that capitalism justifies itself by

503
00:37:04,171 --> 00:37:08,040
creating real, not elusory
value to which he replied, well,

504
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:12,670
you're nothing but a communist.
And that in fact is,

505
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:13,950
is the problem is,

506
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,390
is under Smithian
assumptions about a longterm,

507
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:23,850
uh, honesty, longterm interest in real
value creation. It works perfectly.

508
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,240
It just that when those,
when those assumptions start to erode,

509
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,000
it turns into a nightmare.
Terrific.

510
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:35,300
Uh, Giorgio's now I'm going to call on
you in a moment for a one sentence read.

511
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:36,290
Uh,

512
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:41,150
here's the proposition that we
now want to look at a Smith.

513
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:46,880
Here's a, here's a, an appearance but
not real paradox. Adam spent says,

514
00:37:46,881 --> 00:37:51,881
self interest is the main motive
for what people actually do.

515
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:59,200
And yet he led a life which didn't begin
to maximize his own material interest.

516
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:06,050
He lived modestly. He
worked diligently. He,

517
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:10,370
uh, never, uh, became a wealthy man.

518
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,900
So if he believed it for mankind,

519
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:18,710
how come you didn't practice
it for himself? Well,

520
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:24,430
Richard Material.

521
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,220
Okay,
fair enough.

522
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,390
That's a good point.

523
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:43,020
The other side of it is that wealth
of nations was Smith second main book.

524
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:46,990
And it wasn't the book which made
him famous in his own lifetime.

525
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,580
The theory of moral sentiments is the
book which made him famous in his own

526
00:38:51,581 --> 00:38:53,590
lifetime.
And George Ross,

527
00:38:53,591 --> 00:38:57,490
will you read us please
in good strong voice,

528
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:01,510
the first sentence of Smith's first book.

529
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,510
Thanks very much Lesley.

530
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,220
How self soever man may be supposed there.

531
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:21,750
Evidently some principles in his nature
which interests him in the fortune of

532
00:39:21,751 --> 00:39:25,320
the others and re render their
happiness necessary to him,

533
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:30,570
though he derives nothing from me
except the pleasure of seeing it. Okay.

534
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,130
And now read it one more time.

535
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:37,560
How Selfoss so clever man may be supposed,
they're evident,

536
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:40,050
evidently some principles in his nature,

537
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:44,760
which interest him and the fortune
of others and render their happiness

538
00:39:44,761 --> 00:39:45,900
necessary to him,

539
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:50,400
though he derives nothing from it
except the pleasure of seeing it.

540
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:51,601
Okay.

541
00:39:51,601 --> 00:39:56,601
So Smith actually believed
that we were a complicated mix,

542
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,920
and I think he's right.

543
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:04,430
And he believed that there is a prosocial
element in almost every human being.

544
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:09,510
There is a,
an innate sympathy for others,

545
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:14,040
which almost everyone has.
And at the same time,

546
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:17,580
a tendency to feather one's own nest.
Now,

547
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:21,300
I don't know anyone who is
just one of those two things.

548
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:25,620
I don't know anyone
who is a pure Iga test.

549
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,230
You do?
My goodness.

550
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,863
Okay.

551
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:38,970
Not even generous to his aged mother or,

552
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:47,040
okay. Well there may be some.
Yeah, there may be some,

553
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:51,810
but there aren't a hell of a lot. And uh,
Smith, this is characteristic of Smith.

554
00:40:51,811 --> 00:40:53,400
Smith is not a dogmatist.

555
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:58,790
Smith is a careful observer
who draws as much from,

556
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:04,500
uh, from the evidence
as is there. Now, uh,

557
00:41:04,501 --> 00:41:09,120
this is a map which links
Smith forward to the next,

558
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,290
a historical period, namely, uh,

559
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:18,320
the period when a world trade got serious
and the period which we will discuss

560
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:26,120
in Monday's class when Marx and Engels
we're writing the communist manifesto,

561
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:31,020
the picture on the board
is the world railroad grid.

562
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,120
And if you think about Smith's story,

563
00:41:35,121 --> 00:41:40,121
about how wealth depends on the division
of labor works only where you have a

564
00:41:40,371 --> 00:41:43,990
large market
and he makes that point at length.

565
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,720
And in the period which begins in the
middle 18 hundreds really begins about

566
00:41:49,721 --> 00:41:52,990
1840.
In that period,

567
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:58,620
really large markets became accessible
to everyone located in the dance part of

568
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:02,470
the world, railway, railway grip.

569
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:08,340
And toward the end of the semester we'll
be dealing with the problem of economic

570
00:42:09,851 --> 00:42:11,620
development in places like these.

571
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:16,000
And if you look at the way
the railroads develop there,

572
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:20,740
they all developed to reach,
uh,

573
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:25,830
ocean ports for the export of products,

574
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,700
products to world markets.

575
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:33,540
And the density of connection required
for the internal development of large

576
00:42:34,631 --> 00:42:39,040
markets was by and large mission.
Okay.

577
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,233
No,

578
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,830
I think I'll just finish with,
uh,

579
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:52,440
Adam Smith's story about the pin making
and what happened to the pin making

580
00:42:52,441 --> 00:42:53,730
story.
Smith,

581
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:58,290
I actually didn't have your read this
because it's something everybody,

582
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,690
I think everybody learns
this one in high school,

583
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,440
the division of Labor for Smith is
illustrated by a group of artisans making

584
00:43:07,261 --> 00:43:12,261
pins and one person gets really good
at drawing the wire out straight.

585
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:17,670
Another person at hammering
ahead onto the wire,

586
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:22,620
another person at making the point sharp,
another person at polishing the shaft.

587
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:27,870
And by division of Labor and
development of expertise,

588
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:32,580
they can produce more pins of higher
quality than a single artists and doing

589
00:43:32,581 --> 00:43:36,240
each of those operations by
himself could possibly have done.

590
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:40,170
And that's,
it's a good illustration.

591
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,560
And if you think about all the professions
and occupations in an economy that

592
00:43:47,641 --> 00:43:52,641
kind of profiting from that way of
profiting from specialized expertise is

593
00:43:53,791 --> 00:43:58,230
foundational. It's a market societies
foundational to their wealth.

594
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:02,400
Now the actual fate of the pin machine is,
uh,

595
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,650
interesting and personal to my family.
Uh,

596
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,720
it turns out that in 1831,

597
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:16,140
a New York physician named John Ireland,

598
00:44:16,141 --> 00:44:18,800
how h o w e,
uh,

599
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:23,990
began to tinker with the idea of making
a machine where wire went in one end and

600
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:28,410
polished pins came out the
other in their thousands.

601
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:33,330
And by 1851,
he what was called the how pin machine.

602
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:37,620
There's a room in the
Smithsonian to this day where a,

603
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:42,210
how pin machine shits and a movie of
its operation goes on behind it. Well,

604
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:43,441
John Ireland,

605
00:44:43,441 --> 00:44:48,441
how I won't brag again in this semester
was my five over great grandfather and

606
00:44:50,161 --> 00:44:55,160
the family began pissing away the money
right away and completed the task just

607
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:58,440
in time for my birth.
So

608
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:09,020
the slides include a formalization of
equilibrium theory with an Edgeworth box

609
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:11,800
and indifference curves and all that.
Uh,

610
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:13,770
but I don't think we have
time to do them here.

611
00:45:13,771 --> 00:45:18,750
And I urge you to review them
before the midterm, uh, on the,

612
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,940
on classes be too. So on Wednesday
we are Monday rather, we'll do,

613
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,190
uh,
the communist manifesto.

614
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:32,150
And on Wednesday we'll do Hayak
and the constitution of liberty.

615
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:38,360
So we'll see two ends of the ideological
perspective in a single week.

616
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,390
And after that, we will spend four
straight weeks on business cases.
