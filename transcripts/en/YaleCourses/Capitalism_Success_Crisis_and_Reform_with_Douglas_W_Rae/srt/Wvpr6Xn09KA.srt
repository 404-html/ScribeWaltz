1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,930
Today, what I'd like to do
is focus first on desoto.

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,400
Uh, and then on the larger question,
you have your informal property back,

3
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:13,020
Jennifer.
Uh,

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,450
and then on the larger question
of what's the point of all this,

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,850
what is
the merit of capitalism?

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,960
And we know a lot of things that
capitalism isn't really great app.

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,990
Uh, and we know that it has, if
you let it run its own course,

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,160
it is inclined toward instability
and it is inclined toward stupendous

9
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:46,020
disruption of the planet.
Uh,

10
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,390
and yet I, for one, am a, uh,

11
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,510
guarded enthusiasm for capitalism.

12
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,490
So the underlying point of it,

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,700
a must have something to do with helping
people to have a fuller capacity to

14
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:09,270
lead their lives.

15
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,420
You might call it a
practical freedom and the,

16
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,220
the subject for today and for next Monday,
uh,

17
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,030
bring that out. That is, uh,

18
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,690
today with Desoto and I'm going to call
and several of you to think about how

19
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:32,691
you would use 5% of the GDP of a
country to do as much good as possible.

20
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,650
Um, and then on Monday,
uh, the white tiger,

21
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,530
uh, which, uh,

22
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,650
illustrates quite powerfully
that increasing the average,

23
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,910
uh, average income or
wealth in a country, uh,

24
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,340
can be a wonderful thing,

25
00:01:56,341 --> 00:02:00,330
but seen from the very
bottom cannot be so great.

26
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:01,861
Uh,

27
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:06,861
and a protagonist in white tiger
is a brilliant articulator,

28
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:12,570
if you will, of of that problem. Okay. So,

29
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,160
uh,

30
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,160
the photograph in front of you is meant
to call forth desotos idea of Brow

31
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,600
Dell's Bell Jar, uh, and the foreground,

32
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,770
uh, a vast favela, uh,

33
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,370
is all informal property and
because it's informal property,

34
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:42,120
it is dead capitol.
And the background,

35
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:43,860
uh,

36
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,480
is not only live capitol
and formal property,

37
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,280
but extremely dense
piling up of live capital.

38
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,360
It is an expression of intense economic,
uh,

39
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,440
activity and presumably for the
most part of great economic success,

40
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:13,290
desoto on page pages one 61 61 has,

41
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:14,530
first of all,

42
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:19,530
he has some type type face there that is
a small enough that I can't read it and

43
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:27,040
my guess is many of you will struggle
to read it. But at the top of the page,

44
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:31,750
he has a bridge, uh, showing, uh,

45
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,780
his prescription for the path from dead
capital on the left to live capitol on

46
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:41,740
the right across the top.
The roadway, if you will,

47
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,120
is the commercial strategy,
the creation of businesses,

48
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:47,621
uh,

49
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:52,621
the taking of debt in order
to create new enterprises.

50
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,340
And then the process by which a desoto
and his disciples first map out the

51
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,000
problem,
uh,

52
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,540
and then engage in a political and legal
strategy to create the framework for

53
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,630
formalized property all the
way to the bottom of society.

54
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:22,380
And then the operational
strategies whereby that has
implemented a neighborhood

55
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:24,250
at a time of Avella at a time.

56
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,663
MMM.

57
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,200
Desoto is a deadly serious about this,
and it's a practical enterprise.

58
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,360
Uh, I'm going to Peru, uh,
at the end of term to, uh,

59
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,300
sit in on a,

60
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:45,301
an attempt by a desoto and his fellows
to formalize a set of neighborhoods

61
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,570
around the city.

62
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:52,260
And I hope to write a business case that
will be used in this course a year from

63
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:54,940
now on that trip.

64
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,870
Now, uh, if you

65
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:06,420
take the totality of, of desotos book, uh,

66
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:11,450
the only thing worse than leaving informal
property informal from his point of

67
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:18,861
view is force fitting a formalized
system invented in a university,

68
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,100
uh, onto an existing system
of informal property.

69
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,990
And I'd like to,
uh,

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,920
talk about that with you for a few
minutes and give you a case, uh,

71
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,020
from my own experience
in an American setting.

72
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,900
Well,
informal property,

73
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,360
these are boundaries in an imaginary
informal property system, uh,

74
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:51,420
which correspond to the ingrained habits
and customs of the people who own this

75
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:56,620
property.
And the,

76
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,930
their inclination will be always to
defend it against a change imposed

77
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,850
arbitrarily from outside.

78
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:10,670
And if you ask a smart professors
at the Yale School of Management,

79
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,363
uh,

80
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,610
what's the most efficient way to
lay out the boundaries of property?

81
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:21,611
They'll give you something like the red
grid here with right angles and straight

82
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:27,701
lines and right angles and straight lines
have a brilliant history in American

83
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:30,350
property law.
Uh,

84
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:35,410
President Jefferson a laid out a grid
like this on all but the northeast corner

85
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:40,790
of the u s of longitude and
latitude lines defining,

86
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,910
uh,
sections of 640 acres.

87
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,440
And the whole development of the
American West is actually on,

88
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,910
with the exception of the
mountainous areas. For example,

89
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:57,560
the Sierra Nevadas would that exception,
the whole country looks like,

90
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,640
uh,
this rectangle rectilinear grid.

91
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,040
And as you fly from coast to coast,
you can see the grid laid out,

92
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:07,710
uh,

93
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,710
in a perfectly symmetrical way
with center pivot irrigation,

94
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,960
interrupting the grid from time
to time and an occasional river.

95
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,150
Uh,

96
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:25,150
the better way according to de Soto is
to adapt a formal systems to fit informal

97
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,630
systems.
So to incrementally add the perimeter,

98
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:38,140
a metes and bounds shown
here and ultimately to can
convert the old boundaries

99
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,560
to new boundaries.
Uh,

100
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:47,561
the old boundaries being recognized
only by people living within this little

101
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:49,400
area.
Dot.

102
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:54,420
New Boundaries being recognized all the
way up to the nation state level and in

103
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:57,110
theory,
all the way up to the world level.

104
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:01,640
If people from another country are
engaged in a property transaction.

105
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:06,470
For example,
if the owner of this land,

106
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:07,610
uh,

107
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:12,610
seeks to take debt from a bank in
New York and the property is in Peru,

108
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,420
uh,

109
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:20,420
the whole world's system is involved in
the formalization and the obligation of

110
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:27,401
the Peruvian government to honor a
contract with an American bank would come

111
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:32,990
into play. And so even the,
even at the very lowest level,

112
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:38,650
the ultimate chain of connections to
the top level of government on a world

113
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:42,170
scale, uh, is important.

114
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,710
Um,
nearly 20 years ago,

115
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,680
um,
a fellow named Kurt Schmoke,

116
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,420
a Yale class of about 1970,

117
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,290
uh, and sometimes senior fellow
of the Yale Corporation, uh,

118
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,650
was mayor of Baltimore.

119
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,420
And I didn't actually have
him as a student here,

120
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:16,180
but I was working then on,
uh,

121
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,780
cities that had too much housing

122
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,340
and which I called under a crowded cities.

123
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,910
If you read all the city
planning books from that period,

124
00:09:26,911 --> 00:09:30,420
it's all about how do we handle all this
new population that has to be housed.

125
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,280
And of course,

126
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,580
the real story for a city like
Baltimore was a vast housing surplus.

127
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,790
Uh, anybody come from
Baltimore Wa or, all right,

128
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,860
I'll settle for Washington or
Philadelphia or Wilmington.

129
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:52,020
What have we got in the back
there? What, what city? Okay.

130
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,150
Can you,
and we've got a mic for him.

131
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,670
Can you give us a,
a,

132
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,380
a feel for what an neighborhood
constructed of row houses looks like?

133
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,070
How it's organized? Well, I can tell you
about Baltimore's. I see it on the train.

134
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,320
It looks just like that all
the houses are boarded up,

135
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:15,350
all their backyards or trashed and
there's a lot of vacancy and just desolate

136
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:18,240
wasteland. Okay. It's still a mess, right?

137
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,160
Which means I was not very effective.
Um,

138
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,160
and Mayor Schmoke was not
very effective. The, um,

139
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,960
the difficulty with row houses or what
the economists call an inferior good,

140
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,230
the standard Baltimore
row houses nine feet wide,

141
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,740
the widest are 16 feet wide.

142
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,710
So it's like living in a
railroad car, uh, or in,

143
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,180
if it's a tall one, two or
three real railroad cars
stacked on top of each other.

144
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,650
And by and large, people prefer
ranch houses, which are more more,

145
00:10:55,651 --> 00:10:58,710
which more nearly
approximate a square layout.

146
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,570
And people also don't like,
uh,

147
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,870
living around visible signs of
decay like the ones just describe.

148
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:11,040
And when I came on the scene,

149
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,390
and this is a very
abstract representation,

150
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,060
but the green dots represent the,

151
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:25,340
the squares represent property units
and the green dots represent occupied

152
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:26,604
units.

153
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,890
The yellow dots represent units that
are still standing but condemned.

154
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:38,060
And the blank units represent areas
where the house has been torn down.

155
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,590
And there, there's no, this, there's
no precision in what I'm doing here,

156
00:11:43,591 --> 00:11:48,591
but it'll show you the difficulty of
trying to change something for the better,

157
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,040
uh, in a, in it, I didn't even
know desotos work at this time.

158
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,760
I was acting on the
same general intuitions,

159
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,350
uh,
that he has,

160
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:08,670
that we're at the edge of the bell jar,
the slides just in the wrong place.

161
00:12:08,671 --> 00:12:13,410
But the red line is the edge of the
bell jar.

162
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,180
Well,
one solution

163
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,390
to missing properties is
to install waterfalls.

164
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,240
This was done as a joke by
a student at Johns Hopkins.

165
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:34,230
Uh, it didn't involve in the
actual water or construction.

166
00:12:34,231 --> 00:12:37,780
It's just a photographic joke.
Um,

167
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:44,330
but another approach and the one that
I advocated is to triage neighborhoods

168
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:53,840
and to take a neighborhood like this
where you have very few occupied units,

169
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,560
most of what's there standing is condemned

170
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,030
and lots of vacant lots.

171
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,970
And to say,

172
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:12,020
let's find a way to use the wealth of
people living here to improve conditions

173
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,920
in a more promising adjacent neighborhood.
So

174
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,930
the first thought,
uh,

175
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,590
is that you take down the,
uh,

176
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,600
condemned houses in the unworkable area.

177
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:37,890
Uh,

178
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:42,890
and at the same time you offer a swaps
where you buy for what it's worth,

179
00:13:49,351 --> 00:13:50,640
which is not a lot.

180
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:56,390
You buy houses in the unworkable area
from people and part of their payment is

181
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:03,621
clear title to a similar space in a
more promising and nearby neighborhood.

182
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,580
So there is a,
uh,

183
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:13,670
you were creating a market here that has
a barter element in it for land and a

184
00:14:15,931 --> 00:14:20,030
small cash payment and a,
uh,

185
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,270
uh,

186
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:26,270
an effort to admit it to facilitate
the financing of replacement housing.

187
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,813
Okay.

188
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,140
Uh,
actually has a slide deck.

189
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,310
And so after the people make those moves,
this is theory.

190
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,660
You get a much denser
occupancy grid in the top

191
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,770
and you get some benefit from that one.

192
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,690
One is that crime generally goes down.

193
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:59,350
A neighborhood which is mostly vacant
lots is an invitation to criminal activity

194
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,670
and the statistics on
this area in Baltimore,

195
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:07,850
and it had hundreds of
areas like this one,

196
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,420
the crime statistics are brutal.
Uh,

197
00:15:11,421 --> 00:15:16,421
another fact is that the administration
of public services is wildly

198
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:19,214
inefficient,

199
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,460
where only a few houses in a neighborhood,
uh,

200
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:29,530
have trash to take away a where
streets need to be plowed and cleaned,

201
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,920
uh, even when very few
people use them. Uh,

202
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:39,470
and where police services
are stretched extremely thin.

203
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,960
So the idea is to densify one
area at the expense of another,

204
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,940
uh, and then to demolish, uh,

205
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,240
to demolish and replace the condemned
houses in the stronger neighborhood.

206
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:02,580
And you've made some progress. Well,
the first thing, the first thing that,

207
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,390
what's the first objection
that comes to mind?

208
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:09,883
Yeah.

209
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,590
What do you do with this?
This is now vacant area.

210
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:21,490
What do you do with it?
Anybody got a suggestion?

211
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:29,020
Sasha? Make it a park. That's good.

212
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,830
Uh, and it could be a park
with a huge lake in it.

213
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,720
Likes are much easier to administer them.
You don't have to mow lakes.

214
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,080
And a crime is relatively scarce on
aquatic crime is so far as I know,

215
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,570
rare.
Um,

216
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,610
or in some points that you
make it a golf course. Uh,

217
00:16:53,611 --> 00:16:58,611
there was a place in Miami where they've
created a zone where they've just,

218
00:16:58,810 --> 00:16:59,890
uh,
it just grows wild.

219
00:16:59,891 --> 00:17:03,970
It's largely bamboo and there's
a 12 foot fence around it.

220
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,720
And the thought is that 50 years from
now somebody will figure out what to do

221
00:17:07,721 --> 00:17:11,010
with it. Um, the,

222
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,510
so that's one problem,

223
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:18,940
but there's another set of
problems that are even tougher.

224
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:24,100
And that is that all of these
neighborhoods have leaders

225
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:30,750
and leaders are not really very generous
about having you take their followers

226
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,830
away, right? People who are say,

227
00:17:35,831 --> 00:17:40,831
Alderman or people who are head of a
neighborhood development board or of a

228
00:17:42,731 --> 00:17:47,530
neighborhood crime watch, they all come
forward and they say, this is madness.

229
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,420
These people live in perfectly
good houses where they are.

230
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,800
And the ultimate effect is to drive the
transaction costs through the ceiling.

231
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,620
The costs of getting the deals made is,
uh,

232
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,670
astronomically high. I mean, it's a, it's,

233
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,700
it's a perfect illustration of why the
Coase theorem is serious because if the

234
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:18,000
transaction costs are high enough,

235
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:23,050
even obviously beneficial
to all sides swaps,

236
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,080
uh,
just don't happen.

237
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:31,190
And De Soto is dealing with environments
in which transaction costs are

238
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:37,311
extremely high in which the difficulty
of getting things like this done,

239
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,530
uh, are, uh, is just very,

240
00:18:43,531 --> 00:18:48,531
very great so that it's fine for you
and I to read this elegant little book,

241
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:56,630
but that's very different from actually
accomplishing things on the street so

242
00:18:59,011 --> 00:19:04,011
that this triangular relationship
between imagine an imaginary leaders,

243
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:05,730
uh,

244
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:10,730
would become a dominant obstacle to
completion of the task back to coast.

245
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,520
Uh,
the thesis,

246
00:19:17,521 --> 00:19:22,380
as you will remember, is that where
there are clear cut entitlements,

247
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:28,190
a high degree of transparency
and symmetrical transparency
and low transaction

248
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:32,340
costs,
efficient swaps are feasible.

249
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,820
And on the surface,
uh,

250
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,490
Desoto is all about clear entitlements,

251
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:43,940
but he's perfectly aware that without,
uh,

252
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:49,020
being able to execute economic
transactions, for example,

253
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:53,450
borrowing against a clear entitlement,
uh,

254
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,200
very little has been accomplished.

255
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,670
And that if a corruption,
for example,

256
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,940
interdicts transparency,

257
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,080
those transactions won't happen.
Or if they do,

258
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:10,440
they will be the wrong transactions.
So

259
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,760
one way to think about about how to use
desoto practically is to take the three

260
00:20:25,351 --> 00:20:27,900
conditions from,
uh,

261
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:32,930
this simplified version of the coasts
theorem and put them in a table with

262
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:39,570
relatively practical, uh,
categories that you can,

263
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:45,170
you can deal with and then
look for ways in which,

264
00:20:47,651 --> 00:20:50,620
for example, uh, education,

265
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:56,970
my impact, uh, transparency and so on.

266
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,930
I'm going to, I mean, uh,

267
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:03,830
what I want to do is proceed much
less formally than this. The charters,

268
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:07,010
it's kind of,
it's a very rigid framework.

269
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,510
It's not a bad framework,
but it's a rigid one.

270
00:21:11,511 --> 00:21:15,740
Now have some of you thought about how
you'd spend 5% of the GDP of a country

271
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,010
wave if you have,

272
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,350
I've got one too.

273
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:24,690
Okay.

274
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,590
More w one,
two,

275
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,600
no one in this section three.

276
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,100
No one's fessing up in the front row here.
Over here.

277
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,080
Okay. We're going to, oh, there
we are on the back. All right,

278
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:43,000
so we're going to do some winging here,
I'm afraid.

279
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,383
That's okay.

280
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,310
And lastly,
will you trade me places?

281
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:03,330
Um, Yup. There's some truck

282
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:12,350
now what the exercises to figure out if
we can create large increments in useful

283
00:22:13,741 --> 00:22:17,190
wealth by spending money.

284
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,400
Was it Tom? Is it, what have we got?

285
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,220
So I think it's education.
It's sort of the key to everything else.

286
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:31,730
Okay. You would put education ahead
of any of all of other things,

287
00:22:31,731 --> 00:22:36,260
all other things. Okay.
Uh, help us understand why,

288
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,060
uh,

289
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:41,230
because I think having human capital can
increase your investment and everything

290
00:22:41,231 --> 00:22:43,120
else,
but without that you're not going at it.

291
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:48,121
The people that you need to build roads
or expand property rights or all these

292
00:22:48,581 --> 00:22:49,414
other things.

293
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,401
Okay.

294
00:22:50,401 --> 00:22:55,401
So education a relatively well educated
populace is a necessary condition,

295
00:22:57,121 --> 00:22:59,340
is that what you're
saying? Absolutely. Okay.

296
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,510
Are there any necessary conditions
to a well educated population?

297
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,820
Uh,
well educated teachers.

298
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:10,120
Okay. So we have to have a
well educated teachers. Do we,

299
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,910
are there any other
things we probably need?

300
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,363
Yes.

301
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:21,620
Food running, clean water, electricity,

302
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:26,630
all the infrastructure.
You buy that Tom Sister.

303
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,320
Okay.

304
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,280
So education was expensive to begin with
and now it's looking more expensive.

305
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:36,320
So we're probably gonna need more than
5% of GDP to get very far with that.

306
00:23:36,321 --> 00:23:37,640
But that's a good thing.

307
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,773
Tall.

308
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,470
The other problem with education is,
is

309
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,010
that unless the costs

310
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,480
of the education for those workers are,
are not extremely high, they're not,

311
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,560
they're not going to go to school. The
kids will end up trying to make as little,

312
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:58,410
as much money as they can to support
their families. Okay, perfect.

313
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,160
I ended up actually educate,
absolutely

314
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:04,020
spot on. And then there's
an incident in white tiger,

315
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,090
which is exactly about that,

316
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,320
where the uncle comes and drags the,

317
00:24:10,321 --> 00:24:15,321
our protagonist away from school because
his Labor has been exchanged in a

318
00:24:16,441 --> 00:24:19,590
family deal. Yes. Back.

319
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,160
Let's just put a little lag in the
conversation. So the, the mix get there.

320
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,600
There's also a cultural problem,

321
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:31,060
like certain societies don't
want females to go to school,

322
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,330
so there's something deeper than just,
you know,

323
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,570
opportunity costs at work there that
must be dealt with in other ways.

324
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,670
Okay. Uh, I, I'm sure you're right. She,

325
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,880
can you give a specific example?

326
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:50,580
Um, well I was watching a
movie, it was about, um,

327
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:55,970
it was about like an Indian societies in
which like women are not allowed to go

328
00:24:55,971 --> 00:24:58,180
to school and helped.
Um,

329
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,600
that figure in the movie to leading
hero was actually based on a real life

330
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:07,601
figure who went into the village and
convinced all these different families to

331
00:25:08,301 --> 00:25:10,370
let their children go to school.
Um,

332
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:15,050
because it would be better for them
in the long run but like not based on

333
00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:19,850
opportunity costs but basically tried
to change their cultural kind of closed.

334
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,270
Okay. And what, what's behind this
prohibition on educating women? Do Spouse?

335
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,750
Um,
I think it's partly to do with the meals,

336
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:31,620
so nice to,
so I'll put that on the APP.

337
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,240
I know that in certain families as well,

338
00:25:35,241 --> 00:25:40,070
like the female cannot be more
educated than a male in America.

339
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,630
I certainly believe in.

340
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,710
Yeah.
So I'm,

341
00:25:43,711 --> 00:25:48,150
sometimes a family believes that if
they are females are too educated,

342
00:25:48,151 --> 00:25:51,750
then they won't be able to marry
them off or something like that.

343
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,520
Okay. That's terrific. Right? Yeah. Yes.

344
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:02,910
You also need infrastructure in place and
laws in an economy place for like what

345
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,510
they're gonna do after they go to school.

346
00:26:04,511 --> 00:26:09,340
So like in Cuba they have fantastic
education but no opportunities for anyone

347
00:26:09,341 --> 00:26:10,750
like after that's finished.

348
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:14,710
So for education to be effective,

349
00:26:14,711 --> 00:26:18,250
like you also have to invest
in sort of like the next step.

350
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,863
Okay.

351
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:24,190
So for education to be effective
we have to have a next step.

352
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,370
Is the Cuban example when you know well,

353
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:32,040
uh, I wouldn't say I
know. Well that scares me.

354
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:33,930
I don't want you to ask me that question.
I don't know.

355
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,070
Well, can you, I mean
I've got a couple of,

356
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,600
I've been to Cuba a couple of times and
I have a couple of Cuba stories that

357
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,370
good fill in the blank.
But how about you was drying first?

358
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,870
Um, I tried to go to Cuba last
year. I didn't get a visa,

359
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,570
so I don't know it as well as I would.

360
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,280
Um,
they have,

361
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,781
well it has a lot.

362
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:58,410
I mean it has a lot to do with the
like communist socialist model.

363
00:26:58,411 --> 00:27:03,360
There's just no, there just
aren't any jobs, aren't any.

364
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,070
So like if you're educated as a lawyer,

365
00:27:05,071 --> 00:27:08,160
you just end up being like a
taxi driver no matter what. So

366
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,423
good Thursday,

367
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:16,520
I have a friend who might met in Havana
who was sort of top five among the

368
00:27:16,521 --> 00:27:20,240
fishery scientist in Cuba,
phd in biology.

369
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,550
And he was,

370
00:27:22,551 --> 00:27:27,551
he kept giving the wrong advice after
the Russians pulled out in the so called

371
00:27:28,161 --> 00:27:30,550
special period.
Uh,

372
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:36,040
the government wanted to double and double
and double the harvest of shrimp and

373
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,380
there are limits on the ecosystem
and he kept saying you can't do it.

374
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:47,900
And finally they declared him unemployable
and the effect of that was that he

375
00:27:47,901 --> 00:27:51,350
became a taxi driver
and troubled his income.

376
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,140
It was still a very low income,

377
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:58,040
but it was trouble when he
was making as a scientist.

378
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,730
Hands over here.
Yes.

379
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,600
Have we got a second mic working here?
Anywhere?

380
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:10,390
Okay. One of the downsides
of education is brain drain.

381
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,030
You put all your resources
into educating people,

382
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:16,360
but there are better opportunities in
other countries for them to go work,

383
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,770
make money and stay there.

384
00:28:17,771 --> 00:28:22,210
So if you are going to put education as
your main emphasis to need to have some

385
00:28:22,211 --> 00:28:26,500
sort of incentive within your own
country to have people remain okay. Tom,

386
00:28:26,501 --> 00:28:27,400
do you want to answer that?

387
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:28,563
Yeah.

388
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,800
So I,
I agree that that's a problem,

389
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:35,790
but I think it's maybe less of a
problem than it first appears because of

390
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:39,860
remittances where even in cases of brain
drain where people get well educated,

391
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:43,560
go to be doctors in America
rather than in India,

392
00:28:43,561 --> 00:28:46,890
there's still going to send
some percentage of that
money home in the form of

393
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:47,791
remittances,

394
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:51,870
which can do a lot in itself to prop
up and they copy great toward the back.

395
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,160
So I won't take all the credit for this.

396
00:28:57,161 --> 00:29:01,780
Richard has been convinced me by degrees
as this goes on. Uh, I think that, I mean,

397
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:05,470
I think you'd rather have 100% of that
income in your country and the wait to

398
00:29:05,471 --> 00:29:08,300
get that would be, uh,
through, for instance, great.

399
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,240
Creating pools of capital in your country
through direct foreign investment and

400
00:29:11,241 --> 00:29:13,660
in the way you would get that is through
investments in infrastructure and

401
00:29:13,661 --> 00:29:14,494
security.

402
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,780
Okay. So now we're, we're,

403
00:29:17,781 --> 00:29:21,560
we have veered a long way from education
when we talk about direct foreign

404
00:29:21,561 --> 00:29:23,850
investment.
Um,

405
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:27,080
would you put that as a high priority?

406
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:30,650
Yeah. Higher than education
because I think that that comes,

407
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,690
but I think you need to,
I need to be able to give people jobs and,

408
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,760
and a livelihood before you can
think about educating them. Okay.

409
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:38,803
What do you think Tom?

410
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,120
So I think you're sort of endorsing the
idea of offering your country up is to

411
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,990
be colonialized won't last.
Right. In saying that, well,

412
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:55,310
the best thing that we can do to spur
economic growth is to offer herself as an

413
00:29:55,311 --> 00:29:59,120
extractive nation and we'll build the
roads for people to come in and take out

414
00:29:59,121 --> 00:29:59,940
what they need it.
And I don't,

415
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,430
I don't know if that's the solution
for long term economic with it.

416
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:06,080
That's how I would read
that, uh, interpretation.

417
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,163
Richard,

418
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:16,170
I think in the long run, in order to
build sustainable growth in your country,

419
00:30:16,171 --> 00:30:19,010
if you're starting off where you
don't have any of this infrastructure,

420
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,730
educational facilities in place,

421
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,040
you have to find some sort
of competitive advantage.

422
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,740
And that the initial standpoint
that's going to be your labor,

423
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,120
that's going to be your resources.

424
00:30:27,121 --> 00:30:30,750
Anything you can offer up that's going
to attract investment to build out the

425
00:30:30,751 --> 00:30:34,560
rest of these different, um, you know,
pillars of what you need in society.

426
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:37,740
You can't just start off with here's
the school and we're going to educate

427
00:30:37,741 --> 00:30:40,500
people and they're going to keep
all the value within society.

428
00:30:40,501 --> 00:30:41,550
They're going to capitalize on it.

429
00:30:41,551 --> 00:30:44,130
There's not an incentive
based to really do that.

430
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:47,850
So until you can actually move up the
ladder of competitive advantage and

431
00:30:47,851 --> 00:30:51,060
development of your markets and
education and quality of life,

432
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,090
it's sort of putting the cart
before the horse in my opinion.

433
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,630
Okay. Now, um,

434
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:01,900
what's fairly obvious in this conversation
is that you've got to try to do more

435
00:31:02,241 --> 00:31:04,670
than one thing at once,
right?

436
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,680
We just say education full,
full stop.

437
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:13,250
Or if we say foreign direct investment,
full stop,

438
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,350
we're not going to get it done.

439
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:19,280
And there has to be a complex
spiral of these things.

440
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:25,090
And this is why the book by Clark that
we read is one persuasive on this point

441
00:31:25,371 --> 00:31:29,570
because it takes one thing at a time
and then says, well that won't do it.

442
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,920
And it's the spiraling of
several things at once.

443
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,900
A show shot effect.

444
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:44,330
I think the problem goes back to the
question at hand because of the 5% of the

445
00:31:44,331 --> 00:31:46,580
GDP,
you really can't talk a little louder.

446
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:50,060
I think the problem goes back to the
question at hand because you can't really

447
00:31:50,061 --> 00:31:51,980
do much with 5% of your GDP.

448
00:31:51,981 --> 00:31:55,550
So people are more likely to create this
false dichotomy of options just because

449
00:31:55,551 --> 00:31:56,810
they have limited resources.

450
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,710
Okay. So, but if,

451
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:04,740
if this were a real exercise and you had
control over 5% of the GDP of Cuba or

452
00:32:08,781 --> 00:32:13,750
Peru or Nigeria,
um,

453
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,300
you, what would you do? You've got the 5%,

454
00:32:17,301 --> 00:32:18,920
what's the first thing
you better figure out?

455
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:24,860
I think you have to focus on getting
basic resources and developing a basic

456
00:32:25,231 --> 00:32:29,250
structure. So you may have to forfeit
your emphasis on education immediately.

457
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,220
Okay. So, but the,

458
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,730
what I'm driving at is that you would
want to look at what's already happening

459
00:32:35,731 --> 00:32:39,890
in the right way. Right? You would
want it, you'd want to, there are,

460
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,160
if there are 12 conditions
we're worried about,

461
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,320
you'd want to survey and figure out
that there were three or four where you

462
00:32:48,321 --> 00:32:50,720
could ride somebody
else's dollar so to speak,

463
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:56,950
and then you would figure out some crucial
Shep of others that you would have to

464
00:32:57,351 --> 00:33:00,860
pay your attention to. Does that
sound right? I think that's fair.

465
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,140
I think the problem lies in,
and I'm,

466
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:06,910
I was focusing on central Asian countries
when you gave us this mini assignment

467
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,330
and the problem comes when you devote
everything to foreign direct investment.

468
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,350
When do you stop?

469
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,130
Like when do you transition back to
meeting off those other criteria that you

470
00:33:15,131 --> 00:33:16,150
laid out in the beginning?

471
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:20,890
Okay, so, so it sounds like,

472
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:26,320
it sounds like this a pretty complicated
subject, Richard, I apologize.

473
00:33:26,321 --> 00:33:29,290
Wanted to clarify what we were,
our point was,

474
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:31,510
which is by attracting foreign investment,

475
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:33,310
the idea is that it's
not mutually exclusive.

476
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:38,020
So instead of taking eliminated 5% of
GDP and allocating towards one aspect of

477
00:33:38,021 --> 00:33:42,100
society, if you can signal to
the broader market said, yeah,

478
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,510
you're an attractive investment place.

479
00:33:43,511 --> 00:33:47,260
You've now grown that pool of capital
such that it can be invested through all

480
00:33:47,261 --> 00:33:51,100
the different aspects of what you need
to build society as opposed to cherry

481
00:33:51,101 --> 00:33:55,870
picking one over another. That's the
goal of a tragic multiple investors. So,

482
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,170
so one of,

483
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,630
okay,

484
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:02,620
so the one thing we're at least clear
about is that there is no secret sauce,

485
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:07,150
right? There's no one secret sauce
that is going to get this job done.

486
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:12,670
It's vastly more complex. Now, who did
you have your hand up a moment ago?

487
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,750
I did, but I think it's,
um, it's been a cover. Sure.

488
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:21,310
Okay. Uh, who's, who will
give us a fresh start

489
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,730
all over again.

490
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:33,420
I was going to say that what desoto
keeps emphasizing is the importance of

491
00:34:33,421 --> 00:34:35,290
political leadership.
Somebody forgets,

492
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,500
is that in many of these
developing countries,

493
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:41,070
the political leadership itself is very
corrupt and as long as it's within the

494
00:34:41,071 --> 00:34:44,490
leadership's best interest
to move the society forward.

495
00:34:44,491 --> 00:34:48,510
So I thought that empowering education
will give us better leaders that would

496
00:34:48,511 --> 00:34:53,490
follow desotos ideas of transforming
debt capital last show you and Tom are

497
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:56,200
playing the same tune more
or less? Yeah, same tune.

498
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,120
It's slightly different
rationale. Yeah. Okay, good.

499
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:07,030
I was just about to add to that with an
example actually of a Kosovo case that I

500
00:35:07,031 --> 00:35:09,830
had experienced the summer.
Um, when I was in close,

501
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:13,570
they had a hard time attracting leaders
because most of them had like fled as

502
00:35:13,571 --> 00:35:15,820
refugees and the 99 more,
um,

503
00:35:15,821 --> 00:35:20,821
so the USA ID program had invested in
instead of like this foreign direct

504
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:24,130
investment project. I mean like
there their projects in that as well.

505
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,830
But it professional studies
course that educates leaders,

506
00:35:26,831 --> 00:35:30,370
particularly in finance and
investments in these sorts of things.

507
00:35:30,371 --> 00:35:32,640
So it's bringing the brain drain back,
whoa.

508
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,040
Like back into the country and
investing in leaders instead of,

509
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:38,340
and so then once they have an efficient,

510
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,250
like leadership base, they can go out
and like do these things themselves.

511
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:44,950
Did I just hear you say that MBA education
is the most important thing in the

512
00:35:44,951 --> 00:35:45,784
world?

513
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,400
Would that be nice?

514
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,600
But,
uh,

515
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,040
who would are there?
Why am I doing that?

516
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:05,040
Who would start us with an
entirely different starting point?

517
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,480
Yes.
Wait for the mic.

518
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,733
Yeah.

519
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,210
I don't know how you'd do
this with 5% of the GDP,

520
00:36:15,211 --> 00:36:18,000
but I think if there were a secret sauce,

521
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:21,960
it would be efficiency
and low transaction costs.

522
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:25,110
Is this coming from like my
experience in Latin America,

523
00:36:25,111 --> 00:36:29,100
which like I've worked there and I've
traveled there and I don't even understand

524
00:36:29,101 --> 00:36:33,000
how they do business there ever
because it's so inefficient. Um,

525
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:38,690
like down to little things like I know
when when on Saturdays they don't have

526
00:36:38,911 --> 00:36:43,170
enough coins, but you can only
pay with coins to ride the bus.

527
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,120
But like there's a shortage of coins.

528
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:48,730
And so sometimes you just can't like get
on the bus because you like have cash

529
00:36:48,731 --> 00:36:52,320
but you don't have coins. Um,
so like little things like that,

530
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,730
I don't know how you would like,

531
00:36:53,731 --> 00:36:57,150
where you would even begin to invest
to make those things more efficient.

532
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:01,830
But I think the like foreign directed
investment and the competitive advantage

533
00:37:01,831 --> 00:37:03,120
all flow from that.

534
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:07,890
Like you're not going to be a good
candidate unless you have like low

535
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:09,990
transaction costs within that country.

536
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,003
Okay.

537
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:16,250
So what of what I think I hear you saying
is that you've got to get the coast

538
00:37:16,621 --> 00:37:17,460
there.
I'm working

539
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,170
right and that has something to do
with corruption or a lot to do with

540
00:37:21,171 --> 00:37:24,800
corruption of the government. Yup.
Um, and like the legal system.

541
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,810
Okay, go ahead. Yes.

542
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:37,650
A couple of things I do here,
so if you're getting 5% of the GDP,

543
00:37:37,651 --> 00:37:41,190
one thing that we should keep in mind
is that we can assume that the economy

544
00:37:41,191 --> 00:37:42,150
will go on forever.

545
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:47,230
So I have not spent 5% of the GDP in that
way given ERL divided over a number of

546
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,290
years.

547
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:54,290
The second is that the money that I'd
be getting and not leave a penny in the

548
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:57,090
hands of the comment,
I would give it to the private sector,

549
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:01,770
Al Yamaka thousand villages and as the
private sector to use that money in those

550
00:38:01,771 --> 00:38:05,670
thousand villages the next year
based on their performances.

551
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,270
The second allotment that I would get
out of that 5% of the GDP would be again

552
00:38:09,271 --> 00:38:11,460
given to the private companies
who have performed well,

553
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:15,480
now I'll leave it up to them.
How do they want to develop the villages?

554
00:38:15,481 --> 00:38:19,410
That can be a holistic development.
It can be a incomplete development,

555
00:38:19,411 --> 00:38:21,090
it can be corrupt development.

556
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:25,230
But the second year three sources
would be only going on the basis of the

557
00:38:25,231 --> 00:38:26,340
quality of the development.

558
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:26,871
Okay.

559
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:31,871
So what you want to do is put as much
rocket fuel as you can in the rockets that

560
00:38:32,151 --> 00:38:32,984
are already moving.

561
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,920
Exactly.
But it makes sure that the rockets,

562
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,280
the next day, the rockets move based
on the performance of the rockets.

563
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,210
And if you were a public official, would,
would there be some problem about that?

564
00:38:44,211 --> 00:38:48,500
You imagine a lot of problems,
right?

565
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,251
Because I mean,

566
00:38:49,251 --> 00:38:54,251
the natural tendency is to redistribute
from the functioning rackets to the

567
00:38:55,161 --> 00:38:57,530
nonfunctioning rockets.
Right?

568
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:02,590
And the action we saw at 20 times
earlier in term about how a defining

569
00:39:04,611 --> 00:39:07,990
characteristic of capitalism is
that failing enterprise with spam.

570
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,450
Right? And that's one of the ways
capitalism becomes a learning machine.

571
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,300
So,
um,

572
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:21,940
you are a cruel,
a cruel but wise man.

573
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,333
Yes.

574
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:28,280
In many ways.
This is,

575
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,960
I guess the sort of the
opposite of the last comment,

576
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:35,990
but you could also see some validity to
the point of using that money to try to,

577
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:41,160
um, improve government and capacity
and their sounds because as we've been

578
00:39:41,161 --> 00:39:41,731
discussing,

579
00:39:41,731 --> 00:39:46,650
the government is really a strong point
for creating the stability needed for

580
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:49,200
investment in other,
in other parts of the economy.

581
00:39:49,201 --> 00:39:53,530
So if there was some way to say like,

582
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,450
use,

583
00:39:54,451 --> 00:39:59,451
use the money to increase the reach of
the government into more rural regions of

584
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:04,170
the country or to create secure borders,

585
00:40:04,171 --> 00:40:05,510
things like that.
Um,

586
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:10,680
that I think that that could
have a potentially positive
effect and it's a sort

587
00:40:10,681 --> 00:40:13,960
of a more direct,
um,

588
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,920
direct and centralized use of it.
So it might be a little bit easier.

589
00:40:16,921 --> 00:40:20,730
Obviously you run into problems with
corruption in government and that's minor,

590
00:40:20,731 --> 00:40:21,560
but

591
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:26,210
so that's a very plausible thought,
right? Where you have a weak state,

592
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:31,580
which doesn't have the ability,
ability to actually enforce the law,

593
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,570
uh,

594
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:36,930
or to carry out policy and an
effective way, say in rural areas,

595
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:42,560
think of western China or large chunks
of Afghanistan or nearly all of Somalia,

596
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,640
uh,
strengthening the state.

597
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:52,670
If you've got the right incentives for
the people who benefit directly from the

598
00:40:53,371 --> 00:40:54,270
increment of power,

599
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,750
you've got to have the right people
there with the right incentives.

600
00:40:57,751 --> 00:40:59,580
And if you have the wrong
people with the wrong incentive,

601
00:40:59,581 --> 00:41:01,020
you're actually gonna make things worse.

602
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:05,030
Okay.
Tall.

603
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,410
I sort of have two different,
very different ideas.

604
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:17,880
One that's sort of bottom up and when
that sort of top down from two different

605
00:41:17,881 --> 00:41:21,740
parts of the world, the first
one that sort of bottom up, uh,

606
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:25,560
would build on the work of
sort of micro finance. Um,

607
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:30,740
especially in India and countries like
that where we've seen that if you give

608
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:34,550
entrepreneurs, even at the
village, some basic capital,

609
00:41:34,551 --> 00:41:38,420
they can even based on their input
that they're dead capital sort of,

610
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:42,550
they can turn it into live
capitol, um, themselves, um,

611
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,450
especially women.
Um,

612
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:48,230
and if you focus on that you can maybe
build up sort of a local economy that's

613
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:50,750
sustainable in its own right and not just,
um,

614
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:56,720
sort of at the whim of
FDI at the same time.

615
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:01,310
Um, to use a part of the world that I'm
a little more familiar with. Um, Israel,

616
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:05,600
my parents are from Israel and spent
a good deal of time. There used to be,

617
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:09,770
it was built up. I'm going to keep
boot system of socialist system,

618
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:10,910
um,

619
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:15,410
and had many of the same problems of
the former communist nations almost at

620
00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:19,040
first and then transitioned
into a much more capitalist,

621
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:22,700
a market oriented economy,
one that is arguably quite strong.

622
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:27,740
And part of the way that was accomplished
was as much as it pains me to say

623
00:42:27,741 --> 00:42:31,520
through state sponsored enterprise
as much in the way that China, um,

624
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,560
accomplished it.
Um,

625
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:38,860
and in the sort of building up of basic
utilities and infrastructure and the

626
00:42:40,311 --> 00:42:43,790
companies that serve the people's
needs for those and then sort of spread

627
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:44,624
outwards,

628
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:49,690
eventually turning that informal sort
of communal property into individual

629
00:42:50,061 --> 00:42:52,080
property and live capital.

630
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:57,470
Okay, let's stop and take
stock here for a minute,

631
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,270
right? We've heard, um,

632
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:04,070
a dozen or 15 points of view,
uh,

633
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,440
every single one of them intelligent,

634
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,280
oh and no single one of them.
Any major fraction of an answer.

635
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:19,710
So there is some pattern
of webbing together,

636
00:43:19,711 --> 00:43:20,820
different strategies

637
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:26,630
and of costume fitting,
uh,

638
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,920
those strategies to the circumstance of
actual countries and actual cultures and

639
00:43:32,821 --> 00:43:37,740
actual governmental systems and
actual infrastructure systems.

640
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:43,310
We've said very little so far today
about infrastructure and arguably,

641
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,301
uh,
trains.

642
00:43:45,301 --> 00:43:50,301
Planes harbored all lap
a should be at important,

643
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:55,950
at least late stage and very possibly
middle stage element in our strategy.

644
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,220
Uh, next time, uh,

645
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:04,700
where our text is the white tiger and I
would like to be able to call on you to

646
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:11,610
bring forth the anecdotes from white
tiger because we're going to use it as

647
00:44:11,611 --> 00:44:12,444
follows.

648
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:18,230
The circumstances described in this
brilliant novel are almost invariably

649
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:24,450
circumstances that are
destructive of wealth formation.

650
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:30,610
And so think about the search,
the events,

651
00:44:30,611 --> 00:44:31,770
which happened the book,

652
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:36,300
and then in class we're going to flip
them on their heads, so to speak,

653
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:41,070
and talk about what might be beneficial.

654
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,000
Uh,

655
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
to the protagonist and more generally to
a village in India and a village Indian

656
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,640
Indians who come in the
language of the book,

657
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,790
out of the darkness into the cities.
Uh,

658
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:02,930
and I'll show you a short film
clip of a company called Selco,

659
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:10,040
which is in the business of making off
grid electric lighting for village in

660
00:45:10,191 --> 00:45:13,890
India. Uh, and then
before the end of term,

661
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:18,750
you'll see a full business case about
this company. It's a for profit company,

662
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:24,600
uh, and it depends on
micro finance to sell, uh,

663
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,493
lighting.

664
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:30,900
There are many parts of India where there
just isn't any artificial light. And,

665
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,780
uh, uh, it's, uh, quite,

666
00:45:33,781 --> 00:45:38,400
quite inspiring and interesting case.
So I'll see you on Monday.

667
00:45:38,401 --> 00:45:42,960
And if you haven't yet read
every last page of white tiger,

668
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,120
do it over the weekend.
