1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,270
Think back to this was meeting six.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,530
It's about the rise of the
Joint Stock Corporation and

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,680
the Joint Stock Corporation is without
doubt the most important institution in

4
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:19,910
the world economy today.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,780
It's only rival might be
states or governments,

6
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,890
but it is just a
massively important thing.

7
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:34,180
And the question of how it got here and
why it takes the form it does is our

8
00:00:35,781 --> 00:00:40,580
topic today. Let's begin with Adam
Smith. Oh, we've got projection.

9
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,490
I'm going to just talk for a while anyway.
Uh,

10
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:49,580
begin with which somebody would one of
you guys go up there and get that on

11
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:54,581
slide one slide show and I'll
rejoin it when we get there.

12
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,343
Um,

13
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:02,410
Adam Smith in talking about the invisible
hand is also at lengths to say that

14
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:10,901
the productive use of the division of
Labor kicks in only when you get big

15
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:16,151
markets only where market scale justifies
and elaborate division of labor and a

16
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:21,380
large investment of capital.

17
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,280
Do you get the benefits of capitalism
really in tiny markets where you're making

18
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:36,590
a, for example, clothing for
others in a village of a thousand,

19
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:42,970
the possibility of a sophisticated
manufacturing scheme,

20
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,313
which,

21
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,340
okay, we're almost there. Here we go.

22
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,860
It's really embarrassing to be
a clutch in front of this night.

23
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,823
Paypal,

24
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,980
somebody who knows his stuff,
please do this navigator.

25
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,523
Yeah.

26
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,280
Yeah.
Get it into navigator.

27
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:20,530
And then on the slide one and
play slide show and we're set. Um,

28
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,980
so Smith talks about scaled markets and
the great limitation on scaled markets,

29
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:29,840
uh,

30
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,840
until the early 18 hundreds was the
poor quality of land transportation.

31
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:42,650
Uh, ocean transportation had by
that time gotten pretty good. Uh,

32
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,630
sailing ships had gotten better and better
in the three or 400 years before 1800

33
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,420
and steam ships. Thank you
so much. Uh, and steam ships,

34
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,700
uh,
had improved that,

35
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,363
but

36
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,560
I'm going to skip some slides.
Uh,

37
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:09,330
but the great interior of
all the continents, uh,

38
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,500
still relied on transportation systems,

39
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,320
none of which were superior to a horse.

40
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:21,050
The cheapest form of
transportation was canal shipping,

41
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:22,611
uh,

42
00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:27,611
where the motor power was essentially a
horse on a draw path next to the next to

43
00:03:27,771 --> 00:03:28,640
the canal.

44
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:35,170
And then beginning in the 1820s and
accelerating decade after decade,

45
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,490
uh,
into the 1860s,

46
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,040
the railroad took over
for the first time ever.

47
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:51,041
One could move freight vastly faster
than a horse and vastly cheaper than any

48
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:57,320
previous, uh, means of transportation. The

49
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,080
cities grew up initially at the
intersection of ocean shipping,

50
00:04:06,631 --> 00:04:08,700
coast-wide shipping and canals,

51
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,810
and they grew up because there was always
an economic advantage to being at the

52
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:21,150
junction point between the
main systems of transportation.

53
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,130
Rail took this and
raised it by many powers.

54
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,310
The American rail network.
This is a simplified map.

55
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:40,860
Rand McNally from 1944 and
it's about passenger rail,

56
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,150
but the,
and the,

57
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,180
the real density of the u s rail network
is about five times what this suggests.

58
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,200
But that density created exactly
what Adam Smith contemplated,

59
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,310
a gigantic market where the division of
labor could be refined to a much higher

60
00:05:03,631 --> 00:05:05,550
level than ever before.

61
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:07,960
Yeah.

62
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,190
One result of that.

63
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,280
This is a contemporary map of greater
New York and the coloring is dollars of

64
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,880
earned income per square mile and the
densest places right around in here,

65
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,660
uh, reached past 10 billion,
such dollars per square mile.

66
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,830
And the great cities of the
world are invariably once today,

67
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,480
which enjoy powerful rail transportation,

68
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,620
generally sub supplemented
by water transportation,

69
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:49,621
but rail and New New York's extraordinary
extraordinary advantage as an a

70
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:54,370
gateway to the interior of
the United States by water,

71
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:57,770
first up through the Hudson and then
across the Erie canal to the Great Lakes.

72
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,520
And then beginning with
the 1840 [inaudible], uh,

73
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:08,390
a fabulous deep water harbor for shipments
to the rest of the world connected by

74
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:11,120
rail, uh, to the entire continent.

75
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:17,030
The double challenge faced by railroads.
Two things.

76
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,310
One, they were very expensive
to build. So finance,

77
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,390
finance,
capital,

78
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,690
raising large amounts of money in order
to construct railways was one challenge.

79
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:36,440
And in some senses, and even greater
challenge was actually running a railroad.

80
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:42,730
It turns out that railroads
get an inordinately
complicated after they get big,

81
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,480
when they are one section
of about 40 or 50 miles.

82
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,960
Railroads are actually not
very complicated things to run,

83
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,970
but when they get to be hundreds
or even thousands of miles,

84
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,980
the logistics of management
get extremely challenging.

85
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:05,270
So you have two challenges. One is
finance, the other is operations.

86
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,910
And let's start with operations.
Uh, in the 19th century,

87
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:12,800
train collisions occurred at,
at,

88
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:17,890
at rates varying from about 400 to
a thousand a year in the u s uh,

89
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:23,231
and they were often ugly and they
reflected the challenge of management.

90
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,060
Uh, this is a simple one
section rail that operated, uh,

91
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:36,320
in the 1840s and fifties between
Boston and Worcester, Massachusetts.

92
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,370
Almost all the railroads
built just one track.

93
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,590
And the question was,

94
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:46,520
how do you run trains back and
forth between these two cities, uh,

95
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,720
without collisions?

96
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:52,850
And the solution it's in Chandler that
these people had was to instruct the,

97
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
the engineers of the trains beginning
at the two end cities to proceed to

98
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:05,030
Framingham and one turns
and each take a right turn,

99
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:06,890
so to speak.
Uh,

100
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:11,891
and sit there until the other train is
in view after the other train is in view

101
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:15,890
and stopped, proceed to the neck,
proceed to the, the end of your journey.

102
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:21,350
Pretty simple management. And that
railroad had only about 50 employees.

103
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,660
It was, you know, four trips a
day. And a very simple thing,

104
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:32,650
but characteristic of capitalism is
that people are not content with small

105
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:38,411
success and they therefore try to string
together many short railroads on the

106
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:46,640
theory that average cost will decline
as scale of operation increases.

107
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,120
The New York central system,

108
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:55,100
which was the glitziest of
all the railways at its peak,

109
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,020
it's peak coming,
uh,

110
00:08:58,021 --> 00:09:03,021
roughly from the period of world
war one to the end of World War Two.

111
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,490
Uh,

112
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:10,200
this railroad was created
by splicing together,

113
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,900
uh,
dozens of little railroads.

114
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,120
The Mohawk and Hudson ran
between Schenectady and
Albany and it was the kernel

115
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:22,670
from which this was formed. Uh, the,

116
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,560
it's one, one, uh,

117
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,600
aggregation after another and the
construction of that marvelous terminal in

118
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,460
Midtown Manhattan,
which we're all familiar with.

119
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:41,020
And ultimately after the thing,
uh,

120
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,000
reaches the end of its end
of its competitive lifecycle.

121
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:49,440
And The New York central railroad was
essentially at the end of its competitive

122
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:54,441
lifecycle by the 1950s and
it was there because what,

123
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,650
what, what was hard on railroads?
What was hard on passenger railroads?

124
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:04,200
Long haul passenger railroads.
This is a soft pitch guys. Yes.

125
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:10,190
Highway system and on and on freight.

126
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:14,790
What was the big competitor?
Uh, overland. Okay.

127
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:19,791
So the interstate highway system with
tracking and ultimately deregulated

128
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:23,040
tracking, which was
much more efficient. Uh,

129
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,890
the competitive position
of railroads seemed, uh,

130
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:31,910
to be terminal and the Pennsylvania
railroad and the New York central were

131
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:37,431
combined in a bankruptcy proceeding in
1968 to form the Penn central system,

132
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,380
uh, which, uh,

133
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,970
soon went bankrupt and it went bankrupt
because the two managements hated each

134
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:49,971
other and each did as little as
possible to help the other succeed.

135
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,450
The, and this idea of a
mortal life cycle of the,

136
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,720
of the corporation is a one
which comes up again and again.

137
00:10:57,721 --> 00:11:01,020
A week from today we'll do
the Polaroid corporation,

138
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,600
which begins as a brilliant,

139
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:08,580
innovative firm and ends up
playing defense against other,

140
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:13,550
more brilliant, more innovative
firms. Uh, only, uh, uh, uh,

141
00:11:13,551 --> 00:11:15,960
a generation and a half after it began.

142
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,030
So what really happens
with railroads when you,

143
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,590
if you don't know how to run up and the
early railroads, nobody knew how to run,

144
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:29,970
was that as the railroad
scope or scale got larger,

145
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,070
average costs actually went up.

146
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:38,150
And the reason they went up was that you
had to build a mammoth bureaucracy to

147
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:41,550
run the thing.
Uh,

148
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:45,360
the Pennsylvania railroad
got to 50,000 employees fast.

149
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,740
And the challenge of how to
organize that large workforce,

150
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,000
uh,
became severe.

151
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,020
The first cut was spatial,

152
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,510
the without the kind of surveillance and,
uh,

153
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,910
information technology we have today.

154
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,650
They had the telegraph fairly
early on and that's all they had.

155
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,530
And the,

156
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,680
the control over a massive network.

157
00:12:17,681 --> 00:12:19,910
This is the New York central system,
uh,

158
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,440
meant that they cut the system into
sections and created a set of authorities

159
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:27,280
within each such section.

160
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,400
The ones I've drawn here in
red [inaudible] illustrative.

161
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:32,720
Okay.

162
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,560
Uh,
then there was a division of function.

163
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,310
There were people who
worried about railroad cars.

164
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,310
There were people who worried about track.

165
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,390
There were people who dealt with
passengers, others with freight, finance,

166
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,210
cost accounting,
human resources and so on.

167
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,220
So you have all these functional stripes.

168
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:00,020
All this is Chandler. I'm just
simplifying what he says. Uh,

169
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,960
these functional stripes.

170
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:07,410
And then you've got the geographic
sections and the question becomes,

171
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,750
what do you do with the intersections?

172
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,770
And the chief? My, no,

173
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,350
my comments didn't survive.

174
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:22,730
I had amusing comments in which I
thought there were amusing in which known

175
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:26,870
personalities, creative problems. And the,

176
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,670
the fundamental
administrative question was,

177
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,970
do you let the functional groups,

178
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,800
Boston geographic groups around or do
you let the geographic groups boss the

179
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:40,000
functional groups around?

180
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,590
And what ended up happening was,
okay,

181
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:47,630
okay,

182
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,480
this pattern,

183
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:53,160
which ultimately gives priority
to the geographic groups,

184
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:59,060
it creates enormous power at the top in
general management and the top people in

185
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:06,210
an American railroad. We're
very well compensated, uh,

186
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,720
often, uh, took on ownership stakes. Uh,

187
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,690
and we're true big shots.

188
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:17,010
The functional people
operated as staff to them.

189
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,830
The people who did accounting,
the people who did finance,

190
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,580
the people who did construction
maintenance, rolling stock and so on.

191
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:29,570
And then there were a several
tiers of specific managers,

192
00:14:29,961 --> 00:14:34,260
superintendent with responsibility
for geographic areas.

193
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:39,650
And they too had functionally divided
staff people to worry about the rolling

194
00:14:39,691 --> 00:14:42,060
stock, the track, the
construction, et cetera.

195
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,880
And the pivotal,

196
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:50,170
pivotal decision makers were always
the people with a geographic focus.

197
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,670
They were the ones who had
to take all the factors,

198
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:59,390
all the functions together
and make the thing work.

199
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:05,380
They became the first general managers
of the modern description that Mbas are

200
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:08,350
training for.
Jeez.

201
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:13,510
Essentially the origin of the managerial
managerially operated joint stock

202
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:21,100
corporation. The Europeans
used a different, um,

203
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,500
a different pattern,
which gave priority to the functions.

204
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,320
And by and large, uh, the
American system worked better.

205
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:33,530
Now, why are European trains so much
better than American trains today?

206
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:38,090
Anybody know what's here?
Socialist.

207
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,590
Okay. Yeah. Socialism is part of it. Uh,

208
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,460
w please elaborate too.
Let's get from one word to Tim.

209
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,860
We've got Mike.

210
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:58,750
Uh,
people seem to be more comfortable,

211
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,510
good bourbon a project.

212
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:12,910
Okay. And this is particularly true
of Cottonelle Europe, I think, uh,

213
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,560
where the trains have become, uh, in many,

214
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:22,000
not quite all cases, uh,
publicly operated, uh,

215
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:26,740
systems. There's another reason.
There's a historical reason.

216
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,090
The gasoline price of gasoline,
that's another point.

217
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,130
I hadn't actually connected the dots.

218
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,270
Gasoline there is roughly two
or three times what it is here.

219
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,480
So passenger train for short and
middle sized runs makes a lot of sense.

220
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,950
Big historical event.
Yes.

221
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:46,923
The Internet

222
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,680
say again, like they
didn't have highways. Okay.

223
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:58,480
I think, well, some of them did. I mean
the German Autobahn was pretty impressive.

224
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,700
Um, even if the Nazis built it,
it was pretty good highway. The,

225
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,940
um,
what I'm fishing for here is World War II.

226
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,600
World War II destroyed the European rail
system and because it was destroyed and

227
00:17:13,181 --> 00:17:17,260
because of the u s Marshall Fund, which
paid for an awful lot of reconstruction,

228
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:22,570
uh, they started more or less from
scratch and made the thing work.

229
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:28,110
And we had this higgledy piggledy remnant
of a previous period and never really

230
00:17:30,371 --> 00:17:35,110
made the investment
by socialism or capitalism.

231
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,450
The challenge of finance
was, uh, equally important.

232
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,750
Perhaps more important historically,

233
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:50,420
a project that involved a
high capital investment.

234
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,440
We're funded locally,

235
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,870
people made investments within
small circles within one city,

236
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,780
uh,
within the people who live next to it.

237
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,860
The zone where people living next to a
canal or a segment of a canal would in

238
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:10,080
effect buy bonds and finance the thing.

239
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:14,100
Railroads were catastrophic,
really expensive.

240
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:19,170
They sucked up vast amounts of capital.
And so a device

241
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,560
as in the, this bridge, the EADS bridge
in St Louis, over the Mississippi,

242
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,630
there were hundreds,

243
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:32,220
even thousands of terrifically expensive
construction projects to be financed.

244
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:37,650
And the mechanism chosen was
the joint stock corporation.

245
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:44,300
And the forms of,
uh,

246
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,710
of funding took were of two main kinds.

247
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,360
I'm going to get to
some detail in a minute.

248
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:55,870
One were railroad bonds where people in
effect loaned money to the railroads and

249
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,530
achieved a,
a predictable income,

250
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:05,360
relatively predictable income
from that investment in debt.

251
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,900
The other was the joint stock queer you
bought into the equity of the company

252
00:19:13,461 --> 00:19:15,560
and became a partial owner.

253
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,490
So world railroad grid.

254
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,520
And I'd like you to just in passing
notice the very uneven density of it.

255
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,120
And the fairly strong
correlation between the density,

256
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:38,140
the railroad grid and
the wealth of the place.

257
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:44,220
The railroads were both cause and effect
of capitalist development where the

258
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,850
railroads, there was capitalist
development where capitalist development,

259
00:19:48,851 --> 00:19:53,851
railroads and colonialism had artifact
Africa's railway system got developed,

260
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,950
not so much to create internal markets
as to get goods quickly and efficiently

261
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,660
out for shipment to uh,
the uh,

262
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:10,660
metropolitan power,
which uh,

263
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,970
which controlled the colonization.

264
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:20,120
Okay. No, a chart, the dreaded chart.

265
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,960
And here we've,

266
00:20:22,961 --> 00:20:27,961
we have on the vertical dimension
three major forms of ownership.

267
00:20:29,001 --> 00:20:32,060
Indeed, these are the three most
important forms of ownership.

268
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:37,370
Proprietorship means outright ownership.
You just own it.

269
00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:38,204
End of story.

270
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:44,660
Partnership means what it
says and interestingly,

271
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:47,920
and for reasons you'll probably figure
out by the end of the hour if you don't

272
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:48,760
know it already,

273
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:54,300
partnerships tend to be used
in a certain kind of company.

274
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,440
And it's a company where the value of the
firm consists largely in the talent of

275
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:01,960
its employees.

276
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,990
So that the big consulting firms,
the big investment banks,

277
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,011
uh,

278
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:14,011
the big law firms all take the form
of partnerships and that they are,

279
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:21,280
and that actually changes at one of
the HBS cases you're getting is the one

280
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:25,210
where Goldman Sachs ceases to be a
partnership and becomes a company.

281
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,930
Uh, and of course third,
the joint stock corporation.

282
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:34,570
Then we look at each of
these, uh, with the five,

283
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,120
uh, considerations across
the top in mind. One is how,

284
00:21:39,121 --> 00:21:42,520
what's the accountability chain here?
How do we keep people doing their job?

285
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,060
How do we see the difference between a
job well done in a job poorly done? Uh,

286
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,290
the second is the role of ownership

287
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,120
and uh,
the third is liability.

288
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:59,530
Every one of these is a huge
factor in understanding this. Uh,

289
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,660
the fourth is liquidity.
If I own something or a part of something,

290
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:09,580
how easy is it for me to
sell out? Uh, and finally,

291
00:22:09,581 --> 00:22:10,510
scalability,

292
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,680
to what extent can we start with something
small and grow something enormous?

293
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,960
And the three forms,

294
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,260
very importantly in each of
these five dimensions and I,

295
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,540
I'm afraid I'm going to
walk you through them.

296
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,000
The chain of a chain of accountability
and a proprietorship is pretty simple.

297
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:36,520
I own it, I run it. I'm the boss.
I hire and fire the employees.

298
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,110
I make the business decisions.

299
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:42,280
I don't submit plans to anyone else.
I just do it.

300
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:48,510
And in a very small enterprise that
has its advantages in a partnership,

301
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:55,870
things are more complicated.
The trouble with a partnership is this,

302
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:00,760
every partner has a right
to participate in management

303
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,450
and I can't,

304
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:08,380
I can't admit a new partner without
the consent of the other partners.

305
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:12,580
Now the workaround for this is the,

306
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,380
the hybrid form,

307
00:23:14,381 --> 00:23:18,370
which creates a general partner who
runs it and then a bunch of limited

308
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:23,371
investment partners who participate
passively and lots and lots of things take

309
00:23:24,431 --> 00:23:29,290
that, that hybrid form. But the
pure partnership is very awkward.

310
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,110
You've got to talk to
everybody all the time.

311
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,560
It's like being married to a
room full of people at once.

312
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:41,340
What a nightmare.
Uh,

313
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:45,160
the corporation, the chain of
accountability is very different.

314
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,280
And
it looks like this.

315
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,850
You've got investors over here,

316
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,300
you've got capital
markets with brokerages,

317
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,680
a stock exchanges and such. Like, uh,

318
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:04,550
then you've got a board of directors,
then top management,

319
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,250
then layers of other management,

320
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:10,460
and then layer upon layer
of regular employees.

321
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,620
And the chain of accountability
is the white line.

322
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:21,460
And I've made this one a little
crooked because it is a little crooked.

323
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:27,260
Have you, how many of you own
stock in a specific company? Not.

324
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:28,700
Okay.
Can,

325
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,900
can we get a mic down to this gentleman
here with the olive colored shirt please?

326
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,290
Uh,
is it a publicly traded company?

327
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:43,980
Name it please.

328
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,193
Pardon?

329
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:53,030
Okay. And, uh, you take an active
role in running the company.

330
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,720
Uh, do you like everything
that management does?

331
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,553
Yeah.

332
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,130
Uh,
why don't you fix it then?

333
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:10,130
Okay. And, and if you
called up the CEO and said,

334
00:25:10,131 --> 00:25:15,080
I don't like what you're doing, how do
you imagine the conversation would run?

335
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,210
We'd be short. And what
would his suggestion? He is
not in decent suggestion.

336
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,703
Pardon?

337
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,860
Okay.
Pound sand or sell the damn stock.

338
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,900
You don't like it,

339
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:38,930
get out right and the characteristically
week control that investors have here

340
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:47,730
puts enormous important
on the exit option.

341
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:48,901
Indeed,

342
00:25:48,901 --> 00:25:53,901
the exit option becomes dominant
and in day trading for example,

343
00:25:54,991 --> 00:25:59,970
what people are doing is owning
companies for very short periods,

344
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:05,810
owning tiny slices of companies for
very short periods and exercising.

345
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,580
No influence or accountability,
but just I don't like it.

346
00:26:11,581 --> 00:26:14,220
I'm gone or the,

347
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,770
I believe the price is going to fall.

348
00:26:16,771 --> 00:26:21,771
I'll short the stock and get out so that
what you've created here is a brilliant

349
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:29,490
device for scooping up small amounts of
investment from a large amount of people,

350
00:26:29,491 --> 00:26:30,600
a large number of people.

351
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,830
So that with the joint stock
corporation you can have thousands,

352
00:26:34,831 --> 00:26:37,830
tens of thousands,
hundreds of thousands of investors.

353
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,300
They don't know each other. They don't
talk to each other. By and large,

354
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:47,810
only the large institutional investors
track the company's behavior with any

355
00:26:48,301 --> 00:26:49,134
care.

356
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,740
The specific fundamentals of the
company and the the distancing.

357
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,670
Think about proprietorship where the,

358
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,120
where the boss is in the
shop and partnership,

359
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,240
where the owners are the
partners who actually do it.

360
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:11,610
We've come a long way from that with
the joint stock corporation and it's an

361
00:27:11,611 --> 00:27:15,870
extremely efficient device
for raising money in that way.

362
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:22,130
The internal operation on the other
hand is complex and you've got market

363
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:26,070
mechanisms of exchange outside the firm,

364
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:30,510
but inside the firm you've
got to manage people,

365
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,880
you've got to incent them,

366
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:38,570
motivate them to do what needs doing
for the firm and the board of directors

367
00:27:40,051 --> 00:27:45,051
plays a symbolically central role in all
this because they pick top management

368
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:52,260
and top management is accountable to them,
at least in theory.

369
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,880
And if you think about the recent
crisis in American capitalism,

370
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:02,510
a lot of it has to do with the fact
that boards have failed sometimes

371
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:09,351
catastrophic Lee to exercise any real
accountability on top management.

372
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:15,360
The characteristic problem,

373
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:19,110
which I've mentioned to you a couple
of times about the firm is so called

374
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:20,400
principal agency.

375
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:26,340
I hire you to do something and
you go off and do it or not.

376
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:31,740
For example, let's suppose I
run something as simple as a bar

377
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,650
and I hire you.

378
00:28:34,651 --> 00:28:39,651
I'm not there in the evening and I hired
you to run the bar and I give you an an

379
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:43,590
an hourly wage and I
let you keep your tips,

380
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:45,983
uh,

381
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:51,260
what might occur to you as a way to
maximize your income at my expense

382
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:59,250
free. Who set it? Free
drinks or the very deep poor,

383
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,110
right? You order a scotch,
I pour you a double.

384
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:10,130
You Save the five bucks and
give me two of them. Uh,

385
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,370
and the characteristic of the
situation is that you have,

386
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,480
what's your advantage over
me in scamming me this way?

387
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:24,120
You keep the tips, but how do you
manage to get away with it? If you,

388
00:29:24,121 --> 00:29:27,930
if you called me up and said I'm going
to do this, I'd say you're fired.

389
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:33,840
Right? But you get away
with it. Why I'm not there.

390
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,650
You have the eyes and ears
on the scene and I don't.

391
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:42,190
So you're the agent, you have
a, this is so called asymmetry,

392
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,220
you know a lot more than I
do about what you're doing.

393
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:51,210
And so the characteristic problem for
four people trying to manage inside the

394
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:57,241
box inside the firm is to keep others
for whom they are for whose achievements

395
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,940
or malfeasance. They're accountable
to keep them motivated and honest.

396
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,950
The role of ownership,

397
00:30:08,951 --> 00:30:13,060
the sole proprietor runs the
thing simple as that partnership.

398
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:16,660
They are all there except if
you have the general partner.

399
00:30:16,661 --> 00:30:21,340
But in general the partners say in
a law firm they are all involved.

400
00:30:21,341 --> 00:30:26,341
They will typically create an an an
executive committee and maybe a managing

401
00:30:26,861 --> 00:30:31,030
partner, but pushed to Shovin
and disagreement about the firm.

402
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:36,270
They are all part of management and you
make them that because they are your

403
00:30:37,631 --> 00:30:41,860
assets. In a good law firm, the
real assets are the lawyers.

404
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,430
Okay?

405
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:48,030
In the corporation,
the ownership role is,

406
00:30:48,031 --> 00:30:51,570
as we saw a few minutes ago,
strongly attenuated.

407
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,650
Now in actual,
in actual fact,

408
00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:00,710
there are cases where a stockholder's
rise up against management and uh,

409
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:06,480
throw managed, throw the board
out and with a new board,
throw the management out.

410
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,450
It does happen.
It's just rare.

411
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,380
And it's rare because
the transaction costs,

412
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:18,410
just the time and effort required to
organize the shareholders is quite extreme

413
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,510
stocks. This is a, uh,

414
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:28,640
1998 tabulation of the percentage
of us households by income strata,

415
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,430
uh, high, higher in yellow
and lowest in green,

416
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:36,600
uh,

417
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,310
who directly or indirectly
own among our own companies.

418
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,180
And the,

419
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,670
the just is just what you
would think it would be.

420
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,800
You have a majority of people with six
figure incomes and you've got to inflate

421
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:56,870
a little bit here from 1998 to now.
Um,

422
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:00,450
people with relatively high incomes,
uh,

423
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:04,080
are predominantly,
uh,

424
00:32:04,081 --> 00:32:09,081
owners of companies and
the rate of ownership,

425
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:14,940
uh, scales down with income, which
makes quite a lot of intuitive sense,

426
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,840
but most of the stock is
held in very small parcels.

427
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:26,780
And the putting together of,
uh,

428
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,150
forget a majority putting
together enough to be noticed,

429
00:32:30,151 --> 00:32:33,960
which begins at about five, 5%, uh,

430
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,480
is a major task

431
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,070
liability with a proprietorship.

432
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:48,720
If you do a harm to someone
else, a tort, as lawyers say,

433
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:54,290
if you sell someone a
contaminated bottle of,

434
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:57,720
of drinking water,
uh,

435
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,990
they can sue you without limit.

436
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:07,250
If you're proprietorship is worth
$100,000 and you've also got a home where

437
00:33:08,341 --> 00:33:13,341
$300,000 and savings worth another
hundred thousand dollars to make half a

438
00:33:13,681 --> 00:33:16,860
million dollars,
they can go after all of that.

439
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:22,910
There is no protection against lawsuits
in the proprietorship form with

440
00:33:25,321 --> 00:33:28,140
partnerships.
Things are as bad or worse.

441
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:33,270
Let's suppose Tim here and
I are partners and Tim,

442
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:35,463
uh,

443
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:41,140
for reasons known only to himself creates
a catastrophic train wreck on the line

444
00:33:43,971 --> 00:33:47,750
between new haven and New York one
day and does it in the name of our

445
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:48,561
proprietorship.

446
00:33:48,561 --> 00:33:53,561
Maybe we're in the business of something
for trains and I'm on vacation in

447
00:33:55,341 --> 00:33:59,360
Europe and Tim calls me up and says,
we've killed 110 people.

448
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:04,670
Uh, things are really
only the bleak my problem.

449
00:34:04,671 --> 00:34:09,200
Then of course, I'm sorry for Tim, I'm
sorry that Tim will suffer from this,

450
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:14,500
but I'm even sorry or about me because
the principle of joint and several

451
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:19,721
liability applies to partnerships so
that the litigant can choose among the

452
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:25,820
partners and go after
all the deepest pockets.

453
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:32,270
And that is a,
that is a really major,

454
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:37,890
a flaw in the ownership structure design
from the individual point of view.

455
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:44,920
The most striking single thing about the
joint stock corporation is that it has

456
00:34:45,831 --> 00:34:47,120
limited liability

457
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,860
and the

458
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:56,040
by limited liability we mean if you own
a hundred shares and they have a value

459
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,370
of $7 a piece,
there's $700 worth of capital.

460
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:06,600
The most you can lose is that
$700 no matter what the firm does,

461
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:12,750
the firm could blow up the Atlantic coast
and your liability would be limited to

462
00:35:13,661 --> 00:35:16,780
the $700 which would be in effect.

463
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:20,290
You can lose all of your investment,
but you can't do worse.

464
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,930
Now that's a hell of a deal.

465
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:28,450
That's an enormously attractive deal and
if you think about the purpose of the

466
00:35:28,451 --> 00:35:31,090
joint stock corporation,
it's easy to understand.

467
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:37,170
It's easy to understand because we
want people to make investments over

468
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:42,501
something they can't control and
can't really see inside very clearly.

469
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,210
Now we will,

470
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:49,500
I'll ask you before the terms over to
have a look at a quarterly filing by a

471
00:35:49,501 --> 00:35:52,320
company. So you get to see
about what investors can see.

472
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:57,090
But if you can't control it and have no,

473
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:00,450
no very powerful surveillance
over its behavior,

474
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:06,410
you wouldn't want to invest in it unless
you are granted relief from liability.

475
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,990
And that's exactly the design.

476
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,990
And there was a hundred years ago,

477
00:36:12,991 --> 00:36:17,991
a race to the bottom among the American
states in how generously they treat

478
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,640
corporations under the law.

479
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:26,270
And the reigning champion among American
States for corporate law is Delaware,

480
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:33,380
Delaware corporations abound everywhere
and in particular in places that aren't

481
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:35,850
Delaware or even close,

482
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,600
because these provisions are tightest
from the corporate point of view,

483
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:47,160
uh, liquidity proprietorships
are hard to sell.

484
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,790
Um,
in fact,

485
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:55,410
often it's impossible to really get the
value out of them when you sell them

486
00:36:55,411 --> 00:36:58,190
outside the family.
Um,

487
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:02,070
and often in fact with say retailing,

488
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:07,380
the value of the firm is substantially
the goodwill toward the owner that

489
00:37:07,381 --> 00:37:08,220
customers have.

490
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:14,250
And when the owner sells
it to somebody else, uh,

491
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,930
the value may go to zero.
Although I was just, uh,

492
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:24,000
I had a boat in a marina on Lake Champlain
for a long time and I've got tireder

493
00:37:24,001 --> 00:37:26,850
and Tireder of the
management of the Marina,

494
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:32,460
lazy grasping,
unreliable.

495
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:36,660
And I was talking to somebody on the
phone yesterday and they said, you know,

496
00:37:36,661 --> 00:37:40,550
there are new owners up
there and I thought his Ah,

497
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:43,510
I may take my boat back.
The,

498
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,490
the proprietorship is a
very delicate creature.

499
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,680
The partnership is worse.

500
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,530
Let's suppose that all of us
are the partners of Wiggin
and Dana Law firm in new

501
00:37:55,531 --> 00:37:58,690
haven where all partners,
uh,

502
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,150
except Morgan here.

503
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:07,260
And Morgan is a brilliant student
just finishing the Yale law school.

504
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:12,450
And I'm his advocate. So I say, Morgan,

505
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:14,070
I'm going to make you a partner.

506
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,800
What do I have to do to make that happen?
In theory,

507
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,660
there are ways to shortcut this,

508
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,720
but in theory I have to get
the consent of all of you.

509
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,580
And so the,

510
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,320
and then suppose I say I'm
tired and old and I want out.

511
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:38,020
I'm going to sell Jim
Alexander my partnership

512
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,640
and Jim Alexander is generous enough to
offer me a large sum of money for that

513
00:38:46,461 --> 00:38:47,294
partnership.

514
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:48,970
Okay.

515
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:53,170
Can I just send all of you a memo
about Jim now being a partner? No,

516
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:59,040
you've all got to a proven
and the illiquidity of the
partnership as a result is

517
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,720
notorious.
The corporation is designed for liquidity.

518
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:12,790
You don't even ever have to see
the physical stock certificates.

519
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,210
They are just electronic bit.

520
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:21,620
The time it takes to sell,
uh,

521
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,370
to shell securities is that,

522
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:31,170
and the transaction costs are extremely
low compared to the other two.

523
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,880
Now, scalability, can we
make this thing big or not?

524
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:42,270
And the answer here is in data.
Uh,

525
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:46,810
these are,
can you read this from the back?

526
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:53,660
Um, there are about 18 million
proprietorships in the country,

527
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:57,650
a million and a third partnerships,
5 million corporations.

528
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:03,260
And their average gross revenue
per year are these numbers.

529
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,960
So the

530
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,980
standard story of a proprietorship
is the dry cleaner on the corner.

531
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:17,480
Who makes $1,000 a week
and feels good about it.

532
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,690
These are actually gross revenues,
not net.

533
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:26,890
So what that means is that the
actual take home may be pretty small.

534
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,330
Uh, and the ratios are
suggestive of scalability.

535
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:37,700
The joint stock corporation
is made to get big and

536
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,380
there are several subtypes of corporation,

537
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:48,130
but probably the most profound
threshold for corporations is the public

538
00:40:48,621 --> 00:40:50,600
offering,
the initial public offering.

539
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,800
When you take a firm
from private to public,

540
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:59,930
that is when you, for example, an s
corporation is a very private kind.

541
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,010
You can only have 75 shareholders.
You get some tax breaks,

542
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:08,840
but you can't market your
shares to a wide public. Uh,

543
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:12,650
and when you go public, um, Jim,

544
00:41:12,651 --> 00:41:16,940
you've been through that going public
with a company, is that right? Yeah.

545
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,010
Is there a mic for Jim?
What's the process?

546
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,220
This is a spinnaker exploration

547
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,520
by hers

548
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,090
is they call up,

549
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:37,070
uh, you, uh,

550
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:41,810
you eventually choose a group of people
that you feel comfortable with and

551
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:48,080
you convert. Our analysts think
that you have good prospects

552
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:53,000
draw up a prospectus,
which is a

553
00:41:55,550 --> 00:42:00,550
legal document describing sensibly
ascribing to the investors the principal

554
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:07,340
risks and the potential
returns of the investment.

555
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:10,930
You make sure that you have a,

556
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:14,970
what's viewed as a lawyer, uh, uh,

557
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,850
helping you with that reputation.

558
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:22,900
You are making sure that you have a
audited financials by a firm reputation.

559
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:26,970
And then eventually when
the time is writing,

560
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:31,190
you go around the country for several
weeks talking to perspective institutional

561
00:42:31,191 --> 00:42:32,024
investors,

562
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,790
retail investors in most retail
firms won't buy the smart money,

563
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:42,650
which is deemed to be institutional,
is not fine. And uh, typically,

564
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:46,800
uh, typically, uh, you end up with a, uh,

565
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:48,140
a group,

566
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:53,140
a situation where maybe 20 to 40%
of your company is solved the IPO,

567
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,760
new money coming in, which typically
face down in bed and you end up with

568
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:03,560
sort of two to 500 shareholders

569
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:10,250
have to keep happy at least for the
first year or else bad things happen.

570
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,990
Thanks.
So

571
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,510
the gigantic corporation

572
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:25,300
is the most productive,

573
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:28,600
not the most creative necessarily,

574
00:43:28,601 --> 00:43:31,930
but the most productive
player in the economy.

575
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:34,720
And as you can see here,

576
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:39,780
nearly 90% of all the business done
in the American economy has done by

577
00:43:40,901 --> 00:43:45,280
corporations.
So that the,

578
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
the, an analysis of American
capitalism or world capitalism,

579
00:43:52,001 --> 00:43:55,050
which neglects the joint
stock corporation, uh,

580
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,340
neglect the most important player.

581
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:02,430
So we will be focused on those ones
like the Pennsylvania railroad here,

582
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:05,080
uh,
as we go forward.
