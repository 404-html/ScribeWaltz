1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:02,180
Uh,

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:07,180
what I'd like to do this morning is spend
eight or 10 minutes with a few slides

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:12,340
that are framing and background
of the case. And then,

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,670
um, I'm going to ask Nancy
Height to impersonate,

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,530
impersonate, share an Oscar with
the flying chalk on the board.

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,930
And I'm going to come around and talk
to all of you about the case and we'll

7
00:00:26,931 --> 00:00:29,210
work it through B school style.

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,360
When you look at the institutions
involved in the mortgage system,

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,880
I don't assume that they
were designed brilliantly

10
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,450
or that they were thought
out from beginning to end.

11
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,940
The concept of Kluge is that
in your vocabulary, it's Tim,

12
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,720
is that Kluge?
Is that our curt hands up in [inaudible]

13
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,370
not going to get anywhere with that idea.

14
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,010
A kluge means things that are
complex and badly designed.

15
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,810
And there's a wonderful book by a
guy named Gary Marcus called Kluge,

16
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:19,240
which is about badly designed stuff,
uh,

17
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,190
from,
uh,

18
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,170
economic institutions to human memory,
to,

19
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,390
uh,
the human spine,

20
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:34,180
which is a highly error prone structure.

21
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,230
And it is as it is,

22
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:43,231
not because evolution said what's the
very best support call I can make for a

23
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,250
pipette bipedal creature.

24
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:53,970
But what's the best I can do by evolving
from a four if I get to a to like a

25
00:01:55,121 --> 00:01:55,954
great trip.

26
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,590
And the spine shows all kinds of design
imperfections that are attributable to

27
00:02:02,441 --> 00:02:07,441
the fact that it evolved in a horizontal
plane and then was readapted in a

28
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:13,360
vertical point and the
institutions at play

29
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,860
in what Posner calls the Depression of
Oh eight and what most of us called the

30
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,610
recession. Oh boy. Oh nine.

31
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:29,080
So it is perhaps the
mother of all recessions.

32
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,450
It has not actually attain
thought depth of unemployment

33
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:41,020
and under utilization of a plant and
equipment that would match up with the one

34
00:02:42,851 --> 00:02:47,200
in the 1930 [inaudible] of course
we could still get there. Uh,

35
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,640
it is possible.
That is now 1931

36
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,390
and another dip is out there.
I don't think that,

37
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:03,391
but there are I including wheel gach
when we saw a few days ago who speculate

38
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:05,620
that it might be.
So.

39
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,093
Okay.

40
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:10,690
Uh,

41
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:15,690
this is a cast of characters
for subprime lending,

42
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,810
a left to right, uh, the
home buyer, the broker, the
appraiser, that mortgage lender,

43
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,370
the air,

44
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:27,370
the investment banker and the investors
in the bonds created by the investment

45
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:32,220
banks. And in the, the, uh,

46
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,970
the row I'm touching are the principal
incentives that make the whole system go.

47
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,823
And

48
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,320
the critical thing is that three and
arguably four of the main steps in the

49
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:52,510
process are fee driven.

50
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,430
So that the alignment between
the decision maker and the master

51
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,220
or between the decision maker
and the potential home buyer,

52
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:09,560
uh,

53
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,500
may be muted by the decision
maker thinking fees.

54
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,320
If I'm saying it,
let's suppose,

55
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,580
let's suppose I were a
college admissions officer

56
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,080
and I was paid by the wives
students still ever to the school,

57
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,670
I might become very generous in my views.

58
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,700
I might find creativity
in unexpected places.

59
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,990
I might imagine analytic fire
power where none existed.

60
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,870
And so in all these steps,

61
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,330
the bias toward yes,
the bias toward completing a transaction

62
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,670
a is a very powerful,
powerful piece of the story.

63
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,660
The risks are chartered here.
Uh,

64
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,960
what we're going to do well when
we do the case, among other things,

65
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:06,370
just to fill in the bottom bro,

66
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,160
what are the ways in which we would
expect people in each of these roles roles

67
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,880
to be tempted to get out of
line, out of line, ethically,

68
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:18,700
uh,

69
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,700
and quite possibly out of why legally
as in the case there is a broker,

70
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:24,551
right,

71
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:29,380
who gets way beyond both
ethical and legal bounds.

72
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,140
Home ownership in the United States,
1900 to 2000,

73
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,910
uh, looks like this. And
notice it's a truncated scale.

74
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:43,610
The bottom of the steel is 40%.
Uh,

75
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,690
the big story is a huge normative
emphasis on home ownership.

76
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,470
Uh, the belief, uh,

77
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,170
going back to Jefferson really,

78
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:01,590
that when people own
property, they become, uh,

79
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,260
bought in citizens,

80
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:08,261
citizens who identify with
the Commonwealth and who
can be counted on to act in

81
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:14,120
public spirited ways.
And

82
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,730
there's a great run up in home
ownership between World War Two, uh,

83
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,670
and the 1980s.

84
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,960
And it is fueled by a very profitable
mass development of suburban housing.

85
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,410
It is financed by,
uh,

86
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:41,420
uh, Fha and related,
uh, government entities.

87
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:47,170
And it is rewarded by the
internal revenue service tax code,

88
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,260
which gives a strong incentive for people
to take out mortgages on a principle

89
00:06:56,421 --> 00:07:00,590
residence. Now, homeownership,

90
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,120
I assume, if any, do
any of you own a home?

91
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,670
Okay.

92
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,810
Oh, I should say that. Jaan [inaudible]
who wrote the cases with us,

93
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:18,430
welcome. Yawn. You own a house.

94
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,940
Sometimes I envy that

95
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:29,050
homeownership has all kinds of hazards,
right?

96
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,030
I just learned that my slate roof,

97
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,520
a hundred year old slate roof is at
the end of its lifetime and that's,

98
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,660
that's comparable to buy a,

99
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,810
it's about the same
price as the highest end.

100
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:48,160
BMW replace a slate roof.
That's a hazard.

101
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,590
Uh, suppose, uh, that uh,

102
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,460
you get laid off now your
mortgage payments continue.

103
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,160
Suppose that there is
a catastrophic illness.

104
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:05,020
The mortgage payments continue
the local property taxes continue.

105
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:09,130
The unanticipated
maintenance issues continued

106
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,690
and there is quite a lot to be said for
relative caution about undertaking a

107
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:22,720
debt amounting to several years
income in purchasing a house.

108
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,200
Now there's also a
political dimension to this,

109
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:31,201
which is that the old fashioned local
banking method of writing mortgages was

110
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:42,030
extremely cautious and was
first explosively and then
later implicitly racist

111
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,160
and gender rest.

112
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:51,510
It was all about well
employed white men and the,

113
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:58,890
that there is an any illogical
strand that is not Jeffersonian,

114
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:02,970
but it's more recent that has to do
with the equality of opportunity to own

115
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:03,804
houses,

116
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:09,170
which has pushed a policy toward
a more permissive attitude.

117
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:15,240
Uh, finally there is of
course the pro market view,

118
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:19,630
which became dominant in this
country in the Ronald Reagan era, uh,

119
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:23,310
which says let people cut the deals.
They want to cut,

120
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,720
get the government out of the transaction,
deregulate.

121
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,940
And in many cases, deregulation was
a spectacular success. For example,

122
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:37,480
the airline industry, uh,
the trucking industry, uh,

123
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:42,530
but deregulation of finance
is a slipper you're on,

124
00:09:43,391 --> 00:09:48,000
you're taking
a history of home values here.

125
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,100
Uh,

126
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,420
what's emphasis an index chart
that has 1890 index to a hundred.

127
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,110
And the gist of the
argument in this chart,

128
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:03,660
did I take this from the
case or not? Uh, the,

129
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,820
the gist of the argument in this chart
is that by the time we're done with the

130
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:09,840
current meltdown,

131
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:15,690
a home values adjusted for inflation will
be back about where they were in 1890.

132
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,143
MMM.

133
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,700
This a map of Philadelphia and
it's historically interesting map.

134
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,600
I couldn't find a comparable one for
Cleveland though I'm sure. What exists.

135
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,050
In 1937,
uh,

136
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:47,090
mortgages were collapsing all over the
country and the Roosevelt administration

137
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,760
pushed through Congress a piece of
legislation called the home owners' Loan

138
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:56,700
Corporation, h o l LLC, home
owners' Loan Corporation.

139
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:02,450
And the home owners' Loan Corporation
was charged with finding out how to know

140
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:04,860
in advance if a mortgage
would likely fail.

141
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,300
And the technique was not
to look at credit scores,

142
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:17,510
but to look at housing locations and to
look at the condition of housing in a

143
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:23,760
neighborhood and at the
demographics of who lived there.

144
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,270
And it was crudely racist and uh,
uh,

145
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,610
biased in many, many ways. Uh,

146
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,150
it was explicitly racist about blacks.

147
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,140
It was explicitly racist about Jews.

148
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:45,600
It was explicitly racist about Italians,
most of all southern Italians.

149
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,160
And it was a four point scale.

150
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,020
The worst category.

151
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:56,590
Level D was Red and the term
redlining comes from this.

152
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,480
And the idea was to tell the banking
world not to lend money in those zones.

153
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,000
Uh, yellow was a little
better, uh, uh, then, then, uh,

154
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,160
blue,
then green.

155
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:14,970
And the idea was to put mortgage money
into the safest wealthiest neighborhoods

156
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,280
with the most homogeneous populations.

157
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,880
And from the point of view, uh,
managing the mortgage crisis,

158
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:33,510
it was not a terrible policy from the
point of view of managing cities and

159
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,490
communities.

160
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,940
It was catastrophic because what it
did was to accelerate the creation of

161
00:12:43,151 --> 00:12:48,151
slumped in areas where mortgage money
was unavailable for the sale or purchase

162
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:53,470
of housing or for that matter,
for the large scale repair of housing.

163
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,520
Uh,
they did it to a 200.

164
00:12:57,521 --> 00:13:01,120
They did the process to 200
American cities in a single year,

165
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:06,400
including new haven across
chapel street is class date.

166
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,593
Um,

167
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,080
this is the case shore home
prices story and what's

168
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:20,380
laid out here from the
year 2000, uh, to uh,

169
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,490
uh,
2000 Shabba.

170
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,583
And

171
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:30,990
this is when Gatesman talked about case
Schiller being a reassuring data series.

172
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,580
You look at it between here and here,

173
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,710
if you look at a, uh, a five year
period or even a six year period,

174
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,280
it looks like a process of continued
appreciation in home prices.

175
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:55,140
And there was nothing in the data that
would have given conventional econometric

176
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:02,740
models, would have triggered the
suspicion that the end was nigh.

177
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,000
Uh,

178
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
the chart is also interesting
because Cleveland is this line.

179
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:14,680
Yeah. So that Cleveland is, uh,

180
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,740
a less extreme story in
price appreciation then,

181
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:25,640
but the cases everybody
talks about, which, uh,

182
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:30,640
were, uh, Miami and Las
Vegas and Los Angeles,

183
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,320
uh, this is the same story shown
in year on year percentage change.

184
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,430
And,
uh,

185
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,410
it actually doesn't add much to our
knowledge. Hasn't got it. Skip it.

186
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,153
Yeah.

187
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,580
Uh, this is Cleveland, uh, uh,

188
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,720
uh, price appreciation, uh,

189
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:02,090
from 2000 into 2007 compared
with the country at large.

190
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:07,460
And the gist is that Cleveland was,

191
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,120
uh, not a hot, not a hot city.

192
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:16,130
And it was, it is in
that respect. I've got,

193
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,800
I've missed a charter.

194
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:24,230
There's a huge story about
northeastern industrial cities. Uh,

195
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,770
they, uh, by which I mean, uh,

196
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:33,370
virtually all the cities from Saint
Louis on the left side to Boston on the

197
00:15:33,801 --> 00:15:36,230
right side,
uh,

198
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:42,130
they all had their takeoff in
the middle of the 19th century.

199
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:48,290
They were all going almost
vertical, uh, in the years,

200
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,940
1850 to 1900,
1910,

201
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,580
uh,
by 1920,

202
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,940
they're growth rates slowed
down almost to almost to zero.

203
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,750
Uh, and we're, uh,

204
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:10,150
fluctuated wildly during the depression
years recovered briefly in World War II

205
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:16,060
and then which sharply south
from 1950 on a new haven's case,

206
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,360
the strength of the inner city economy
forums and almost perfect arc with the

207
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:26,930
starting point in 1840,

208
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:31,931
the peak in 1950 and the bottom in about
1990 and there's actually been a little

209
00:16:33,711 --> 00:16:34,970
bit of recovery since,

210
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:39,410
but Cleveland is a
classic industrial city.

211
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:44,770
It is the place where standard oil set
up its first large refining plants.

212
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:50,710
It was an at vantage point
in transportation because
it was an intersection

213
00:16:51,681 --> 00:16:54,380
between very high quality east,

214
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:57,740
west freight rail and
Great Lakes shipping.

215
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:04,450
And it when rail became
subordinated to trucking,

216
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:07,790
uh,

217
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:12,790
and when suburban development
became dominant over the
reuse of industrial urban

218
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:16,610
neighborhoods,
Cleveland suffered mightily.

219
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:24,940
This income map of Cleveland where median
incomes under 22,700 are shown in the

220
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:33,350
darkest a rust tone,
uh,

221
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,260
is where the case takes place.

222
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:41,240
The green.is approximately the
location of Slavic village.

223
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,190
I wouldn't swear to it or argue with
yon if he said move it three or four

224
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:51,270
degrees of the compass north or east or
south or, but it's right about there.

225
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,480
And it is on the edge of a large
post industrial working class,

226
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,353
uh,

227
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,660
neighborhood or more mega neighborhood
in a declining industrial city.

228
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,150
Well,
there's the great art

229
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,480
and the concentration of
subprime lending in Cleveland,

230
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,030
shown in the darkest tones here,

231
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,600
includes the neighborhood
we're talking about.

232
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,060
And then there's Posner

233
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,000
on page two 84.

234
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:36,130
I hope all of you have
memorized page two 84.

235
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,810
It's worries apportioning blame,
but all,

236
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,780
although the financiers grabbed the
primary responsibility for the depression,

237
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:50,280
that's his name for the recession.
I do not think they can be blamed.

238
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:55,050
I tell it a blame for it.
Implying moral center.

239
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,860
Any more than one can blame
a lion for eating a zebra.

240
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,260
Capitalism is Darwinism.

241
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,830
Pretty dark interpretation.

242
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,120
Uh, and Nancy, can we,

243
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,860
how do we go? Here we go. Room controls

244
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,590
were from you. You'd Mod. Okay.

245
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:21,970
That's good to screen to go away.

246
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,873
Yeah.

247
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,670
Jennifer.
Yes.

248
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,580
So travel with letting me learn your name.
You get cold called.

249
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:58,470
Um, there's a story in
this where a local broker,

250
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,390
um, ends up being sentenced to prison.
Do you remember that part of it or not?

251
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,040
Okay. Mark, can you give
us a little recap on mark?

252
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,810
Uh, Mark Kellogg, uh,

253
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:17,190
submitted fraudulent data for about
70 homes and are somehow ended up,

254
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,850
I'm not sure the process of
flipping a house exactly,

255
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:27,120
but he did it to about 70 homes and they
all ended up defaulting on the loans

256
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,160
people. So, um,

257
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,050
Mark Shin would be, would it be
what? Let's try somebody else.

258
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,670
What's mark? Well, if mark were a,

259
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,680
a relative of yours and you had to have
Thanksgiving dinner with him while he

260
00:20:47,471 --> 00:20:51,130
was on furlough from
Ohio state penitentiary,

261
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,560
what topic would you
want it to reflect on?

262
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,060
Ethical topic.

263
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,800
I'm gonna take a shot at this.

264
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,293
MMM.

265
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,870
Perhaps just kind of as,
as you can get it though,

266
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:17,730
as he just kind of mentioned with the
topic of, uh, kind of preying on zebras,

267
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,220
um,
perhaps something like that.

268
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,630
And that kind of using
a position to kind of

269
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,460
benefit from people at a,

270
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:32,461
at a much kind of like position in you
and kind of did their detriment into your

271
00:21:32,851 --> 00:21:33,400
game.

272
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:38,020
Okay. So the buyers on your
telling are zebras. Uh,

273
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,450
okay. Uh, I, that's, that's
a plausible possession.

274
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,110
If the buyers are zebras,

275
00:21:47,111 --> 00:21:50,680
are the zebras in any way
blame of bubble in this story?

276
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,943
What do you think?

277
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:58,620
Um,

278
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:03,480
it's possible that they're blaming bull
if they were given good information.

279
00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:06,020
But in this situation it seems like
they were given completely wrongful

280
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,920
information, led to believe
that it was true. Okay.

281
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,720
Like a plausible person believe that.

282
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,840
Okay. Uh, can you,

283
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:18,080
can we tell a story where the home buyer
where it's plausible that blaming the

284
00:22:18,081 --> 00:22:18,914
buyers?

285
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:23,310
Yes. Okay. Where are they
should have known that they,

286
00:22:23,311 --> 00:22:28,050
if they don't have the income to pay
the okay on it and they weren't there,

287
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,210
they were going to default.

288
00:22:29,211 --> 00:22:32,300
And so therefore they should
have not bought the home.

289
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,910
Thank you.
And uh,

290
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:41,230
are there instances where people are
encouraged to lie about their incomes?

291
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:49,460
So I think there's a big problem with a
lot of these jumbos sub prime mortgages

292
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:53,660
they call them where people were buying
really big houses or second houses with

293
00:22:53,661 --> 00:22:54,590
subprime mortgages.

294
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,070
And in that case it is their fault because
they were just being greedy. Right.

295
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,630
Okay. Trying to take, yeah.

296
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,640
Trying to either falsify documents or go
for the type of loans that would allow

297
00:23:04,671 --> 00:23:08,390
them to get the second properties without
really having enough to back it up.

298
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,590
Okay. So, uh,

299
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,600
that's the Shin of
Shinar pride or gluttony?

300
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,820
Not really glad, but it's
bricks and mortar. Got me.

301
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,413
Yes.

302
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:25,010
Um,
well there were also a Ninja loans,

303
00:23:25,011 --> 00:23:29,420
which I think is a very appropriate
acronym because of the sneakiness,

304
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:33,050
but it was an acronym for no income,
no job and no assets.

305
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,030
Okay. Ninja, no income, no job, no assets.

306
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,120
Why would anyone,

307
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:46,620
anyone encourage another human
being to shake an Angelo?

308
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,140
It's an obvious yes.

309
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:52,631
Well,

310
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:57,631
if you're one of the three steps
that profits off the fee of making,

311
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,460
of like having that long go through,
then you don't even,

312
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:04,390
it doesn't really matter to you if it or
it doesn't matter to you if it default

313
00:24:04,391 --> 00:24:06,760
as much as it matters to
the buyer or to the bank.

314
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,813
Okay.

315
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:13,030
So long as you can successfully
pass it along to the next step,

316
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,390
you collect the fee and your
home dry no matter what happened.

317
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,050
That's great.
And you're wrapping

318
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,393
up.

319
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,400
Sure. Okay. Now let's stop and see
what we got for a diagram here. Sharon,

320
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:36,480
unpack, unpack your dining room. Okay,

321
00:24:36,481 --> 00:24:39,690
so I guess I knew you'd be good
at diagram our game of Pictionary.

322
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,250
So I'm trying to out
what exactly went wrong.

323
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,350
And I would start with a home and I'm
the Slavic community and then I would end

324
00:24:49,351 --> 00:24:53,310
maybe here with like
bank of Scotland and um,

325
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:57,420
between quote unquote Joe six pack,
um,

326
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,960
purchasing a home with
$22,000 yearly income,

327
00:25:03,151 --> 00:25:08,151
which was the average I saw
that was misrepresented as
being worth about 80,000,

328
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:13,260
um,
from the broker who works with her

329
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,140
that

330
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,790
I figured we could have everyone
fill in the parts for me. Like how,

331
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:23,050
how do we get from the home to the,
um,

332
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,380
international crisis.

333
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,390
Okay. And so who's, who's the,
we have another mic or not.

334
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,960
Yeah.
Um,

335
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:38,200
what's the next step in the chain to the,
to the right of broker here?

336
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:43,900
Oh,

337
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:48,430
probably someone will give a rating for
this mortgage so that the broker will be

338
00:25:48,431 --> 00:25:53,410
able to package it with other mortgages
and sell it to an investment banker.

339
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,520
Okay.
So there's a credit rating story,

340
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:59,210
but there's also another story
that's closer to ground level

341
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,010
concerns.
The house itself,

342
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:12,850
we need a evaluation of the house,
like what the house value of these.

343
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,810
Okay. And there's, thank you.
There's a saying in real estate,

344
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,750
uh,
praise as an instructor

345
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:27,430
and uh, that and, and it's,

346
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,910
and it's not altogether
false that whoever hires,

347
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,290
think about the incentives.

348
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:38,740
You're an appraiser and a tall here
hires you to do an appraisal and you're

349
00:26:41,451 --> 00:26:43,680
going to get a fee of 1100 for doing it.

350
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,890
And Paul lets it be known that he thinks
this house really ought to be worth

351
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,350
something north of $200,000
and you go out in the field,

352
00:26:55,351 --> 00:26:58,680
do the copper bowls and
the number comes up at 140.

353
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,323
What

354
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:05,920
Tim, what thought might
cross your mind if you were,

355
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:10,250
I understand in your case
of course wouldn't, but uh,

356
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:14,320
in my case, uh, Mike,

357
00:27:14,321 --> 00:27:18,490
Cross your mind to trust tall and just
go with a $200,000 prediction. Okay.

358
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:23,350
And the, and the second step
in the reasoning is, um,

359
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,390
no one will ever know no one let her know.

360
00:27:25,391 --> 00:27:30,391
And next time tall goes to the
yellow pages for an appraisal to you,

361
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,460
you'll come to you or he's more
likely to, he said, damn site,

362
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,760
less likely to if you under cut steel.

363
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:38,643
Uh,

364
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:44,740
I'll tell you a Yale story
about appraisal. Uh, when
I was in city government,

365
00:27:44,741 --> 00:27:49,690
we leased high street and Wall Street
to Yale for 99 years. We were broke,

366
00:27:49,691 --> 00:27:50,524
we needed money.

367
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,710
And uh,

368
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:59,150
the mayor sat down with Benno
Schmidt and Petros said,

369
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:01,470
well, the university will
handle the appraisal for you.

370
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,153
Yeah,
they did.

371
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:09,560
Uh, the two streets together
leased for $1 million for 99 years.

372
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:15,890
It should have been a lot more than that.
Uh,

373
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:22,090
and there were those in city government
who thought I was the guy who got the

374
00:28:22,671 --> 00:28:26,230
number that low. I was actually
pulling hard on making that,

375
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,080
making the number at least one
zero or a year and a half higher.

376
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:35,360
I had allowed the law school to build
that gorgeous underground library cause

377
00:28:35,361 --> 00:28:36,880
the ground rights went with the street.

378
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,200
Um,
yeah.

379
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,370
So appraise has instructed, this is a, uh,

380
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:48,600
an important component in the store.
Um,

381
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,390
we got the appraiser there.

382
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:59,090
So who else was involved and
what are their incentives?

383
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:06,540
What are,
what's the tall

384
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:16,480
well, you, you've got the
local bank that's actually
doing the lending. Okay. Um,

385
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,650
and uh,

386
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:22,780
they probably look at a fee for the
loan that they take and then if they can

387
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:26,380
package it and sell it
off to someone else. Okay.

388
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,300
They don't end up with
a loan on their books,

389
00:29:28,301 --> 00:29:31,660
so they could probably care less
how it performs over the long run.

390
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:34,730
Okay. So the terrific. So the lender,

391
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,370
the lender is,
uh,

392
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:43,690
also feed driven and is,
uh,

393
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:47,710
is inclined to think that she
or he can escape accountability.

394
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,210
Uh, when the property
defaults, it defaults.

395
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:58,240
And why would that be? What are the what,
what do we turn these loans into it?

396
00:29:58,241 --> 00:29:59,074
The next stage?

397
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:06,180
That's what I do have to talk to you.
I don't think we know you've talked once.

398
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,050
Go ahead.
Um,

399
00:30:08,051 --> 00:30:12,910
usually it's sold off to a big
investment bank or basically a financial

400
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:17,350
powerhouse when they pulled off mortgages
into these giant collateralized,

401
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,640
that obligations.

402
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:23,170
Okay. She d o s famous acronym.
You want to add anything to that?

403
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,420
Okay.
Uh,

404
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:30,510
so you've got the banks
creating these huge bundles and

405
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:39,430
the bundles. How, what story could you,

406
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:44,500
could you tell just say that bundling
these mortgages from all across the

407
00:30:44,871 --> 00:30:49,070
country might be a good thing
from the economist point of view?

408
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,680
Is there anything you could say

409
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,440
vibe to it? Diversifies the risk
for it, diversifies the risk?

410
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,560
Say a little more?
Um,

411
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:07,430
well presumably the people who are
packaging them can take out a bunch of,

412
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,880
you know, do a lot of, uh,

413
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:13,900
financial analysis and determined that
the risk of the number of defaults,

414
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,080
um,

415
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,490
would be lower than the benefit of the
people actually paying their loans back.

416
00:31:19,491 --> 00:31:20,690
So the people who take out the,
uh,

417
00:31:20,691 --> 00:31:25,490
the package would have a favorable
risk return. Okay. Uh, and part,

418
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:28,150
where you about to say something?
Um,

419
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:32,870
I think it also increases the market of
potential buyers because now rather than

420
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:37,120
owning a mortgage and having to deal with
an investor one on one, uh, you have, uh,

421
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:42,110
a pooling and servicing agreement that
has a company as a servicer handles all

422
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,230
the collection of payments
and just reaching up money
into different investments.

423
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,190
Okay.
So you've got,

424
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:52,250
you've got an institutional mechanism
that makes this work relatively smoothly.

425
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,680
Um,
and

426
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,750
yeah,

427
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:02,750
you're interested when you create
these bundles in having the risks on

428
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:06,930
relatively have relatively low
correlation with one another.

429
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:09,820
You what,

430
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:14,820
what would be a bad bundle is one where
we can know that some of the mortgages

431
00:32:16,861 --> 00:32:18,870
are you faulting and infer from that,

432
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,200
that lots of others are likely to fall.

433
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:28,010
And a bundle that was
geographically concentrated
on Slavic village for example,

434
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:32,760
would have that second characteristic
and that would be a bad thing.

435
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,270
So there is a story about

436
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,800
risk management that

437
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:41,481
makes that work.

438
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:45,980
Now are the agencies like Moody's,

439
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:51,130
these outfits that Judge Credit worthiness
of companies and other and other

440
00:32:53,391 --> 00:32:56,540
financial intermediaries,
are they in this story anywhere?

441
00:32:56,541 --> 00:33:00,440
I don't know if they yawn. Does Moody's
get into your case? I don't know.

442
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,410
I think I found it.

443
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,150
Okay. So, uh,

444
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:12,680
everybody know what Moody's
and and its rivals. Do

445
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,780
anybody want to help us with that?

446
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,940
Barback here it comes.

447
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,030
I'm slow.
Pray.

448
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:41,150
Moody's and its rivals are essentially
collect a fee from anyone who wants to

449
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:45,820
spin off and asset or debt obligation
to actually rate the soundness of the

450
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:51,050
security for what it's supposed to be
beside a rating like AAA or single. Okay.

451
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:56,510
And if I'm Yale, is it a trip? What
was triplet? And I think we're now AA.

452
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:01,050
Um, what's a triple ae? What's
the advantage of a AAA rating?

453
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,390
Uh,
if you have a higher rating,

454
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:06,030
then that means you can get
a lower cost of capital.

455
00:34:06,031 --> 00:34:07,830
So if you actually want to
raise some money, right,

456
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,420
you can raise it for a lot less.

457
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:15,390
So reduces the cost of capital and
it therefore has great value to you.

458
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:20,950
Now, if you could bribe movies, you know,

459
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:26,010
if you were completely a moral and you
could bribe Moody's to make something a

460
00:34:28,631 --> 00:34:32,890
trip away when it was really being,
uh,

461
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,430
it would be worth paying
a lot, right? The,

462
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:40,710
the actual economic value
of those ratings is Hume

463
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:44,140
what keeps Moody's honest?

464
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,083
Okay.

465
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:55,650
Oh,
the reputation,

466
00:34:55,770 --> 00:35:00,480
the fact that they are years kind of
made sure that the ratings that they're

467
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:03,600
given actually safe investments.

468
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,610
Okay. Well, and, and in general,

469
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:12,820
people on the buy side are going to want
the rating agencies to tell the truth

470
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,770
and people on the sell side
will be ambivalent about that.

471
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:22,970
So they're right there,
there are cross pressures there.

472
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:28,600
And there is a patent evidence of grade
inflation in the ratings that these

473
00:35:32,001 --> 00:35:32,990
firms produce.

474
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,313
Uh,

475
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,740
does that you

476
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,013
tall?

477
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:45,310
Not really. No. Because they get paid
by the sell side, not by the buy side.

478
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:48,640
Absolutely.
So they are doing,

479
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,180
they are in a sense
appraising as instructor.

480
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:57,910
And that's a pretty scary
part of this whole thing. The,

481
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,223
uh,

482
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,270
let's reach all the way back
to Adam Smith for a minute

483
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:12,150
and Smith's story, not just of the
invisible hand, but of the general,

484
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,330
generally benign working in markets

485
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:21,290
in everything Smith says is
embedded at basic norm of truth.

486
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:28,990
That I'm not selling you a
false mirage of a loaf of bread.

487
00:36:29,811 --> 00:36:31,700
I'm selling you an actual loaf of bread.

488
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:37,910
I am not selling you a
coffee or assumptions.

489
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,920
Looks like coffee.

490
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:43,930
I'm Sonia coffee and the
basic accountability in
bilateral trade where you're

491
00:36:46,101 --> 00:36:48,740
buying something from me or
I'm buying something from you.

492
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,350
We keep each other honest,
right?

493
00:36:51,351 --> 00:36:55,340
Where it's two parties and
there's no information asymmetry,

494
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,510
right? Where there are two parties
with symmetrical information.

495
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:05,440
The most foundational aspect of a market
system is that buyer and seller are

496
00:37:06,801 --> 00:37:08,320
equipped to keep each other honest.

497
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:12,650
And where there is a huge
information asymmetry,

498
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:19,060
we invent things like Moody's or
appraisal of real estate as a substitute,

499
00:37:22,611 --> 00:37:27,080
a way of creating or simulating
information symmetry.

500
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,160
But if a third party agencies act like
sellers to the side that pays them,

501
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:43,940
the information asymmetry
is actually made worse,

502
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,120
right? And the case, the,

503
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:56,240
the strongest piece for increased
government regulation of,

504
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,103
uh,

505
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:03,370
the finance industry generally actually
is the difficulty of policing the police

506
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,320
of tracking the integrity of estimates
put out there by people who are in the

507
00:38:17,841 --> 00:38:21,350
business of correcting
information asymmetries.

508
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,183
MMM.

509
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:33,230
Uh, young. Um,

510
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,220
are there aspects of
the that you would urge

511
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,920
us to pay greater attention to?
Okay.

512
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:45,260
Well, first of all on the,
uh, on the kind of AAA story,

513
00:38:45,261 --> 00:38:50,180
and this may not be in the case per se,
uh, but it's certainly part of the thing.

514
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,900
Not only is there a nice little boots,

515
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,870
coffee capital if you get rated AAA,

516
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:01,970
but there are certain funds in certain
buyers like money market funds and other

517
00:39:01,971 --> 00:39:05,120
funds that only dive AAA Bob,
right?

518
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,400
So once you've crossed that threshold,

519
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:12,450
you were just counting the
number of people, uh, and,

520
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,660
and possible purchasers of your funds.

521
00:39:14,661 --> 00:39:17,150
Because if you put money in
a mark and money market fund,

522
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:19,290
do you want to reasonably
liquid investment?

523
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:22,340
You want to reasonably assured return,
uh,

524
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:26,720
things are not supposed to
be risky investments and
therefore money market funds,

525
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:30,140
all kinds of other funds
are limited to AAA bonds.

526
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:34,610
So getting to that AAA level,
what was really important,

527
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,920
uh,
to say something,

528
00:39:36,921 --> 00:39:41,210
even though I'm not a big fan of
their performance in this case,

529
00:39:41,211 --> 00:39:45,140
but in terms of Moody's and Fitch and
everything, the collusion doesn't,

530
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:50,590
there doesn't have to be
explicit collusion in the
sense that if I give you this

531
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,680
bond to rate,

532
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:56,810
I will never raise your vibe again
unless you give the a AAA rating.

533
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:01,150
What happened in this case is the Moody's
and Fitch and others without fairly

534
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:05,120
explicit guidelines on what they
consider it to be turned away.

535
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,480
So you're the bond package or the IPA
and you're bringing all of the together,

536
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,010
all these mortgages and you say,

537
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:18,070
I have to reach a kind of 15% threshold
level where it's 15% over collateralize

538
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:24,040
or I have to buy cds, which are um, uh,

539
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:28,910
the default swaps in order to ensure this
investment and getting over that AAA.

540
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,510
Huh?

541
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:33,980
You do exactly what you need
to do to get that AAA rating.

542
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,720
And what happened when the crisis hit
was we had all of these people who are

543
00:40:38,721 --> 00:40:43,160
just over the AAA rating and they,
uh,

544
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:45,350
I mean with,
with them just over,

545
00:40:45,351 --> 00:40:48,710
you don't have a spread and you don't
have to kind of a usual probability

546
00:40:48,711 --> 00:40:49,430
distribution.

547
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:54,260
All of these guys who are creating these
CDOs knew exactly the kind of where the

548
00:40:54,261 --> 00:40:56,060
finish line was and when,

549
00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:00,980
just a step over that to make sure that
they were good at the AAA ratings. So,

550
00:41:00,981 --> 00:41:01,814
uh,

551
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:06,590
the fact that they were not very well
understood that kind of the historic data

552
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:11,000
went back three years and they felt
very confident in doing stuff with three

553
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:12,830
years of data.
Uh,

554
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:17,570
I think that's kind of an interesting way
because when you're looking for active

555
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:22,370
collusion, the expect that
I didn't see bars, you know,

556
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:25,490
uh, trading kind of information and, and,

557
00:41:25,491 --> 00:41:29,720
and dollars in Brown paper
envelopes. And sometimes it's, it's,

558
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,430
it's not that explicit.

559
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:36,460
There are ways that gaming the system
without having anyone do anything that

560
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,560
even resembles something that sketchy.

561
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,260
So

562
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:48,200
it may be that legitimate cheating,

563
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:54,580
cheating in a good blue suit is more
dangerous than cheating shady or setting

564
00:41:58,041 --> 00:41:58,874
with sr or,

565
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:01,050
or, or, you know,

566
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:04,230
cornea love that's really untested
by a heck of a lot of data.

567
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:10,290
Also a bad idea. And, and, and I to go on,

568
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:10,451
I,

569
00:42:10,451 --> 00:42:15,451
I'm actually kind of surprised given that
we're at an elite university with lots

570
00:42:16,351 --> 00:42:20,580
of people with connections to Wall Street
in some way or another that everyone

571
00:42:20,581 --> 00:42:24,780
thought the Zebra was the
people buying the houses.

572
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:26,070
Uh,

573
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:31,070
if you look at the data and you have
mark Kellogg's kind of purchase lists

574
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:32,850
there,
if you look at the data,

575
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,020
you begin to notice not only is there
a pattern in who the appraiser is,

576
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,690
but there are patterns
as to who the buyer is.

577
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:44,870
We have this one buyer here and I'm
just looking at it in a 40 year period,

578
00:42:44,881 --> 00:42:49,350
bought five houses, six houses,
all with the same broker,

579
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,730
all with the same appraiser.
Uh,

580
00:42:51,731 --> 00:42:55,530
we'd go down and there are
others at seven or eight times,

581
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:58,900
just look at the names and
they repeat them, the samples.

582
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,170
So I would put the question
back here. Who, who's the, uh,

583
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:06,720
who's the lion and who's
the Zebra in this case?

584
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,770
Was it the I dance?
I mean,

585
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:15,050
they were relying on these boats in
Cleveland should do a reasonable job in a

586
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:19,560
phrasing in, in putting out the, uh,

587
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:22,490
thing. And in the end, that's what Lynn,

588
00:43:22,491 --> 00:43:26,400
in each of those formulas that I was
talking about, the fact that, okay,

589
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:30,710
you have houses that are phrased at
this much and historically they fall,

590
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:32,520
but let's say a 10% rate,

591
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:38,030
but they didn't take into account the
fact that you have people who are just

592
00:43:38,731 --> 00:43:39,960
figuring the system.
I mean,

593
00:43:39,961 --> 00:43:44,961
going in a six month period of buying a
house at 25,000 and selling it at 85,000

594
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:49,750
with no evidence of any remodel,
uh,

595
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:53,490
and it just goes on and you can go through
this data sell sheet is actually kind

596
00:43:53,491 --> 00:43:57,180
of fascinating. If you want to have
a plate, kind of junior detective,

597
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:01,360
if you want to look to see how
these kinds of patterns in the data,

598
00:44:01,361 --> 00:44:04,050
and you can look at the data adult,
you know, this can't be right,

599
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:06,290
this really happy,
right,

600
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:10,440
in terms of who's selling and how
much you're selling to things for.

601
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,800
And especially when you look at the
story of Cleveland and wasn't in a hot

602
00:44:13,801 --> 00:44:14,634
market.

603
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:18,450
And you can't come up with a story of
like you might for Miami or Las Vegas and

604
00:44:18,451 --> 00:44:21,360
say, well, you know, a lot of old
people are going to move here and,

605
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,970
and that's a good reason.
Land values are going up.

606
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,230
I'm up with a story like that
for Cleveland. Uh, I mean,

607
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:32,110
it's a wonderful town. Don't get
me wrong, but, uh, there isn't

608
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,430
worse yet.
They've got the Indians and the Brown.

609
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,220
Yes.
Uh,

610
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,860
it's fish and they had the rock and
roll hall of fame, but there's really,

611
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:44,170
you know,
it's hard to come up with a story.

612
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:49,350
So why aren't we getting into this
kind of a occurrence and so on.

613
00:44:49,631 --> 00:44:52,780
So, you know, that's a point. I,

614
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:58,180
so, so one thing that I saw
was I felt like the Zebra
would really represents, um,

615
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:02,600
potential profits and economic profit
more than an individual in itself.

616
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:05,570
So if you look from each of
the actors point of views,

617
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,980
the zebra is really what they're,

618
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:11,780
the profits that they're going after
under the system that's set up. Uh,

619
00:45:11,781 --> 00:45:15,680
so rationally each player is
acting in their own best interests,

620
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:16,880
but in the end,

621
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:21,140
in the big picture ends up where
it hurts the system as a whole.

622
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,550
Um,
and so I think that like,

623
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:27,380
it's very easy to want to put blame on
a specific party or a specific group,

624
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,590
but it's just very difficult to do
because everybody's working under the

625
00:45:30,591 --> 00:45:33,470
incentives that has been
created for that party.

626
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,510
And,
and they offer another potential.

627
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:42,020
The drugs are considered
when she is, uh, the boats.

628
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:47,050
Let's say you're buy one of these
houses and is a house next to you,

629
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:51,590
has been bought for 25,000, sold for
85,000 with no visible improvements.

630
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:56,060
You bought your home for 30,000.
You put another 40,000 names,

631
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:00,380
you have a legitimately $70,000 house.

632
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:04,430
How are you going to deal with in
that house next to you is boarded up,

633
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:08,150
it goes into foreclosure because someone
has been playing the appraisal. Cancun.

634
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:12,440
So there is an externality here to
consider to of the overall community.

635
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:17,740
So who's got an idea
about how to fix all this?

636
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:24,380
Would it be drumming?
Truth telling him to three year olds.

637
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:25,383
Okay.

638
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,800
Would it be yes.

639
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:32,873
Okay.

640
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,560
I think there's a huge gap
and government oversight, um,

641
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:41,960
particularly with regard to the
ratings, uh, that, I mean when,

642
00:46:41,961 --> 00:46:44,420
when Moody's is,
although they all,

643
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:46,310
they have the cross pressures
that you talked about,

644
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,040
but when Moody's is being paid
by one side and not the other,

645
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:53,600
and even if even if we assume that they're
all inflate it and therefore it was

646
00:46:53,601 --> 00:46:57,590
down to road with them to
be sort of suspect without,

647
00:46:57,591 --> 00:47:00,920
without some third party that's completely
disinterested at like the government

648
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,680
coming in and telling you how to rate it,
you're not going to get,

649
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,530
you're not going to get truthful writings
in there for the whole system falls

650
00:47:06,531 --> 00:47:07,430
apart from the top.

651
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:10,460
Yup.
That sounds right at mine.

652
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:15,590
One of my own inclinations would be to
compel the initial lenders to hold a

653
00:47:15,721 --> 00:47:19,620
given percentage equity in each,
each loan,

654
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,673
um,

655
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:27,140
so that they can't utterly
ignore a probability of default.

656
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:32,643
Um,

657
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:43,210
on Monday I'm going to, uh,

658
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:48,790
Monday is a wildcard in the
syllabus and I had planned to use,

659
00:47:48,791 --> 00:47:53,500
use it to do the Maurice. Um,
the more he's business plan.

660
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:54,640
Uh,

661
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,640
but it turns out that there are people
who think it would be a terrible idea if

662
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:02,770
the Morrie's business plan
and got the Yale Daily News.

663
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,940
And while we're 110 really good friends,

664
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:12,970
I think I'd be nuts to
use that at this stage.

665
00:48:12,971 --> 00:48:15,310
We'll do that at the end of
the semester when it won't be,

666
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:20,590
when it will not cause bloodshed
somewhere in the system. Um,

667
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:25,450
and we'll do a, uh, I, I'd like
to do two things with Monday.

668
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:30,160
One is a poster case on Vioxx the drug,
which

669
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:36,880
was a Cox two inhibitor and did a lot
of good for people like me with knee

670
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:37,714
trouble,

671
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:42,960
but it killed a few of them and there
were hard feelings and a vast avalanche of

672
00:48:45,191 --> 00:48:47,380
lawsuits.
And we'll look at that.

673
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:50,410
I'm also going to post
federalist paper number 10.

674
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:55,660
Can I hands up if you've read
federalist 10 k no American,

675
00:48:55,930 --> 00:49:00,930
nobody who's going to do business in this
country should fail to get the idea of

676
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:03,940
the fundamental design of the
American political system,

677
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:08,710
which is spelled out in only a few
thousand words there. See, on Monday.
