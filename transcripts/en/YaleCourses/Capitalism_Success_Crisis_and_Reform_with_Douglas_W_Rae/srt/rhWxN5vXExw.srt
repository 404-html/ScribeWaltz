1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:03,893
Today,

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,310
we had ordinarily expected Paulos Arnone,

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,030
who is the senior partner of
Goldman Sachs to be with us.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,720
And it turns out,
uh,

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,830
we are a lower priority than a new merger
deal and we'll have him a month from

6
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:26,640
today, uh, which gives us

7
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,550
time to pull together a
bunch of, uh, important, uh,

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,570
details about the institutional
foundations of capitalism.

9
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,990
And I'm gonna use the term
wealth maximizing law today.

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,250
If you think about,
uh,

11
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,010
what courts do and what legislature's,
uh,

12
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,160
at any level from new haven to
the congress, the United States,

13
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,140
they set rules which create incentives
and disincentives that affect how people

14
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,163
behave.

15
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,400
And we're going to do four topics today,

16
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:18,240
but they're all ways
of talking about that.

17
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,740
I'm going to start with the Coase Theorem,
which is not in your reading packet.

18
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,550
Uh, and neither is it
strictly speaking a Theorem,

19
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,150
but it is a foundational set of
concepts that Hernando Desoto,

20
00:01:35,121 --> 00:01:38,250
his book, which we are reading, uh,

21
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:43,050
is built on to Soto has in
effect taken the Coase Theorem,

22
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:45,540
which is 60 years back.

23
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,470
And it one Ron coast, a Nobel prize, uh,

24
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,640
about 30 years ago.
Uh,

25
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,950
has taken the Coase theorem and applied
it to reality in a very lively way.

26
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,640
So the Theorem is a good thing
to have in the background.

27
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,720
A second and very briefly,
we're going to look at a law case,

28
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:09,570
which is actually in the syllabus
for a little later in term,

29
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,590
but I'm going to bring it forward
because this is really a good place to,

30
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,070
to show, uh, it's resolved.

31
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:21,750
It's a case about whaling
off Cape Cod in the 1980s.

32
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,650
And what's important about it
is not the facts of the case,

33
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:30,210
but the way the judge reasoned
his decision. A third,

34
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:34,950
we're going to do a desoto in America,
uh,

35
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:38,790
which was, uh, the assignment in,

36
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,360
in this book for today's class.
And finally,

37
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:45,640
we're going to look at some
of the finer grained, uh,

38
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,070
distinctions in the way you can
structure a business organization.

39
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,163
Coase theorem.

40
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,580
It's about this story. This is,
we've all been through, right,

41
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,770
uh,
about

42
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,970
disputed ownership of property.

43
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,030
Now,
um,

44
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,460
I've noticed a pattern here and let's
see if I've got it right or not.

45
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:16,723
That

46
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,990
you're always in that third
chair from the end of this row.

47
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,390
I think all three of you are always
in this orientation. My ride.

48
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,660
Okay.
And how would it work out if,

49
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,690
let's say Leslie here came a little early
next Wednesday and sat in one of those

50
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:45,280
three chairs. It would be horrible. Okay.

51
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,140
Now
what would be horrible about it?

52
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,520
You're all coequal he
students in the course,

53
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:58,810
the chairs so far as I can tell are
identical except that this one is broken.

54
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,960
What's up?
This is sort of

55
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,830
acknowledged my seat.

56
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:07,963
Okay.

57
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:12,830
It's acknowledges your seat and the
other two of you would say something very

58
00:04:12,831 --> 00:04:13,664
like that.

59
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,540
Um, you own this one? Yes. Yes.

60
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:20,933
Okay.

61
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:21,900
Uh,

62
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,900
so what we have here is an
informal set of property rights.

63
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,010
There isn't a law of any kind,

64
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,220
which refers to these rights,

65
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:41,130
but they are the folk
way, folk way norms, uh,

66
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,360
of our classroom. Now, if we
press further, let's take,

67
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,520
you have an in, in your college
and your college and that college.

68
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,770
Yeah. Do you live there? Yeah. Okay. Uh,

69
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,860
are there property rights in and around
your entryway and in your suite and so

70
00:04:58,861 --> 00:04:59,694
on?

71
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,080
Are they ones written down by the
Dean's office or by the master?

72
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,153
Are they,

73
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,960
well, I mean, aren't there
some that aren't written down

74
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,623
perhaps?

75
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,330
Well, okay. Can you, I'm

76
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,200
trying to draw you out on this right here.

77
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:27,610
Uh, he has a quarter of the common and
dedicated to his desk and his children's

78
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,683
studies.

79
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,910
And what would you think of sitting there?
Yeah.

80
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,660
Okay. And Ray, how does it, does your
friend here have any rights or not?

81
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,760
Um, I guess, let's see, before you go in.

82
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,620
I think we're not doing that one this
morning, this afternoon, but it actually,

83
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:55,240
it's actually very suggestive,
right?

84
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:59,960
That there is that beneath government,

85
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,200
outside the actions of the state,

86
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,270
there is an enormously intricate
system of informal property,

87
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,280
which governs the way
we actually function.

88
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,920
And that system, a property,
uh, can be good, bad,

89
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,590
or indifferent.
It can be just or unjust.

90
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:27,170
It can be notoriously inefficient.
And in fact,

91
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:32,171
if you think about the
failure of socialist regimes,

92
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:39,190
one important explanation is that the
underlying informal norms about what

93
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:45,221
people do with their work lives were never
integrated with the planned economies

94
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,200
in an effective way.
Now.

95
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,310
So that's something about formality.
And in formality,

96
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:00,110
I also have here a watch.
Um,

97
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:04,340
it says on the top Mavado
um,

98
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:09,290
it's really very handsome
and I really don't need it.

99
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,490
I'm thinking of selling it.

100
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,800
And does anybody have any,
does anybody need a watch?

101
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,410
You do. You don't. Uh,

102
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:30,580
what does, uh, what does the standard
Movado watch sell four in a jewelry store?

103
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,070
I actually don't know. I should've done
my homework. I think it's low hundreds

104
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,200
and I'd be willing to part
with this fund for 20 Bucks

105
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,280
who says deal?
I'd be careful.

106
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:58,340
Is it conceivable that the proper retail
price of this is less than 20 bucks?

107
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,960
Um,
what I,

108
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:08,860
but remember what I'm trying to
demonstrate here is information asymmetry.

109
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:17,680
This watch is worth about $8. And, uh,

110
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,560
it's a,
and if I sold it to you,

111
00:08:20,561 --> 00:08:25,561
what I would be doing is
stealing from the manufacturer,

112
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:26,920
stealing the brand.

113
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:32,710
And one of the curious things about
watches these days, by the way,

114
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:37,120
it works fine. Somebody gave it
to me for my birthday as a joke.

115
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:42,520
Uh, it keeps, as far as
I can tell, perfect time,

116
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:46,730
possibly better time than a real Mavado.
Uh,

117
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,510
and there's an interesting
problem about watches, right? Uh,

118
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:55,950
which is better a $9 Casio,

119
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,840
the cheapest imaginable
Casio or a Timex or a Rolex.

120
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,430
Uh,
if the question is keeping good time.

121
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,020
Pardon?
Yeah.

122
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:18,170
The Rolex is a mechanical movement
of brilliantly designed and executed

123
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,260
mechanical movement.

124
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:24,890
And it's not as good as an
ordinary electronic watch
doesn't keep time as well.

125
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:32,250
And yet people are willing to
pay a thousand to one multiples,

126
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:37,560
uh,
for the social meaning of the brand.

127
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,600
And that means that there's an enormous
market for cheaply made watches,

128
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,590
gray, gray market watches or
even black market watches,

129
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,940
which knock off a brand name,

130
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,820
uh,
and which people,

131
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:01,710
people sometimes by really
thinking that it's the real deal,

132
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:07,310
but more often just thinking it's kind
of fun to buy an expensive brand for say

133
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,390
$20.
Well,

134
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,430
the Coase theorem is about

135
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:23,930
those issues plus the one
where this girl is vexed.

136
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,560
And the one where she's vexed is
that the property rights to that toy.

137
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,260
Our unclearly marked,

138
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,190
I have a granddaughter who has,
um,

139
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,760
who got the boss gene from her mother
and she's a first a kindergartener.

140
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,570
And her first day at school they got out,
they brought,

141
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:53,571
brought out a little plastic aunt for
the children to learn basic arithmetic

142
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:57,360
with and they put a pile of them on the,
in the middle of each table.

143
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,230
And then for kids. And, uh,

144
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,620
my granddaughter came home complaining
that the other kids had been mean to her.

145
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,240
And so her mother talked to
the teacher the next day.

146
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,480
And the story was that, uh, the gray,

147
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,700
our grandchild had taken all the aunts
and put them in a pile and then begun

148
00:11:26,431 --> 00:11:30,300
negotiating bilateral agreements
to give some to the other students.

149
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,210
They didn't like that.
Well,

150
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,680
the Coase theorem boiled down

151
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:42,750
is that if you have three conditions,

152
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,290
clear initial entitlements to property,

153
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,050
and this is what, this is what's
stressed most in the desoto book,

154
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,710
clear entitlements to property,
uh,

155
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,020
a high degree of transparency,

156
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:04,160
which is what's missing in the
story about the bogus Movado Watch,

157
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,670
uh,
and um,

158
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,660
and low transaction costs.
Uh,

159
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,850
the Nobel Prize in economics
announced, uh, today,

160
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:23,590
uh, they, they announced two
of them, but one of them, um,

161
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,030
went to Ali Williamson,
formerly a colleague of ours here at Yale,

162
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,880
uh,
for inventing and elaborating a,

163
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:37,890
the idea of transaction cost
economics and by trends that we have.

164
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,720
We talked a little about
transaction costs here,

165
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:46,880
about how hard it is to do to
get, get a deal made. You know,

166
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:50,480
what deal you want to make a but the,

167
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:54,530
all the red tape that gets in the way,
uh,

168
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,420
makes it very difficult to get there.

169
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,560
And Kostas principle point

170
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,540
is that in that

171
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,040
tiny segment in the middle of the Venn
diagram where these three conditions all

172
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,084
obtain,

173
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:20,020
we should expect people to reach efficient
allocations of property no matter

174
00:13:21,741 --> 00:13:26,450
what the initial allocation.
Now notice I didn't say,

175
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:29,450
and he doesn't say fair
or just allocations,

176
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,480
just efficient and efficient in the
sense that people will trade to a point

177
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:42,710
where there are no further
opportunities to uh,

178
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,120
for mutual gain.

179
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,640
And you get to a so called Paredo
efficient or contract curve outcome.

180
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,960
And I'm going to,
well I don't do this to you very often,

181
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,500
but we're going to do this with a,
uh,

182
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,120
a graphic demonstration.
This an Edgeworth box

183
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:08,690
I used one once before and it does
anybody in trouble about how an edge worth

184
00:14:08,691 --> 00:14:11,720
box and set up home if you are.

185
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,560
Okay.
So Smith is here,

186
00:14:15,561 --> 00:14:20,561
Voltaire is their Smith gets that
much paper and that quantity of Penn's

187
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,500
Voltaire gets the OP verse quantities.

188
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,870
If we start at the Red Dot,

189
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,860
Voltaire to entitlements are shown by
the blue lines and Smith's by the pink

190
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:33,924
lines,

191
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:42,540
uh, Voltaire would prefer anything,

192
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:48,020
any outcome beyond this indifference
curve going this way away from his,

193
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,890
his point of origin.
And Smith

194
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:59,080
would prefer anything that way
from the pink indifference curve.

195
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:04,760
So there is a set of outcomes
which are clearly superior to the,

196
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:09,820
to the starting point. And
they're in that set, that Lozenge,

197
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,050
uh, in shape. And so
they will trade to that.

198
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,940
And if the,

199
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:20,900
if we just set it up as this is a rank
order account of what Smith wants and of

200
00:15:20,901 --> 00:15:25,070
what Voltaire wants, yes,
is that set of outcomes

201
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:31,440
and those two s and the two
diagrams is the same thing.

202
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,360
And ultimately they'll get to an outcome
where the indifference curves are

203
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,820
tangency to one another.
So there's no further gain from trade.

204
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:48,410
And there will be a whole set of
outcomes that fit that description,

205
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:55,710
forming the contract curve,
all those points

206
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:03,190
and the contract curve will be equivalent
to this possibility frontier in the

207
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:08,370
other style of diagram.
And

208
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:15,760
so really simple idea.
Uh,

209
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,570
the way to use the Coase
theorem though is backward.

210
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,620
The coach there is boring.
Incidentally,

211
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,940
I was talking to my tas this morning about
the first round of memos and they had

212
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:35,241
only one complaint that
they were often boring

213
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,460
and not,
not bad,

214
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,180
but there was none of the author's
personality at most of them.

215
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,240
And you've all learned,
I,

216
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,400
you've all learned long sense how to write
papers in college and get good grade,

217
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:57,270
but you audit just occasionally
put yourself into it.

218
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,630
Don't do it the standard way Josh,

219
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:06,210
go out on a limb. Now that's especially
true if you don't want to get,

220
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,330
you don't think you need to go to
law school, Med school or an Mba,

221
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,840
but it's,
it's actually,

222
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,580
I remember,

223
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:21,120
I remember making it all look the exact
same calculations when I was where you

224
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:21,954
are,

225
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:28,260
but a little risk taking and writing
actually endears you to those who,

226
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,080
who read the the work and um,

227
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:37,530
often actually pays off.
An interesting thing about writing after,

228
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,480
after your Ba, uh, taking
risks with your writing,

229
00:17:42,481 --> 00:17:44,490
turns out to be the only
way of getting ahead.

230
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:50,750
Standard issue writing page up to the BA
n by and large doesn't pay after that.

231
00:17:51,911 --> 00:17:55,920
It's interesting. At any rate, I don't
mean to alarm you about your grades,

232
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:00,570
but I think, yeah, I think it's
actually worth thinking about.

233
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,120
Um,
I'd mislabeled this.

234
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:10,920
The top label should read again
versus rich Gannon is spelled g, H,

235
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:15,950
e n and this is a case about thinking
out the incentives to make people behave

236
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:26,550
in productive ways.
The story goes as follows

237
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,260
again is a whaler.
Um,

238
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,260
he operates out of
Wellfleet, Massachusetts. Uh,

239
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:42,180
it is 1881,
and uh,

240
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,610
he spots a fin back whale

241
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:51,650
and sends the little boats out with
his crew and they harpooned the whale.

242
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:58,890
Uh, and thin backs are big, uh,

243
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:03,920
fast aggressive and they
have one further peculiarity.

244
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,780
When you kill them, they sink
to the bottom of the sea. Uh,

245
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:13,530
virtually all whales float when,
when killed.

246
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:17,370
And the general rule
of property in whaling

247
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,910
is finders keepers,
losers,

248
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:24,000
weepers you've all heard of that.

249
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,340
And the, and the specific, uh,

250
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,120
method is that after you kill a whale,

251
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:38,900
you either lash it to your ship
and tow it to harbor or uh,

252
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,490
or slice it up and processes at sea.

253
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:46,890
But these boats by and large
weren't big enough for that.

254
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:53,360
Or you leave it floating and put a
marker on it and the marker is your,

255
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,190
it's your brand.
It's like branding cattle.

256
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,470
And everybody then is compelled by law
to acknowledged that it's your whale.

257
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,600
But the fin back presents a dilemma
because neither of those strategies is

258
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:13,020
available to the Waler
who kills a fin back.

259
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,160
And what happened to this particular fin
back is that it floated up a day or two

260
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:23,250
later on the beach near
Wellfleet on Cape Cod.

261
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:29,330
And a gentleman came along and found
it and conducted a quick auction.

262
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,640
And Ellis Bob Ellis bought the whale and
processed it into a way oil and other

263
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:44,490
byproducts,

264
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,120
put them on the market and at this again
returned from his voyage and wanted to

265
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,343
swale back.

266
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:58,780
So he sued Ellis are rich rather,

267
00:20:58,781 --> 00:21:02,860
sorry. Ellis was the guy on
the beach who found it. Uh,

268
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:07,150
he sued rich, who, who
had processed the oil, uh,

269
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,230
for his money.

270
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,700
And what happened was that the judge
ruled in favor of gay men and reasoned,

271
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,330
well,
let me not tell the whole story.

272
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:25,170
Let's suppose you are hired as
attorney for the fin back whales,

273
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:32,970
the fin back whales hire you as a lawyer
and they want to get this case to come

274
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:36,640
out so that they will be safe
from whaling in the future.

275
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,570
How would they have the
judge decide the case

276
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,213
back?

277
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,980
Okay. Exactly. And why?

278
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,920
Nope, because the risks.

279
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,010
Okay,
perfect.

280
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:16,430
So the judge reason just as suggested
that only by honoring the relatively

281
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:24,180
indirect claimed a property
which gun was urging,

282
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,950
could the industry of bag of,

283
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:33,140
of wailing for whale backs be incented
so that it would go on in the future.

284
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:35,843
Now

285
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,290
a lot of things we're doing and
thinking about are analogous to that.

286
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:44,930
Okay.

287
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:49,930
Structuring incentives so that people
behave in ways which increased the wealth

288
00:22:51,051 --> 00:22:53,320
of society,
uh,

289
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,950
while trying to increase their own wealth.
Uh,

290
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,150
in effect,

291
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:04,190
creating conditions analogous
to the invisible hand

292
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:10,280
in Smith is what the judge was doing.

293
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,310
And it's, it's actually,
you should Google it.

294
00:23:13,311 --> 00:23:17,640
It's only three pages long
and just read the opinion, uh,

295
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:22,810
because it brings out the fundamental
issues that we're trying to deal with now.

296
00:23:25,161 --> 00:23:26,570
Just Soto in America.

297
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,203
MMM.

298
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,380
Desoto talks in the
early parts of the book,

299
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:40,381
which we read at the opening of term
desoto talks mainly about emerging market

300
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:44,134
countries

301
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:50,530
and the jest is that they
are loaded with dead capital.

302
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,480
Okay.

303
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,000
Oh, can somebody help us with
the notion of dead capital?

304
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,663
Here we go.

305
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:12,990
Live Capitol Service Focus,
purpose out of the House and um,

306
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,800
it's kind of second line to serve

307
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,010
future investment. Okay. Actually
have a legal right over your house.

308
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,440
It can't serve it in the second purpose.

309
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:28,930
Okay. So the, the house,

310
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,630
so let's,
let's take the chair you own here.

311
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,200
Is it dead Capitol or live capitol?

312
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,020
Well, it's not a lot to me because I
don't own it, but to the university maybe.

313
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,500
Okay. Okay. That's well put. And we,

314
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:51,300
we will in fact look at the title
to this room in a few minutes.

315
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,650
The,
um,

316
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,713
MMM

317
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:59,610
desotos idea is that

318
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,380
in an informal system of property,

319
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,250
which has not been integrated with
a governmental system of property,

320
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,890
people have capital,

321
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:16,040
but it is dead in the sense that it can't
be used for collateral against a loan.

322
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,120
And if it is sold,

323
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:26,870
there is no way to enforce the contract
on the sale except mafia style.

324
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:34,470
And Mafia style often doesn't
work out all that well. So

325
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,730
the,
the

326
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,100
chapter we read for today

327
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:47,690
is about the proposition that the advanced
economies didn't get to having live

328
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:51,870
capitol all at once.

329
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:57,800
It came through a long process and
Desoto in this chapter talks through the

330
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:06,500
informal practices or property which grew
up in a mining camps in California are

331
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:13,740
in agricultural communities in Iowa
and other Midwestern states in,

332
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,100
uh,
uh,

333
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:22,110
claims to land in a colonial America.

334
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:27,980
And what I'd like to do is start at
the present and then work our way back.

335
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:40,580
Uh, this is a property map
of our present neighborhood.

336
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,160
This is an official map

337
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,610
from the,
the place where deeds are capped

338
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,020
at 200 Orange Street in new haven.

339
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:59,700
And in every community
in the United States,

340
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:04,500
you will find a set of deeds and a
corresponding set of maps similar to this

341
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:08,760
one. I'll do sec this and in large
parts of it and so on. As we go.

342
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,940
Uh, you'll find, uh,

343
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,020
these maps are quite ubiquitous.

344
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:21,050
Now this one has the peculiarity that in
some parts of the city they've drawn in

345
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:25,670
the buildings and it turns
out that that's there,

346
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:29,790
that that has happened where there is a
wealthy institution that paid to have it

347
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:33,770
done familiar to all of us,
uh,

348
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:38,370
and not where there isn't
a wealthy institution that
would pay to have it done.

349
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:44,060
The green lines represent property parcels
and all lists is entirely accessible.

350
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:52,080
If you go, if you Google vision
appraisal, one word, a vision,

351
00:27:52,081 --> 00:27:55,260
a vision appraisal, new haven, uh,

352
00:27:55,261 --> 00:28:00,261
you'll get all these files and you'll
get a photograph of every structure to go

353
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:02,094
with it.

354
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:08,930
And here we have a particular parcel that
includes and surrounds this building.

355
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,360
And there's a close up of the
building and we're in the,

356
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:23,310
you can see
the match there.

357
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,370
And let's look at four,

358
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:32,480
three properties first and then we'll
look at some more and we'll see how

359
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
structures of ownership get built
around the formalized property parcels.

360
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,370
Um,
61 high street is this building?

361
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,950
Anybody know what 64 high street is?

362
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,320
No idea.
What's the small stone?

363
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,850
Small Brownstone building
across the boy skull and bones.

364
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,860
Okay.
In skull and bones.

365
00:28:59,861 --> 00:29:04,610
Turns out for property
purposes to be called the uh,

366
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:09,700
Russell Trust. And we'll look
at that. And 41 high street.

367
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,700
I was just there.
Uh,

368
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,310
is Starbucks and some
other property above it.

369
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,580
And let's look at,

370
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,130
well I I,

371
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:33,550
yeah,

372
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:37,990
10 66 chapel is actually Starbucks.

373
00:29:37,991 --> 00:29:40,330
I was mistaken in what
I said a minute ago.

374
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:44,110
41 high is the building
right behind Starbucks.

375
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,170
And this is what you
find on the land records.

376
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:51,970
So this building is parcel
one four one eight eight,

377
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,020
a map to 61,
block two 52.

378
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,820
It has any effective total area.
And this is,

379
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:04,360
this means places you
could do anything with.

380
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,760
And this would count every,

381
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,780
every square foot of
indoor or outdoor space.

382
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:16,890
And it totals a little over a hundred
thousand of which 9,259 is heated indoor

383
00:30:18,701 --> 00:30:21,010
space.
Um,

384
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:26,410
it's asserted value from
the city is 2.6 8 million,

385
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,690
uh, uh, for the land
4.97 for the building,

386
00:30:31,691 --> 00:30:35,170
7.65 all together.
Uh,

387
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,020
and of that 7.65,

388
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,740
7.65 is exempt from taxes in the city.

389
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,010
And that's a point of
interest to the city.

390
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:50,470
And what I'm trying to do get you to
do is just get into the details of this

391
00:30:50,471 --> 00:30:53,240
stuff and see how interesting it is.
A,

392
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:58,260
the net value to the city for tax
purposes is zero owner Yale University

393
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,423
now

394
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:08,710
compare this to 10 66 chapel,

395
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:12,800
uh,
where the numbers are smaller because the,

396
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,350
the buildings are smaller and,
and they're nowhere near as good.

397
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,500
Um,
the

398
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,710
net taxable value is
half a million dollars.

399
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,670
The owner is something
called Chapel investments,

400
00:31:28,671 --> 00:31:33,671
Llc and Chapel Investments LLC is
owned by people I know the work family,

401
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,560
and they own four parcels over there,

402
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:48,130
including the one in which Cesar Pelli
has his architectural office and so on.

403
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:53,330
And it is organized as
a taxable corporation,

404
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,420
a taxable LLC,
which is,

405
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,290
this is a hybrid,
a hybrid form,

406
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,630
which we'll get to at the end of the hour.

407
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,440
Now let's take the value of this building
and the way it looks to Yale and the

408
00:32:09,081 --> 00:32:09,914
city.

409
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,093
Uh,

410
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:18,370
if we wanted to mark to market
Lindsley Chittenden Hall.

411
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:19,850
Yeah.

412
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:22,970
We want to say,
what would this building really shell for

413
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,770
this building and the land in question.

414
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,940
How would we go about that?

415
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:36,210
Who's got an estimate more
or less than 7.6 $5 million

416
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,553
more?

417
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:44,130
Who said more? Okay.
Can we get him on mic?

418
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,410
Oh, there we go. Um, why do you think so?

419
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:07,510
Okay. Is it a bit, it does. It
looks like it's well maintained.

420
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,250
Might buying this have any
resemblance to buying them?

421
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,090
Lobato watch of this description.

422
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,990
Let's suppose I want to run a,

423
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:24,790
some kind of a commercial
educational institution.

424
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,520
What would this building be worth if
I were suppose I were going to run

425
00:33:30,521 --> 00:33:34,540
something which was aimed at,
uh,

426
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,630
wealthy kids with bad test scores.

427
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:45,750
Yeah,
I might name it ray college at Yale.

428
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,680
It has a ring to it.
Right?

429
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,030
And the building use that.

430
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:56,190
That might be the highest
and best use of the building.

431
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:59,940
Anybody else got a thought
about what? Yes, Thomas.

432
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,210
I am.
Well,

433
00:34:03,211 --> 00:34:08,211
unless I can get it made into a five
o one c three nonprofit corporation,

434
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:14,190
in which case I might get
away with not paying taxes.

435
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,570
Um,
so any,

436
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,880
any other use anybody can
imagine for this thing?

437
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,180
Oh, come on. Yes,

438
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,020
some ways.

439
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,730
Well,
I mean,

440
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:56,460
can we think of anything unrelated
to education you could do with this?

441
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,800
Could it be a resort?

442
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:11,500
Pardon? I making a movie theater.
You'd make it a movie theater. Well,

443
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:14,230
I gotta tell you,
I think that's a really bad idea.

444
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:23,440
If you study the current economics
with movie theaters, don't do it.

445
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,340
Uh,
anybody else

446
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,270
renovating and spilling as
an indication of how much

447
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:37,990
when you're willing to pay for a

448
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:42,720
mass amount of money, I buy it. That would
give a lot of value. Well, that's right.

449
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,860
And by the way,

450
00:35:43,861 --> 00:35:48,840
is a good reason to think that they're
not going to sell it for any price that

451
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:52,020
we could even imagine
capturing the value from.

452
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:55,680
I think that's right. Now, uh,

453
00:35:55,770 --> 00:36:00,770
the other property is probably already
the Starbucks one is probably already

454
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,010
pretty much add highest and best
use and is therefore an interesting.

455
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:14,090
Now let's think about the properties on
the other end of the block across Chapel

456
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,780
Street, the end, uh,

457
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:20,750
down towards the new haven green
and there's a large assembly,

458
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,910
there are about 15 parcels down there.
I picked out three,

459
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,573
and

460
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,780
they all look like this.

461
00:36:30,781 --> 00:36:33,450
They all belonged to something
called the chapel company.

462
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,770
Who can make a guess what
the Chapel Company might be?

463
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,840
Well,
I'll tell you yes.

464
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:50,800
How, how perceptive. Okay,

465
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,790
here's the story.

466
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:53,623
MMM.

467
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,370
25 years ago, a Yale college
alum named Joel [inaudible],

468
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:05,430
who is an irascible and brilliant fellow,
Yale Co,

469
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,780
he has the same educational pattern
as Jim Alexander here, Yale College,

470
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,890
Harvard Business School.

471
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:12,903
MMM.

472
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,010
He bought, it was a slum. All these,

473
00:37:17,011 --> 00:37:20,760
this whole area down here
was a commercial slump.

474
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,430
The buildings were in disrepair.

475
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:28,770
They were being used for
a very marginal purposes,

476
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:34,650
and he bought the whole thing up for
not very much and began renovating it.

477
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,680
And the renovation model was small retail,

478
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,980
small retail with quality, um, uh,

479
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,700
residential on the
second and third floors.

480
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:51,020
And we're talking about places like the
Union league and Claire's Cornucopia and

481
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:57,650
the Shubert theater and the
Taft hotel. Now, the Taft, uh,

482
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,980
condominium,
uh,

483
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:04,680
he fixed it all up and
made it really sing.

484
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:07,920
And one of his precepts was every,

485
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:13,040
every property should be
leased to somebody who owns
their own business and is

486
00:38:13,651 --> 00:38:15,840
willing to work really
hard at making it work.

487
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,580
So he didn't go after change.
He went after entrepreneurs. Uh,

488
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,310
and the thing really worked beautifully.

489
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,380
But Shavani is one of
these guys who can't.

490
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,830
He's got the spirit of
champagne Schumpeter about him.

491
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,990
You can never leave well enough alone.

492
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:36,860
So he gets interested in other things
and leverages the new things by taking

493
00:38:38,081 --> 00:38:40,060
further mortgages on all this property.

494
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,150
And then in the 1980 [inaudible],

495
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:48,240
there is a huge real estate recession
and he loses it all to a federal offense

496
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,990
of the federal government,

497
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,800
buys all the property for very level and
then auctions it off through something

498
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:05,041
called the RTC and Yale hires a guy named
Joe [inaudible] who was a student of

499
00:39:06,521 --> 00:39:08,620
mine at som at the time this happened.

500
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:13,450
He now runs all of Disney's
real estate and Fay,

501
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:18,451
he invented the Chapel Company and
bought all of the ponies property,

502
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,650
uh, on Yale's behalf for
about 25 cents on the dollar.

503
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:30,790
And Yale was, had the, the
good judgment, in my opinion,

504
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:35,020
to leave it all functioning as pro as
if it were private commercial property.

505
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:39,670
And the neighborhood is a
strengthened enormously by that.

506
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:44,350
Uh, and Yale. Yale does not
make a lot of money at it,

507
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:49,950
but it indirectly gets a lot of
benefit by having a strong commercial

508
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:55,510
neighborhood, a budding the campus.
Oh, we're not quite ready for that.

509
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,370
Well, let's, let's not use
the maps, but let's do, um,

510
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:11,940
let's talk about properties, uh,
further up in the middle of campus.

511
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:16,530
I'd like you to focus on one 40 high
street and three Oh six York street,

512
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,010
one 40 high street is the Yale law school

513
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:26,210
and it's taxable value is $42 million.

514
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,360
That's the building,
not the institution.

515
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,393
MMM.

516
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:39,300
Across York Street is Maurice or
more exactly the Maurice Trust.

517
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,820
What do you think Morrie's is worth?

518
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:50,620
Well, the tax estimate is
$400,000 and a little bit.

519
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:55,130
Who would be prepared to
buy Maurice for 400,000?

520
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:03,190
No takers.
Anybody tempted?

521
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,070
Okay.
Why are we so cautious about Morris?

522
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:13,423
Pardon?

523
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:15,710
Why are we cautious about Maurice?

524
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:18,810
Wow.

525
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,170
It closed its doors on
December 19th last year.

526
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,210
What's wrong with that?

527
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,580
It would about area.

528
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,453
Okay.

529
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,580
Yeah. I mean, it's, it's,
sure. A rundown neighborhood.

530
00:41:41,581 --> 00:41:44,900
You've got the Yale Hall of
Graduate Studies, Morse and stiles.

531
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,120
Okay.

532
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,640
Okay.
I am at,

533
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:08,580
I am the chairman of the group
that it in fact owns it and

534
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,140
okay.

535
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:15,330
I try not to take offense at
the way you guys value it.

536
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:21,570
Um, we're investing $3 million
in it over the next four months,

537
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,360
and,
um,

538
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,960
we plan to open it and have all of you
clamoring to get through the front door

539
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:35,270
or the backdoor, which will
be the whiff and poof bar. Um,

540
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:40,630
now in evaluating it,

541
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:45,100
you do have to take into account lots
of things that aren't bricks and mortar.

542
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:48,260
And I'm glad you said what you said,
you're,

543
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:53,050
you're blaming the neighborhood for what
is in fact a spectacularly mismanaged

544
00:42:53,051 --> 00:42:55,040
business, right? I mean,

545
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:58,840
did anybody eat and mores last year?

546
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,680
Can you, can we get the mic to
this lady? We're going to do a,

547
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,633
okay.

548
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:10,890
Okay. On a one to five star
basis, what's the rating

549
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:20,650
compared to food that costs
about the same thing? Uh,

550
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,080
on the private market

551
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:23,740
pain, but, um,

552
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:29,520
a three.

553
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,033
Okay.

554
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:39,690
The fun part was the singing,
the memorabilia, the cockroaches.

555
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,510
No, I'm kidding. Um,

556
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:48,360
but the food was notorious,
right? It was really bad.

557
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,370
And how well did they
do with serving drinks?

558
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,480
Horrible.
There was no bar.

559
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:02,300
The tables down at Morrie's had no bar.
Um,

560
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:06,570
and it failed partly because
we were very badly managed.

561
00:44:06,571 --> 00:44:09,060
It was managed by 15 Yale Alumni,

562
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,620
not one of whom knew
anything about business.

563
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,720
That's a little harsh,

564
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:22,750
not one of whom knew anything
about business except for
just being a stockbroker,

565
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:27,280
which is a pretty abstract business,
right?

566
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,980
There are no cooks in a brokerage house.

567
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,750
The other side of it,

568
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,200
and we will actually do this case
before we're done. The other,

569
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:45,230
the other side of it was
a highly restrictive labor
union contract with local to

570
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:50,250
17 of unite here.

571
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:55,190
And that contract,
um,

572
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:57,840
doesn't go away when you close the door.

573
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:03,540
Turns out under Connecticut
Labor Law that the contract,

574
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:07,590
if you reopen a restaurant there,

575
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,850
you would normally expect,
you would have to honor the contract.

576
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:16,560
Now it turns out we have a loophole.
It's going to get us a more,

577
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,920
a better deal than that.
But I'll give you an idea of what the,

578
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:23,570
so what that means is
that given the labor,

579
00:45:23,571 --> 00:45:28,571
while the value of the building is
affected by the existence of the union

580
00:45:28,591 --> 00:45:29,424
contract,

581
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:34,710
it becomes almost like paint and
the way it adheres to the thing.

582
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:38,250
And it included a,
for example,

583
00:45:38,251 --> 00:45:43,251
a provision that there should be four
people called cashiers who count the cash

584
00:45:43,981 --> 00:45:46,880
each night.
Um,

585
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:52,050
only one on duty each night they
rotated. They were all part timers. Uh,

586
00:45:52,051 --> 00:45:56,850
one of them was a full time teacher
at a local high school and they were

587
00:45:56,851 --> 00:46:01,170
required that you were required to pay
them four hours for each appearance.

588
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:07,160
And each appearance was how much cash do
you think you'd take in these days in a

589
00:46:07,171 --> 00:46:08,640
restaurant of that kind?

590
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:10,743
None.

591
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,630
There might on a good
night be $100 to count,

592
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:20,800
but the contract oblige Morrie's to employ
these guys and worse yet to pay them

593
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:23,000
vacation time.

594
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:30,550
So we have a high school teacher being
paid five days of vacation time by

595
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:34,520
Moreish while he is on vacation,

596
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:39,050
paid vacation from the Branford
school system. That's a deal.

597
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:40,583
Um,

598
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:46,240
so analyzing what gets built on
this framework is a little complex.

599
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:52,563
MMM.

600
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:58,530
Let's go through the big story in Desoto,

601
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:03,740
uh,
about za the

602
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:06,880
informal property systems
in the United States.

603
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:11,520
Can anybody summarize it
for us in a hundred words?

604
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,510
Got to take her out there.

605
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,420
Are you headed for a taker?

606
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,353
Oh,

607
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:28,733
okay.

608
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:32,480
Uh, I'll do it. Um,

609
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:37,490
the system of property is
built on nation states.

610
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:42,520
Nation states are the underlying unit
and when you have a frontier society,

611
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:48,380
which the United States
remained until about 1880,

612
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:54,290
you have a vast area where
there is effectively no state

613
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,800
or if there is a state,

614
00:47:57,801 --> 00:48:02,801
it is a very weak state with very limited
capacities to enforce any property

615
00:48:03,351 --> 00:48:04,184
system.

616
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:06,800
And the,

617
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:14,070
the key green versus Biddle case which
arose in Kentucky asserted the following.

618
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,450
It said, informal property
rights count for nothing,

619
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:28,320
only formal property rights issued by a
part of the United States government at

620
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:32,320
either the federal or the
state level count as real.

621
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:39,180
Uh, this provoked a rebellion
that included violence. Uh,

622
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:44,280
it also created an enormous inefficiency
because the existing informal system of

623
00:48:47,561 --> 00:48:52,300
property rights based on
preemption and occupation,

624
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,440
so called Tomahawk rights
or cornfield rights.

625
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,890
You occupy the land,
improve the land,

626
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:04,120
demonstrate that you're making a living
from the land and it becomes yours.

627
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:06,070
Homesteading was the name for it.

628
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:10,090
And in 1862,

629
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:15,310
the homestead act
adopted into federal law,

630
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:20,820
that system of informal law and made
an integration between the two levels,

631
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,000
the,
the

632
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:36,230
wealth that was built in
the United States. Uh,

633
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:40,670
in the, in everything outside
the original east coast colonies,

634
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:46,010
uh, is built up on that peace
treaty between formal and informal.

635
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,730
The, uh, he does a brilliant job.

636
00:49:49,731 --> 00:49:54,731
Desoto does with the mining camps in
California and with the land claim

637
00:49:56,811 --> 00:50:01,040
associations in the Midwest. And you
can read the details for yourselves.

638
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:02,563
Uh,

639
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:07,600
but the gist is that a well
functioning system of property,

640
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:13,210
we'll have both the formal
and the informal rights, uh,

641
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:18,050
in sync with one another,
not in tension with one another.

642
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:23,710
And if we go finally to,
uh,

643
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:27,080
the finer details of business,

644
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:32,750
we're done. Now, I'll use this at
the beginning of class on Wednesday.

645
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:38,210
I'll talk about how Morrie's is
being restructured and you should,

646
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:38,900
uh,

647
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:43,900
the case as scheduled for Wednesday is
the one about the mortgage meltdown in

648
00:50:45,261 --> 00:50:50,000
Cleveland, Ohio, and the URL has
been posted on classes. Be Too.
