1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:02,461
Okay.

2
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:07,461
Today's discussion relies on three
bucks and one of them is high acts,

3
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:14,340
constitution of liberty,
which you've seen, uh, uh,

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,560
two chapters of online.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,950
Another is Hernando de Soto's
mystery of capital. Uh,

6
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:24,810
and the third,
uh,

7
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:28,650
and by far most entertaining is our oven.

8
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,540
A Diego's the white tiger.

9
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,730
In today's class we're talking about
something really foundational and it is,

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,290
it is basically a pragmatic or
practical theory of freedom.

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,840
It's why is freedom of good thing.

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,580
And this is a much less high flown
theory than many philosophers would give

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,710
Hayak after all was an economist.

14
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,850
But it is a powerful one.

15
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:05,970
And for me it corresponds to
more or less to my convictions.

16
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,190
And the,

17
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,270
the most powerful aspect of it is that
I can profit from your freedom and you

18
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:18,540
can profit from mine.

19
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,860
Freedom is a common good individual.

20
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:31,020
Freedom is a common good in a
way that makes a great deal of,

21
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,940
of practical,
common sense to a lot of people,

22
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:40,410
including me.
We'll do it in four chunks.

23
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,660
We'll begin by looking
at high JAKKS framework.

24
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,850
Uh, we will then, uh,

25
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,130
take up briefly the question of government
and how government relates to this.

26
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,160
Then we will look at to Soto's,
uh,

27
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,680
the Soto's analysis of live and dead
capitol and his explanation of why

28
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,370
undeveloped countries remain
undeveloped in many cases. Uh,

29
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:19,230
and then finally we'll rub our
idea of freedom up against,

30
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,450
uh, the lives of the central
players in the white tiger.

31
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,820
And throughout this I'm
gonna, I'm gonna, uh,

32
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,560
advert, uh, from time
to time to a Yale story,

33
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,490
not the tragic one that is on the
front page of today's paper. Uh,

34
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,400
but an equally well now I wouldn't say
equal eight. Another troubling story,

35
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:53,270
which is the decision of Yale University
press when it agreed to publish a book

36
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:56,160
about the Danish cartoons,

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,790
which poked fun at the
Prophet Prophet Mohammed.

38
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,550
Uh, when that book was ready
for printing three months ago,

39
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,890
uh, the director of Yale University
press called me. He is, I'm on here.

40
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,650
I'm on the committee that decides what
books they publish. And the question was,

41
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:20,200
can we pull the cartoons out of the book?

42
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,820
These are cartoons which make
a devout Muslims very mad.

43
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,730
And the,

44
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,520
the answer we arrived at
very reluctantly was yes,

45
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:43,840
pull the cartoons and that point that,

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
think of that problem and think of what
possible explanation could there be.

47
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:54,130
Why a great university,
uh,

48
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,160
feels itself unwilling to stand
up for freedom of expression.

49
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,980
Uh, in the case of these, uh,

50
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:11,030
admittedly blast from us cartoons and, uh,

51
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,010
it turns out the answer is very practical
and I'll give you my position on it by

52
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:19,840
the end of class. Okay. Hi.

53
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:24,841
Eric was a charming guy and
a very practical thinker,

54
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,560
a less practical perhaps then
economist who worked for banks.

55
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,900
Uh, but, uh, as Nobel
laureates go very practical,

56
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,650
uh, he was, uh,

57
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,680
given to thinking about hard cases
about why things were done as they were.

58
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,540
And he was most of all

59
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,350
a n intellectual skeptic.

60
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:59,070
He was most of all inclined to doubt
human knowledge to lean on salability and

61
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:06,950
ignorance,
uh,

62
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,490
to look at Marxists.

63
00:05:10,491 --> 00:05:15,310
Historicism which we discussed
last time as horse feathers.

64
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,010
He was contemptuous of,
of not,

65
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,300
not Mark's alone,

66
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:27,301
but of whom so ever imagines that there
is a deterministic course for world

67
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:32,980
history.
Hey and that they know what it is.

68
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:37,450
Be neither a nor B washes with high Eq

69
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,940
and the region it doesn't wash
is that he believes in freedom.

70
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,350
And in free societies,
outcomes are unpredictable.

71
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,010
We're going to read this
for a second for yourself.

72
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:02,020
It's the worst sin in the use of
PowerPoint is to put a lot of words on the

73
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:03,950
screen and then read them to people.

74
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,840
It makes me furious when I'm in
the audience and people do it.

75
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:13,710
So can you read it for yourself
in the back there? Hey,

76
00:06:13,711 --> 00:06:15,380
and we'll parse it a little bit.

77
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,590
Civilization,
which no brain has designed,

78
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,090
but which has grown from the free
effort of millions of individuals.

79
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,543
Okay?
And

80
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,910
the idea here is this is a
very powerful idea. It is.

81
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:44,840
If you say, who designed the world
in which we live here at Yale,

82
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,280
how long would the list be?

83
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,480
Or let's try this. Let's take the highest
ranking officials of Yale University.

84
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:03,150
Um, let's say, uh, Roland batch,

85
00:07:03,151 --> 00:07:07,290
who is the chairman of the Yale
Corporation, uh, and Rick Levin,

86
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,060
who is the president of the university.

87
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,620
And let's throw in Linda Lorimer,
who's the secretary

88
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,250
and Mary Miller,
who's the dean of the college,

89
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,660
and think of four or five
others that might be important.

90
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,300
What percentage of what goes on
around here? Did they think up?

91
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,840
Take a guess who we have a mic out there.

92
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,880
Just hand it to the
woman right behind her.

93
00:07:38,881 --> 00:07:43,881
Let's get her guess what percentage of
what percentage of the way we do things

94
00:07:46,561 --> 00:07:51,120
at Yale is attributable to the five
highest ranking officers? The University?

95
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,200
5%.
You think that much?

96
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,700
Let's pass the mic around to

97
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,930
what I can tell. You've got
something to say. Go with it.

98
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,840
Yeah,
it doesn't seem to be on.

99
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,190
Okay. Third repetition. The question is,

100
00:08:21,191 --> 00:08:23,620
take the five highest ranking
officers of the university.

101
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,020
Take everything that goes on around Gail.

102
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,080
What percentage of it can we
attribute to them thinking it up?

103
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,540
I'd say way less than one. And I think
they would say way less than one.

104
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,070
Right.

105
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:43,070
And it's because the university has
been invented a piece at a time over the

106
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,820
centuries.
It's reinvented every day.

107
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,050
What you do in the classroom
is part of reinventing. Yeah.

108
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:56,250
What you do elsewhere is part of it.

109
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And the notion of a free society that
Hayak wants to put in front of us is one

110
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,910
queer agency.

111
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,410
The right to make decisions
is widely dispersed.

112
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,960
And you can imagine, you can
imagine societies in which
that isn't true. In fact,

113
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:18,080
many exist,
uh,

114
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:23,090
one would be an authoritarian society
and autocracy where a ruling elite pretty

115
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:25,470
much says what happens.

116
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,120
Another would be traditional
society or a sus,

117
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,900
a theocratic society where
there are standing rules,

118
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:39,590
they are more or less followed and
they restrict agency in a sharp way.

119
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,280
A new haven colony in the years,

120
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:49,310
1637 to 1665 was a strict theocracy

121
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,710
and the rules were laid down in the Bible.

122
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,580
A solum scripture from was
the idea they made no laws.

123
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,410
All they did was interpret the
Bible and enforce it harshly.

124
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:11,070
Uh, Hayak has in mind something
very different from that.

125
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,683
And

126
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:18,723
the,

127
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:24,420
the idea that society is in some sense
a great learning machine or that a free

128
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:32,461
society is a great learning
machine is the powerful idea,

129
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:38,290
uh, in high x work. If we think of,

130
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,800
you know,
I'm given to these extravagant charts,

131
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,570
historical time on this dimension
measured let's say in centuries,

132
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,240
uh, or in human generations if you
prefer. And on the vertical access,

133
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:57,630
the total shared store of knowledge that
that society accumulates knowledge as

134
00:10:59,051 --> 00:11:04,051
trivial as how to manufacture a toothbrush
or as complex as how to operate a

135
00:11:07,421 --> 00:11:08,380
great university.

136
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,120
The accumulation of that knowledge is
high acts as accelerated exponentially by

137
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,310
dispersed agency by freedom

138
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:28,140
and the rate of accumulation grows in an
exponential curve with a free society.

139
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,140
Uh,
he doesn't talk about demography,

140
00:11:38,141 --> 00:11:43,141
but I would say that a free society
which has passed through the world

141
00:11:43,781 --> 00:11:48,781
demographic transition so
that people live long lives,

142
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,100
lives in which a great deal of
learning can go on after decade,

143
00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:00,150
that such a society embedded in the
institutions of a free society would have

144
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:07,530
the sharpest upward upward curve in
the accumulation of shared knowledge.

145
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:14,110
The other side of that story, and here
I've added a second axis on the right,

146
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,580
which represents the percentage
of a society's knowledge,

147
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,310
which one very competent
person can capture,

148
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,850
right? Who's the most competent?
Rick Levin is very competent,

149
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:32,910
never brilliant, always thoroughly
competent. It's really true.

150
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,660
I mean, it really is true. I mean,

151
00:12:36,661 --> 00:12:39,180
part of why he's so good is he
never tries to be brilliant.

152
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:43,650
He never ever heard him say
anything that was even vaguely edgy.

153
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,360
I've known him 40 years. We used to
ride home together at night whenever.

154
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,810
He's never anywhere near the edge,
but he's never,

155
00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:00,240
never, never crazy. He's
just, he's the most thorough.

156
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,810
He Bright. It's the personality
profile for an airline pilot,

157
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,340
a heart surgeon,
and maybe the president of a university.

158
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,420
Uh, so it's, it's a very steady,

159
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,220
very competent persona.
And high x,

160
00:13:17,221 --> 00:13:21,960
big point is that no individual,

161
00:13:21,961 --> 00:13:26,961
however competent can know any major
fraction of what of the knowledge

162
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:32,610
accumulated in a free society over time.
And that,

163
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,260
first of all, it's humbling, right?

164
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,850
It's terrifically humbling.

165
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:43,780
And part of what the sort of education
all of you are getting is about learning

166
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:52,630
what you don't know and learning where
to find out the things you don't know,

167
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,290
which through time you need to know.
But it,

168
00:13:59,090 --> 00:13:59,520
it,

169
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,520
it is not imagined that this or any
other college can create graduates who

170
00:14:07,401 --> 00:14:12,401
master any large fraction of what is
known in the United States or the Western

171
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:15,200
world,
much less the world at large.

172
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,290
So as knowledge accelerate,

173
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,100
the individual fraction of that
knowledge becomes smaller and smaller and

174
00:14:25,521 --> 00:14:30,521
individuals become more and more dependent
on things discovered and known by

175
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:35,870
others.
Take the toothbrush.

176
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,450
Who's got a mic here?

177
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,740
Let's go to the gentleman
in the red tee shirt.

178
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,983
Uh,

179
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,583
if it were

180
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,210
your assigned in your first job

181
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:59,770
to set up a manufacturing plant for
ordinary plastic toothbrushes with nylon

182
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:04,310
bristles,
how would you go about it?

183
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,890
Okay. That, that incidentally is
where this photograph came from.

184
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,860
Case to go to Wikipedia.

185
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,380
You think Wikipedia has got a design for
a toothbrush factory now maybe when you,

186
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:33,630
okay, what'd you'd begin doing
is reaching out to others. Right.

187
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:38,010
And you would probably have to
reach out to several others.

188
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,650
Uh, and those others, the others who
actually make these toothbrushes are,

189
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,740
do you think that youth, suppose those
plants are located in New Jersey?

190
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,120
Um,
not really sure.

191
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:55,230
I'm pretty sure,
Mike,

192
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,080
I don't even know this,

193
00:15:56,081 --> 00:16:00,820
but I'd be willing to offer a
substantial bet that the vast majority of

194
00:16:00,821 --> 00:16:05,410
toothbrushes are manufactured somewhere
in Asia or the southern hemisphere,

195
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,980
probably Asia.
Uh,

196
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,860
and I would also bet that no one in this,

197
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,100
does anyone in this room have a
clue how you'd go actually about it.

198
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,050
Okay.

199
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:21,920
Injection molded plastic,
right? No one knows.

200
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,140
And yet each of us,

201
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:29,830
each of us profit in a small way from
tens and hundreds of thousands of bits of

202
00:16:33,801 --> 00:16:37,940
knowledge like that.
I got said,

203
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:42,170
examine this chart now. I think maybe
if we work cooperatively in the room,

204
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,880
we could learn what it's about.

205
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:52,300
I have no idea.
I certainly can't read these labels.

206
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,010
There's anyone here who can read them.

207
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:55,603
Okay,

208
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,040
cool. Go get, let's get her. Let's
get her a mic so we don't miss this.

209
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,003
Okay.

210
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:13,803
MMM,

211
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,873
mmm.

212
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,430
Okay. Re-Export. Right.

213
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,930
This is a history of a British,
uh,

214
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,450
British exports,
uh,

215
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,800
ena complex bar chart and the fact that
are there other people who knew how to

216
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:46,880
do it and didn't, didn't
raise her hands. Okay.

217
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,760
What we see here, this is kind of
a division of Labor story, right?

218
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:55,761
It's a little like Adam Smith and the
pin factory that we rely on others as

219
00:17:57,631 --> 00:18:02,070
store houses of knowledge, uh,
useful to us or at least imaginably.

220
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:05,910
So in my example,
um,

221
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:11,930
this is the model t Ford and it was

222
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,700
produced for the first time in numbers
between 1910 and 1917 and it was a

223
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:26,340
revolutionary machine by 1917.
It was,

224
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,400
well, when it began, it was selling
for about a thousand dollars,

225
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,760
which would be a lot more than
a thousand dollars today. Uh,

226
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,850
by 1917,
uh,

227
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,440
the Ford Motor Company had figured out
how to make this car and make money on it

228
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,530
by retailing it for $360.

229
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,110
And they had done that by combining,

230
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,260
uh,
many pieces,

231
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,890
many small pieces of
engineering from other fields.

232
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,760
And by using a moving conveyor belt,

233
00:18:59,761 --> 00:19:04,761
which carried the car along and workers
who stayed in position each with an

234
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:09,480
assigned task,
each coordinated in a very efficient way.

235
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:15,460
And the larger implication of that,
uh,

236
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,230
for the American and world economy,

237
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,800
the knowledge embodied in it was
enormous and it was wholly unoriginal.

238
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,920
Ford was not a brilliant engineer.

239
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,270
Some of the people he hired were damn
good engineers by and large though they

240
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:38,271
were just regular smart people who
worked in a cooperative team way,

241
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,220
a division of labor about ideas.
And there was a,

242
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:47,970
an older idea called the American system.

243
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:53,490
And the American system was,
uh, interchangeable parts.

244
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:59,030
It was parts made so precisely identical
that you could take the left front

245
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:07,461
wheel drama off one model t and put it
on any other model t and expect it to

246
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,910
fit. And that idea, which,

247
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,780
and that's actually one of the
revolutionary ideas that's involved in the

248
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:20,781
vertical vertical spike of world
affluence and which has been,

249
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,660
uh,
dispersed everywhere in the globe.

250
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:29,940
You can't manufacture anything
in a competitive way if
you don't understand and

251
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,350
execute on interchangeable
parts. The earliest, uh,

252
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:39,180
alleged case was actually new haven.
It was that you like Whitney gun factory,

253
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,230
the waterfall on Whitney Avenue,
the little building there.

254
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:48,830
Eli Whitney had a contract with a federal
to make 10,000 muskets and he set out

255
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:54,100
to do it with interchangeable parts.

256
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,890
And what's fascinating
is if you go out there,

257
00:20:56,891 --> 00:21:00,670
they've got a couple hundred
of these things in the drawers.

258
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,500
He knew he got most of
them just a little wrong,

259
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:11,610
so he would file them or his workers would
file them and Chevy them to make them

260
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:15,250
interchangeable. But from the
point of view of the military,

261
00:21:15,251 --> 00:21:20,251
the idea of interchangeability was
huge because when one part of a weapon

262
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,783
jammed,

263
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,530
you could take another
one and interchange it.

264
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:31,180
And the efficiency of the
logistics were enormously improved.

265
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,420
But the military is mainly
what that idea is about.

266
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:37,580
Okay.

267
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,350
Anybody have a clue who this is?

268
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,010
Fair enough. There's no
reason you should. Um,

269
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:50,660
this is the Guy Norman Borlaug.

270
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,480
Correct.
Uh,

271
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,520
who did the critical work
on developing high growth,

272
00:21:59,521 --> 00:22:03,660
high bro Productivity,
disease resistance, seeds. Uh,

273
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:08,390
most of the work done 50 or 60
years ago. He died last week, uh,

274
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:12,840
which increased agricultural yields,
yields on a world basis,

275
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:18,750
uh, so that there is still hunger
in the world, but it's all manmade.

276
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,243
That is,

277
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:25,050
there are no cases in the world now
where there isn't enough food to feed

278
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:29,310
everybody. There's always enough food, uh,

279
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,770
if it doesn't get to the right places,

280
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:35,250
that's something to do with
human agency or institutions.

281
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,840
And all of us benefit from that work.

282
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,900
And that work in turn benefited from
generation after generation of botany and

283
00:22:45,961 --> 00:22:48,170
husbandry.
Uh,

284
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:53,390
and all this process of building the
social store of knowledge is what high x

285
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,420
idea of freedom is about.

286
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:03,680
And this is Dean Mary Miller and by
now I've beaten this horse to death.

287
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,460
Uh, she's wonderful.
She's absolutely terrific.

288
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:14,510
But what fraction of the curriculum
she supervisors would she need to have

289
00:23:15,841 --> 00:23:20,810
direct knowledge of
if she knows what we do in here,

290
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:27,730
she wouldn't. She'd only know if I were
in a lot of trouble or you work. Um,

291
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,250
there are hundreds of courses,

292
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:36,490
even thousands and the
dispersion of agency,

293
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:38,893
right?

294
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:44,260
The last summer I sat at my summer house
in northern Vermont with a stack of

295
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:48,380
books about that high,
picking the books for this course.

296
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,130
She didn't supervise that.
Uh,

297
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,760
neither would I have
been pleased if she hand,

298
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:58,790
but the effect if she,

299
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:05,020
if she has the right people doing it
and trust them is very like Adam Smith's

300
00:24:05,091 --> 00:24:08,450
pin factory and the division of
labor and the power it produces.

301
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,820
So we're back to Smith.

302
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,600
Smith had the idea that by dividing
labor so that one person doesn't,

303
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,730
doesn't, uh, undertake the whole
complex task of manufacturing a pimp.

304
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:28,460
If you divide the labor among many who
get good at specific aspects of the task,

305
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,990
you can make it cheaper and more efficient
than otherwise it would have been

306
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:36,520
high acts id is more loose
jointed than that. Hi.

307
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:41,530
Acts idea is that you don't
even assign roles to people.

308
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:44,210
You let them find their own roles.

309
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,750
Okay.

310
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:51,750
That if you want to go out and start
a toothbrush factory using a novel

311
00:24:52,331 --> 00:24:55,610
technology
invented late,

312
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,800
late at night over beer
with your roommate,

313
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,160
what's the likely outcome?

314
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,440
The likely outcome is that you will fail.

315
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:11,450
Your toothbrush will be too
expensive and not very good, right?

316
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,830
Isn't that the likely thing?
And,

317
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:21,310
and if you think about a market economy
as literally hundreds of thousands of

318
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,100
people who make decisions like that,
go no,

319
00:25:25,101 --> 00:25:27,530
go with a new model toothbrush,

320
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:34,030
the accumulated knowledge from
that is enormously powerful.

321
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,740
And if you begin to make money
with your new model toothbrush,

322
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,000
then a couple of things will happen.

323
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,370
One capital will flow toward you.
People will say,

324
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:54,110
we would like to own part of this and
our subject next Monday is a joint stock

325
00:25:54,111 --> 00:25:56,420
corporation,
which is all about that.

326
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:00,260
So capital will flow towards you.

327
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,080
And so we'll competition.

328
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,830
As soon as you begin to succeed,

329
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:11,831
people will attempt at to get as close
to your product as the patent and

330
00:26:13,341 --> 00:26:18,341
copyright laws permit and to compete
with you on the basis of quality or price

331
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,650
and that process,

332
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:25,670
you can think of it as an
enormous diversified portfolio.

333
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,320
The whole economy,

334
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,870
no one directs the whole economy or says
where the capital goes though sometimes

335
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:36,710
it feels as if Goldman Sachs
comes close to that. The,

336
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:42,410
the decision process is
highly decentralized and
unprogrammed and indeed Hayak

337
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:50,920
if you'll look closely says,
well let's find it.

338
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,910
He says that what we're trying to
do is create the opportunity for the

339
00:26:56,911 --> 00:26:58,070
unexpected to happen.

340
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:05,030
Liberty is essential in order to
leave room for the unforeseeable,

341
00:27:05,031 --> 00:27:05,870
an unpredicted.

342
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,190
We want it because we have learned
to expect from it the opportunity of

343
00:27:10,191 --> 00:27:11,960
realizing many of our aims

344
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:16,980
so that uh,
so that

345
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,430
the core idea is dispersed.
Power of action.

346
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,440
No,
hi is

347
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,670
entirely dependent on the idea
that we are limited intellect.

348
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,400
If we were,
as this quote says,

349
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,360
Omniscience the page 29,

350
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:43,460
the green quote here up there would
not be so strong a case for freedom.

351
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,170
I think there would be other cases,

352
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:50,710
but the core case that Hayak is making
is that freedom is a way of overcoming

353
00:27:51,561 --> 00:27:56,561
our own fallibility and of allowing
others to fill the holes in our individual

354
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:01,400
stores of knowledge.

355
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:03,830
Okay.

356
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:08,090
Now, high tech, early in
the section you read, uh,

357
00:28:08,091 --> 00:28:10,190
focuses on the question or rock climber.

358
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:15,400
It's kind of a jarring reference when
when you see it, it's at the very,

359
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,660
I think it's about around page 12.

360
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,310
Yeah.

361
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,143
Um,

362
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:33,020
I read most people will still have enough
feeling for the original meaning of

363
00:28:33,021 --> 00:28:36,650
the word free to see that if you know,
sorry.

364
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:40,580
Uh,

365
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,151
in this sense,

366
00:28:41,151 --> 00:28:45,320
freedom or first solely the relation
of men to other men or persons to other

367
00:28:45,321 --> 00:28:49,460
persons or the Omi infringement of it,
of it is coercion by men.

368
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:53,240
This means in particular that the range
of physical possibilities for which a

369
00:28:53,241 --> 00:28:57,680
person from which a person can choose at
a given moment has no direct relevance

370
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:00,770
to freedom.
The Rock climber on a difficult pitch,

371
00:29:00,771 --> 00:29:05,120
who she's only one way out to save
his life is unquestionably free.

372
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,890
Most people will still have enough feeling
for the original meaning of the word

373
00:29:09,891 --> 00:29:14,891
free to see that if the same rock climber
were to fall into a crevasse and were

374
00:29:15,111 --> 00:29:19,700
unable to get out, he would only
figuratively be called unfree.

375
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,610
Now that's,
that's a big,

376
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:27,670
there's a lot rides on that claim
and high act offensive unevenly.

377
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,170
If you look closely at the
way he defines coercion,

378
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:39,130
you'll find that the rock climber
story is the clear and easy case.

379
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,730
And the end of our slides today,
we'll,

380
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:48,250
we'll begin to look at some harder cases
and some of those hard cases are raised

381
00:29:49,031 --> 00:29:52,480
by the white tiger book.
Now

382
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,910
this is more my kind of rock
climber hanging on barely.

383
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,110
I'm terrified of any height
greater than five feet.

384
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,600
What's behind the story?

385
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,350
What hi accusing isn't sneaky here.

386
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,500
Anybody want to tell us
why he makes this argument?

387
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:22,710
Because he is arguing in an environment
where communism is a very live option.

388
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:32,850
And the Marxists position about freedom
is that it's a bourgeois delusion.

389
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:40,830
And that only by giving
everyone the same access to,

390
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,460
to material rewards,

391
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,850
to money,
wealth and the like,

392
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:52,150
only by downward redistribution of money,

393
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:56,350
wealth and the like can real
freedom be shared by everyone.

394
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:58,380
Okay.

395
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,250
And Hayak wants desperately
to head off that argument.

396
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:05,930
Now whether that argument
is right or wrong,

397
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:11,240
uh, is actually more
semantic than anything else.

398
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:16,460
And we'll actually close with a
slide about this. That is to say,

399
00:31:16,461 --> 00:31:21,050
can you be free?
And at the bottom of society,

400
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,830
unable to do many, many things,
unable to effectively rec,

401
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:31,100
uh, effectively exercise your freedom.
One view is that the two dimensions,

402
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,910
freedom and uh,

403
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:36,170
wealth or power are entirely independent.

404
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,200
Another view is that without
some degree of market power,

405
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:47,350
some degree of ability to interest others
in your needs through exchanging your

406
00:31:49,311 --> 00:31:54,311
skills and your labor for what it is
that you need or for the money which will

407
00:31:56,151 --> 00:32:01,151
buy what it is that you need or want
only with some degree of market power,

408
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,250
uh, can freedom be fully realized.
And I'm of that second view,

409
00:32:06,251 --> 00:32:11,251
I am of the view that the wide dispersion
of relative affluence is part of

410
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,530
making freedom real.

411
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:21,250
And the way I would argue that with
Hayak is that conceptually the concept of

412
00:32:24,351 --> 00:32:28,310
coercion is,
is extraordinarily slippery.

413
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,120
Let's consider the guy in the crevasse.
He stuck.

414
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:37,840
But you and I are walking by on our way
to a picnic and he calls to us and we

415
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:41,750
say, sorry, we're late to the picnic.

416
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:43,880
Yeah.

417
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,970
Uh,
it would be not it,

418
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,990
you wouldn't have to much twist the
language to say that that was an implicit

419
00:32:50,991 --> 00:32:55,280
act of coercion on our
part. Okay. And then,

420
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,240
then the slope gets dangerous and complex.
Uh,

421
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:04,270
if he had diabetes and we withheld
from him the treatment for diabetes,

422
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,310
would that violate his freedom?
All I want you to do,

423
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:15,370
what I really want you to do is get the
power of high x idea in your head and

424
00:33:16,941 --> 00:33:20,540
get the complexity of applying
it in your heads. Now,

425
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:25,690
the reason I think some
degree of affluence or some
degree of market power is

426
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,990
part of the deal is that high
acts examples all depend on it.

427
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,090
The things which he,

428
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:37,270
which he tells us about in the second
chapter are all ones where people have

429
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:42,500
enough education,
enough physical health,

430
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:46,700
enough skills that they
can be real players.

431
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,753
No.

432
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:56,230
Now the, uh, d good questions

433
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,370
and this is a degus social
class we're seeing in this slide

434
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:08,490
are different. Okay, let me, we're
going to go to dig in a few minutes,

435
00:34:08,491 --> 00:34:11,910
but let's pause and talk
about the Danish cartoons,

436
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:17,040
which I'm not going to show
you. Um, you can see them.

437
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:19,720
All you gotta do is Google them.
Um,

438
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:25,190
and they are from an Islamic point
of view blast from us and they are,

439
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,703
um,

440
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:33,590
from a western secular point of
view there in some ways. Funny. Um,

441
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,850
this cartoon which is a
cartoon about cartoons,

442
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:44,900
captures the idea that the scriptural
blast from the seen by the Muslim here is

443
00:34:47,281 --> 00:34:52,281
on the same plane with the secular
blasphemy seen by the advocate of free

444
00:34:54,901 --> 00:34:59,670
speech. John Bolton is a Yale
alum. I even know him a little.

445
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,250
He was bushes representative
to the UN and he's a,

446
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,340
an a,
um,

447
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:13,430
radical libertarian and he's on the
war path against Yale over are not

448
00:35:13,441 --> 00:35:17,640
publishing the cartoons.
Let's stop and talk practice for a minute.

449
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:21,720
We got, Yup. Pick somebody out.

450
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,653
Okay.

451
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:29,930
Okay. Uh, can you
imagine any circumstance?

452
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,620
The few, the proud, the
Moose. I like it. Um,

453
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:39,940
can you imagine any circumstance under
which you would say that we should tell

454
00:35:39,991 --> 00:35:43,230
the university press?
Not to publish the cartoons in the book.

455
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,500
The book will be out in about a week,
but without the cartoons.

456
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,890
Okay. You went, you cut straight
to the chase. Very well done. Uh,

457
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:13,940
the point just made is that the
university consulted experts

458
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,200
and the question to the experts was,

459
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:25,610
what's the probability of a terrorist
attack launched against Yale,

460
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:30,900
uh, in response to the
publication of the cartoons.

461
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,060
Okay.

462
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:37,050
And the answer came back that
it was not insubstantial.

463
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,323
Now

464
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,970
why would that be?

465
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:45,030
Would you,
um,

466
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,600
you got to grab it and talk to it.

467
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:54,910
Would you be inclined to take
the libertarian possession
and say Yale was the

468
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:59,240
kind of place which stands
up for freedom of expression?

469
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,513
Yeah,

470
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,820
I think you could make the case that
yields stands up for freedom of expression

471
00:37:04,821 --> 00:37:06,650
of a lot of cases,
but not all.

472
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,830
Okay. And so let's, let's see.
Can we have, we got a sh a

473
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,110
true gospel libertarian in the room.

474
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:21,850
We've got somebody who wants to say
damage. You should have published them. I,

475
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:26,770
I don't mind being criticized.
Yeah. Yes, we need to, yeah.

476
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,320
If you'll come forward a little,
it's going to make it easier.

477
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:40,740
Yes.
Darwin,

478
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:45,560
Darwin Day were the pictures of fish
eat on that walk when we went to the

479
00:37:45,561 --> 00:37:46,394
landmines.

480
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:52,310
And I think that the best approach would
have been probably to try to create an

481
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,980
academic exchange whereby
every university, uh,

482
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,260
to slip the cartoons in
some public place because

483
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:06,960
you're the kind of guy,
Rick Levin. Thanks. No,

484
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,960
that was good.
The Richard.

485
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,290
Okay.
Um,

486
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:19,820
if the argument is that the
right to life is going to

487
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:27,610
raise possible chances of a terrorist
attack bowls going to be and it's a

488
00:38:29,721 --> 00:38:34,340
slippery slope and the minute you
get into this sort of, um, uh,

489
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,890
appeasement before is that
intention threads down the road,

490
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:43,950
the potential that you're giving up
multiple or a societal amount of freedoms

491
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:47,370
to,
to appease and aggressor if you own,

492
00:38:47,371 --> 00:38:50,090
you're actually bringing that up
and even greater existential, right.

493
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,800
I agree that that would be
one of the counters and it,

494
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,150
and it is a persuasive one.
It's important.

495
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:02,710
The issue here
gets to be,

496
00:39:02,711 --> 00:39:07,711
it comes down in my view to the
effective ability to defend,

497
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,390
uh, the institution. And when I
say defendant, I mean defendant.

498
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:19,840
And the next topic for us if I've
got these slides organized right,

499
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,510
is the nation state system.

500
00:39:22,511 --> 00:39:27,511
And what we have here is a quote is a
question of narrow gauge state failure.

501
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,190
The Guy Pictured is Thomas Hobbs.
His great book,

502
00:39:33,191 --> 00:39:38,191
the Leviathan came out at the same time
as the settlement to the 30 years' war,

503
00:39:39,821 --> 00:39:43,870
more or less.
And they were two faces of the same thing.

504
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:49,890
Hobbs central idea of the Leviathan was
a power so great and so well disciplined

505
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:58,950
that it could monopolize force and
violence in society and keep people from

506
00:40:01,661 --> 00:40:06,661
attacking one another and put down a
general set of rules of law which allowed

507
00:40:09,011 --> 00:40:10,810
people to know what was coming next.

508
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,140
And if the Leviathan
we're fully effective,

509
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:22,860
I would favor publishing the cartoons
and my reasoning would be similar to the

510
00:40:23,381 --> 00:40:28,130
reasoning.
A back left that uh,

511
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:32,950
freedom is freedom and
freedom includes bad taste.

512
00:40:32,951 --> 00:40:36,880
I think blasphemy is very bad
taste toward any religion.

513
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:38,110
It's bad taste,

514
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:43,680
but the fact that I deem at bad taste
doesn't make it make it inappropriate and

515
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:47,590
inappropriate exercise of freedom
for those who take a different view.

516
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,680
That's the whole idea of freedom.
Now,

517
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,780
what's missing here

518
00:40:55,330 --> 00:41:00,060
is that in some fundamental way,
uh,

519
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:04,960
the al Qaeda events work,

520
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,280
they did in some degree work.

521
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:14,540
We all pay rent on them every
time we fly, right? If there,

522
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:15,700
I mean,

523
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:20,290
think about the person hours
consumed taking shoes on and off

524
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,880
and the perfectly good bottles of water
or shaving cream which are confiscated,

525
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,133
uh,

526
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,820
the critical aspect of state performance,

527
00:41:34,821 --> 00:41:39,740
the rule of law reliably and forced
zones of freedom. For example,

528
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:43,300
within our own property
here at the university, uh,

529
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:48,290
corruption minimized and the monopoly
on force and violence effective.

530
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:49,461
Now,

531
00:41:49,461 --> 00:41:54,461
what nine 11 was about was an attack
on our culture and a demonstration that

532
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:04,670
even the mightiest nation in the world,
uh,

533
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:07,700
NATO mightiest nation in
the history of the world

534
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:12,830
was open to violent attack,

535
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:17,330
especially if you are willing
to die in the process.

536
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,400
And we have been convinced by that.

537
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,190
And if you,

538
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:30,530
if you actually think about
defending the Yale campus

539
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,430
against it,

540
00:42:34,431 --> 00:42:39,040
just imagine a single person,
uh,

541
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:44,080
willing to die or spend his life in
prison for attacking Yale in the most

542
00:42:45,111 --> 00:42:46,670
spectacular possible way.

543
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:52,160
What would we have to do to the campus
to rule that out called the new haven

544
00:42:52,161 --> 00:42:55,550
police department?
You must be kidding,

545
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,100
right?

546
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,970
I mean they don't have anything like the
resources to do it and our own police

547
00:43:01,971 --> 00:43:05,770
force doesn't come close
to being able to do it. Uh,

548
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:10,810
the campus is built on the premise
that the monopoly on force and violence

549
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:15,290
works. It is built to deal
with petty criminals, right?

550
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:17,150
The locking of gates
in that kind of thing.

551
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:23,110
But the locking of gauges entirely
useless against a terrorist and arid.

552
00:43:23,211 --> 00:43:28,211
I soberly thought about this and I thought
I would much rather take the ringing

553
00:43:29,361 --> 00:43:33,050
first amendment point of view,
but uh,

554
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,780
and I was only one of many
people involved in this judgment,

555
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,610
but ultimately,
uh,

556
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:44,650
I couldn't bring myself to undertake
that risk on behalf of all of you.

557
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,350
And uh,

558
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:53,730
Richard Postelli is correct
that that represents a,

559
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:58,400
a loss of something. And a
step on a slippery slope.
I think that's really true.

560
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,780
Uh, but it's real. And, uh,

561
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:07,840
the virtue of high x way of thinking
is that it's not all or nothing.

562
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:13,780
It is a pragmatic judgment about
how best organized society.

563
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:18,380
Now Hernando de Soto,
third topic,

564
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:20,390
mystery of capital,

565
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:26,470
it's a middle middle difficulty books
that very difficult and it's all built on

566
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:28,064
one point.

567
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:33,840
And the one point is the distinction
between formal and informal property.

568
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:40,100
The photo I showed you before
is a favela near Rio in Brazil.

569
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,470
Uh,
and it's all informal property.

570
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:46,710
The people who built those
houses don't really own them.

571
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:51,810
They own them according to
a set of informal rules that
operate among the people

572
00:44:51,811 --> 00:44:52,644
in the favela.

573
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:58,850
They don't have formal
documentation for them.

574
00:44:59,311 --> 00:45:01,470
So it is informal property.

575
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:07,550
Every building in new
haven is formal property.

576
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:12,510
Even community gardens
are formal property.

577
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:18,030
There is a deed written down, you can
trace it and you can show it to a bank.

578
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,353
And

579
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,400
desotos major idea is
that informal property

580
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:32,080
is dead Capitol

581
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:40,990
and formal property where the power of
the State stands behind your ownership is

582
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:42,410
live capital.

583
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:48,190
And his claim is that poor people in
developing societies own a vast amount of

584
00:45:51,441 --> 00:45:54,830
capital in informal forms.

585
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:56,510
Yeah.

586
00:45:56,510 --> 00:46:01,510
And that just as capital is formed in
advanced market societies by combining

587
00:46:03,591 --> 00:46:06,620
many small assets into
smaller number of big assets.

588
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,950
So to Ken,
capital B,

589
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,160
four in poor countries by formalizing
property and allowing people to make

590
00:46:16,551 --> 00:46:19,430
investments by taking on debt,

591
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,570
which is secured by formal property.

592
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:29,890
And his further claim is that many of
the worst economies in the world are the

593
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:37,160
worst economies in the world because the
number of hurdles to form that stand in

594
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:41,420
front of you when you want to formalize
your property are wildly excessive.

595
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:48,460
I'm going to do the white tiger at
the beginning of class next time.

596
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,440
I urge you at one of you came up
to me at lunch today and said,

597
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:56,740
wow, this is fun. I mean, it is.

598
00:46:56,741 --> 00:47:01,741
It is one of the great novels of this
era and I promise you if you'll just give

599
00:47:02,591 --> 00:47:03,424
it an hour,

600
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,440
you're going to love it and we'll start
with a white tiger on Monday and then

601
00:47:08,441 --> 00:47:11,500
we'll go to the joint stock corporation.

602
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:15,040
