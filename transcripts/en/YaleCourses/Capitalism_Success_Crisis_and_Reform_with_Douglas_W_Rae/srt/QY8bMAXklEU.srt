1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,790
Ahead.
Okay,

2
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:07,791
so the optic today is
to wrap our arms around,

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,690
not all but a good portion
of the material covered. Uh,

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,750
the book called bottom billion is
somewhat neglected in today's discussion.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,690
What should not be neglected in
your essay is indeed your essays.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,020
Uh,
we'll,

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,020
we'll need to take account of many of
the things said by Paul Collier in that,

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,670
in that book,
uh,

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,040
first of all,
our topic slide here,

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,770
you have to ask yourself first what this
guy believes that umbrella is going to

11
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:51,260
do for him.
And it's,

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,830
and I'll show you the subject when slide
in the appropriate place about what

13
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:56,664
happens neck.

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,480
But the gist of that slide is that
capitalism is a dynamic system which is

15
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:10,761
always leaning forward and is always
within a few months of leaning too far

16
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:16,740
forward.
It is the nature of the system

17
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,350
you really thought I hit.

18
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,733
Okay.

19
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,440
I'm going to begin by
revisiting the fundamentals,

20
00:01:32,441 --> 00:01:36,170
the systems of ideas that
we began the term with.

21
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:40,130
And then we'll look at some of
those systems in greater detail.

22
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,740
Tom was small fish
essay on population.

23
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:55,860
The thesis is that nearly universal
poverty is inevitable because wherever

24
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:04,960
productivity increases,
population increases a page

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and the resources used for
production have diminishing returns.

26
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:17,170
As you invest more and more labor,
multiple shoes,

27
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:22,171
obviously thinking about farming and
farming in a small island called England,

28
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,860
and he's wrong.

29
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,180
The world demographic transition,

30
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,990
I've heard we contradict his theory

31
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:41,820
and the fact that birth rates and death
rates might fall in the precipitous way

32
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:47,810
they did,
uh,

33
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,080
is the world demographic transition and
is a major key to why the world economy

34
00:02:55,331 --> 00:03:00,331
works the way it does because it
produces an enormous surplus labor in the

35
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:04,150
societies which pass through
it later rather than earlier.

36
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,580
Similarly,

37
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,320
if we look at Hans Rosling's
wonderful data animation,

38
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:16,200
which we used on the first day
of class, uh, relating, uh,

39
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,940
life expectancy to GDP per capita,

40
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,610
the world in the last
hundred 20 years has grown.

41
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:27,580
Rick grown richer on
average five or six fold,

42
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,590
five or 600% richer and healthier,
longer lived.

43
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,960
So that there is a human,
a human project,

44
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:43,020
a world human project in which the
best of capitalism participate.

45
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,600
And I think that's the
important upside to the topic.

46
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,590
Adam Smith,
invisible hand.

47
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:59,590
I am Smith has become,
uh,

48
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,740
in death a more famous figure
that he was in life and Ando.

49
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:05,860
Simpler figure.

50
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,790
The number of people who have actually
read wealth of nations or read it and

51
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:18,460
theory of moral sentiment
is a tiny fraction of the
people who claim to organize

52
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:23,461
all their thinking around Adam Smith
and Adam Smith's invisible hand is a

53
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:30,211
fragile thing which operates
not with giant corporations,

54
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,610
not with oligopolies
knock with monopsonies.

55
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:39,060
It operates under conditions of
perfect or near perfect competition.

56
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,860
And the porter forces,

57
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:46,270
which we've seen a direct competition,

58
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:47,830
the threat of new competition,

59
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:51,130
the threat of people moving
to substitute project product,

60
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,610
the power of suppliers and the
power of buyers to bargain.

61
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,590
All five of those factors work
against the invisible hand.

62
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,940
The whole point of the porter porter
forces is how vicious corporations avoid

63
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:13,291
being compelled to behave in the Smithian
way of producing goods and selling

64
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:17,140
them at or near their marginal costs.

65
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,250
Karl Marx and Joseph Schumpeter.
Yeah,

66
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,700
two great economists to great thinkers.
Uh,

67
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:38,650
Mark's the founder of a
revolutionary movement, Schumpeter,

68
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,710
uh, a banker, a Harvard professor, uh,

69
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,820
a brilliant intellect,

70
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,780
two ways of looking at the same thing.

71
00:05:50,781 --> 00:05:55,781
What these two guys agree
on is that capitalism is an
inherently unstable moving

72
00:05:58,221 --> 00:06:03,150
system. That the one thing of
which capitalism is, is in capable,

73
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:07,910
is standing still that liked
the bicyclist in my title slide.

74
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,540
Capitalism always leans forward and
always relies on events in the future,

75
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,960
which are not predictable.
Now,

76
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,890
where the to part ways is
that Mark's is a determinist.

77
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,320
Mark's really thinks that he can foretell
the history of capitalism in its main

78
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,154
outlines

79
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:33,230
and he was mistaken of that.
We can be sure

80
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:40,340
show paid or on the other hand believed
that the future of capitalism is

81
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:41,690
inherently indeterminate.

82
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,190
That there is so much random process,

83
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,600
so much opportunity for
unexpected innovation,

84
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,450
that the prediction of capital,

85
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:59,070
the behavior of capitalist economies
beyond the very short term, uh,

86
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:03,650
is impossible. And I'm inclined to
believe the Peter's right about that.

87
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,103
Hi Yak.

88
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,381
Hi.

89
00:07:08,381 --> 00:07:13,381
Eric is the guy who wrote Constitution
of liberty and it's possible to be very

90
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:17,720
critical of high, actually does play
some logical tricks where this reader,

91
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,000
uh,
on the other hand,

92
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:25,930
he puts forward a passionate vision about
the creative possibilities of a free

93
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:27,764
society,

94
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,760
a society in which the right to innovate
the right to choose the right to author

95
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:38,240
one's own life and proposed
scripts for the lives of others,

96
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:44,170
a society which is open and not
subject to a overbearing hierarchy and

97
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:48,254
bureaucracy.

98
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:53,850
I is a learning machine and Hayak is
a brilliant theorist of that learning

99
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:58,484
machine.

100
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,290
Another set of fundamentals.
This is Ronald Coase.

101
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:10,430
He have Coase theorem fame.
This is her Nando de Soto. Uh,

102
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:15,540
he of mystery of capitalism fame and what
they both say is the capital formation

103
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:23,820
relies on governments and court and
the formalization of property rights.

104
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:31,890
And that one of the foundational aspects
of our wealth in the Western world is

105
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:39,150
tradable property rights
so that our houses are also
are also small store houses

106
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,310
of capital
and are earning power,

107
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,420
can be dot collateral for debt,

108
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,190
which is repaid through future earnings.
That whole aspect of capitalism.

109
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,760
That whole metabolic process is at
the fundaments of the best aspects of

110
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:05,700
capitalism, the aspects that
involve sustained prosperity.

111
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:07,763
Okay.

112
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,930
With the remaining 40
minutes of our class,

113
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,360
I'm going to go through these topics.
You can just take a quick glance at them.

114
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,380
They are basically the
details of what I just,

115
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,620
just adumbrated and the last of
them is the case for your final.

116
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,563
Okay?

117
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,020
Okay.
Capital

118
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,110
capital

119
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,800
is accumulated wealth
reproductively deployed.

120
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,460
It can take the form of cultivated land.

121
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,040
It can take the form of seed corn,

122
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,460
it can take the form of factory machinery,

123
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,810
it can take the form
of stock certificates.

124
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,490
It can take the form of educated people.

125
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,690
Indeed,
in a very real sense,

126
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,320
you are in the process
of capital formation.

127
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:18,320
During your years as university students,

128
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,740
you will be an embodiment of capitol
and indeed capital of a high order.

129
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,030
Uh,

130
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:31,030
when you finish Yale College or the
school of management or the law school or

131
00:10:32,421 --> 00:10:36,470
whatever it may be, your
last stop. Capitalism,

132
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,460
on the other hand

133
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:44,170
is the name that Socialists gave to a
whole bunch of things they didn't like

134
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:51,670
private businesses that in their view
exploited labor in their view despoil the

135
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:59,450
environment in their view
de sanctified historical,

136
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,160
historical and religious tradition.

137
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:07,340
And there is no inventor of capitalism.
Adam Smith didn't use the term.

138
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,540
Adam Smith didn't even like
joint stock corporations.

139
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,430
He thought they generally
didn't work well,

140
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,480
but it is an organic system which develops
over time and as Hayak and Schumpeter

141
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,560
and others point out to us is capable
of self modification through time.

142
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,580
Uh,
Marx's historicist theory of this,

143
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:38,890
and we did a whole lecture
on this in September, uh,

144
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,520
with the idea that capitalism,
capitalism always turns toward monopolies,

145
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:48,830
that capital becomes too abundant and
the rate of return on it falls with time

146
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:53,680
that the working class is
eventually eventually starved out.

147
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,380
Immiserated to use the term,
uh,

148
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:59,830
the inevitable revolution in
advanced capital of systems.

149
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,110
The places the revolution occurred.

150
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:06,130
We're always in the least
advanced market societies,

151
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,570
places like the Soviet Union.
Uh,

152
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,370
the theory of a universal class that
once the working class capture society,

153
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,420
it,

154
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,420
there will be no class
below it and therefore no
possibility of conflict and uh,

155
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,010
and uh, exploitation, uh,

156
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,890
the withering away of the state.

157
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:28,723
Okay.

158
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,480
Well here are the places where the
revolution occurred in Rad entered,

159
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:39,701
occurred in almost all of them because
the capitalist order was not developing

160
00:12:40,191 --> 00:12:45,191
and not maturing rather than that it
was developing and had exhausted itself.

161
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:50,883
Yeah.

162
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,750
The withering away of
the state takes a while.

163
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,000
Uh, this is from the communist manifesto
and this is where he gets it, right.

164
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,680
The notion that the bourgeoisie that
is capitalist cannot exist without

165
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:14,840
constitution constantly revolutionizing
the process of production.

166
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,500
That the conservation of old ways of
doing things was characteristic of every

167
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:23,870
previous economic system,
but not of capitalism.

168
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,100
All that solid melts into air.

169
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,620
So the flat part of
this is pre capitalism.

170
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:41,280
This was the Angus Maddison
curve that a Clark in,

171
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:45,200
in his, uh, farewell to arms, uh,

172
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,770
uses as his thesis again
and again and again.

173
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,820
And the upturn corresponds
to the capitalist era. Now,

174
00:13:52,821 --> 00:13:56,660
it also corresponds to the year
of intensive use of fossil fuels.

175
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:02,330
It also corresponds to the era
of radical urbanization, uh,

176
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:02,851
and there,

177
00:14:02,851 --> 00:14:07,010
and it also corresponds to a period
of extraordinarily fast technological

178
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:07,844
innovation.

179
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,980
And you can say that I give capitalism
too much credit and I'll settle for

180
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,000
agreeing with that.

181
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,830
But I will also say that capitalism is a,

182
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,040
has within it indigenously enormous
incentives for continuous technological

183
00:14:25,671 --> 00:14:30,671
innovation and for the rapid
deployment of desirable technologies.

184
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:35,150
And in that way,
it differs from all of their systems.

185
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,100
Capitalism during its rule of scarce 100
years has created more massive and more

186
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:53,840
colossal, productive forces that then
have all preceding generations together.

187
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,220
That's a true statement.

188
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It was made in the winter of 1847
48 and it was arguably true then.

189
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,920
It is vastly more obviously true
today that in roughly 10 generations,

190
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,780
maybe 12 generations,

191
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,440
capitalism has created more total
wealth and total spending power.

192
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:21,440
Uh,

193
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,330
then all the economic systems which
occupied human history before that time.

194
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,580
Now gapminder I'm actually
in a little bit of a,

195
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:36,080
I don't really have time for
a gap minder exercise, but uh,

196
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,440
there it is.
gapminder.org just go and play it.

197
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:44,750
Play it for yourselves if you want to
be sure that we're not talking about

198
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:45,860
something imaginary.

199
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:50,300
Uh, now what, what

200
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:55,410
it's an interesting exercise to do is
to single out sub command economies,

201
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,510
uh, such as, uh,

202
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:05,380
the Soviet Union before in
1989 or Cuba throughout the,

203
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:08,530
throughout the last 60 years.
And watch them.

204
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:13,680
And what you'll find is they do relatively
well on the health and longevity

205
00:16:14,381 --> 00:16:18,250
dimension and not so well
on the GDP dimension.

206
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:23,200
And it is a perfectly
reasonable for someone to say,

207
00:16:23,201 --> 00:16:25,180
I don't care about wealth,

208
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:30,930
I care about health and good spirit and
all that and I'm not interested in being

209
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,570
part of a society that
generates enormous wealth.

210
00:16:34,571 --> 00:16:37,720
And there are very reasonable and
rational people who take that view.

211
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,550
Um,
and

212
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:45,520
it's an option and it's fine.
It's even admirable,

213
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,530
but it's not what capitalist
market societies are about.

214
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,900
And one reasonable critique of
capitalist market societies is that they

215
00:16:55,901 --> 00:17:00,901
encourage us all to consume way beyond
our real needs that we spend more money

216
00:17:05,561 --> 00:17:10,560
on clothing and automobiles and
sporting equipment and liquor, uh,

217
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,270
then is really needed.
And there's no doubt of that.

218
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,880
I'm guilty myself.

219
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,980
Uh,
and

220
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:24,690
my guess is that most of you feel the
pull of market society and the inclination

221
00:17:25,751 --> 00:17:30,250
to spend more than would be
absolutely rational or necessary.

222
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,363
Uh,

223
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,210
fair enough. It's a critique. Uh, and
I think it's, I think it's a valid one.

224
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,813
Yeah.

225
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,400
The state property and capital back to
Smith Smith famously talked about the

226
00:17:44,461 --> 00:17:47,220
nightwatchman state,
the state,

227
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,320
which focuses primarily on law and
order and the enforcement of contract,

228
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,291
the state,

229
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:02,291
which makes it possible for a person
to own property to deploy that property

230
00:18:05,841 --> 00:18:10,490
productively and to make
money by satisfying the,

231
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,410
the apparent needs of others.

232
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,450
Now in order to have a
night watchman state,

233
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:22,430
you better have a state and Smith
wrote roughly two centuries,

234
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,320
Rah Rah,

235
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,980
a century and a half after the
Treaty of Westphalia in 1648,

236
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,730
which was the launch point of the modern
nation state system with a monopoly on

237
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:35,510
force and violence.

238
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:41,410
And Smith is in a sense
building a theoretical system
on the foundation of state

239
00:18:44,781 --> 00:18:47,540
enforced property rights.
In fact,

240
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:50,960
it's not just in a way that
is what he does. This was,

241
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:55,190
these are the states
involved in that treaty. Uh,

242
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:00,220
this is Thomas Hobbs who's Leviathan is
the defining tracked on nation state,

243
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,040
uh,

244
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:09,040
and which defines the Leviathan as
a monopolist on force and violence.

245
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,120
We prevent being the victims of one
another by in trusting to the state a full

246
00:19:19,551 --> 00:19:22,340
monopoly on the use of force and violence.

247
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,710
And in that way profit enormously through,
uh,

248
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:32,740
peace security and the ability to plan
ahead based on our current property

249
00:19:34,371 --> 00:19:35,204
holdings.

250
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:41,910
The Nation state system lays
out like this. Uh, it is,

251
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,310
uh, in many ways I think you
can say this definitively,

252
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:51,030
capitalism without the nation
state system is infeasible.

253
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:57,620
That if there were not the coercive
agency of the state in the background to

254
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:02,250
vouch safe property and contract,
uh,

255
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:07,350
to perform the functions, desoto
attributes to it. If it were not for that,

256
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,400
then none of the capital formation
processes that are vital to our wealth,

257
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,430
uh,
would be reliable and feasible.

258
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,700
Now you could invent some
entirely different system.

259
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,860
You could invent a system which slice
the world on another, another angle,

260
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,400
conceivably a functional angle there or
eight or could be a gender organization

261
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:35,760
in the world. There could be a
state for women in a state for men,

262
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,980
they'd have a geography of,

263
00:20:37,981 --> 00:20:40,670
it would be a little tangled if we
were going to reproduce. But, uh,

264
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:46,370
the just of the gist of this is that
capitalist wealth rests the foundation of

265
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,110
the nation state system. Uh, and it,

266
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,650
and the nation state system is
not altogether a pretty story.

267
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:02,430
Here's the British empire as it stood
in 1920 [inaudible] or the 1920s,

268
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:08,580
and none of these places shown in red
volunteered to join the British empire.

269
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,700
Uh, you might claim that Australia
and New Zealand did I think,

270
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,680
but even that's a reach.

271
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:23,250
The British empire was an extremely
coercive device for occupying territories

272
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:30,930
and extracting from their economies a
vast surplus for the metropolitan country.

273
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,400
Uh, it had many knock on
effects which worked out well.

274
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:42,450
The much of the infrastructure and
educational system which makes India so

275
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:44,670
promising today,
uh,

276
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:48,970
is partly related to the
best parts of British Raj.

277
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,070
But the,

278
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:57,030
the colonial background is a
part of the nation state story.

279
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,510
The function of states

280
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:08,100
having no state versus a state having a
failed state versus an effective state

281
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:14,850
having a state which fails to promote
formal property versus one that does the

282
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:18,850
one point in the tree,

283
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:24,630
which leads to the existence of what
desoto calls live capital is this one.

284
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,510
And lucky for you and me,

285
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:37,070
it is the one which envelops our lives
in the United States and in the Western

286
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:39,544
world.

287
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,900
The and desotos thesis really boils
down to this two by two table with dead

288
00:22:52,241 --> 00:22:55,810
versus live capital and formal
versus informal property rights.

289
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:01,690
But in the back of this is the notion
that you have to have a state which

290
00:23:01,691 --> 00:23:04,510
effectively and efficiently
administer his property.

291
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,310
And that means an elaborate court system,

292
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,950
a vast number of lawyers,

293
00:23:11,951 --> 00:23:16,120
barristers and the like a
huge record keeping system,

294
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:17,590
uh,

295
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:22,590
and and a and behind it all behind it
all a government capable of enforcing,

296
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:31,030
enforcing property rights
against theft and expropriation.

297
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:35,110
And this map of this
neighborhood of new haven,

298
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:40,170
the green lines are the property lines
and the vault at 200 orange street

299
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:43,150
contains the records corresponded,

300
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:48,380
corresponded to each of the green polygons
and a in the city there are 26,000

301
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:51,740
and some green polygons like that.

302
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:57,340
And the whole surface of North America
is covered with analogous polygon,

303
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:04,810
which are seed seed points of capital
formation and energize the economy

304
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:14,991
at desoto.

305
00:24:14,991 --> 00:24:19,850
Construct a strategy of conversion
from dead Capitol Alive,

306
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,970
uh,
toward the back part of the book.

307
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:28,330
With these phases indicated and in many
parts of the world and much of Latin

308
00:24:31,941 --> 00:24:34,610
America, much of Africa,
some parts of Asia,

309
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:40,030
the campaign to create live capital,

310
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:40,910
uh,

311
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:45,910
is a very real and live a campaign today
and is strategically of considerable

312
00:24:49,101 --> 00:24:49,934
important.

313
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:55,420
And as you think ahead to the case
you're going to write about in Cochabamba

314
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:59,960
Bolivia and about which we'll have a few
minutes to talk to or the end of this

315
00:24:59,961 --> 00:25:00,794
class,

316
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:06,400
the very in formality of that economy
is part of what kills Bechtel and its

317
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:12,200
development projects.

318
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,700
Yeah.

319
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,990
And the Soto makes quite a lot of how
it is that you can't have an informal

320
00:25:18,991 --> 00:25:23,820
system of property and then
just impose cookie cutter style,

321
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:28,560
a formal system of property which no one
understands at which doesn't correspond

322
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:33,540
to their beliefs. You've got to adapt
the formal system to the informal system.

323
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:39,350
And if the Soto is right and I think he
is part of the brilliance of American,

324
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,560
uh,

325
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:45,560
property law was that it found ways to
incorporate again and again and again to

326
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:51,921
incorporate informal property rights
like the Tomahawk farm or the minor's

327
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,900
rights recorded in minors
association records.

328
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,880
Having no relationship to government,
government didn't come along and say, no,

329
00:26:02,881 --> 00:26:07,140
that's all baloney. We're going to do it
our way. Government came along and said,

330
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:07,561
oh,
we,

331
00:26:07,561 --> 00:26:12,561
she now let's put that into language
which can be incorporated in the law and

332
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:21,441
which can allow the law to work with
rather than against the property rights

333
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,690
which you have established
among yourselves.

334
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,180
Ron Coast

335
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:35,210
coast is a Chicago school economist,

336
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:41,150
uh, and a, and he's written,

337
00:26:41,151 --> 00:26:46,151
he wrote all kinds of a wonderful
scholarship and what's called the Coase

338
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:50,790
theorem is really post hoc
reinterpretation of his work.

339
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,520
He never sat down to write
a paper called my theorem.

340
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:00,940
And the insight in it is really pretty
straight forward and I make it a little

341
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:04,350
simpler than he would like it.

342
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:10,470
But as we said before, where there
are clear initial entitlements,

343
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:17,930
the entitlements and the opportunities
to change them are transparent and where

344
00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:24,081
the information is shared in a way that
is relatively symmetrical so that we

345
00:27:24,421 --> 00:27:28,920
don't have situations where a buyer
or a broker knows all kinds of things,

346
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,590
which a customer doesn't know.

347
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,650
I, I, I said that wrong.

348
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,300
Where an owner or a broker knows all
kinds of things which are customer doesn't

349
00:27:40,301 --> 00:27:44,890
know, uh, can finally
low transaction cost.

350
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,690
A practical story.

351
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:50,770
But any of you ever been involved in
buying a house or being part of a family?

352
00:27:50,771 --> 00:27:51,670
Is it bought a house?

353
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,573
Yes.

354
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:00,040
Okay. That's informative. Uh, did you, uh,

355
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:04,360
what did you do to remedy the information
asymmetry between you and the sour?

356
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,043
Right.

357
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:11,840
You didn't do anything, but when did
your family do visited the house. Okay.

358
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:16,130
And just that grow,
they had all sorts of papers.

359
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,490
I hope what they did was it hot,

360
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:22,760
was hired someone to inspect the
house and give them a report.

361
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,260
Let's check with a jet behind you.

362
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,460
Do you ever experienced with it?
Yes,

363
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,360
and I did a praise.
Okay.

364
00:28:32,361 --> 00:28:36,170
You had an appraisal and did you have
anybody to look at the pipes on the roof

365
00:28:36,171 --> 00:28:38,800
and the and all that? Yeah, go ahead.

366
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,540
I'm glad the there,

367
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:46,760
and I say this because I four or five
years ago bought a house with a slate roof

368
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:52,400
and I got a report which called the
condition of the slate roof. Very good.

369
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:57,620
Well it turns out that very good for a
slate roof cost about $20,000 a year in

370
00:28:57,621 --> 00:29:01,280
repairs.
So it was a very bad decision on my part,

371
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,950
but the,
the,

372
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,040
the information shaman tree part of this
is central and the idea is that you can

373
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:15,581
get an efficient market including any
efficient formation of capital through

374
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:21,330
leveraging, leveraging real property, uh,

375
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:26,060
where those conditions are met. So as
a practical guide in, in doing things,

376
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:31,760
you've got three things to tick off on
your fingers and think about in managing

377
00:29:31,761 --> 00:29:33,920
the affairs of an organization or affirm.

378
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:41,370
Yeah, this is too complicated. Um,

379
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:48,390
the rough idea here is to take the three
factors in coasts and run them against

380
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,340
the obvious aspects of
a nation state system.

381
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:56,410
And look how tech not
say to take an example.

382
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,840
Technology transfer,
uh,

383
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,290
relates to transparency so that we're,

384
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:07,650
we are one segment of society has unique
access to technology and knowledge that

385
00:30:10,511 --> 00:30:14,340
others lack. You can assume
there will be huge, uh,

386
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,440
huge asymmetries in the distribution of
information and that that will distort

387
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:24,130
the functioning of the economy.
And sure enough it does.

388
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:30,030
And part of the justification
for government provision
of public education is

389
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:38,731
that it provides the minimum access to
information and the methods of obtaining

390
00:30:39,581 --> 00:30:44,581
information which are required by
citizenship in a democratic and market

391
00:30:44,981 --> 00:30:45,814
society.

392
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:48,803
MMM.

393
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,800
With any market economy you're going to,

394
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,020
you're going to expect to
move east of the status quo.

395
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,850
I did an elaborate exercise with Edgeworth
boxes with you about about a month

396
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:06,500
ago and where you start
determines where you end.

397
00:31:06,501 --> 00:31:11,501
So if we start here where the
smiths have almost everything,

398
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:18,190
we're going to end up somewhere up there
or here where the Jones is on almost

399
00:31:18,201 --> 00:31:19,940
everything.
We're going to end up somewhere here.

400
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:25,450
So what coast doesn't say is that there
is some particular symmetry or justice

401
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,370
to the way property rights move.
And indeed,

402
00:31:31,371 --> 00:31:36,371
it's worth stopping to say
that to ourselves whom so
ever expect social justice

403
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:41,690
from a market economy expects in vain.

404
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:46,460
That's not what market economies are
good at. They're good at a lot of things,

405
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:51,140
but you cannot when you are a wealthy,

406
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,620
a wealthy Septa, judge, Arion,

407
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,600
and I'm at least one of those two things.

408
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:06,720
You cannot say to yourself that it is
the just verdict of the American economy

409
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:10,390
that I should be well to do.

410
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:15,610
I had has it has in it all
kinds of happenstance factors,

411
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,110
uh,

412
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:22,110
including the luck of one's birth and
the generosity of one's educators that

413
00:32:25,691 --> 00:32:30,280
those things happen. And
so the claim people, I,

414
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:32,890
I am clearly pro capitalist,

415
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:37,180
but when I argue with people and
they say, well, but it, it, you know,

416
00:32:37,181 --> 00:32:40,820
there are all kinds of people have more
money than they and others who have last

417
00:32:40,821 --> 00:32:43,850
I say, yes, I agree. Uh,

418
00:32:43,851 --> 00:32:47,270
and there may be other remedies you
want to take for that. For example,

419
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:48,890
giving some people some of your own money,

420
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:54,650
but the claim for capitalism
just doesn't go there.

421
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:56,810
Okay.

422
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:01,220
Wealth maximizing war and a
joint stock corporation. The law,

423
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:02,630
the government create,

424
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:07,880
can either be well designed or
poorly designed to create wealth.

425
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:13,730
And we started some months
ago with Gan versus rich,

426
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:19,420
the matter of a sinking whale and
tailoring of the judgment in that case to

427
00:33:21,741 --> 00:33:24,770
preserve the incentive
for the whaling industry.

428
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,350
Yeah.

429
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:31,350
By allowing the principal deigns to go
to those who take the largest risks and

430
00:33:31,871 --> 00:33:34,990
make the largest investment.
And that's the,

431
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:38,950
that's the intuition of
wealth maximizing law.

432
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:42,990
Another case we, I think luck that
I'm not quite sure I would do.

433
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,540
Would you do us versus caused me
the one about their rights? Well,

434
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,820
you get it before the airplane,

435
00:33:48,821 --> 00:33:53,821
it was perfectly sensible to say that
the air rights over one slammed extended

436
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,260
to the end of the universe,

437
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,570
or at least until they got to
the next inhabited solar system.

438
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,650
Uh, that was a perfectly okay
thing to say. It did no harm.

439
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:10,060
But once air travel became
part of the technology,

440
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:15,510
you had to change that precept and
grant the right of free trespass above a

441
00:34:16,031 --> 00:34:16,900
certain altitude.

442
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:19,803
Yeah.

443
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:24,760
Uh, this is Mark Lanier. I show you
guys a little bit of Mark Linear.

444
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,373
Okay.

445
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:31,620
And the dark side of wealth Max on the
top side of wealth maximizing law is tort

446
00:34:32,711 --> 00:34:33,790
law and the lawsuit.

447
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,720
But the thinking behind having lawsuits
is that lawsuits provide an incentive

448
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:47,460
against carelessness in dealing with
the lives of others and the punishment.

449
00:34:50,051 --> 00:34:50,530
That one,

450
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:55,530
that one that accompany gets for producing
a hazardous product or performing a

451
00:34:56,321 --> 00:35:01,321
risky and failed medical procedure is a
way of keeping manufacturers and health

452
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,300
care people.
Uh,

453
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:08,560
honest and careful though

454
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,830
critical features,
features

455
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:20,630
of the Joint Stock Corporation as compared
with straight forward proprietorship

456
00:35:21,451 --> 00:35:26,160
and partnership are first of all that
the chain of accountability is thin.

457
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,990
That is the relationship.

458
00:35:27,991 --> 00:35:32,991
Customers and investors both have only
a thin relationship with the decision

459
00:35:35,431 --> 00:35:38,940
makers in the firm. You
can't, if you own a thousand,

460
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:43,380
a thousand shares of General Motors
and you think they shouldn't have fired

461
00:35:43,381 --> 00:35:45,300
Fritsch yesterday as they did,

462
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,680
you're going to waste your money by
calling them up to talk about it. Uh,

463
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:53,370
and if you're the owner of a General
Motors car and you don't like the way the

464
00:35:53,371 --> 00:35:54,630
door handles are put on,

465
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:58,950
it's not much use calling them up
and asking them to do it differently.

466
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:04,080
What you have to do is buy
another manufacturer's car. Uh,

467
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:09,110
the role of ownership is passive investors
buy shares and if they don't like the

468
00:36:10,141 --> 00:36:13,770
course of the company's, uh,
management, they sell the shares.

469
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,610
Uh,
liability is limited.

470
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:23,030
The most an investor can lose
is what she put in to, uh,

471
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,980
the shares she purchased. That's,
and that's a great provision,

472
00:36:27,981 --> 00:36:29,180
right?
If you're an investor,

473
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,690
it means that you really don't
have to do much homework,

474
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:37,760
at least homework about the
downside of management practices.

475
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,800
Liquidity is like water.

476
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:45,190
It is a perfectly liquid instrument and
it is an endlessly scalable instrument.

477
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:52,420
And the joint stock corporation is about
between 88 to 90% of a market economy

478
00:36:56,361 --> 00:36:58,700
is embodied in joint stock corporations.

479
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:02,420
And whenever their flaws
and their flaws are many,

480
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,670
Jim Alexander here has told you
a few, uh, their flaws are many.

481
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,210
But uh,

482
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:14,320
the ability to produce at enormous scale
with enormous efficiency is very real.

483
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:18,590
I'll post these slides
so you don't need to

484
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:25,210
write down all my squiggles. Uh, but the,

485
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,280
the most important feature is that
you've got centralized management,

486
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,280
which has a thin Roy ocean ship both with
customers and with investors and is in

487
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:43,340
it and has the capacity to engage in
efficient production of stuff people

488
00:37:44,961 --> 00:37:46,040
actually want to buy.

489
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:47,830
Okay.

490
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:52,830
Vertical integration is a key feature
of companies like this vertical

491
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:54,760
integration,

492
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:59,760
meaning that the company engages itself
in a long chain of activities which

493
00:38:01,481 --> 00:38:05,860
start in the extreme case,
start with raw materials.

494
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,230
For example, iron ore in the ground,
tobacco growing in the field,

495
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:17,640
lobsters crawling about
under Penobscot Bay, uh,

496
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,030
and finishes with lobsters on the plate,
uh,

497
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:27,000
with a completed
automobile, uh, or whatever.

498
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:32,240
And vertical integration creates an
enormously difficult management challenge.

499
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:37,690
And often companies wisely walk
away from some aspect of it.

500
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,390
The car companies,
for example,

501
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:45,600
have been shedding the manufacturer of
many of their intermediate parks now for

502
00:38:45,761 --> 00:38:48,580
30 or 40 years because it
was so difficult to manage.

503
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:54,570
But the advantage is that it gives a
company enormous autonomy from others who

504
00:38:56,261 --> 00:38:59,080
seek to intervene in its operations.

505
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:05,910
The vertically integrated corporation is
also from a public perception point of

506
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:11,200
view, quite often a monster.
Uh, Alex, I think it was,

507
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:14,240
uh, referred us to the, to the, uh,

508
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:19,260
picture of a vampire
squid for Goldman Sachs.

509
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:26,430
And that picture actually goes back all
this in 1881 cartoon of standard oil

510
00:39:28,361 --> 00:39:31,360
pictured a not as a vampire squid,

511
00:39:31,361 --> 00:39:35,080
but as a giant squid with tentacles
reaching into everyone's living room.

512
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:40,600
And it was that
a vertical integration from

513
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,610
an olive grove to Palmolive soap.

514
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,680
That's the gist of this.
The slogan on the Palmolive soap,

515
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:56,110
I learned from, from a beauty
expert how to hold my husband.

516
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:02,850
That's a terrible way to sell
people soap, right? It's just raw,

517
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,240
right?
It just is.

518
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:10,810
But marketing does that and it's part
of the package in a capitalist market

519
00:40:13,251 --> 00:40:14,084
society.

520
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,170
Okay.

521
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:20,190
Uh, the first great corporations
where the American American railroads,

522
00:40:20,191 --> 00:40:23,850
or at least in American history and
the Alfred Chandler piece about the

523
00:40:23,851 --> 00:40:27,500
Pennsylvania railroad is a
good example of this. They,

524
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,480
they involved enormously large,

525
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:35,550
large scale investment of capital in
the railroad infrastructure and rolling

526
00:40:35,551 --> 00:40:39,570
stock. And they created a
challenge to management,

527
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:42,690
which no previous business had created.

528
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:47,691
So you've got 50,000 employees and
you've got these enormous contraptions

529
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:53,070
running at one another, uh, all
over the place. And incidentally,

530
00:40:53,071 --> 00:40:53,940
in the early years,

531
00:40:53,941 --> 00:40:58,941
killing five or 10,000 people a year
and the management of all that required.

532
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:05,280
One of the great revolutions, which I
have spent little time on in this course,

533
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,100
where in the joint stock corporation,

534
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:13,050
you develop a huge cadre of
professionally trained managers, uh,

535
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,080
like the crowd sitting back, right? Uh,

536
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:21,200
soon to be a freshly minted
Yale Mbas who are going to run.

537
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,930
I don't think you're going to run trains.
Uh,

538
00:41:24,931 --> 00:41:27,180
but they're going to run
big complicated things.

539
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:33,830
Goldman Sachs
is a different kettle of fish.

540
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:37,310
Goldman Sachs is not
vertically integrated at all.

541
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:41,780
It occupies a strategic
position in the economy,

542
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,670
which allows it economy and government,

543
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,820
which allows it to create,

544
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:55,830
to use enormous leverage
and enormously high powered,

545
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:56,810
uh,

546
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:01,810
expertise to generate revenues on a more
or less unprecedented scale and polos.

547
00:42:05,441 --> 00:42:09,650
And noni is my very dear friend.
Uh, he really is. I mean,

548
00:42:09,651 --> 00:42:13,250
we're really good
friends. Um, but I would,

549
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,230
I would say I would say it to his face.

550
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:18,020
I probably wouldn't say it in front
of a hundred people to his face,

551
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,770
but I would say to his face that
he earns way too much funny,

552
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,540
just outrageous how much money you earn.
Now I,

553
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,430
I wouldn't advance a law to
take his money away, but I,

554
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,630
I do think there's more of it than he
needs or deserves. But like I said,

555
00:42:35,631 --> 00:42:39,100
capitalism doesn't solve that problem.
Um,

556
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:44,950
this is the inner courtyard at
Infosys in Bangalore in India.

557
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:51,250
And the process of very rapid formation
of gigantic wealth in through the,

558
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:58,910
through the best joint stock
corporations is a worldwide event.

559
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,260
Uh, and the world would be a better
place if there were more of it.

560
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:08,280
The,
the

561
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:13,170
Ibbotson slides, which I
showed you some months ago, uh,

562
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:18,180
for the u s summarize what becomes of a
dollar invested in 1927 as common stock.

563
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:26,170
And that kind of growth is
characteristic only of very well managed.

564
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:35,230
Uh, equity investments, greater
possibilities with free society.

565
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,373
Okay.

566
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,440
Hi Act conceives of society
as a learning machine

567
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:50,090
and that store of knowledge
and institutional practices
which are built up in a,

568
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,010
in a,
in a market society.

569
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:55,303
Okay

570
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:58,360
bill up in an exponential way
like the green curve here.

571
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:04,980
And the most important fact
about that is that no individual

572
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:12,540
knows a very high fraction of the
total knowledge of the system.

573
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,170
We are all,

574
00:44:14,171 --> 00:44:19,030
we all need to be shelf consciously
humble about how little it is.

575
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,880
We know about the total
operation of the system.

576
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:27,510
We are all looking at 1% 3% 2% of the
data which make our society function or

577
00:44:31,411 --> 00:44:36,330
fail to do so. And that condition,
it's more and more obvious, right?

578
00:44:36,331 --> 00:44:40,680
If you think about what it
is that is on the screen in,

579
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,930
in your,
on your study desk,

580
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:48,230
what's accessible in that screen at
any given moment is thousands of times,

581
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:51,780
thousands of times more
than you will ever command.

582
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:57,060
I'm going to have to stop there with
that and go back and go to the case

583
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,190
because,
um,

584
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:03,300
I want to have time for that and a post.

585
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:07,230
I've got three or four more topics there,
but I,

586
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,500
I'll post the slides and I want
to discuss the case with you,

587
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:14,690
um, of, can we turn this?

588
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:21,290
Yeah. Here we go. Um,

589
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:26,550
were you, how many of you were able
to look at the Finnegan piece so far?

590
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:31,430
Got Your attention. Go ahead. Um,

591
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:35,340
you audit,
start by,

592
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:37,603
I would,
I would,

593
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:42,160
I would start interpreting this story by
asking yourself about Bolivia's history

594
00:45:42,161 --> 00:45:43,390
and social composition

595
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:52,060
and where it Phipps, uh,
in the world economy,

596
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,900
how it relates

597
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:01,850
to Paul Collier's bottom billion.

598
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:03,323
Yeah.

599
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,880
And here's one obvious
way it relates call your,

600
00:46:07,881 --> 00:46:09,890
has a series of what he calls traps.

601
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:16,220
If you're running Bolivia through all
the traps, you will see that it is an,

602
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,170
it is not a favored nation.

603
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:22,640
It is a nation which has
many vulnerabilities,

604
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:30,540
and it is consequently on the
lower edge of the world economy.

605
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:33,743
Now,

606
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:39,640
it has a city called Cochabamba,
about 800,000 people,

607
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,050
uh, with a, uh,

608
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:48,010
water company called a
water agency called cm pos.

609
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:52,570
And that agency is terrible.

610
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:57,580
It does a very poor job
of delivering water.

611
00:46:59,080 --> 00:46:59,913
Uh,

612
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:05,760
it is also corrupt and a very high
fraction of the water distributed is

613
00:47:08,231 --> 00:47:09,430
distributed illegally.

614
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:14,290
People tap into it just
as in poor countries,

615
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:16,930
people tap into the power line,

616
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:19,750
power cables that run through their areas.

617
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,780
And the,

618
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:26,740
there are two gigantic agencies,

619
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,990
the World Bank and the
international monetary,

620
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:32,590
which believe in markets in a big way.

621
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
And they have a pressured Bolivia and uh,

622
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:45,660
50 or 75 similar bottom billion countries
to marketize their economies through

623
00:47:50,351 --> 00:47:51,340
private investment.

624
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:57,870
And the gist of the story is that the
investment of private capital will

625
00:48:01,601 --> 00:48:06,580
incentivize companies typically well,

626
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,520
well finance, Josh, Josh,

627
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:13,590
joint stock corporations to do an awful
lot better job of providing water,

628
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,810
electricity, a rail service, air service,

629
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:21,280
uh,

630
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:26,050
all the basic functions of an economy
will be better performed privately then

631
00:48:26,051 --> 00:48:26,980
they were publicly.

632
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:33,120
And the people who are of the inspirers
of that are called the Chicago Boys

633
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,850
Group of young economists,
the most famous of whom is Jeffrey Sachs,

634
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:44,050
who was then at Chicago
but is now at Columbia.

635
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:45,670
Uh,

636
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:50,670
and the market tonic is what
was applied in this case.

637
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:57,130
Now the case didn't work,
the, the tonic didn't work.

638
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:02,380
And one conclusion,

639
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:07,630
one conclusion is that market
reform is all together wrong

640
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,540
and we'll fail everywhere.

641
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:14,620
And I think you can gather some evidence
through your reading and through

642
00:49:14,621 --> 00:49:19,330
Collier one way or the
other. On that point, uh,

643
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:23,350
the gist of the question,
which I'll post tomorrow,

644
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,353
is

645
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:32,070
explain what happened when Bechtle
through its wholly owned subsidiary,

646
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:39,940
went into Cochabamba to
reconfirm reconceived,

647
00:49:39,941 --> 00:49:42,490
reconfigure and reconstruct
the water system,

648
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:49,110
interpret that story in light of the
most important things you've learned in

649
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:54,010
this course.
Are there questions?

650
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:01,420
Okay, we'll see each other again
on December 14th at the exam.

651
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:09,560
[inaudible].
