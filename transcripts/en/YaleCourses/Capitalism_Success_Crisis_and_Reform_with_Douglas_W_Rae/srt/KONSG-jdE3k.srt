1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,720
Uh, today's case, a
shell co Seawall, uh, is,

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,540
uh, a wonderful transition, uh, to,

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,440
uh, Colliers, bottom billion. And

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:18,983
A,

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,230
I want to start with some frameworks
and I'm, I'm going to do these briefly.

6
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:29,850
I'll post them this evening shoe could
look back at them. I want to introduce,

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,740
these are very standard Mba ish,

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,220
a shorthand frameworks for thinking
about cases. And you heard,

9
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:42,900
I think most of this, but I,
I should rub it in a bit. Uh,

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,080
one is called Swat, s, w o, o t.

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,310
And this one has really
no analytic content to it.

12
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,410
It's just a,

13
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,520
a way of organizing your
thoughts on a topic,

14
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,160
a strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, threat,

15
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,950
uh,
in the temporal dimension.

16
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,420
Typically the strengths and weaknesses
are things which are immediately present

17
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,040
in your situation.

18
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,030
And the opportunities and threats are
things you might have happened to you or

19
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:21,540
might cause, uh, cause, uh, to occur.

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,930
And,
um,

21
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,540
a lot of back of the envelope thinking
about business cases is organized in a,

22
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,630
this shorthand.
Uh,

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,640
so you might make yourself a grid like
this and let the column headings be Swat.

24
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,680
And then,
uh,

25
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,650
let the row headings be
whatever you choose. Uh,

26
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,620
but one candidate a is the porter forcer,
uh,

27
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,190
which we've seen before.
Uh,

28
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,600
how fierce is the direct competition in
your business from other people doing

29
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:03,780
more of us exactly what you do and
trying to do it better than you?

30
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,970
Uh, what's the threat that others not
now doing it will enter the business and

31
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:11,580
increased competition.
Uh,

32
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,610
how likely is it that people will find
substitutes for your whole industry that,

33
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,390
uh, your industry will be
undermined by an adjacent industry?

34
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:25,224
Mine

35
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,493
is that

36
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,140
I could tell I was able to
determine which letter it was.

37
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,950
Can you hold that up and
tell us what it's about?

38
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,630
Yeah.
Really quickly

39
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,700
hold it up.
So the video guy,

40
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,500
the Congo,

41
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,380
the kinds of sexual crimes of sexual
violence that are common communes to the

42
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,230
billions as well resolve
the mineral conflict, uh,

43
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,950
such as copper and coal,
uh,

44
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,980
which are frequently found in
our own devices such as iPads,

45
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:07,480
cell phones and cameras. So just trying
to draw attention to the crisis. Terrific.

46
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,840
It's certainly an eye catching
a accessory as you walk in.

47
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,900
Um,
threat of substitution,

48
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:20,860
then the power of your
suppliers in the shell case.

49
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:25,861
Think about where you're buying
the basic components of these,

50
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:32,260
uh, generation and
lighting systems. Uh, if,

51
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,280
if there's only a limited number of
sources or perhaps even just one store,

52
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,490
then they're in a position
to squeeze you on price.

53
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,930
And that's an important strategic
consideration. And buyers,

54
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,680
if buyers have a lot of leverage
or as in the Selco case,

55
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,040
not a lot of money,

56
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:00,150
then buyers become a central
point of strategic focus.

57
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,960
So you could, if you
wanted, and I often do this,

58
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:09,310
you could combine swat across
the top with supply, with,

59
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,600
with a porter in the rows so that,

60
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,093
uh,

61
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,200
if you take a potential
entrance threat of entry,

62
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,550
uh, your strength might be that there's
no money to be made in this field.

63
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,350
So not many people are
going to want to do it.

64
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,420
Or it might be that there are huge
switching costs so that once people have

65
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:32,410
bought your equipment,

66
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,450
it is very difficult for them to
switch to other people's equipment.

67
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,050
Uh, the weakness might be
that you're making money

68
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:47,550
and that the Financial Times just ran a
large article about how lucrative your

69
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:52,420
business is, which is likely to
attract the attention of others,

70
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,400
uh, opportunities. Uh, perhaps, uh,

71
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,320
well how is, how is barriers
to entry and opportunity? Uh,

72
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,180
perhaps you can build pricing advantages.

73
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,720
If you increase the scale
of your operation, uh,

74
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,200
your unit costs may get low enough
that whenever a new entrant comes,

75
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,380
you can crush him with low prices.
Um,

76
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,680
uh,
and threat similarly,

77
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:31,681
somebody else may jump in and get
to a higher scale of production,

78
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,290
much lower unit costs and crush you.

79
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,800
So you can, you could walk
all the way through, uh,

80
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,830
the 20 cells there. Uh, but it, it,

81
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,650
frameworks like this are meant to
be useful. And when they're useful,

82
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:48,820
they are there,
you use them.

83
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,690
And if there's a particular cell
here that doesn't make any sense,

84
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:55,030
you just put an x through it and go on.

85
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,020
Uh,

86
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,030
another concept that
we've used briefly and it,

87
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,430
and it gets to be important in cases
like Selco is vertical integration,

88
00:06:06,431 --> 00:06:10,330
which I've drawn horizontally
as almost everyone else does.

89
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:16,110
And the rough idea here is that on the
left is the supply of raw materials.

90
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:22,900
Uh, and then, uh, then making of
the product. It's the assembly,

91
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,080
it's distribution and
sale all the way out here,

92
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:30,820
the sale and is called the forward part
of integration. So forward integration,

93
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:31,720
uh,

94
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,640
raw materials and intermediate products
is called backward integration.

95
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,250
And so defying all logic backward
plus forward makes vertical,

96
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,310
don't ask me how that came about.

97
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,663
MMM.

98
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,820
Behind that process,

99
00:06:51,821 --> 00:06:56,821
which we think of in
very physical terms is a,

100
00:06:57,161 --> 00:06:59,440
an intellectual and managerial layer,

101
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,400
which starts not with raw materials,
but with a business plan,

102
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,860
a and a product design and the assembly
of a management team and the creation of

103
00:07:10,661 --> 00:07:14,770
channels for distributing the
product. Again, left to right.

104
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,960
And if you think about the sell coke case,

105
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,483
uh,

106
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:24,370
where's the, where's their main
focus on this Arrow at Selco?

107
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,970
What do they mostly paying attention to?

108
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,650
Back left, you got to shout.
If you don't have a bike,

109
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,420
they, most of their staff is focused on
distribution and sales. But then India,

110
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,730
okay.
This absolutely.

111
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:49,970
So the forward integration of
Selco is it's most obvious,

112
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,480
uh,
obviously unusual feature.

113
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:00,350
They're reaching into very difficult
markets to do the sales and very awkward

114
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:05,820
places to do the service which
has to go with the sales.

115
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,750
And if you look now at another way of
looking at the backward to forward a

116
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,660
story, it's, I,

117
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:20,880
I've reproduced what was already there,
but then I've added service out here.

118
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:26,390
It turns out that taking responsibility
for durable goods that you sell,

119
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:34,020
right? There's not much
longterm responsibility for
toothbrushes or toothpicks.

120
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:39,780
Uh, but there is a lot of service
responsibility for any form of machinery,

121
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:45,200
especially when people are
going to organize our lives
around the machinery. Uh,

122
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:50,190
the classic insight on a
classic example on this is,

123
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,450
uh,
a McCormick,

124
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,790
a farm machinery in the 18 hundreds.

125
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,780
The brilliant thing they did,
which none of their competitors did,

126
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,380
was to manufacture a only during the
winter season and use the same people that

127
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:12,900
were running the manufacturing plant
to be servicing agents for the farmers

128
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,520
during the growing season.

129
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,110
So that the advantage
of buying their stuff,

130
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:24,540
I had everything to do with service. Now
think about the laptop in front of you.

131
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,340
Take Yours. Uh, is service an issue?

132
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,740
Well, does it just run, run
forever and keep you happy?

133
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:43,200
Okay. And what do you do? Okay.

134
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:46,560
Or you call him up and talk to talk to it.
So called genius.

135
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,740
What a thought,
right?

136
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:54,770
The genius bar and Max
Competitive Advantage.

137
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,200
It's partly the elegance of the,
of the equipment,

138
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,630
but a lot of it is that they're servicing
is way better than anybody else's

139
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:09,740
who's got a kind of computer
that services hard to find for.

140
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:15,190
You're all perfectly happy with the
support you get for your computers.

141
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:21,550
Well that's wonderful. It's,
it's improbable but wonderful.

142
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,490
Um,
okay,

143
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,200
so you get a,
with Selco,

144
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:34,260
a huge emphasis on the
service end of the business.

145
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,220
Okay. Now let's turn to the case
itself. There's an a part and a B part.

146
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,440
The B part is really kind of a more like
a teaching note than an actual case.

147
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,660
And the focus is on a rural,

148
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,890
the a certain rural part of India and on,

149
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,623
uh,

150
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,840
sales to people who are either in
business on a very small scale,

151
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:13,711
entrepreneurs of some kind or householders
in an area that is off the electric

152
00:11:15,521 --> 00:11:16,354
grid.

153
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:21,910
And it's an interesting fact about
India that the electric grid is highly

154
00:11:21,911 --> 00:11:26,680
problematic and incomplete. And uh, first,

155
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,550
uh,

156
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:32,550
mass development of wind turbines was
actually begun in India by a textiles

157
00:11:33,941 --> 00:11:37,430
manufacturer who,
uh,

158
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:42,510
got tired of all the downtime
in his reliance on grid
electric power and started

159
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,440
developing turbines for his own use.

160
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,800
And then had the,

161
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,840
had the insight that turbines where a
profitable business than textiles for him

162
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,790
and switched all together.

163
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:02,791
It's now headquartered in
Denmark and it's a huge company.

164
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,503
MMM.

165
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,850
So the alternatives to
what these guys are doing,

166
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:16,200
the ones mentioned in the
case are the grid Pico, hydro.

167
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:21,201
And it's very hard for me to envision
how you do distributed generation with

168
00:12:21,301 --> 00:12:24,960
water. I got, well anybody
got a thought about this?

169
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,980
You live next to a running stream and
you build a little water wheel and it's

170
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,470
got to be something a little
glitzy or than that, uh,

171
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,870
and wind turbine on a micro scale

172
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,170
now,
um,

173
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:48,550
what are the inherent disadvantages of
the distributed generation strategy that

174
00:12:50,511 --> 00:12:51,830
Selco is engaged in?

175
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,870
If you were looking at it from a
business point of view, what would be

176
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,750
factors that would,
would strike you as a

177
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,683
scary?

178
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,623
Uh,
yes.

179
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,630
Every time they entered a new market
they had to convince the finance

180
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:19,830
institution to finance their products to
the market that they were catering to.

181
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:25,190
So it was almost a barrier of entry for
them because the kind of people they

182
00:13:25,381 --> 00:13:27,900
wanted to sell the products
to did not have the services.

183
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:32,400
And it was also a new concept that they
were introducing because financing was

184
00:13:32,401 --> 00:13:34,140
never done with respect to energy before.

185
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,100
Okay.
So one,

186
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:41,130
one problem that is inherit in the market
segment they choose to serve is that

187
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:43,600
you've got a twin,

188
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:49,260
a door to door finance at the
micro level with door to door sale.

189
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:55,120
Uh, of the, of the equipment,
the generating equipment
and the lighting equipment.

190
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,970
So that's one difficulty.
Are there any others?

191
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,260
Maybe I'll just make carry that around.
Any others?

192
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,503
Yup.

193
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,020
Um, some days there's no
sun and then obviously, yes,

194
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:13,230
solar system isn't going to work.
There are,

195
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:18,380
and there are some seasons in which that
happens repeatedly though in the part

196
00:14:20,311 --> 00:14:25,230
of India they're doing, it's a pretty
sunny place. Uh, but okay. So that's,

197
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,470
that's uh,
that's a genuine drawback.

198
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,450
Other other thoughts?

199
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,950
Oh,
there you are.

200
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,160
Essentially they're competing
with the government.

201
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,370
If the government chose to
expand the grid in the region,

202
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:47,810
they're doing business
that would put there,

203
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,430
that would put their business
plan and they decided decision.

204
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,190
Okay.

205
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,900
So, uh, there's a lot said there all,

206
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,840
all in one elegant sentence.
Uh,

207
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,370
and the, uh, the biggest piece of it,

208
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:10,210
as I heard it was the threat that the
grid might expand into a given area.

209
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,120
And why would people,
once the grid came,

210
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:18,260
switched from Shell Cosa
equipment to grid equipment,

211
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,720
we took your mic
probably cost,

212
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:30,640
it's more efficient to
generate electricity, um, in a,

213
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,100
in a power plant. Then
in your own house. Okay.

214
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,850
And in n is there a general concept here?

215
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,990
Economies of scale,
economies of scale, right?

216
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,970
The whole point of centralized generation,
uh,

217
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:50,260
is huge economies of
scale, right? So that,

218
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,480
uh, if you, if, if,

219
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,560
if the grid is run reasonably efficiently,
efficiently,

220
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,060
it will time after time
Trump distributed generation.

221
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,790
And so why would we do this business?

222
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:13,220
What's the point?
Is this something that

223
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:15,643
uh,

224
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:19,190
a brilliant young reptile from the Harvard
business school is going to jump into

225
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:24,250
to make his fortune?
Sasha,

226
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:27,720
what do you think? No, no. And why not?

227
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,660
I think there are too many risks,

228
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,450
too many risks. And how
big an upside is, sir.

229
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,810
Um, I, I'm not sure how you
would clarify the upside,

230
00:16:39,811 --> 00:16:42,330
but I'm not convinced that it's
huge enough to take advantage.

231
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,900
Okay. Uh, does anybody remember
the financing story for this

232
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,550
work comes what,
what subsidies are required?

233
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:53,651
Okay,

234
00:16:53,651 --> 00:16:57,820
let's watch a little bit of filming yet
further along with the actual story.

235
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,240
We got the sound. This found cord
up here, guys. I hear it yesterday.

236
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,273
Okay.

237
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:50,490
I had a chance to go to
Dominican Republic way back in 91

238
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,480
and there I saw actually some villagers
using solar power and paying for it.

239
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:01,110
That triggered a lot of changes
in my own thought process.

240
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:02,430
When I came up in the back,

241
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,420
hi was one of the first to realize that
there was potential for selling solar

242
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:09,490
home systems to individual users.

243
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:14,080
At the time the only lighting systems
in rural India where community

244
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,180
installations funded by the government.

245
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:23,970
What we did basically what start
off the operations and and see uh,

246
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,780
solid. Okay, let's,

247
00:18:25,781 --> 00:18:30,250
let's tackle the barriers as they come
rather than studying it and then seeing

248
00:18:30,251 --> 00:18:33,080
what the solutions were. So we
were a three member team, Harish,

249
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,800
no one Mr Pie and I,

250
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:40,270
the three of us together were the ones
who are the so called management of the

251
00:18:40,271 --> 00:18:42,430
company at that point in time.
And between the three of us,

252
00:18:42,431 --> 00:18:46,540
we delighted the jobs that were dead in
the organization with the taking care of

253
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:50,680
most of the day to day running of
the organization. Those days, Mr,

254
00:18:50,681 --> 00:18:54,400
by taking care of the operational side of
it and me taking care of the marketing,

255
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,640
we started basically with $30 in the
pocket for three years and we would buy a

256
00:19:01,331 --> 00:19:02,650
for lighting system from a,

257
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:06,790
from a manufacturer and then sell it
and whatever money we would get in by

258
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:07,624
another

259
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,680
Hareesh slowly realized that the one
size fits all for light system was not

260
00:19:12,961 --> 00:19:17,070
always the most appropriate or
affordable solution for the rural poor

261
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,920
[inaudible] actually dumping
technology down people's throat.

262
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,080
Even not giving them a choice.
Say that we have for light,

263
00:19:23,081 --> 00:19:25,980
so you need to take four lights
and four lights for what?

264
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,730
See the corridor light was different too
about from light a bathroom light was

265
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:30,990
very different to our kitchen light.

266
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,810
Why do you need 11 more
light in the bathroom?

267
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,570
You need light for the sake of
having light in the bathroom.

268
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,410
So you can come up with a very small
light of one water or two words.

269
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,520
So we need to give them a
choice of people would say,

270
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,640
are you in the kitchen and in
the dining room at the same time.

271
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,970
So you'd give you four
points with two lights.

272
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:54,380
So when you're done with the cooking you
shift the light to the dining room and

273
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:57,960
it effectively acts like
a full light system.

274
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:03,590
Typical example when uh, when a farmer
came to us and said, we want it,

275
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,160
I want a three light system.

276
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:08,170
And when we designed a three light
system for the farmer, the farmer Rhino,

277
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,110
it said it's too expensive,

278
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,640
but the technician went to his house when
on top of the house broke a part of it

279
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,520
and put one light.
He wanted light in three rooms.

280
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:21,660
He did not need three lights and
certainly solo became affordable

281
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,720
because of the different
segmentation of people,

282
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:32,850
especially the poor. There's no
standardized income generating activities.

283
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,770
Our neighbor might be a midwife. This
side neighbor might be a street render,

284
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,660
the other side neighbor would be a
potato vendor and everybody needs the

285
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,540
different sorts of energy services.

286
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:50,260
Especially the difference here being
that it's between a need and a warrant.

287
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,390
You definitely can standardize.

288
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:57,391
I want you cannot standardize a need
because once you look at basic needs and

289
00:20:57,911 --> 00:21:00,880
everybody's needs are very, very
different. I need to ask off lighting.

290
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,230
Somebody needs for us of lighting,

291
00:21:02,231 --> 00:21:07,231
somebody needs one off lighting from
milking the cow as Selco focus on creating

292
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:10,870
individual solutions.
Business took off. However,

293
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:15,070
it was not always a smooth ride. Since
your success came pressure to expand,

294
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,640
we got ed wise from well known management
gurus that the way you guys are doing

295
00:21:23,561 --> 00:21:28,561
it is not correct and you need
to not own your own centers.

296
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,830
Why you need to create
a lot of other dealers.

297
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:39,010
We went to that and created half the
company to create those dealer models.

298
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:45,210
What happened with that was completely
the mission went for a toss in a sense

299
00:21:46,121 --> 00:21:50,380
that dealer started looking at upper
middle class and high middle class,

300
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:51,880
so the poor,

301
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:56,890
well any left behind and because of that
we nearly got killed because the market

302
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,270
was not so maturely developed for the,

303
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,820
even for the middle class
and upper middle class,

304
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:07,870
the margin levels for what the
dealer's expected were not as high,

305
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,090
so they started tapering down in the
business and we had lots of inventory that

306
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:17,110
we had bought because of these dealers.
We nearly nearly collapsed.

307
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,680
The mission was going for a toss.
The company was going for a toss.

308
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,610
The what we had actually started
with was going into fourth toss.

309
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,360
We feel that the middle class and
upper middle class, anybody else,

310
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:32,170
we'll reach them. They have a choice,
they have a choice to go after things,

311
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,280
but that's no fun. The Fun for us
is at this segmentation and the fun,

312
00:22:36,281 --> 00:22:39,670
frankly speaking is the
barriers that we come across.

313
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,560
No amount of Google search can help
us all that and that is what keeps us

314
00:22:44,561 --> 00:22:49,390
frankly glowing. Even if it takes a lot
of capital, it takes a lot of investment,

315
00:22:49,391 --> 00:22:50,224
a lot of time.

316
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,620
That's the mission of the company
and that's what we want to achieve.

317
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,493
Great.

318
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,070
Okay.
Um,

319
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:08,643
yeah,

320
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:14,580
you had to summarize what was just
said there in 20 words or less,

321
00:23:14,581 --> 00:23:15,414
what would it be?

322
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,990
Okay. Sasha, well,

323
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:25,030
bottom line

324
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,620
company that their mission
is not purely thing.

325
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:28,830
Okay.

326
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:33,300
And now help people who don't talk
bottom line counts to understand what you

327
00:23:33,301 --> 00:23:34,090
just said.

328
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:38,230
Um, so some of you talk about a double
or triple bottom line and then you have

329
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:41,710
people who are looking at social returns
and environmental returns in addition

330
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,510
to purely financial returns.

331
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:48,340
Okay. So to rip, that's
terrific. So heretofore four,

332
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,530
we have talked as if
companies had one bottom line

333
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:58,150
and their net results were correctly
reflected in a profit and loss statement.

334
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:05,890
And what Sasha is suggesting is that a
firm like Selco a or a bank like seawall,

335
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,190
uh,
thinks about more than one bottom line.

336
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,520
And they want to say that some

337
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:23,770
net losses in the financial bottom line,

338
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:25,390
uh,

339
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:30,390
may be balanced and over compensated by
gains in environmental territory or in

340
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,570
social services.

341
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:43,350
So this is capitalized capitalism
hybridized with a nonprofit service sector

342
00:24:49,661 --> 00:24:54,661
institutions and Selco and seawater are
neither of them institutions which would

343
00:24:57,491 --> 00:25:01,630
have been designed if you thought
about just one bottom line,

344
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,300
right? The merit in them, uh,

345
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:12,420
has to be captured in social and
to some extent environmental terms.

346
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,690
Now,
um,

347
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,660
what the what, what's
the market's message, uh,

348
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:28,690
to village India about the availability
of light and electric current for

349
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:36,581
purposes like running a running
small machinery or heating water?

350
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,710
What's the market say?

351
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,820
Yes. This is a case where there's
exactly as economists say,

352
00:25:50,821 --> 00:25:51,930
an equilibrium outcome.

353
00:25:51,931 --> 00:25:55,830
What's somebody's got a hand
up over there are there we are,

354
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:03,150
I mean for the darkness area there's
simply insufficient demand to justify

355
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,960
expanding the infrastructure
of drastically. Okay.
Across much of rural India.

356
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,420
All right, so that's, go ahead.

357
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,480
Adam Smith distinguishes between total
demand and when he called effective

358
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:20,020
demand. Total demand is how many people
put up your hand, put up their hands.

359
00:26:20,021 --> 00:26:23,830
If you say, would you
like electricity? Uh,

360
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:28,240
effective demand is people who would
do that and back it up with money

361
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:34,510
and effect. Effective
demand is very low. Now,

362
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:40,670
not only is it low,
but overcoming it with a grid structure

363
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,200
is inherently difficult because while
there are some customers capable of paying

364
00:26:48,811 --> 00:26:50,670
market rate for grid electricity,

365
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:56,190
the vast majority of customers in many
of these regions are below that income

366
00:26:56,191 --> 00:27:00,780
level and could not
afford any of the above.

367
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,210
In addition to that,

368
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,230
there poverty is reinforced by
the absence of energy supplies,

369
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,240
right?

370
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:14,240
If you don't have the energy supplies
to do small scale production or to

371
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,270
eliminate a market, uh, during, uh,

372
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,590
evening hours or any of a
hundred other such things,

373
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:31,310
the low level of commerce is
kept low by the absence of,

374
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,410
uh,
of efficient energy supplies.

375
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:43,910
So the justification for an enterprise
like this has everything to do with

376
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:50,310
finding a way around the
market equilibrium at zero,

377
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:55,590
uh, which prevails in
some of these places. No,

378
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:04,290
there was another feature
in the film clip. Uh,

379
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:08,250
what's the attitude toward customers?
How does their attitude compare with,

380
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,240
well, let's establish the,
the high end of the scale.

381
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,250
How does Gail do at providing a
choice of courses for you to take

382
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,070
ridiculously well,
right?

383
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,100
A third of Yale courses
have fewer than 10 students

384
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,913
think that,
oh,

385
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,420
imagine that you brought a cost accountant
in here to look at your college.

386
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,610
20% of my brothers and sisters on the
faculty, we'd be looking for a job.

387
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,070
And the enormous wealth of the
institution is what makes this possible.

388
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:54,320
And it's a wonderful thing.
Now,

389
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,110
if you were now,
now go,

390
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:02,710
go back to what's your least favorite
company that you deal with routinely?

391
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,250
Most of you have an unfavorite company.

392
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:13,230
I see a good nod right back
in the six row. Third seat in

393
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,840
my least favorite company
ever is Connecticut Limo.

394
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,043
Okay.

395
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,330
Connecticut Limo Wa there.

396
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:26,164
I ask,

397
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,900
they don't give customers what
they promise. They're always late.

398
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:37,170
They're too expensive and they're mean

399
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:40,690
me. Okay. Anybody else got an

400
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,023
over here?

401
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:46,763
Mcdonald's.

402
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,560
What's your grudge against them?

403
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,990
Uh, many, uh,

404
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:58,800
first how they market to children and uh,

405
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,170
how unhealthy their food is in general.

406
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,240
Okay.
Uh,

407
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,570
how many of you have eaten at Mcdonald's
sometime in the last two weeks?

408
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:13,990
That's a really interesting data.
We're at about 3%.

409
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,130
Okay.

410
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:20,450
I'll bet you are the lowest
Mcdonald's demographic in the country.

411
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,450
Um, okay. But your
objection to Mcdonald's,

412
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:31,530
is it, is it that they don't offer a
wide enough range of, of customizations?

413
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,413
Partly.

414
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:40,460
Okay. I mean, if I were
them, I'd say to you,

415
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:44,840
come on, what's the beef we offer
you? What is it? 2020 sandwiches.

416
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,160
Five breakfast.
Uh,

417
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:53,180
is it one flavor or more or two of
ice cream too? To have ice cream?

418
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:58,400
It's quite a lot. Your beef is
of another nature, isn't it?

419
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,860
That they,
that they popular as unhealthy food.

420
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:06,520
Okay. So you, uh,

421
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,050
and if you were king,

422
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:15,580
would you put them out
of business? Yeah. Okay.

423
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:21,220
Uh, I have a good friend and prominent
faculty colleague named Kelly Brownell.

424
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,250
Kelly Brownell visible to all of you.

425
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:29,610
Some of you round now is the
leading advocate of the fat tax.

426
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,700
He himself is a big guy actually,

427
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:40,620
but he wants to tach restaurant fat so
that there would be an excise tax on the

428
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:48,031
big Mac of three or four bucks because
it is just one huge blob of cholesterol.

429
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:53,690
Um, but we're off topic here. Uh,

430
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,140
the least favorite,

431
00:31:56,890 --> 00:32:01,300
my least favorites are several airlines,
uh,

432
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:06,450
and providers of Internet service
and providers of a television signal

433
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,780
and it's because they're rigid.

434
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:16,590
Their business strategy strategy involves
a rigid interface with customers and

435
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,710
the Delta shuttle between
here and Washington, brutal,

436
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,690
just brutal the way they do it and that,

437
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,040
and there's a reason for that.

438
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,250
It's not just because they're bad
people or not even bad people.

439
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:36,330
It's because there are huge economies
in not listening to the details of what

440
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:38,314
people want.

441
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:42,680
Do want a ticket on the shuttle or do
you not want a ticket on the shuttle?

442
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:47,930
It will leave at age 70,
full stop end of conversation.

443
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,300
And it isn't even actually a conversation.

444
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:55,301
It is an interplay with a website
and the website is often Kludgy,

445
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,550
uninformative and so on.

446
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,110
But in a cost benefit ratio
from their point of view,

447
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:05,580
it works really well.
So when,

448
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:09,920
when you look at Selco the first,

449
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:13,730
my first impulse would be to say simplify,

450
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,010
don't customize.

451
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:21,730
Get one product that you can generate
at much lower costs and stay with it.

452
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:24,940
Okay.

453
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,140
Uh,
remember,

454
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:31,170
remember how in the dialogue in the film
clip and in the case he talks about one

455
00:33:31,961 --> 00:33:33,460
size fits all,
doesn't work.

456
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:39,660
And what he means is that people who
can barely afford this equipment are

457
00:33:42,761 --> 00:33:46,900
inclined to take it only if you match
it very well with their preferences.

458
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,263
Now

459
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:54,350
is that is somebody defense?
Selco please.

460
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,440
They're highly defendable.

461
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:58,741
I mean,

462
00:33:58,741 --> 00:34:02,980
I guess this goes back to the bottom line
we talked about and where cell phones

463
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:06,720
cys not just a for profit bottom line.
They really want to help people in.

464
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,530
That comes up along the case where in
the end they talked that about what the

465
00:34:10,531 --> 00:34:14,820
name of them manager Silka is that he
really wanted to help these people and

466
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,510
unless he tries to at least to
some extent customize as products,

467
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,490
you won't be able to help as
many people as you'd like.

468
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,210
Okay. That's good. And
hand the mic on here,

469
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,440
it's also sort of about
growing the market, right?

470
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:32,150
Because if you provide a customized
solution, just say, um, you know, uh, uh,

471
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:36,290
a street vendor and that vendor is able
to, you know, like this storefront,

472
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,150
make more money and maybe in the future
when he's adding another side to his

473
00:34:41,151 --> 00:34:44,660
store for it to come back to you
and you know, by the full package.

474
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,090
Okay.
So there is a,

475
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:51,650
there's a sort of multiplier effect when
in the, on the commercial side of this,

476
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:55,920
you've customized it correctly. Now, um,

477
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:03,340
the major issue in the background
here is what's the size of this market

478
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:06,410
worldwide ballpark,

479
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,580
somewhere around a billion.

480
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,110
So they're a hell of a lot
of customers out there.

481
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:17,403
And

482
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,073
the,

483
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:24,880
and if that's so scalability
as it's called becomes,

484
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:28,870
uh,
a pressing question for a firm like Selco

485
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,543
and

486
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:36,670
scalability would mean that you could

487
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:43,470
drive your costs low enough and,
uh,

488
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:48,530
develop your distribution system strongly
enough that you can reach vastly more.

489
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:52,980
You know, there they are.
When the case is written,

490
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,010
they're still well under 10,000 households

491
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:01,710
and at well under 10,000 households.
This is an experiment,

492
00:36:01,711 --> 00:36:02,940
a noble experiment,

493
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:06,900
but merely that it is a
demonstration project.

494
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,730
Now,
um,

495
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,690
a background fact about them,
which isn't in the case is this,

496
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,890
I had lunch today with
a Yale college alum, uh,

497
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:27,080
who worked last year for an Indian
company that manufacturers equipment like

498
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:32,541
this GWP and GWP assigned her the task
of finding a sales relationship with cell

499
00:36:41,161 --> 00:36:41,994
cub.

500
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:47,360
So she spent a year working with
Selco trying to sell them a high,

501
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:53,160
high quality but completely
standardized system.

502
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,250
Okay.

503
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:59,720
That wa that was designed
to achieve scale economies.

504
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,613
And

505
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,870
her experience was entirely frustrating

506
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:10,310
because Selco ultimately,

507
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:16,130
ultimately wasn't interested
in achieving scale.

508
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:22,390
They were interested in serving the
immediate customer base in front of them.

509
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:30,050
Okay. What does that mean? I think it
means that Selco is a service company,

510
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:34,640
uh, and is destined to
remain a very small one.

511
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,373
Now,

512
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,090
in the case there's, in, in the B case,

513
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:46,450
there's some discussion about
they're a not for profit financing.

514
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:51,170
They may remember the amount
of financing they have

515
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:58,410
no, no reason. You should $462,000,

516
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:03,390
which isn't an is it a
monumental? Some, uh, but it's,

517
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:06,900
it's a pretty hefty sum if you're
talking about a few thousand customers

518
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:13,080
and the rhetoric in the bks is no,
no,

519
00:38:13,081 --> 00:38:18,081
we're going to get to 300,000 customers
and the unit costs will be a dollar and

520
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:22,170
change per customer serve.

521
00:38:22,171 --> 00:38:25,410
The subsidy will be that small.

522
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,340
Well, I actually don't think
they're going to get there.

523
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:34,770
I don't think it can be done
with this level of customization.

524
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:40,690
Okay. So now the task is each of
you as a management consultant. No.

525
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:47,670
And you're brought in by the
board of the funder for Selco.

526
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:49,580
Okay.

527
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:52,250
And you've got to figure
out how to take the,

528
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,180
take the baby out of the bath water,

529
00:38:56,181 --> 00:38:59,630
get rid of the bath water and
come up with something scalable.

530
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,120
How would you go about that?

531
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:06,563
Anybody got a thought?

532
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,850
Where did we fire management or not?

533
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,290
Oh, over at uh, yes.

534
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:21,750
First I would try to get them to stop
being dependent on one geographic area.

535
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:26,020
It seems like they really concentrated
between Bangalore and I think it was, um,

536
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,270
Dubai.
Yes.

537
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:31,890
And like clearly there are a lot of poor
regions in India and once they get out

538
00:39:31,891 --> 00:39:33,660
of those,
that specific region,

539
00:39:33,661 --> 00:39:36,630
I'm pretty sure there'll be forced
to look at it a bit differently.

540
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:41,400
Okay. So let me, let me see
if I understood that. Uh,

541
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,620
do you want them to move
into higher income groups?

542
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:47,420
No. Okay. I want them to
go to another poor region.

543
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:50,720
Okay. You want them to go to another
poor neighborhood and do what?

544
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:54,400
And clearly by seeing that there are like,

545
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:58,300
since there are so many different cultures
within India and so many different

546
00:39:58,301 --> 00:40:01,180
needs, if they continue this model
of customization, they will see,

547
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:04,600
they will ultimately fail and they need
to start moving into something else.

548
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:09,090
Okay. Um, I'm going to
pretend to be another person,

549
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,240
a person on the board lot.

550
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:14,730
We've already figured out these guys
are running straight into a dead end.

551
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:19,410
I'm impatient. You're all you're going
to do is demonstrate failure again.

552
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:22,530
Find me a better solution

553
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:25,603
now.

554
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,860
Anybody think,
think they've got one?

555
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,130
Yes,
it's far back.

556
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,800
Uh, yeah. I just figured out, um,
a couple of cell coast products,

557
00:40:39,801 --> 00:40:44,060
a couple of their best products that
numerically meet the needs of the most

558
00:40:44,061 --> 00:40:48,050
number of people. And then I would
expand by pushing those products.

559
00:40:48,051 --> 00:40:52,790
And of course in the process you'd lose
out on customization and individual

560
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:53,361
solutions.

561
00:40:53,361 --> 00:40:57,290
But if your goal is to
provide illumination to the
maximum number of people,

562
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:59,170
just kind of focus on
what you're good at it,

563
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,710
it's focused on a few product.

564
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:07,600
Sounds like a good idea. Now,
what about people who are,

565
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,110
you remember there's talk
in the case about a pyramid,

566
00:41:10,111 --> 00:41:14,730
there's even a picture of a pyramid and
we're talking about serving people near

567
00:41:14,731 --> 00:41:16,770
the bottom of the pyramid economically.

568
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:21,930
Is there a way that you might think
about serving people at the bottom of the

569
00:41:21,931 --> 00:41:25,220
pyramid by all sort of serving people a,

570
00:41:25,221 --> 00:41:27,750
a layer or two above them in the pyramid?

571
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,013
Yes.

572
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:40,600
If you can charge the people a little
bit higher up on the pyramid more

573
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,640
well the systems they can subsidize.
Yeah.

574
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:47,070
Okay. So if you can take off, take a,

575
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:50,280
you probably have to have the
product differentiated a little bit.

576
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:55,620
If you produce a higher
margin product, uh, which is,

577
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,740
uh,
very similar to your,

578
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:03,850
your straight product and build a
distribution channel in so that the same

579
00:42:07,021 --> 00:42:12,021
distributors can cover the higher margin
product and also the low margin product

580
00:42:14,311 --> 00:42:19,140
for the people at the bottom
of the pyramid and achieved
some scale economies so

581
00:42:19,141 --> 00:42:24,141
that you begin to make
the pump run on its own.

582
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,103
MMM.

583
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:32,650
And there and in the, the video clip
we just watched, they talk about how,

584
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:37,090
uh, when they let distributors
do what they want it,

585
00:42:37,091 --> 00:42:41,860
the distributors ended up drifting
into higher income straight up. Right.

586
00:42:41,861 --> 00:42:46,861
And that's not very surprising because
the margins can be much higher right in

587
00:42:47,771 --> 00:42:52,600
the bottom, the bottom channel, unless
you get the thing very standardized,

588
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,390
uh, the margins have to be negative
because people just can't afford her.

589
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:02,810
So high customization at the very bottom,
it looks like a highly problematic, uh,

590
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:05,740
strategy inspiring as it may be.

591
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:07,773
MMM.

592
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,490
Is there,

593
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:19,360
are there other lines of
production unrelated to
electricity that strikes you as

594
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,020
interestingly analogous to this?
For example,

595
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:32,770
let's say the nub of this
idea is distributed production
instead of centralized

596
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:36,320
grid production, we're
doing distributed, electric,

597
00:43:36,321 --> 00:43:38,120
productive production of electricity.

598
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,700
Just as we have distributed
computing on all these laptops.

599
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:46,340
Are there other,
uh,

600
00:43:46,341 --> 00:43:51,341
highly distributed strategies that
might be of service in bottom billion

601
00:43:51,771 --> 00:43:52,604
countries?

602
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:57,493
Okay.

603
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:02,660
Okay. Um, talk, say more. Uh,

604
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:08,080
you could distribute mobile phones
instead of, you know, building a,

605
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:10,280
a land line. Okay. It,

606
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:15,190
has anybody thought of that yet?
I'm sure. Yeah. Well big time,

607
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,251
right? I mean, and the,

608
00:44:16,251 --> 00:44:21,251
the story here is landlines
become completely saturate
the market and then cell

609
00:44:21,971 --> 00:44:26,971
phones are a layer on top of that in
all the countries we'll be talking about

610
00:44:27,911 --> 00:44:32,180
with the bottom billion, uh,
cell phones just over landlines,

611
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,833
right?
Yeah.

612
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:39,380
And are technologically superior to land
lines for all from almost every point

613
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:44,140
of view and a very low income settings.
So that's a,

614
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:48,010
that's a good suggestion. Any other
occurred? Anyone? Okay. Jennifer?

615
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,790
Water purification.
Okay. Water purification.

616
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:57,030
And the technology there is,
well how do you do it?

617
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,390
Well, instead of running pipes to
transport clean water to remote places,

618
00:45:02,391 --> 00:45:06,710
you could just build their own
filters or dig their own wells.

619
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:10,090
Okay. You could build your own
filters, dig your own wells,

620
00:45:10,091 --> 00:45:15,091
might or might not work depending on
the water table's depth and quality.

621
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,930
Um, but yes, it's a very good point,

622
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:23,500
right at the end of the semester
we'll see occasion, Bolivia,

623
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:26,880
Cochabamba Bolivia where um,

624
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:33,060
we try to fix a water supply system using
straight capitalist technique and get

625
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:39,480
into a lot of trouble. And we get into
a lot of trouble for it before the,

626
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:44,570
basically because the pricing model for
the capitalist to make money leads to

627
00:45:46,081 --> 00:45:51,081
too high a price for people who
are right at the bottom of Bolivia.

628
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:52,350
Bolivia is pyramid,

629
00:45:52,351 --> 00:45:56,100
which is not very different from India's
pyramid except it's got a lot less

630
00:45:56,101 --> 00:46:00,420
growth in it. Thank you.
Anybody else got one?

631
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,410
Um, fighting malaria for example,
you could focus on like big projects,

632
00:46:08,411 --> 00:46:12,770
you alter the landscape like draining
swamps versus just giving people like

633
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:14,480
mosquito nets in their own homes.

634
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:19,470
Okay. And the gates was
agree with you, right?

635
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:23,220
Uh,
and are throwing Belgians pattern.

636
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:25,430
And uh,

637
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:30,530
in general there was this whole family
of models for multiple bottom line

638
00:46:32,611 --> 00:46:36,840
businesses and some natural
not so multiple bottom lines.

639
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:41,841
So straight out for profit businesses
were having decentralized production.

640
00:46:42,691 --> 00:46:43,524
Sure.

641
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:48,510
As in shellcodes equipment
is a terrifically valuable,

642
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,920
uh, asset, no for Monday,

643
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:54,780
uh,

644
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:59,780
the main metric that is used in the
world for progress and what defines the

645
00:47:01,981 --> 00:47:06,630
bottom billion as bottom
billion is GDP per capita.

646
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:13,020
And in my part of Monday's class,
which I'm about to record,

647
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:17,910
I'm going to pick APP.
I'm going to start with the proposition,

648
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:21,660
maximize GDP per capita,
and make our country better.

649
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,030
And Paul Cod, you're more or less
advocates that in the bottom Belgium.

650
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:31,150
And I'm,
I'm sympathetic to that view,

651
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:37,110
but I'll set up sub critical screens
to pass it through and explain those.

652
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,540
Uh, and you'll, you'll see that video
at the beginning of class on Monday.

653
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,760
And then after my little video,

654
00:47:45,761 --> 00:47:50,761
there is a Ted talk by Paul Collier
explaining what he thinks his book has to

655
00:47:52,031 --> 00:47:52,390
offer.
