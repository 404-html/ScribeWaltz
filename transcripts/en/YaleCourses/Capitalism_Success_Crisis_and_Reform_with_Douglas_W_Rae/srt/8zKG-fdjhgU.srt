1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,620
Okay,
let's get started

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:12,630
in your current movie over
the break that Goldman Sachs

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,710
get some bad press.
Is there,

4
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,780
is that, has anybody read
the beach in rolling stone?

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,350
Okay.
Okay.

6
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,990
We're good at the end mark.

7
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,020
Yeah. I'm Matt [inaudible]
Goldman Sachs a, um,

8
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,810
and I did this go wrong. It's something
along the lines of a grade. Bam.

9
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:52,740
Higher Squid were, that was the jammy.
It's anything that smells like money.

10
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,080
I think that's an exact quote.
Yeah,

11
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,150
we should try that out on power.

12
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,370
It also reminds me of a
passage in Richard Posner,

13
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:09,810
Xbox,
uh,

14
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,880
to the effect that we can no more blame
the financiers or the record of the

15
00:01:16,481 --> 00:01:17,440
credit markets,

16
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,850
then we could blame a
lion freaking a zebra.

17
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,670
And
there's an odd,

18
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,240
this continuity here.

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,370
When you look at Goldman Sachs internally,
uh,

20
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,930
through the eyes of one of
its very senior partner,

21
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,680
uh,
the ethical component is big.

22
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,600
There's a huge component about,
uh,

23
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,670
integrity and meeting one's obligations
and delivering the highest quality

24
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,210
product on the market.
Uh,

25
00:02:01,211 --> 00:02:02,670
and at the same time,

26
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,930
Goldman is vulnerable to the view that
if tour in order to advantage of the tax

27
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:17,190
payers in a recent debacle,

28
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,540
now how would they defend themselves?

29
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,870
They would say one thing they would say
is we didn't want to pick the money.

30
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,920
Hey Paulson and told us
we had to take the money.

31
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,320
But because the stigma which
would otherwise fall on the bank,

32
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,340
which you talked to,
the money

33
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,980
would cause further
disruption and meltdown.

34
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,960
That's one thing they would
say. Um, another thing,

35
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,620
well, if you noticed what they're doing,
the in the way of charitable activities,

36
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:57,940
just lightly, everybody notice, uh,

37
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,390
announcement $500 million.

38
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,470
It helped to 10,000 small businesses.

39
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,920
Uh, does that strike you as a
big gesture or a little desk

40
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,650
tell?
What do you call or anything?

41
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,560
Oh, has it, what percent
of their revenues,

42
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,930
profits or even just at an APM bonuses
every year? I would say that's very little

43
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,400
gesture. The very little gesture. I agree.

44
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,130
From a public relations point of view,
if they multiplied it by 10,

45
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,440
so it's 5 billion,

46
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,870
would it do the more good them?
Not the world,

47
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,440
not the country down

48
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,880
where zero's probably make, I've made
a difference in how the Canadian, um,

49
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,420
but I don't know if it
would believing up for

50
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,400
a cost consciousness.

51
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,131
Okay.

52
00:04:07,131 --> 00:04:12,131
So my own intuition is that it
wouldn't do them a lot of good

53
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,870
that the public doesn't
think quantitative way.

54
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,860
Some opinion leaders do,
but most people,

55
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:26,861
500 million sounds like an awful lot of
money and 5 billion doesn't sound like

56
00:04:26,991 --> 00:04:30,860
10 times as much. Uh,
so there are probably,

57
00:04:30,861 --> 00:04:34,340
they're probably not far off in the
number they chose if the [inaudible] is

58
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:38,810
public probation's,
which I think it is. Uh,

59
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,700
how many are there people here who think
that the government ought to compel

60
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:48,701
them to give back a bigger chunk of
capital to put it out there in some

61
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,940
charitable way or give it
back to the tax payers?

62
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,370
Maybe anybody have that view

63
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,760
and, okay, so, so you're unanimous,
which is rare birth this size.

64
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,050
Uh,

65
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:14,050
does that mean that you think there's
no ought to it or does it mean,

66
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,310
so that the process by which
the government would do
that strikes you as not a

67
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:20,144
good one?

68
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,100
Who's got to rescue me here guys,
I'm drowning.

69
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,990
There's a big difference between
what we should do. They can make you,

70
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,080
I don't think that there's any of using
virtual patients should be forced,

71
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:42,640
you know, each charity unless
it's like a ad hoc tasks are,

72
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,870
and then we applied to them and
that seems like a little teenager.

73
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,650
Okay.
So if,

74
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,680
if probably would violate the constitution
if we created the Goldman Sachs

75
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,370
recognition act.
Um,

76
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,073
I agree with that.

77
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,160
So we're coming to the end of the course
and what I want to do is today to add

78
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:10,790
one more case,

79
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,660
one which allows us to look at
the interface between capital,

80
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:23,190
the environment and government in the Txu,

81
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,813
EDF,

82
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:30,510
a case which you've all looked at and
which is structured so that you could

83
00:06:32,321 --> 00:06:35,850
invest a whole week if you
were willing to trace outs,

84
00:06:35,851 --> 00:06:39,180
temporary strand in the, in the, uh,

85
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,290
a web page.

86
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,970
And then on Wednesday I'm going to do
a read a recap of the course as if on a

87
00:06:49,961 --> 00:06:52,670
motorcycle,
uh,

88
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,280
and finish with a shell.
Cool case.

89
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,880
Quick will form the basis for your final
exam as shy and sensitive to account

90
00:07:05,651 --> 00:07:07,270
for 70% of the final.

91
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:13,620
I'm sure we'll have a hundred percent
attendance during the last 20 minutes of

92
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:18,520
class. And, uh, I'll, I'll
get, I'll give you the,

93
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,140
give me the, the reading assignment
and advantage. It is the,

94
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,830
uh, leasing the rain. It's the, the,

95
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,270
the reading is the William Finnegan
piece from the New Yorker about the

96
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:36,271
privatization of the water
supply of Cochabamba Bolivia,

97
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,440
a by an American corporation
known as Bechtel. Uh,

98
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,340
and the essay question,

99
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:50,860
all the formula at the end of class
Wednesday asks you to work through that

100
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:55,861
story and as somebody who has learned
something about capitalism in this course.

101
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,533
Yeah.

102
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:02,770
Okay. So now marrying the devil. And

103
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,920
the
well,

104
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,580
difficulty with this
case is that it's full,

105
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,320
full backgrounds and I,

106
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,660
these are the most important or most
immediately important of the acronyms.

107
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,770
And,
um,

108
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:27,160
can anybody here quickly recite the
full lane of every one of these?

109
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,030
Who wants to be a show off?

110
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,380
I'm sure there are 50 people
who can do it in this room.

111
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,850
Okay.
I'll,

112
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,310
let's put them into three bins.
Um,

113
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,540
this is the most obscure
Texas climate initiative.

114
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,330
Uh,
and Jim Marsden,

115
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,110
who is a video star of the case,

116
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,890
is president of that.
Uh,

117
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:09,180
and he is the regional head of EDF,

118
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,240
the Environmental Defense Fund for Texas
a and the natural resources defense

119
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:21,150
council is a,

120
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:26,310
is parallel to the EDF,
a little harder edge,

121
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:32,290
uh, and important, oops. Can't, yeah.

122
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,143
Here we go.

123
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,830
Then in the gray box in the middle,

124
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,860
we have the target firms in
the private equity takeover.

125
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:49,350
Uh, it's just one for
a really, it's Txu. Uh,

126
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:54,410
but the focus strategically is on
Txu plus it is on the expanded,

127
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,810
uh, generation capacity
that Txu has announced.

128
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:09,830
And that expanded generation
capacity is on the lower edge.

129
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,300
From an environmental point of view.

130
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,800
It relies on conventional technology,
which no one thing,

131
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,920
no one thought at the time was the
best available technology for coal fire

132
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:30,220
generation of electric current.
Uh,

133
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,310
and while we're at it,

134
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,550
the parts of a,

135
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,580
an electric utility company are three
generation transmission and sales or

136
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:42,930
distribution.

137
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:48,710
Transmission is the long lines and
distribution is the last mile of lines and

138
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,120
the financial connection,

139
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:57,420
the contractual connection
with the customer.

140
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,610
I then on the right,

141
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:05,990
we've got KKR and TPG
and these are both large,

142
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,680
uh, and uh, very aggressive.

143
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,340
Uh,
private equity firms.

144
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,390
KKR is most famous or the,
uh,

145
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,310
the Reynolds' Nabisco, Rjr Nabisco, uh,

146
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,770
uh,
takeover,

147
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:33,890
which is characterized at length in our
variants of the gate and Texas Pacific.

148
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:37,800
Uh,

149
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,800
is actually the more interesting of the
two from the point of view of this case

150
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,800
or any,
anybody snap to a,

151
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,540
an obvious conclusion about
the difference between the two.

152
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,740
Okay.
We'll draw it out in a few minutes.

153
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:02,390
The TXU expansion,
uh,

154
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,650
8,600 megawatts added.

155
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,800
That's a just under 50% incremental to
the firm's total generating capacity.

156
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,293
Uh,

157
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,490
10 or $11 billion in cost.
Uh,

158
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:25,550
somewhere between half
1,000,000,002 billion of that
are budgeted to controls of

159
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:30,684
pollution.

160
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:36,530
And it's pretty murky in the case and
pretty murky in fact just how much it

161
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:41,790
would cost. How much of the capital
can be construed as pollution control.

162
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,590
Uh,
they promised a 20% cut any missions.

163
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,270
What do they mean by that?

164
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,980
Who thought that one
through 20% cut of emotions,

165
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,880
we're going to add 47% of our total
generating capacity and we're going to cut

166
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:05,130
emissions by 20%.
What exactly is the claim?

167
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,520
Does it meet?
Yes.

168
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,230
I'm not sure what TXU problems exactly,
but there are two ways you can do that.

169
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:21,260
You can artificially Nicu my carbon
credits or reduce your emissions intensity

170
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,413
on paper.

171
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:26,970
You can also retrofit
some coal plants and see,

172
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:31,380
um, so that emissions are kind
of sequestered from the ground.

173
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,450
Like there are certain
technologies allow you to do that.

174
00:13:33,451 --> 00:13:34,830
So that's some ways you can cut it.

175
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,340
Okay.
Um,

176
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,060
those are both valid points,

177
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:45,090
but I'm still a little unclear about how
much salt is going to come out the end

178
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:48,070
of the pipe.
Yes,

179
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:49,983
I use,

180
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:54,990
I guess a of potential difference is
whether the 20% caught to Sam's little

181
00:13:55,210 --> 00:14:00,130
missions or are generated.

182
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,050
So it was pretty unique generated there
would still be a larger percentage of

183
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,660
mission slowed would be less per unit.

184
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,220
Yeah.

185
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:14,220
I think it has to be a norm to in that
way it has to be a unit rate of emission

186
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,380
so that these planets are on average
quite a lot better than the old plants.

187
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,260
Uh,
those still not state of the art.

188
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,840
And the claim is that we're
going to drive the anger,

189
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:30,020
good emission rate per mega watt,
uh,

190
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,510
down by 20%. Uh, they're using old sites.

191
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,600
They plan to use the old sites
where they've already got a plan.

192
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,140
Anybody figure out why they
would say a thing like that?

193
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:45,843
Well,

194
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,500
yes Tom,
if you're building a new site,

195
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:56,430
it requires a lot more
regulatory approval. Greenfield,

196
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,820
Greenfield site, and you've got
a whole round of permitting. Uh,

197
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:03,590
and there are a couple
of other advantages.

198
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:08,180
One is that the up nimby politics,

199
00:15:08,181 --> 00:15:12,200
not in my backyard,
politics are over in those areas.

200
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:17,420
You've already been through it. And if
you can come back to people and say,

201
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,410
this is a less disruptive
plant than the old one,

202
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,850
uh, that's a pretty good start. A,

203
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:29,150
and even if people aren't
much taken by that,

204
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,830
if you've been,
if the management has been intelligent,

205
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,090
they will have built a network
of local relationships,

206
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,460
which they would have to build a
new on a Greenfield site. Finally,

207
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:48,461
there's an infrastructure reason that
the transmission lines required to

208
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:55,270
transport the current produced a will
already be in place and that's both an

209
00:15:57,321 --> 00:16:00,590
economic and a political plus a.

210
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:05,590
And then at the end of this they throw
in a 10% discount to their customers and

211
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,150
that discount is a nonsequitor
in the environmental discussion.

212
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:12,410
Uh,

213
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:17,410
but it's not a non sequitur in the actual
case because Txu is in trouble on to

214
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:22,970
political fronts at once.
It is a monopoly,

215
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,330
a seller of current,

216
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,750
and it has,
it is,

217
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:34,870
it has wired the state of Texas
politically and there is a populous revolt

218
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:37,820
against that.

219
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:43,870
And the populist revolt takes the form
of criticizing the ultimate pricing,

220
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,030
uh, at the household level. Now,

221
00:16:50,031 --> 00:16:52,550
if we look at the case from Austin,
Texas,

222
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:57,560
we've got all these small things upper
right that our federal government,

223
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,720
uh,

224
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,720
and we've got all these big things
locally that are state politics and

225
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:07,520
government.
I,

226
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,540
you've got Texas state government where,
how,

227
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,530
how CXU doing with Governor
Perry during all this.

228
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,040
Is Perry a populous to
wants to beat up on them?

229
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,140
Now they own parent,

230
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:28,370
I've may overstate alone,
but they pretty much own governor Perry.

231
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,833
Uh,

232
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:35,650
the Texas business for clean air is a
not altogether surprising alliance of

233
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:41,450
business groups, uh, which, uh,

234
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,870
are opposed to Txu on this,

235
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:50,220
on environmental grounds, sometimes
for self-serving business reasons.

236
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:54,150
And other times I think because it's
what senior management thinks is right.

237
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,250
Uh, you've got Texans for
public. Josh does, and they're,

238
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,870
they're not so much about the
environment as about the rate.

239
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:09,400
Uh, you've got a state senator
named Troy Frazier who is, uh,

240
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:14,420
making a name for himself statewide by
attacking Txu on mostly on the rate side,

241
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:24,300
but he's also willing to take
up the environmental side. Uh,

242
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:28,740
you've got the Texas climate initiative
and EDF, which are closely or twine.

243
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:32,890
And the personality of Jim Marsden.
Uh,

244
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,730
what do you think of Martha? You, if
you went all the way through the case,

245
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:37,350
you hurt him,
I don't know,

246
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:41,700
five or seven times in
video seem like enable guy

247
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,150
a thumbs up if you think that

248
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,860
bounce down if you're
going to pay it back.

249
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:59,860
Hmm. We've got 95 abstentions. Yeah.

250
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,713
MMM.

251
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,280
Usually label guy.
He's a very able guy.

252
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,903
Uh,

253
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,500
but he is, he is a, uh,

254
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,130
he has a very soft style of argument.
Right.

255
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:23,040
And he never seemed to
be a jump ahead of you.

256
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:28,041
And the argument is always in a very
laid back way asking your opinion,

257
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,920
uh, as if he hadn't really figured
out where you wanted to go.

258
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:37,710
And that may be partly for our benefit
because he was working for the school of

259
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:40,290
management in preparing for the case.

260
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,920
But it's also probably
part of his natural style

261
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,320
puct public utility
commission of Texas and Texas

262
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:05,070
Commission on environmental quality.
I almost missed that one myself.

263
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:10,670
These are the two principal regulatory
bodies and the case and the Association

264
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:14,580
of electric companies of Texas.
You can imagine who they are.

265
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:19,970
And what [inaudible] role
is, it's a classic, uh,

266
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,690
Interest Association.

267
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,360
And then you've got popular.

268
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:30,810
Cool.

269
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,540
We're out here today as part
of a national day of action.

270
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:37,420
Target and Merrill Lynch
for backing TX shoes,

271
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,030
dirty coal plants,

272
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:42,520
poor profits, Morocco,
Asma, global warming.

273
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,663
Oh,

274
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:01,750
in cities like New York, Boston, San
Francisco, Washington, DC, Los Angeles.

275
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,560
And of course Houston.
Yeah,

276
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:17,670
we want Tia cue to stop this wrong headed
plan to build 11 new coal fire power

277
00:21:17,671 --> 00:21:20,760
plants in Texas. We want
the banks, Morgan Stanley,

278
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,940
Merrill Lynch and Citibank
to scuttle the deal.

279
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,890
Deliver this letter or I'm
in the barrels is a letter

280
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,980
to Merrill Lynch knows best dirty

281
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:18,100
coal,
but they don't seem to

282
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,390
say we'll take the house but

283
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:33,390
I have an appointment.
Thirdly,

284
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,270
rehabbing appointment, we
have an appointment. Cheryl,

285
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:42,300
you and our relationship with
Merrill Lynch is quite tight.

286
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,003
Yep.

287
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,400
Okay.
So

288
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,870
did you guys ever done
in protest of that type

289
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,070
and you just don't look
like street theater times?

290
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:08,750
Do you think that's a factor?
You're shaking your head.

291
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,780
Okay. And I think there are
two sides to the question.

292
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,340
Let's start in the negative here.

293
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,640
I mean,
I just feel as though it's not in.

294
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,920
So we get the companies to change their
positions generally. So I mean, yes,

295
00:23:24,921 --> 00:23:29,700
it might serve a little public
disapproval for a couple of days with this

296
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,490
machine.

297
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:31,001
Okay.

298
00:23:31,001 --> 00:23:36,001
So as a direct strategy for changing
the Bader of companies goes nowhere.

299
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,753
We agree.

300
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,920
Is there any other way in which it might
be of service to the cause these are

301
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:46,154
pursuing

302
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,283
here and then

303
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,230
did you can get coverage on it.

304
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:58,290
It tends to have a more dramatic effect
on politics and yet I was working on a

305
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,240
political campaign where
you sell something that was
smart enough pay shine in

306
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,630
the Washington Post.
Um,

307
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:09,340
and so I know this from personal
experience that that uh,

308
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,990
it does have the potential,

309
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:15,991
probably not to effect the direct
response to the people are falling out,

310
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,490
but that they're a Margaret Ish.

311
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:27,100
Okay.
So the clear the media are the,

312
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:32,310
are the target and then who would we
most likely influenced with this sort of

313
00:24:33,911 --> 00:24:37,210
thing.
Anybody want to elaborate further?

314
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,440
Yes,
Sasha.

315
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,910
What companies really worry about,

316
00:24:44,911 --> 00:24:49,380
his other clients are going to be
sensitive to the native grass and changed

317
00:24:49,381 --> 00:24:50,214
companies.

318
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,590
Absolutely.
That's okay.

319
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:59,100
Txu customer voter base is a part of this
and both of those nouns are important

320
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:03,670
in it.

321
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:08,670
They are both voters and customers and
they may not have many places to go as

322
00:25:09,431 --> 00:25:12,430
customers,
but as voters,

323
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:17,790
the perception within regulatory
and legislative groups in Boston,

324
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:24,250
would it be, uh, an
important consideration?

325
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:29,940
I personally don't think that this kind
of demonstration is hugely effective,

326
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:36,900
but it does kind of raise the temperature
of the issue and make it salient to

327
00:25:37,901 --> 00:25:42,310
decision makers in
government. Now, in all the,

328
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:47,020
if we switched from Austin
to Washington, uh, the,

329
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,870
the actors get deaf get,
get to be different.

330
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:54,930
And the EPA and the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission,

331
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:57,683
uh,

332
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,700
and the key people in Congress
slide Henry Waxman or,

333
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,600
uh, Senator Bingaman and boxer, uh,

334
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:11,110
become big players and the EDF and the,
uh,

335
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,370
and our, uh, RBF, um,

336
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:19,680
national resource defense
funds become a well staffed.

337
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:24,870
They would each have 50 or so staff
people in Washington and become a major

338
00:26:26,801 --> 00:26:27,634
presence.

339
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:33,330
And the question in front
of a Kkr and Texas Pacific,

340
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,810
a hindrance on why do,
why do they,

341
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,990
why are they messing around with
all these environmental groups,

342
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,290
which sounded like from a
purely economic point of view,

343
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:53,280
to be a waste of time. And yes, from a,

344
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:58,230
from an entirely rational economic
point of view, it isn't a waste of time.

345
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,593
Why not?

346
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:10,490
Well, let's look. Let's go to Wall
Street. The private equity business.

347
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,900
In 2007,

348
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:17,770
there were 794 a large private
equity transactions during that year,

349
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:26,010
uh, adding up to about 800 billion. So
they average about a billion of peace,

350
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,450
uh,
explosive growth.

351
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,990
They're up about a 400 and 450,

352
00:27:32,991 --> 00:27:37,410
500% from 2000 to 2007.

353
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:43,150
Uh, and it's a period when capital
is abundant and cheap. So the,

354
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,670
the, it is in every sense, boom.

355
00:27:46,671 --> 00:27:49,490
Time for private equity.

356
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:53,800
The,
um,

357
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,690
you've got

358
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,910
three sets of players as
seen from Wall Street.

359
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:04,750
You've got the private equity
firms, the target firms, uh,

360
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,330
and the business services organizations,
mainly investment banks,

361
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:14,340
which catalyzed a
transactions of this kind.

362
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:20,330
And the takeover of Txu is a mega deal.

363
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:27,210
It is the biggest transaction of its kind,

364
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:34,820
so it gets a lot of attention
and offers to be very profitable.

365
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,263
The

366
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:44,610
institutional investors showing up or
left in the blue box are limited partners

367
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:53,490
in the funds created by organizations
like Kkr and Texas Pacific.

368
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,570
And from their point of view,

369
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:02,960
this is one of the highest yielding,
uh,

370
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:07,640
asset classes in their portfolio.
Uh,

371
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:11,750
and David Swensen for example of Yale.
Uh,

372
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:17,710
one of the things he did with the Yale
portfolio which made it grow so much

373
00:29:17,711 --> 00:29:22,510
faster after he came then and had grown
at anytime in the university's history

374
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:28,230
was to shift a great deal of capital
away from publicly traded securities into

375
00:29:29,771 --> 00:29:34,180
private Equity Funds,
which uh, which differ,

376
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,660
they defer the biggest difference between,
um,

377
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,810
how well best companies do,

378
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,840
would it stocks and bonds on the one side
and private equity on the other is the

379
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:54,421
difference between the smart money
and average money in the stock market.

380
00:29:55,690 --> 00:30:00,310
The difference between very smart
money and fairly dumb money is a few

381
00:30:00,311 --> 00:30:01,480
percentage points.

382
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,880
The difference in private equity between
the smartest money and fairly dumb

383
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:11,590
bunny is enormous. And so if, uh,

384
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:16,450
if a, a, an institutional
investor by Gail Harvard, uh,

385
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,480
or the big pension funds can get
into private equity with smart money,

386
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,800
hire smart management,
uh,

387
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:30,970
invest with people like
Texas Pacific and Kkr,

388
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:36,210
the opportunity to, uh, beat
the market in a big way, uh,

389
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,160
is a very right one.
And

390
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:44,290
that's the heart of this deal.
Now,

391
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:47,200
from a sociological point of view,

392
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:51,250
uh,
the people who run these,

393
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:56,580
these companies are pretty
far away from the green world,

394
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:05,500
uh, which centers in major
metropolitan areas, uh,

395
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,540
and it's populated by Welton do activists,

396
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,160
uh,
and they're five o one c,

397
00:31:15,161 --> 00:31:19,410
three corporation of which,
uh,

398
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:23,410
uh, the, the ones in
play today are examples.

399
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:25,743
Now,

400
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:32,430
the Pacific group is a little different
from KKR in its relationship to those

401
00:31:33,551 --> 00:31:38,551
groups because it has one key player in
William Riley who had been the head of

402
00:31:41,711 --> 00:31:45,040
the EPA before and who is agreeing?

403
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,200
And he gave,

404
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:53,220
he gives Texas specific
a relationship to a,

405
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:58,260
to this world of which KKR
pretty much doesn't have that.

406
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,450
Ain't David Bonderman, who is, uh,

407
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:06,480
one of the founders of Texas Pacific is
a Harvard educated and kind of part of

408
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:12,670
this world. If you begin tracking
personalities in these funds,

409
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:17,200
uh, Francis Vita King, uh,

410
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:21,020
she of a Yale fame,
uh,

411
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:26,040
is the head of a natural
resources defense.

412
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:27,070
Fine.

413
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:31,550
I don't know why would seasons instead of
F's on the end of this other slide. Uh,

414
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:32,980
she,

415
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:37,980
she's the head of that and a
terrifically potent a leader.

416
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:45,340
And the reason the privileged access to
do this case came to the Yale School of

417
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:50,480
Management has something to do
with that particular connection.

418
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,360
Uh,
and there is a cultural divide here.

419
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,330
It is, uh, uh, it is,

420
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:04,630
these are quite different views of the
world and if we compare a five zero one c

421
00:33:08,301 --> 00:33:13,301
three corporations with regular public
or not publicly publicly traded or not

422
00:33:14,481 --> 00:33:18,590
publicly traded corporations,
we get some sharp contrasts.

423
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:24,960
The business corporations
are pursuing profit. A,

424
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:29,330
the five o one c three
s are pursuing a cost.

425
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,993
The

426
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:37,490
attitude to risk is far more
aggressive among the businesses.

427
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,373
Uh,

428
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:44,470
the boards are accountable to mainly to
major investors on the business side,

429
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:48,860
uh,
and uh,

430
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:53,330
to donors on the final one C3 side,

431
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:59,560
except that in the really big old five
[inaudible] they're accountable to no one

432
00:34:00,591 --> 00:34:05,270
because the donor is dead. The
Carnegie Corporation, for example,

433
00:34:05,271 --> 00:34:07,430
where my wife is a chief
investment officer,

434
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:11,520
Andrew Carnegie hasn't paid any
attention to their lenders in some time

435
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:17,330
and it actually creates an
enormous amount of, of, uh,

436
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:22,400
uh, free play at top
management and board level.

437
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,043
Uh,

438
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,910
the management culture on the business
side is far more aggressive than on among

439
00:34:28,911 --> 00:34:33,911
the nonprofits and top
management compensation in it,

440
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:38,090
particularly in private
equity is high and variable.

441
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,160
And Jim would,

442
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:45,190
Jim pointed out to me that Jim Alexander
pointed up to me this morning that when

443
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:47,090
I say high and variable,

444
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:51,950
the variability may or may not be
well tied to actual performance.

445
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,270
You can get a lot of compensation for
just sitting in the right chair during a

446
00:34:56,271 --> 00:35:00,360
bull market. And many people have. Um,

447
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,900
and on the nonprofit side,

448
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:07,870
if the compensation is
relatively modest and uh,

449
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:12,230
more or less in variant with performance,
uh,

450
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,600
take Francis by Nikki,

451
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,680
there was a to do a in the same year
because somebody published their top

452
00:35:20,271 --> 00:35:25,271
salaries are always public and her salary
of $252,000 was published and there

453
00:35:26,361 --> 00:35:27,680
was a populous outcry.

454
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:33,170
Now by private equity standards
that sound a lot of money,

455
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,473
uh,

456
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:40,560
even by not people on the investment side
and organizations like this make three

457
00:35:40,561 --> 00:35:42,560
or four or 10 times that.

458
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:48,950
But the general norm in nonprofits is how
many are there people here who planned

459
00:35:49,271 --> 00:35:51,850
the become nonprofit tiers?

460
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,793
Maybe?

461
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:00,490
Okay. Well the one thing you
have to do is take a zero off.

462
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:07,120
Uh, when you think about compensation,
uh, more or less, it's, it's,

463
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:12,090
that's about the ratio
and it's considerable. Uh,

464
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:16,860
so these are two very different
classes of organizations. All right.

465
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:21,900
Here we have Fred crop of the
natural resources and Henry Kravitz.

466
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,660
And I'll bet not one of you is
in doubt about witches switch,

467
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:35,340
but the pictures are then
you get the point across. Um,

468
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:37,743
and

469
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:45,090
why on earth would people on this side
be so interested in participation from

470
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:53,100
people on this side, Sasha, again,

471
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:03,190
um, to do something with the business
that makes them more money ultimately then

472
00:37:03,191 --> 00:37:04,024
it's a good deal.

473
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,180
You nailed it.
And not,

474
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:13,690
not one iota of direct concern for the
environment is required to back that up.

475
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,350
Right? So what's the biggest
problem about Tia Queue?

476
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,370
Why is it,

477
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:28,590
what if you're going to get to sit down
and calculate the risks from Kkr and a

478
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,950
specific point of view
of taking over this firm,

479
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,900
what would the main risk
speed they would be?

480
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:41,000
Would they be that the
technology will fail?

481
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:47,710
Would they be that consumer demand for
electric tower will suddenly go away?

482
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,990
Would they be that a new
entrant will come in,

483
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:59,370
a large new amber will come in and
begin to compete with lower prices?

484
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,980
None of those things or arc imaginable.
None of those are imaginable.

485
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,640
So why isn't this Josh a
license to print money?

486
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:18,010
And the answer to that is that a
regulatory risk is substantial at both the

487
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:25,550
federal and state levels, much more
substantial at the federal level.

488
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,730
And that the,

489
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:34,470
the process by which the,

490
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:39,730
the groups would in effect bless or kosher
the transaction is a way of limiting

491
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,200
political risk.
Oh,

492
00:38:52,201 --> 00:38:57,201
the eat the EDF is all about
the cause of the environment.

493
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:59,783
Um,

494
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:05,660
and their claim is that a
lobby work they've done in
the years from 2001 to 2008

495
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,950
will, uh, diminish, uh,

496
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:18,300
diesel pollution by nearly 90% by 2030.

497
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,420
And that's their business.

498
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:26,450
Their business is to get the government
to compel companies to pollute less,

499
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,140
uh, Fred crop at Davos
in the year of the case.

500
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:41,430
This is not in the case. The smartest
companies can see over the horizon,

501
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,320
anticipate consumer demands.

502
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,560
That's why the EDF has been able
to team with a team up with Alcoa,

503
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:51,530
dupont, Caterpillar, GE,
Duke, the Duke Energy,

504
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:56,540
BP America and others on a plan that
could cut greenhouse gas emissions by 68%

505
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,920
by 2050.
The plan is a job,

506
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:05,120
Twitter as well as an
environmental winter. So the,

507
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:09,890
so organizations like these are brokers.
Yeah.

508
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:14,940
Which they cut deals with businesses and
the businesses they cut the deals with

509
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:21,620
our one switch have a higher than
average capacity to withstand pilar

510
00:40:22,771 --> 00:40:25,290
regulation.
For example,

511
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,340
Ge with ECO imagination,
you've all heard of that.

512
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,750
If you watch television for any
period of as as long as an hour,

513
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:38,910
you have been saturated with that message.
And why can he do that?

514
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,290
Well why does it have to do it?

515
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:45,900
What street is long term reputation
for environmental pollution?

516
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:52,620
It is that they filled the Hudson
River with PCPs 50 years ago and it's

517
00:40:52,831 --> 00:40:56,640
important for them to get us off that
topic and to think of them in an in a

518
00:40:56,641 --> 00:40:58,240
different way.
Second,

519
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:03,000
if they compete in Europe
for the manufacturer of
electrically powered equipment

520
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:07,650
and the regs in Europe are much tighter
than they are here from an environmental

521
00:41:07,651 --> 00:41:08,484
point of view.

522
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:13,890
So they have developed a technology
to meet Mike higher standards.

523
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:18,330
They've got it already in the kit.
And so from their point of view,

524
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:23,360
it is actually a corporate strategy play
to encourage the feds to raise the bar

525
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:32,900
cap and trade. I'm running out of
time here. Cap and trade diagram.

526
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:38,750
Uh, the interesting side fact
that cap and trade in the EU,

527
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:40,340
uh,

528
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:45,340
basically fizzle and it fizzled because
the caps that were put on the countries

529
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:55,580
were not low enough to make
people go out and buy credits.

530
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:01,810
They were sat in a very gentle political
way and the market for cap and trade

531
00:42:04,581 --> 00:42:09,581
depends on people having to break the
caps and buy credits to make up for that.

532
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:17,020
And the caps were set so high that
it didn't produce the desired effect.

533
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,390
I don't know why that slide is there.

534
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:26,623
No.

535
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:31,020
Um, let's think about outcomes. Uh,

536
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:36,710
we've got on the vertical dimension
Greenwald and on the horizontal dimension,

537
00:42:36,711 --> 00:42:40,910
Green Paper and uh,

538
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:46,030
four big quadrants. The four
quadrants of this space, uh,

539
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,320
define,
uh,

540
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:53,390
points we could think about in
looking at what the risks are,

541
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:56,510
the possibilities of this
are for these two classes of,

542
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:00,680
of organizations down here,

543
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,210
emissions are high end profits are low,
is a catastrophe.

544
00:43:05,211 --> 00:43:06,140
On both dementia.

545
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:12,640
And the likelihood of both of those
things happening is very small.

546
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:21,470
A story where you have both
high emissions and high profit.

547
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:28,810
This is the most worrying category
from the point of view of the EDF.

548
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,990
This would,
this would constitute greenwashing,

549
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,150
which has become a really
important epithet in the
politics of the environment.

550
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:47,020
Where are their blessing something
which is a retention benefit to the

551
00:43:47,451 --> 00:43:48,284
environment.

552
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:54,340
And here is the disaster from the point
of view of Kkr and Texas Pacific where

553
00:43:57,290 --> 00:44:01,310
you have both low
emissions and low profits.

554
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:02,703
And

555
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:09,040
do you think KKR and Texas Pacific enter
into this relationship fearing the risk

556
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,490
that EDF and the natural,

557
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:19,790
the natural resources defense fund will,

558
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:25,300
will encourage the imposition of standards
so direct Konijn that they can't make

559
00:44:27,111 --> 00:44:29,870
a living? Well, no,

560
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:33,780
they wouldn't have EDF as the lead agency.

561
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,980
If EDF we're of the same temperament.

562
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:39,840
Ash let's freak theater.

563
00:44:39,841 --> 00:44:44,841
We saw in the video they chose EDF
quit cause they think they can cut a

564
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:51,330
plausible and constructive
bargain with them,

565
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:56,360
which liege not upper left upper right
in the diagram or emissions decrease in a

566
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,120
substantial degree.
And uh,

567
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,810
and profits remain hot.

568
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:15,710
This slide is in the is from the case
and it's the full inventory of exactions

569
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:22,340
that Jim March then and EDF people
consider in looking at the case and it,

570
00:45:23,291 --> 00:45:28,200
if they call it the blue sky concessions
because it's perfectly clear they're

571
00:45:28,201 --> 00:45:31,260
not going to get all of these,
but they want,

572
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:36,261
some of them are and they get some of
them and they also get quite a lot of

573
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:40,260
symbolic by him.
So let,

574
00:45:40,261 --> 00:45:45,261
by the current year 2009 Kkr is
offering an investment portfolio,

575
00:45:45,481 --> 00:45:47,670
wicked calls the green portfolio.

576
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,720
And this consists not of companies
that are going to devote themselves to

577
00:45:54,211 --> 00:45:57,210
producing environmental products,

578
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:00,960
but random grid companies
which produce other products,

579
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:07,020
for example in bio mat, uh,
produce magical devices.

580
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,300
But we're,

581
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:14,570
they sign on to the proposition that they
will make their production process far

582
00:46:15,931 --> 00:46:17,370
greener than it was before.

583
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:23,360
So that I as an investor can buy into
the Green Fund and expect market rates of

584
00:46:25,231 --> 00:46:30,231
return and think that on the side I'm
doing a little bit of good for the

585
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:31,704
environment.

586
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:35,063
Yeah.

587
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:38,780
Big changes are on the horizon
for Texas power customers.

588
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,940
Welcome to the new TXU.

589
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:45,560
We've listened to Texans on prices and
we're taking a new approach to prove it.

590
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:48,350
Most residential customers will
get a double digit price cut.

591
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,020
We've listened to Texans on
the environment, so we'll cut,

592
00:46:51,021 --> 00:46:55,090
propose to new coal units from 11 to
three and look for new ways to ensure

593
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:58,940
reliable, affordable power,
doing what's right for customers,

594
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:03,230
doing what's right for Texas.
Welcome to the future. Welcome.

595
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:04,873
Txu.

596
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:08,240
Okay. So, uh,

597
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:10,940
and they all went to the beach
and had a swell afternoon.

598
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:15,310
Um,
the,

599
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:23,190
okay, so that's the last case we're going
to do except the one for your final.

600
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:28,750
And what I hope you'll
do for Wednesday is, uh,

601
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:32,110
read Finnegan piece with some care.
He's a British writer.

602
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:37,270
I got to know him personally when he
came to write about a violent kids in new

603
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:40,250
haven 20 years ago.
Um,

604
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:45,550
and it's a beautifully written
piece and it's a compelling story.

605
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:51,360
And also begin reviewing your notes for
the big picture level of the course.
