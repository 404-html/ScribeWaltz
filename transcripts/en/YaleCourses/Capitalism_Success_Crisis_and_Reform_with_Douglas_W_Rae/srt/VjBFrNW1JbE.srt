1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,070
Well, this is what a well worn
copy of white tiger looks like.

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,660
The
style of it

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,660
is pretty striking.

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,460
Anybody want to take a shot at
other novels that reminds you of

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,280
yes content
and not to cover.

6
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,280
Okay.
Well it reminds me of,

7
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,860
it reminds me of someone. Rashid has
been nice children. Okay. That's,

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,130
that's one interesting
suggestion. Sophie Quinten. Yes.

9
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,073
Yeah.

10
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,533
What do you think?

11
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,390
Um, what do I think of the book or is this
related to the warm call email and you

12
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:57,030
send it the morning? Yeah. Well, um,

13
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,460
in the back of white tiger they sort
of a reading group discussion with the

14
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:05,030
author and one of the things the author
says that it's kind of interesting is

15
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:09,360
that, um, his inspiration
for Ballarat was, um, it, it,

16
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,650
he sort of a compensate the character
that came out of the author's experience

17
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,090
just hanging out in slums and train
stations and in servant's quarters and

18
00:01:17,091 --> 00:01:22,091
listening to what basically the underclass
of India are saying and how they are

19
00:01:22,431 --> 00:01:24,560
thinking. Um, and it sort of,

20
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,720
it's interesting that ballroom who's
such an angry character is the embodiment

21
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:33,660
of something very real. That
Attica Adiga I guess, um,

22
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,600
felt talking to people on the street.

23
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,330
Right. Okay. That's good. Um, in the,

24
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,930
he also mentions three American
novelists in the, in the back.

25
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:48,850
Did you notice them? No, I did not.
Okay. Um, well it's interesting.

26
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:51,760
The um,
are

27
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,030
the influences on white tiger or three
black American writers of the Post World

28
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,360
War II era, Ralph Ellison, James
Baldwin and Richard. Right.

29
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,370
So, um, it has,

30
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,320
um, are many ways to look at it. It is

31
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,660
written in a very
straightforward style that is,

32
00:02:16,661 --> 00:02:18,520
each paragraph is pretty straight forward.

33
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:24,510
The sub text about how it's being
told is a little more complicated.

34
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,890
And one of the other things she
says in the, in the back, which,

35
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,030
and this goes to the point Sophie made,
uh,

36
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,670
is that while,
uh,

37
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,840
none of the characters or incidents
are copied out of journalism,

38
00:02:43,091 --> 00:02:46,140
which is the authors business.
Uh,

39
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:51,180
all of them are meant to be representative
of something real in Indian wife.

40
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,620
So that the book is literally fiction,

41
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,750
but has a purpose,

42
00:02:58,751 --> 00:03:03,751
like many of the best works of fiction
as a purpose of describing something,

43
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,270
uh,
that is very real.

44
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,310
Are there ways in which fiction can
do a better job than social science of

45
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:13,720
telling the truth about a country?

46
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,270
Anybody got a thought about that?

47
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,723
Yes.

48
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,530
Well, it's an art form and something
like social science can't really say,

49
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:29,980
well this makes me feel this or
this is like the nuance of that.

50
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,520
And that's where art plays in.
And I mean, I'm also, I mean,

51
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:36,880
it's mass media too and a lot of ways so
you can reach a lot more people through

52
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:38,800
this and have it easily understood,

53
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,760
okay,
it's mass media,

54
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:46,030
but it actually does something that most
nonfiction written by academics can't

55
00:03:46,401 --> 00:03:49,310
do. Right? Economists,
political scientists,

56
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:53,570
people like that by and large,
a little wooden than religion,

57
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,430
a little category bound,
a little obsessed with methodology.

58
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:04,930
And this book covers a huge swath of a
very complicated aspects of a society,

59
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:10,990
which,
uh,

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,380
as far as I can tell his top half dozen
in the way of complexity in the world.

61
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:16,671
Right.

62
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:21,671
I mean the structure of the historical
structure of India and the incredible

63
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:29,060
rate of economic and Sociological
Change, uh, have very few,

64
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,430
uh, equals elsewhere. Um,

65
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:40,130
Divia if I got that name
right. Yeah, yeah. Um,

66
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,681
again,
and again,

67
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:47,681
the concept of out of the
darkness comes up in the book,

68
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,560
help us try to understand that.

69
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:56,860
Yeah. So I think it's sort of literally
and figuratively the darkness of India,

70
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:59,800
the parts of India that has sort of been
left behind and all the development and

71
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:02,320
globalization, um, where
there's no electricity.

72
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:06,330
So like literally it's dark
when the sun goes down. Um,

73
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:10,500
and where there's also a lack of like
basic necessities like sanitation,

74
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,850
like proper food.
Um,

75
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,850
and I think also the darkness of sort
of corruption and bribery and like

76
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,000
theoretically there being resources,

77
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:21,830
but those getting funneled into
the hands of like, for example, um,

78
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,220
like the great socialists who is,
you know,

79
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,070
campaign to sort of lift the
darkness out of the darkness,

80
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:31,660
but ended up just getting sort of sucked
into the bribery of people in the upper

81
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:36,500
caste and the town. And, um, continuing
to take advantage of like the lower caste.

82
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,343
Okay.

83
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:42,590
From the point of view of a
village India deepen the darkness.

84
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,660
Uh, is it clear one way or the
other, whether the economic

85
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,340
miracle and maybe too strong a word,

86
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:58,341
but the incredible progress overall
development that's been made since about

87
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:02,660
1990 is a good thing or a bad thing?

88
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,960
I think like,
I think it's,

89
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:12,030
it's kind of goes both ways and I
think he talks about it and that, um,

90
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:16,740
I guess he sort of talks about it as
the difference between the north and the

91
00:06:16,741 --> 00:06:20,380
south or what like his, the
two cities he was in. Um, it,

92
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:24,810
when development gets kind
of entrenched in corruption,

93
00:06:24,811 --> 00:06:29,370
that ends up being a bad thing and ends
up taking advantage of people at the

94
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:29,851
bottom.

95
00:06:29,851 --> 00:06:34,851
But I think to me it seemed a little
optimistic that it can be a good thing in

96
00:06:35,281 --> 00:06:37,500
places where it's been done properly.

97
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,793
Okay.

98
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,390
And do you have it in the back of your
mind an idea or two about what doing

99
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,750
capitalism properly mean?

100
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,750
Well, not really. I guess I'll Betcha.

101
00:06:48,751 --> 00:06:53,470
Do you know not corruption?
Not Bribing policemen.

102
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,790
Okay. Not Corruption, not bribery.

103
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,150
I mean,
I don't know.

104
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,860
There are, I guess a lot of things, but,
okay. Let's go on and we'll find of,

105
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,463
okay.

106
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,210
Uh, Sudhir yeah,

107
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,430
there's a passage in,
I think it's the first night in the book.

108
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,520
How about,
uh,

109
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,200
I think it's for animals, my
right, who represent people.

110
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,780
Can you help us with?

111
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,570
Sure.
I think the first point is that a,

112
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,610
do you guys making a statement about a,

113
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,690
and quite unabashedly
landowners is animals, uh,

114
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,380
who in this case quite literally
feed off Lakshman guards,

115
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,200
physical and human resources.
Um,

116
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,890
the other obvious point is
that the animals that do
you get chooses to represent

117
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:50,840
the landlords aren't
particularly glamorous.

118
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,550
I think he has a view of land
and is tocky cross lazy. Um,

119
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,680
and it's clear that,
you know,

120
00:07:57,681 --> 00:08:01,370
one of the few reasons or main reasons
that they hold a position of power in

121
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:05,180
society is they've probably descended
from families of landowners who have a

122
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:09,860
long history of exploiting
and extorting from the war.

123
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,690
Okay. Now here's an interesting
parallel. If you think about the,

124
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:18,040
about Clark farewell to alms.
Uh,

125
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:23,041
one of the big lessons there is
that land is the primary basis of,

126
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:25,923
uh,

127
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:31,170
economic return in premodern societies
and loses its relative standing with

128
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:37,750
development.
So if a degas is right,

129
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,420
are the stork, the Raven, the wild boar,

130
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:47,140
and who else? Oh, and the Buffalo, uh,

131
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,740
are they basically fossils of a previous
era grasping for the last straws of a

132
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:54,970
power base?
It will go,

133
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:00,380
or given the nature of rural India
will lay persist in that position.

134
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,110
Generation after generation,
you think,

135
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,110
you know,

136
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,100
it's hard for me to kind of identify
that trajectory of India's development.

137
00:09:13,101 --> 00:09:16,760
She says, I don't know
how much of, I guess,

138
00:09:16,761 --> 00:09:21,450
I mean really and yet is large,
makes a large chunk of the, uh,

139
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,940
the country and the economy for what it's
worth. So I think there are probably,

140
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,800
um,
in the foreseeable future,

141
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,390
there's probably a very good chance that
characters like these four will still

142
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:37,730
retain a good deal of influence in
those spheres. I mean, obviously, um,

143
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,490
you know, corporations are
making their way into these, uh,

144
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,390
into rural areas and setting
up innovation camps and, um,

145
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,860
large offices. But to the
extent that India has, um,

146
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,873
uh,

147
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,140
the rural base is strong,
I think these people will thrive.

148
00:09:55,270 --> 00:10:00,130
Okay. And if, uh, if capitalism

149
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,170
seeks economies of scale as it's
wanting to do a small landholding,

150
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,540
uh, will be, uh, eventually, uh,

151
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:19,020
undermined by large scale land
holding and agricultural development,

152
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:26,140
uh, on a vast scale or that's, that
would be the textbook hypothesis.

153
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,950
Uh, if you look at what's
happening in Brazil, for example,

154
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,650
a development on the scale of farms,

155
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,510
uh,
25 or 35 miles square,

156
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:44,950
25 by 25, say, uh, is commonplace.

157
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,310
And maybe India is different.

158
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:53,380
And the reason it may be
different is that the indigenous,

159
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:57,250
the density of indigenous rural
population is much higher.

160
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,340
And, uh, the,

161
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,210
the process by which
land would be aggregated,

162
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,850
it may happen quite a lot slower.

163
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,960
Maximillian uh,

164
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,910
where the title of the Book Come
From and how do you understand

165
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,420
he calls it the white tiger because,
um,

166
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:24,330
by Ron stands out of all of the other
servants, like why Tiger stands out. Oh,

167
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,560
by tiger stand out of there.

168
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:31,510
I don't know other animals who are
not albinos because they're so rare.

169
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,920
And,
um,

170
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,600
there's one incident leading up to
becoming the white tiger that is,

171
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:42,660
I guess where they are on the wait with
the two sons of his masters to bribe the

172
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,040
minister. And, um, I run, reaches out to,

173
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,330
um,
to a beggar intuitively to help him.

174
00:11:52,331 --> 00:11:57,331
And he gives him some money and the
sons of his master get really angry with

175
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:02,410
them. Um, I'm giving him the money, um,

176
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,560
and they start to complain about,
um,

177
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,400
how Texas they have to pay you and that
they're already helping the poor. And um,

178
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:15,040
yeah, that's how he realizes
that the entrenched,

179
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,100
entrenched inequalities in Indian society
will perhaps persist despite India's

180
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:21,643
new prosperity.

181
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,040
Okay.
Go ahead.

182
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:28,050
And do you remember the part about the
school house early on where there's a

183
00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:30,390
surprise inspection?
Does anybody remember this?

184
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,630
I drawing a blank here over there?

185
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,720
Yeah. Um, in the beginning I believe in,

186
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,630
there's a surprise
inspection and he's, uh, uh,

187
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:51,520
the inspector comes in and
asks the students a bunch
of different questions and

188
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,820
really nobody is able to give any, uh,
any good answer except for a ballroom.

189
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,540
And a,
he then asked him,

190
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:02,440
I guess he asks him about
a certain question. I bill,

191
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,640
I forget exactly what the question is,

192
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:07,720
but the answer was that it's
a white tiger. It's a think
that is the most unique.

193
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,860
Okay.

194
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,860
So he gets named white tiger for being
uniquely talented in a situation where

195
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:16,740
talent is not being developed.
Right.

196
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,230
And how does the school school
room operate? Do you remember that?

197
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,281
Well,

198
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:28,050
it's interesting that ball armed and
actually blame the teacher because I guess

199
00:13:28,051 --> 00:13:33,051
the teacher would steal the uniforms
and all the resources that came.

200
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:36,270
But I think at one point farm
even says like, well, I mean,

201
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:41,430
no one really blames him because his
payment also gets taken by someone else.

202
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,870
Um,
so the teacher,

203
00:13:42,871 --> 00:13:46,260
there's just like a chain of corruption
that ends in the teacher basically

204
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,420
stealing the resources that were meant
for the kids and just sleeping all day or,

205
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,620
um, and while the kids do whatever. Okay.

206
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,273
No,

207
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,990
quite often there's a mention of the
fact that the teacher was snoring. Well,

208
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:05,250
right. The students were supposed to be
learning somehow from one another. Uh,

209
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,780
and you're right in that the,
I think the narrator says something like,

210
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,640
um, those who live in a dung heap
can't be expected to smell well.

211
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:21,040
Right? And so there's a kind
of environmental explanation,

212
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,640
um, social and social
environmental explanation.

213
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,430
And W why do we think is
this, is this, uh, uh,

214
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:34,650
man bites dog story or is corruption of
a fairly major issue in Indian society?

215
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:39,723
Who's got an opinion

216
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,303
back?

217
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:45,770
I,
yeah,

218
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:49,820
I think it's a fairly major issue because
even when you make the transition into

219
00:14:49,821 --> 00:14:54,470
like the lightness in the book, you still
get severe corruption of course with,

220
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,550
um,
you know,

221
00:14:55,551 --> 00:15:00,470
the ballrooms boss going to give the
big bags of money to the government. Um,

222
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:05,490
so I think it's corruption that pervades
every level and kind of the light is a

223
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:10,400
little bit of a deceptive name for what
ballroom moves into because even at the

224
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:11,390
height of his success,

225
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:15,980
the only way he can succeed is by
killing someone then by paying off the

226
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,610
policeman.

227
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,340
Okay. Now that's, that's elegantly put,

228
00:15:19,341 --> 00:15:21,800
but it's evidence from
fiction about fiction.

229
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,070
So what the judgment I'm looking for is,

230
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,160
is his claim that the book represents
Broglie truthful patterns in the society

231
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:35,780
or not you buy it or not?

232
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,650
Well, I mean having, um,

233
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,870
India myself several times and
having many friends from there,

234
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:46,370
I definitely heard, you know,
considerable, um, stories
of corruption. I mean, I,

235
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,040
I'm not in a position to
judge the society as a whole,

236
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:52,320
but it seems like it would
have an element of truth to it.

237
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,270
Okay. Has anybody glanced at one
of the world rankings from say,

238
00:15:56,271 --> 00:16:01,271
Transparency International
or other organizations which
have VAT evaluate levels

239
00:16:01,521 --> 00:16:04,690
of corruption?
Okay.

240
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,730
The Socratic method stops here.
Uh,

241
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,840
India is near the top of the world
table in a corruption as a per an issue

242
00:16:17,891 --> 00:16:22,891
perceived by people in
business as problematic.

243
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,460
Anybody with substantial experience,

244
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,230
one of contradict or
elaborate on this point?

245
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,970
Oh yes,
we need a mic in the middle

246
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,370
for lots of people staying in India,

247
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:49,100
especially doing the sister
corruptions almost become a VA light.

248
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:53,610
So they see, they'd rather call the
system, flexible them calling it corrupt.

249
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:58,290
So if you want to get a
government sanction, which
was only take three months,

250
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,890
you can get it done in three bay,

251
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,860
three days if you pay an additional
amount and that's the premium that's a

252
00:17:04,861 --> 00:17:09,630
pregnant, that's not corruption.
So for a lot part of the society,

253
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,760
it's a flexible system
rather than a corrupt system.

254
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,800
Okay. And a good American
economists would call it

255
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,610
the inefficiencies in the market.
So you just exploiting them. Yep.

256
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:22,830
Inefficiencies due to rent seeking,
right.

257
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,000
Rent seeking.
I love that concept.

258
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,203
MMM.

259
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:33,600
Danielle. Right on the w
are you hear Danielle? Hi,

260
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,480
I'm Dr Ram.

261
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:40,910
Pondi is it Pindi something like that.
Something like that.

262
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:46,050
Tell us about that incident in the book
and give us something about what you

263
00:17:46,051 --> 00:17:46,820
think it means.

264
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,810
Okay, so I'm on page 41 of the book,
the theirs when they're all sitting,

265
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,490
um,
in,

266
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,810
and the white tiger has taken his father
to the hospital and they're sitting in

267
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:00,240
the waiting room waiting
for a doctor who won't come.

268
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:03,390
And an old Muslim man start songs story.
Um,

269
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,990
excuse me about this fictitious doctor,

270
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:11,730
doctor ran panty and talks about how
the great socialists sells off plots of

271
00:18:11,731 --> 00:18:16,290
like, um, like districts to
doctors and the doctors, bodies,

272
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,820
districts almost like a feudal system.

273
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,920
And then the doctors in
those districts will,

274
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,570
he'll take part of the salaries from
these doctors and then tell them, oh,

275
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,870
well now you can just go off
and work for a private hospital.

276
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,610
You don't have to worry
about these people.

277
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:31,500
I'll write it down in my
ledger that you've been there.

278
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,180
So basically the government is on a
totally different strata and all the money

279
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:40,590
or benefits just get written down or
written away and these people are left

280
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,410
dying or with wounded
legs like the Muslim man.

281
00:18:43,411 --> 00:18:47,910
And he's just sort of laughing about
it. So there's this sense like, um,

282
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,010
with the Muslim man and all
the people in the waiting room,

283
00:18:50,011 --> 00:18:51,470
this sort of laughing about their,

284
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,350
their problems or grinding about them
because I mean his father dies in the end.

285
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:59,790
Um, ballrooms father dies in the end
because this doctor never comes. So the,

286
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,010
the corruption and the resources are just

287
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,313
like

288
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,410
strewn about and

289
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,930
that passenger is actually quite
polemic all the way it's written, right.

290
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,730
It probably overstates right.

291
00:19:15,731 --> 00:19:19,390
There were probably a hell of a lot of
places where you actually can see the

292
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:24,391
doctor and the doctor does pay attention
to people who were supposed to pay

293
00:19:24,611 --> 00:19:27,910
attention to.
But the general pattern described there.

294
00:19:27,911 --> 00:19:29,080
What's wrong with corruption?

295
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:32,763
Corruption.

296
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,180
I mean there,

297
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:40,610
there are various is people who think
corruption is not altogether a bad thing.

298
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,620
For example.

299
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,373
MMM.

300
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,620
There are people who write
about American cities and say,

301
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:52,610
if you have to choose between corruption
and civil service bureaucrats who do

302
00:19:52,611 --> 00:19:55,550
everything to the letter of the law,
take corruption.

303
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,023
MMM.

304
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,200
An example is a historical example was
the Fulton fish market in New York,

305
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:09,120
which was run by the mafia for a long
time and read pretty efficiently.

306
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,670
I mean, there was some rent
seeking, uh, and some violence,

307
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:16,920
but it worked.

308
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:21,950
And then Rudy Giuliani took it over
and put in clean bureaucrats to run it.

309
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:28,530
And people thought, well, it may not
actually run as well this way now,

310
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:31,020
but there is, there's
counterpoint to that. There's a,

311
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:36,021
there's a big themes about why corruption
is from the point of view of growth

312
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:41,460
and development and human welfare.
Probably not on average a great thing.

313
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,350
Did you have a comment? Well, you know,

314
00:20:43,351 --> 00:20:48,010
we can always go back to Adam Smith
and disregard, but, but not what he's

315
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,520
most famous for. But he, he's, he, he,

316
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,500
he kind of gives us a self interest,

317
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:57,430
but it's not this naked isolated
form of self interest. You know,

318
00:20:57,431 --> 00:21:02,431
he said capitalism only functions upon
a foundation of ethical participants and

319
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,830
if not,
it's brutally,

320
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:09,340
grossly inefficient because you can't
get the right information around at the

321
00:21:09,341 --> 00:21:10,174
right time.

322
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:15,210
Terrific. Right. And this is, I mean,
this was a huge point in understanding.

323
00:21:15,211 --> 00:21:19,890
Smith Smith is a moron,
right? Smiths in his own time,

324
00:21:19,891 --> 00:21:22,920
his famous book wasn't this,
it was a theory of moral sentiments.

325
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:28,580
And Smith is saying
articulate shelf interest,

326
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:34,490
frankly pursued within a framework of
honest communication within a framework of

327
00:21:36,621 --> 00:21:41,070
honest communication and with a
government in the background that enforces

328
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:45,420
contract and prohibits
fraud within that framework.

329
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:50,310
Self interest creates an
upward draft on an economy.

330
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,520
But if you take away that framework,

331
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,080
the ethical aspects of,

332
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:03,140
of people's beliefs and the proper
functioning of the government in enforcing

333
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:08,460
contract and related things
and you take all that away, uh,

334
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:09,960
the,

335
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,960
the invisible hand story works if anything
in reverse and we're inclined to just

336
00:22:17,641 --> 00:22:20,910
assume that,
um,

337
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,180
to, to just march too quickly by, uh,

338
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,880
the issue of that fuck,

339
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,620
that foundational issue and the eye.

340
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:37,740
If I asked you this, how many of you've
done Ben pollocks course on Game Theory?

341
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:45,230
That's really, I recommend
it to all of you. Um,

342
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,290
but think,
think this or think about this problem.

343
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:54,291
Suppose you are operating in a system
where everybody else is willing to lie in

344
00:22:56,521 --> 00:22:57,354
order to profit.

345
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:04,130
And at each one of those other people
assumes that about all the people she and

346
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,390
she or he is dealing with,

347
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,830
how do you form a strategy
to make a business run?

348
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:17,280
And the answer is that it is virtually
impossible because you cannot anticipate

349
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,720
the way people,

350
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:23,810
people respond to straightforward
incentives and it's a big deal.

351
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:28,500
And getting out of that,
out of that dilemma,

352
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:33,800
right. [inaudible] another way
to put it is there's a famous uh,

353
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,800
philosophical example, one version
of which is a sentence, you know,

354
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,320
written inside a box which says this
sentence is a lie or the sentence in this

355
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:47,030
box is a lie.

356
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,940
Okay.

357
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,780
How do you interpret that? True or
false? False. True. True. If false

358
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,730
can't get anywhere with that.
Very hard to live that way.

359
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,490
Mid back

360
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,570
caste is a

361
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,590
really complex cultural structure,

362
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:19,020
which I've read a little about and
talked to Indians widdle about and it's

363
00:24:19,021 --> 00:24:20,130
obviously important.

364
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,423
Help

365
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,860
help the uninitiated here.
I'm a little bit

366
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:31,020
sure. Um, I did some research last
night, but I think I got my most,

367
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,760
my most profound revelation.

368
00:24:32,761 --> 00:24:36,570
I talked to one of my best friends from
Indiana and he gave me an incredible

369
00:24:36,571 --> 00:24:39,410
perspective on cast and most of the
donors and Dell, but I didn't know about.

370
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:42,400
And so I'm going to go a little bit
into the history of cas because it's,

371
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,280
it's honestly fascinating.
Um,

372
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:50,300
cast actually started out as a really
advanced complex system that we see in

373
00:24:51,061 --> 00:24:52,140
today's capitalist worlds.

374
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:56,370
It started off as division of Labor
started off as promoting specialization.

375
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,780
Cast a cast wasn't a bad
thing when it first started.

376
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,170
It just means that people were specialized
in certain traits. For example,

377
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:08,000
we have blacksmiths and we
had traders and we had, uh,

378
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,940
people in different sectors of
the economy here. Similarly,

379
00:25:11,941 --> 00:25:14,970
we had castes in India and they weren't,

380
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,030
they weren't silent constraining.

381
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:22,110
They were just indicating what you
are best at its division of Labor.

382
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,550
So cast actually started degrading
or unfortunately, and it's actually,

383
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:31,300
it's actually gone through some evolution.
Uh,

384
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,930
and this catalyst when the British came,
when the British came,

385
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:36,150
they didn't grasp cast as.

386
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,150
And the advanced system of division
of labor and special relations,

387
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,470
they grasp the cast as
as as more feudal system.

388
00:25:43,471 --> 00:25:45,660
And so they started perpetuating this,

389
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,130
this thought that once you're born
mcast you're stuck in a cast forever.

390
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,220
And that's what started bringing
negative connotations towards cast.

391
00:25:53,221 --> 00:25:57,630
That's what started making
casts constraining. And

392
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:04,050
I guess the best way to put this
out, but the, after the British came,

393
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,430
it basically started destroying whole
people started being born in casts and

394
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,010
they started thinking, believing
they were relegated to these cast.

395
00:26:11,011 --> 00:26:12,310
If you look at the book,
um,

396
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:16,110
ball around ended up ended a passenger
with the quote that they're only two

397
00:26:16,111 --> 00:26:17,790
destinies eat or get eaten up.

398
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:23,150
And that just shows the cast evolved from
being an advanced concept of division

399
00:26:23,611 --> 00:26:26,850
of labor, of specialization to
something that you're constrained to.

400
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:31,050
And I think that today the only thing
that separates cast from an advanced

401
00:26:31,051 --> 00:26:34,080
capitalist structure is
mobility in the casts.

402
00:26:34,081 --> 00:26:36,780
And there's not mobility because you're
born into a system and you're stuck with

403
00:26:36,781 --> 00:26:39,040
it forever. And an American
system, for example,

404
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:42,330
if you at least have the hope and
the ability to move from cast from,

405
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,250
from to trade,
from cast

406
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,390
to cast.
And I think that's a trend.

407
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,200
Well at the foundation of
India as a democracy in 1947,

408
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,110
there was a huge emphasis on the downbeat,

409
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,500
the untouchables and on making sure
that they had opportunities and more to

410
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,700
other people.
Anybody know anything about that effort?

411
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,263
Yes,

412
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,570
they're the [inaudible] commission,
um,

413
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:16,210
started this program where it kind of
like afraid of affirmative action here,

414
00:27:16,211 --> 00:27:19,790
but much more restricted in the sense
of there are numerical quotas. Um,

415
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,850
so there are quotas for
three types of people.

416
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,920
Obcs other backward classes, which is
not necessarily as much caster Javi,

417
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,530
but more of a economic economic.
So a Brahmin,

418
00:27:29,531 --> 00:27:31,810
which is the highest caste
or also be part of this task.

419
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,360
I'm part of the sudden relic designation.

420
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,250
If they do not earn as much
as they're supposed to,

421
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:39,160
like 10 rupees a month
or something like that,

422
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:42,130
then you have all bosies was
just scheduled tribes system.

423
00:27:42,131 --> 00:27:43,930
And then you also have
a schedule caste system,

424
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:45,250
which goes back to the original cast.

425
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,650
Now what's really interesting about
the caste system, as you know,

426
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,010
it was just mentioned that
there is no, um, mobility,

427
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,550
but in essence there's still
differences going on in India right now.

428
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:57,370
So people do move around,
can move around, for example,

429
00:27:57,371 --> 00:28:01,240
they can go in and out of the OTC
category. Um, so that still exist.

430
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:05,290
And then these designations
happen in government positions.

431
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:07,660
So in IIT, which is, as you know,

432
00:28:07,661 --> 00:28:10,690
Hyundai was from Iot and all these
other institutions that are government

433
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:11,291
institutions,

434
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:15,970
like the proportion of the population
that is in any of these designations have

435
00:28:15,971 --> 00:28:18,370
to have those seats in those institutions.

436
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,860
Go ahead admirably, Duh. Um,

437
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,640
uh,
Jasmine,

438
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,120
uh, I, I asked Jasmine to
think about the passage,

439
00:28:35,121 --> 00:28:39,560
which begins with chopping onions
unusually early in the morning,

440
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,270
and then the discovery switch followed
that and what it might tell us about the

441
00:28:44,271 --> 00:28:46,100
role of religion.
Yeah.

442
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,010
Speech 90 in the white tiger.
Um,

443
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:53,680
it talks about like a
discount rate of firearm, uh,

444
00:28:53,681 --> 00:28:58,640
about the number one driver,
uh, Ron per side. And, um,

445
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:03,150
basically he just, uh, he found
out that, um, rappers that was, um,

446
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,860
a Muslim because he was observing
Ramadan and he's not eating,

447
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,930
he's chopping up onions in the,
yeah.

448
00:29:10,931 --> 00:29:13,230
In the dark because he
has to fast during today.

449
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:18,420
And so by Ron was able to use this
fact as an advantage to him. And,

450
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,343
um,

451
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:24,530
basically because the landlord is
a Hindu and there is a kind of a,

452
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:30,231
like a religious tension between the
Hindu majority and the Muslims and

453
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:35,250
traditional parts of
India. So, um, uh, when he,

454
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,770
he,
uh,

455
00:29:37,771 --> 00:29:42,771
he talked to another servant about this
and he able to make his way to Dell ages

456
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,700
because he was using this fat.

457
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:48,300
Okay.
So historically this,

458
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:53,630
this cleavage between Muslim and Hindu
has been a huge factor in the history of

459
00:29:54,181 --> 00:29:56,470
South Asia. Yes. Um,

460
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:59,520
basically I guess a lot of Hindus,

461
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:04,230
I thought that Muslims with like
an invader culture and also in,

462
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:09,360
um, like the 1947, uh, when they had, uh,

463
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:14,130
well basically India was
subdivided into Pakistan, a Muslim,

464
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,270
uh,

465
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:20,270
subcontinent and a Muslim country
and the like now modern India.

466
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,373
So

467
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:25,280
go ahead.
And the,

468
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,970
the other layer is captured
in the line in the book.

469
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,180
There is no hatred like that of the number
two servant for the number one server.

470
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:39,690
Right. And that close conflict, uh, we,

471
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,760
we recognize you see that
everywhere around here.

472
00:30:41,761 --> 00:30:45,690
You're seeing even on the faculty,
um,

473
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:52,950
um, Susie park. Yeah, that's the question

474
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:58,960
I was going to ask you about,
about um,

475
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:03,420
serving sure about hospital
need to servant and so on.

476
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:09,520
Well, I guess, um, um,

477
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:15,170
well basically it's kinda similar to
serve in hostility to masters I think.

478
00:31:15,191 --> 00:31:18,700
Cause like when you look at
like the person to person,

479
00:31:18,701 --> 00:31:23,170
like you're not actually hating the
person themselves, but more like, because,

480
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,420
um, you're, um,

481
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:30,190
like he has this kind of like
bitterness at the system itself.

482
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,270
But then like in some part of
the book it said like they don't,

483
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:37,980
they're really like blamed up bigger
government like the nation itself,

484
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:43,020
but they're more about like play me like
the local like smaller like level and

485
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:47,350
like the landlords. Um,
so it's Kinda like, um,

486
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:53,040
they're like the white tiger was more
into like hitting the number one driver

487
00:31:55,691 --> 00:31:57,670
rather than like the system itself.

488
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,250
Right.

489
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:04,250
And so the idea is the displacement of
hostility to the huge system on to the

490
00:32:07,471 --> 00:32:11,470
little system within
the household that fas,

491
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,910
um, the, there's a,

492
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,740
I think one of the great lines
in the book is the one about

493
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:26,220
the coupe, the coupe, the chicken
coop is garnered from where them,

494
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,950
what's all that?
I mean,

495
00:32:28,951 --> 00:32:32,250
the way I interpreted it was it's
more like of a social construct where,

496
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:34,460
I mean if you just look at the back
of the book, it says Blah Blah.

497
00:32:34,461 --> 00:32:36,990
Malawi is a complicated
man, servant, philosopher,

498
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,620
etc. But when you're inside the coop,

499
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:42,080
you're only thinking of how
can I be a better servant?

500
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,670
That's a social construct whereby,

501
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:47,990
I mean we can even relate it to the
hatred of 71 72 to serve a one is because

502
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,230
the servant, you're not thinking
of becoming a master, what you're,

503
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,310
what you're aspiring to a certain one.

504
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:56,120
And it just scares you to get
out of that social construct.

505
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,610
And the only way to get out of it as
soon as it was resolved or something

506
00:32:58,611 --> 00:33:01,250
extreme like killing your master.
Okay.

507
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,970
So that often the victims of a huge,

508
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,340
hugely oppressive situation,
uh,

509
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:14,020
are hostile mortar mortar people who
are their peers or near peers then to

510
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:16,970
people who are their vast superiors.

511
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,650
And that's a pretty good
generalization actually. Um,

512
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,653
Sebastian,

513
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:27,893
there we are.

514
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,130
Tell us about the car accident.

515
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:40,780
All right. So, uh, in page
one 37, there's a Pinky,

516
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:44,060
madam decides that she wants to drive.
Um,

517
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,930
it tells the driver to get out,
then she comes back.

518
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,680
She was very drunk at this point,
comes back, gets in the car,

519
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:54,710
tells the driver to get back in the car
and then drives off. And he hits, uh,

520
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,740
something.
At first we don't know what it is.

521
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:00,530
We are quickly discovered it's a child.
Um,

522
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:05,710
and everyone's kind of in
shock. Uh, and I think,

523
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,800
I don't know if you want me to say
more of the details of the accident,

524
00:34:08,801 --> 00:34:13,801
but the biggest implication is that then
by Rahm is asked to take the blame for

525
00:34:14,801 --> 00:34:19,110
this, for this accident that,
that his master's wife, uh,

526
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,230
committed. Um, and
instead of thinking, uh,

527
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:27,970
of how he can not take the blame,
he kind of starts automatically assuming,

528
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:31,660
how am I going to survive in jail?
What am I going to do survive? Um,

529
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,180
and I think it goes back to that thing
that you were just talking about in the

530
00:34:34,181 --> 00:34:39,010
rooster coop where it's just
absolute perpetual servitude.

531
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,560
Uh,
it's kind of very much intrinsic and mark.

532
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,400
Okay. Go ahead now. And, and what
the, what this is a straight forward,

533
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,820
straight forward criminal corruption,
right.

534
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:54,590
And this criminal act that the,
uh,

535
00:34:55,080 --> 00:35:00,080
the cosh Koppel are commanding and the,

536
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,210
the white tiger

537
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,820
basically basically just lives with it,

538
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:14,190
right. And later in the
book. And where are you

539
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,430
later in the book? And, um,

540
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,340
the concept of rage gets to be center
stage. I think on page one 96 does it

541
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,410
help us with that and what's
going on with that? Well,

542
00:35:31,411 --> 00:35:33,120
I think to a certain extent,

543
00:35:33,121 --> 00:35:38,100
he realized that he realizes that
the only way for him to escape kind

544
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,140
of from the rooster goop
is to do something extreme.

545
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,190
And one thing that he talks about when
he describes the roost whole rooster

546
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:48,990
analogy is that like he mentioned
family as part of that explanation.

547
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:51,930
He says that family is like
the thing, little cool, sorry.

548
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,930
The family is the thing
that keeps you in the group.

549
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,540
And so I think like,

550
00:35:57,541 --> 00:36:01,710
he needs a really powerful emotion to
counteract the family ties in order to

551
00:36:01,711 --> 00:36:02,544
break free.

552
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:03,663
Okay.

553
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:08,670
So he's in two different coercive networks
wanting to do with his own family at

554
00:36:10,331 --> 00:36:14,500
another to do with, uh, the,
the family, which employs him.

555
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,093
Um,

556
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:24,820
uh, Drake right here. Yeah. Um,

557
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:28,970
the most dramatic passage in
the book has to do with the,

558
00:36:28,971 --> 00:36:31,790
you the ulterior uses of a whiskey bar,

559
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,913
but

560
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,200
at ballroom and uses the bottle to kill
the son of his employer and do use,

561
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,930
he does this to steal the money that,
uh,

562
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:49,370
a shock was going to use to bribe
officials and he sort of goes off it,

563
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,760
takes it and starts his own life.

564
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:54,390
Okay.
And how do you interpret what he does?

565
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,360
Uh,
I saw it as sort of emblematic of the,

566
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,190
the new India sort of

567
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,183
Oh,

568
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,340
uh,

569
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:09,990
taking over instead of replacing the old
India that a shotgun and his family are

570
00:37:09,991 --> 00:37:14,250
sort of representative of, um, he
sees the son of a land donor. Uh, he,

571
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,260
he's wealthy and he's,

572
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:19,350
he's using his money to try
to keep himself in power
by bribing these officials.

573
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,243
Um,

574
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:25,320
and a shot takes that money or borrow
and takes the money and he goes and uses

575
00:37:25,321 --> 00:37:28,560
it to sort of start his own business
and get himself up to the top.

576
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:31,520
I think it says an act of
entrepreneurship. Right.

577
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,870
I know there were huge
amount of parody in this.

578
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:38,323
MMM.

579
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,820
You,
how do you judge him for this?

580
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:49,120
I mean, I, I would say that it was,

581
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:53,270
I wouldn't condone it, but I can,
I can sort of understand it. Um,

582
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,370
what'd you go so far as to
say justifiable homicide?

583
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:04,130
No, not justifiable. Right. In
the sense that, you know, he,

584
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:07,650
the man that he, he murdered
deserved it. But, you know,

585
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,700
for him it was the only way to, to break
out of the life that he'd been living.

586
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,900
And it's, to me, it just sort
of, it really captured, um,

587
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,930
just how traumatic for our society,

588
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,660
a change like monitorization can be.
You know,

589
00:38:21,661 --> 00:38:26,661
everyone's scrambling to get
themselves ahead and in the process,

590
00:38:26,731 --> 00:38:27,930
you know,
people get stepped on.

591
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:32,860
Okay. So you see it as a rational
act, not an act of range.

592
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,250
Yeah, I think it was
definitely a rational act. Um,

593
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:42,310
but I don't know if that justifies it.
Okay. Well, I don't think it justifies it.

594
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:46,000
I,
I'm not much on justifiable homicide as a,

595
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,090
that's a cultural trope.
Um,

596
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:54,480
but it makes it easy to
understand, doesn't it? Uh,

597
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:57,430
Amy Chu or in the law
school has a book about

598
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:03,930
that begins with a story from her
own family in the Philippines and um,

599
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:05,381
in it,

600
00:39:05,381 --> 00:39:10,381
her grandmother is murdered by
the family show for her and the,

601
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:12,643
um,

602
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:18,630
the police record where motive
is recorded as just one word,

603
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:21,603
revenge.

604
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:28,320
And the relationship between people
who are completely dependent,

605
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:33,990
servants of arbitrary,
uh,

606
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:37,990
families who behave
arbitrarily and cruelty.

607
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:42,730
This is a, an ancient story and
it's one that's easy to understand.

608
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,720
Now let's get back to bigger picture.

609
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:54,020
Why is ballroom so weak?
There's, I had another question.

610
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:59,040
I asked somebody about English
language. Who did I ask? Okay,

611
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:01,130
I'll ask myself.
Uh,

612
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,200
English plays a huge part in the class
structure of a society like India and

613
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:13,300
the, let's just list ballrooms,
weaknesses economically.

614
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:19,450
One is English is not his first language.

615
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:25,840
His family and the debt
to the stork wasn't,

616
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,453
yeah,

617
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:35,540
the debt which gets him jerked out of
school and which is a constant burden to

618
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:37,660
the family.
That's another weakness.

619
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:43,930
He drops out of school because his
uncle rips him out of school actually

620
00:40:43,931 --> 00:40:47,560
forcefully.
Other weaknesses cast.

621
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:51,760
He is not from an advantage
task sweet makers.

622
00:40:51,761 --> 00:40:56,050
I don't quite understand
why that's that disadvantage,

623
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:00,070
but uh,
uh,

624
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,800
what about the world
demographic transition?

625
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,210
So world demographic transition
bearing down on this young man at all?

626
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,393
Yes,

627
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,240
because the huge surge of population
in the darkness of India creates a

628
00:41:19,631 --> 00:41:23,890
devastatingly plentiful
supply of unskilled labor

629
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:30,540
so that the market equilibrium
price of unskilled labor is very,

630
00:41:30,611 --> 00:41:31,450
very low.

631
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,560
And the standards you have to use in
treating employees in unskilled or semi

632
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:44,110
semi skilled jobs in order to
keep them with you are near zero.

633
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:46,670
Right?

634
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:51,670
Rick Shaw Por Rickshaw pullers have
essentially no market power and it has

635
00:41:54,531 --> 00:41:56,840
everything to do with demography.

636
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:03,280
It also of course has to do
with educational opportunity
command of the Lingua

637
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:07,430
Franca of the country,
all those things.

638
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,830
But when we talk about the
demographic transition, it's this,

639
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:18,400
it's this ultimately benign
story about going from short,

640
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:25,610
short lives and many babies to long lives
and fewer babies over a period of time.

641
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,240
But there's a huge coercive aspect of the
way it works out during the transition

642
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,700
for people who don't
have demographic luck.

643
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:39,380
And luck of a luck. Big Time. Luck.

644
00:42:39,381 --> 00:42:42,740
Historical luck is a pretty big thing.

645
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:46,430
I'll give you another example.
A new haven.

646
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:54,100
New Haven had very few black citizens
before World War II and at the time of

647
00:42:56,931 --> 00:43:01,010
World War II when southern
agriculture was pushing,

648
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,380
uh,
labor off the land,

649
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,870
most of the black families who ever came
to new haven came here in about a 15

650
00:43:08,871 --> 00:43:13,871
year period and they came in search of
a industrial employment exactly a decade

651
00:43:18,861 --> 00:43:22,910
before that industrial
employment collapsed and went,

652
00:43:22,911 --> 00:43:27,911
guess where south industrial employment
went south seeking lower energy costs

653
00:43:29,451 --> 00:43:33,290
and cheaper labor so that the economic,

654
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:35,690
it's of course a much more complex story,

655
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:39,050
but the timing couldn't have
been worse and ball roms,

656
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:43,700
timing in demographic history
couldn't have been much worse.

657
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:47,870
Now Wednesday's case about Selco,

658
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,800
let's hope I can get
this to run with sound.

659
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,063
Okay.

660
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,500
Despite rapid economic growth,

661
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,860
India has the largest
population of poor in the world.

662
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,990
It's a mix between the old developed
and underdeveloped country and as a 650

663
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:34,650
million people still on the party line
of 650 million people not having access

664
00:44:34,651 --> 00:44:36,000
to a proper energy services.

665
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:41,100
And then at two o'clock in the morning
at traffic lights you have built begging

666
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:44,340
six year old, 10 year old girls
begging with flowers go to Bombay,

667
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:48,400
tough exam and Andrea talking of 8%
growth isn't that we're creating a divide.

668
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:53,710
We are dividing that actually going
to be a much father social unrest,

669
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:57,730
social unsustainability for the country
and for the rest of the developing world.

670
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:02,250
Frustrated by the disparity
between rich and poor. Can we,

671
00:45:02,251 --> 00:45:07,230
Shandy has made it his life's work to
create sustainable solutions to bridge

672
00:45:07,231 --> 00:45:08,064
this gap

673
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:15,470
in 1995 who each founded Soko to bring
customized solar solutions to India's

674
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,200
poor.

675
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:22,200
The mission of the company would be that
we would do interventions that would

676
00:45:22,331 --> 00:45:26,770
have a direct impact on the quality
of life and in a very sustainable way.

677
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:31,870
I spent quite some time in rural parts
of India and then looked at rural

678
00:45:31,871 --> 00:45:32,704
electrification.

679
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:36,250
Okay.

680
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:40,890
Hamish handy saw firsthand how the rural
poor struggles with daily power cuts.

681
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:45,100
Well,
many more had no access to electricity.

682
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:48,610
He knew that by getting them
affordable solar lighting,

683
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:51,340
he could help improve their lives overall

684
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:58,790
with the right customize solutions.
Garment makers could, so, no, sorry.

685
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,513
No.
Yeah,

686
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,470
that's triple vendors could
sell products after dusk.

687
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,200
Children can study longer.

688
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:14,863
Hello.

689
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:19,120
And midwives could
deliver babies underlined.

690
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:21,220
Okay.

691
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:25,260
When you look at an individual household
or community or a village or a state,

692
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,830
the political dynamics,
the social dynamics,

693
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:33,840
the relationship between neighbors was
as important as looking at what the

694
00:46:33,841 --> 00:46:38,280
product was. You cannot paint
everybody with the same brush,

695
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:42,340
don't speak a lot in remote areas.

696
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:45,790
And having centralized solar
parks is not going to help them.

697
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:51,490
Can we just realized that in order to
succeed Selco miss develop decentralized

698
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:56,140
energy solutions as one of the
first companies to do so in India,

699
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:58,360
Selco entered unchartered territory.

700
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,570
There are no more rules to follow.

701
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:07,080
So the bad years where were
not very known, what actually

702
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:09,610
jumped into the realm.

703
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,430
Okay.
MMM.

704
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:19,010
A couple of announcements.
In closing the case,

705
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,800
the case is in two parts a and B.

706
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:26,390
Both are posted on classes be too.
For Wednesday's class on Monday,

707
00:47:26,391 --> 00:47:30,100
I will be here only by video.
Um,

708
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:35,790
I'm in Washington Monday and I'm going
to speak the lecture to a lens and a play

709
00:47:37,901 --> 00:47:42,570
it in my own absence. But otherwise,
everything would be normal. The,

710
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:47,510
um, uh, and the exams, we'll
come back on Wednesday. Uh,

711
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:52,570
my impression is that the
grades are outrageously high.
