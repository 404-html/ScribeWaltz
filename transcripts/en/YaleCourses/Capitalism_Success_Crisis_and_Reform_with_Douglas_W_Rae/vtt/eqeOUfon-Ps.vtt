WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.070
Uh,

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.070
we have heretofore flown at a relatively high altitude with the likes of Adam

3
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.140
Smith,
a Karl Marx,
Joseph Schumpeter,
Faa Hayak,

4
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.570
uh,
and today,
and continuing from here to the midterm,

5
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.210
we are going to deal with real businesses and it is our,

6
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.550
uh,
considerable privilege to have with us.

7
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.360
Sharon Oster who is a Harvard Phd in economics,

8
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.130
uh,

9
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.130
is a widely thought to be the wisest owl on the management of nonprofit

10
00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:52.000
organizations anywhere in the world,
uh,

11
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.210
and is the Fredrick Wolf professor of entrepreneurship at the School of

12
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.500
Management and is in addition to that,
uh,
dean of that school.

13
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.340
So please help me welcome Sharon Oster.

14
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.800
<v 2>Thank you all in my,
uh,
in my youth.</v>

15
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:17.580
I taught at Yale College and I taught generations of undergrads,

16
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.490
intermediate micro.
Um,
so it's nice to be back,
uh,

17
00:01:21.491 --> 00:01:25.200
amongst you teaching something a little bit about economics.

18
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.760
I hope to warned you,
but I'm going to treat it like a business school class,

19
00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:31.530
which means I'm going to cold call on you.

20
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:35.280
And people in the back should know that I especially like clung on to people in

21
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:38.580
the back because they tend to doze otherwise.
Um,

22
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.810
so you might want to change your seat.
Um,
so,
uh,

23
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.050
let's think about this case a little bit.
So imagine yourself,

24
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.250
you're one of the three entrepreneurs,
Ferrari gold and Dylan.

25
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.220
The world is your oyster and Sam's,
hence,
here you are,
you've founded this firm.

26
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.230
You've got a product that's this kit that can be used in heart surgery,

27
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.580
big market.
There's a million people who need heart disease,

28
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.300
who need some kind of heart surgery every year.
Growing market,

29
00:02:09.301 --> 00:02:12.770
we're all getting fatter,
we're getting older,
we're getting weaker,

30
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.010
we're getting less healthy.

31
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.370
You might think that's a problem for President Obama and the health care,

32
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:19.800
but it's an opportunity for our entrepreneurs.

33
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.750
This is that you even in the US,
they could imagine $1 billion market,
uh,

34
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.551
in this business.

35
00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:30.450
Not to mention the rest of the world where people are also overeating and

36
00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:32.640
getting less and less healthy over time.

37
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.990
And yet when we,
when the case opens,

38
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.690
they seem like they have some worries on their mind.

39
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.460
So if you were one of those individuals,
[inaudible] guys in this case,

40
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.230
what are you thinking about?

41
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.550
<v 1>Okay.</v>

42
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.850
<v 2>Okay.
So what do you mean by marketing?
What's,
what's the issue?</v>

43
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.873
<v 1>Well,</v>

44
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.670
we do do a lot of money and help out consumers,

45
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.840
but you have to work through the physicians.
They're the ones

46
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.020
grading.
Okay.

47
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.950
<v 2>So one set of questions.</v>

48
00:03:12.951 --> 00:03:17.120
We're going to have our set of questions about the buyer and it can be a lot of

49
00:03:17.121 --> 00:03:18.140
quit talking about the buyer,

50
00:03:18.141 --> 00:03:21.920
but let's just get that up there as one set of things we're worried about.

51
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:22.970
What are you worried about?

52
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.580
<v 1>Worried about the,
the competitiveness.</v>

53
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.850
<v 2>Good.
So you know,
at the moment and let her have it.</v>

54
00:03:35.851 --> 00:03:40.070
She's doing okay.
Uh,
so,
so at the moment,
um,

55
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.940
I only have one competitor,

56
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.620
so what would we call that if we were an economics class?
I do happily.
Okay.

57
00:03:46.621 --> 00:03:49.080
Now one of the things we,
now we're back to Wa police.

58
00:03:49.081 --> 00:03:53.700
If there any kind of a sensible duopolies,
they're probably doing pretty well.

59
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.600
This duopolistic my competitor.
What's his price point look like?

60
00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.843
<v 1>Great.</v>

61
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.500
<v 2>Yeah,
till he,
I'm charging fast and bucks from my thing.
What's he charge in?</v>

62
00:04:03.501 --> 00:04:07.550
Anybody remember the number?
5,000 no,
that's they're good.
They're good.

63
00:04:07.551 --> 00:04:11.210
They know the numbers.
So,
so you know,
I'm thinking to myself,

64
00:04:11.211 --> 00:04:12.650
you're worried about the competition,

65
00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:16.370
but I got one competitor and he's charging five times my price.

66
00:04:16.371 --> 00:04:19.460
That makes me look like I'm pretty good.

67
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.590
Is there something else you worried about?

68
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.250
<v 1>Good.
Okay.</v>

69
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.570
<v 2>So one thing I'm worried about right now is my existing competitor but or</v>

70
00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:40.340
doesn't tell me that I should only worry about a static competition.
Desi,

71
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.400
what is Schumpeter's model about what Ha,
what's happening with competition?

72
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.200
<v 1>Creative destruction
roll.</v>

73
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:53.723
Okay.

74
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.720
<v 2>So with things like better worry about is not just the EC stamped was hard port,</v>

75
00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:02.090
but I bet to think a little bit about who else is coming.

76
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.190
So I'm going to be thinking a little bit about what Michael Porter,

77
00:05:07.191 --> 00:05:11.960
who you also looked at,
I guess is new entry and how do I understand new entry.

78
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.180
And then if I think about the flip side of Schumpeter,

79
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.050
not only am I worried about some new guys coming in and destroying me,

80
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:26.060
but as I come in,
I'm of course competing against some existing players.

81
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.990
So I need to think a little bit about

82
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.190
existing players

83
00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.190
and the way in which they are attacking this market,
this market.

84
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.970
And one of the things you're going to observe a bat almost every new product as

85
00:05:40.971 --> 00:05:45.110
it enters the market,
even if it thinks of itself as a new product,

86
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.430
it has existing competitors.
So many of you may have kindles.

87
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:50.930
If you look at kindles,

88
00:05:50.931 --> 00:05:55.280
the kindle is obviously also worried about what's happening with the Sony reader

89
00:05:55.281 --> 00:05:56.810
and all the new things that look like a,

90
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.010
but really from the point of candles from Kendall's point of view,

91
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.880
it's real job at the moment is converting all those people who are buying hard

92
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:06.350
covered books.
Okay?

93
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:11.351
So it is thinking a little bit about conversion of uh,

94
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.600
consumers from the way in which they are currently used to solving a problem to

95
00:06:16.821 --> 00:06:18.800
your new way of solving a problem.

96
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.020
So we're going to have to think here in competition,

97
00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:25.760
not only about the guys that are doing it our way,
but the existing players.

98
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.080
And we're going to have to think about these things in the context of set of

99
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:33.560
issues involving the customers,
how I connect to the customers,

100
00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:38.150
how I deliver to whoever these customers are,
and not to think about that.

101
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.590
Um,
a set of different um,
uh,
products,
uh,

102
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.510
for the needs of our,
uh,
of our people.
I'm going to stay with those two,
um,

103
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:53.950
things for awhile and then Doug will help me pull down the slides to get to some

104
00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:55.010
other questions in the end.

105
00:06:55.011 --> 00:06:56.930
But this is going to take care of us for a little while.

106
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.390
So let's stick with the competition part of it first.
So before I came along,

107
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.090
kind of how we set that people got their heart,
a problem,

108
00:07:06.091 --> 00:07:08.450
self guy in the back with the pink shirt and the last row.

109
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.673
<v 1>MMM,</v>

110
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.590
<v 2>good.
And do you have a vague idea about,</v>

111
00:07:17.591 --> 00:07:21.690
of these 1 million patients about how they divide up?

112
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:29.040
Anybody else remember about the numbers
to the nap?

113
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.820
Perfect.
Um,
so the cabbage,
it's about 350,000.

114
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:39.370
And the NGO plasty
Oh,
if it's a number like that,

115
00:07:39.371 --> 00:07:41.830
you can just yell.
You don't have even have to raise your hand.

116
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.370
We're much more casual group than that in business school.
Um,

117
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.250
so I've got two different ways of doing it.
Let's stick with you.

118
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:53.170
Kick up my candy.
Good.
So tell me a little bit about,

119
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:54.583
uh,

120
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:59.610
my organization cardiothoracics competing against competitors in each of those

121
00:08:00.221 --> 00:08:01.054
two markets.

122
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.470
<v 1>One
word,</v>

123
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.133
good.

124
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:24.330
Whereas the bypass,
it was usually in that case,

125
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:26.710
creating more trauma.

126
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.710
<v 2>Okay.
So one of the things about this particular product is in its infancy,</v>

127
00:08:34.711 --> 00:08:38.150
it could only do one or two vessels at a time and that limited,

128
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:43.190
limited it really pretty much to this side of the picture.

129
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:48.710
Because most of what we were doing this side of the picture involved as you

130
00:08:48.811 --> 00:08:51.060
indicated,
a little more drastic,

131
00:08:51.061 --> 00:08:55.110
cutting a and typically then more treatment of multiple.

132
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.910
So generation one sort of focused on

133
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.330
this part of the market.
Now,
as you indicated,

134
00:09:06.331 --> 00:09:10.290
the technological trajectory was to more and more vessels.

135
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.560
So we're going to spend a little bit of money for this firm and we're gonna move

136
00:09:15.901 --> 00:09:19.380
to not only solving those problems,
but solving those problems.

137
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.930
Does that change come without a cost?

138
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.080
As I moved from generation one degeneration two to generation three,

139
00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:30.270
I get more and more vessels.
Do I lose anything

140
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.730
<v 1>if the market over and over again?</v>

141
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:43.930
<v 2>Okay.
So one set of questions is,
as I'm doing anything technological,</v>

142
00:09:43.931 --> 00:09:46.390
I'm going to have to invest real cash in this one,

143
00:09:46.391 --> 00:09:47.920
if to think a little bit about that.

144
00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:51.610
But is there anything else I lose as I move from one generation to another?

145
00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:55.083
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

146
00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:01.990
<v 2>Okay.
Well that's true.</v>

147
00:10:01.991 --> 00:10:06.370
It's hard to do more vessels because I've got more things I'm trying to do as

148
00:10:06.371 --> 00:10:07.204
it's beating.

149
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.930
But there's something else I'm doing is I moved from generation one onward.

150
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:12.903
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

151
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:21.170
<v 2>Great.
So if you think about this product in the beginning it had to kind of</v>

152
00:10:21.171 --> 00:10:25.640
technological features.
One was it dealt with the bleeding,
heart beating part,

153
00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:31.370
bleeding heart,
uh,
and the second one hit at a smaller cut.
Okay.

154
00:10:31.371 --> 00:10:33.350
So you didn't want to cut all the way through people.

155
00:10:33.351 --> 00:10:37.700
You actually wanted to have a little bitty hole,
uh,
so small incision

156
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.920
and it turned out the,

157
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.680
the beating heart eliminated some of the neurological problems and the small

158
00:10:45.681 --> 00:10:48.650
incision made people recover a little bit faster.

159
00:10:48.651 --> 00:10:52.040
So they were different elements of the product that we liked.

160
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:56.990
And when we moved from the kind of only a couple of vessels,

161
00:10:56.991 --> 00:11:01.610
too many vessels were giving up on some of the functionality associated with the

162
00:11:01.611 --> 00:11:05.810
product by cutting us cutting up a patient's a little bit more.

163
00:11:05.811 --> 00:11:09.440
And that's another feature that Schumpeter and others have talked about,

164
00:11:09.441 --> 00:11:13.550
including clay Christianson who talks about disruptive innovation that when you

165
00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:18.350
make a product change,
it is,
it is often the case that you don't just,

166
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.800
um,
improve and prove and prove and prove.
You give up things.

167
00:11:21.801 --> 00:11:24.790
There are trade offs that you're making and the trade offs are not just,

168
00:11:24.791 --> 00:11:27.200
it cost you more money and you get more functionality,

169
00:11:27.201 --> 00:11:31.940
but sometimes you actually push along one dimension and you're drawing back

170
00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:34.670
actually in what,
in the qualities of another dimension

171
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.670
in this situation.

172
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:44.330
Why put the money in and give up the small incision piece just to enable

173
00:11:46.021 --> 00:11:51.021
yourself to move into this piece of the market after all the one or two vessels

174
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:56.710
market is the biggest chunk of the market and it's pretty darn big.

175
00:11:56.711 --> 00:12:00.370
I'm just a little guy.
Why don't I,
you know,
manage as I,

176
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:04.420
as I am focusing on that part of the market.
Why is that?

177
00:12:04.421 --> 00:12:08.910
I have to go,
why is it I decide to transform myself here in the back,

178
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:09.880
the woman in the corner,

179
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:27.330
you have to say that louder for me or slower though.

180
00:12:27.331 --> 00:12:29.460
I got a piece of Panay and get it all.
So let's start again.

181
00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:33.150
<v 1>We're good.
We're all
good.</v>

182
00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:46.530
<v 2>Okay.</v>

183
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:50.850
So one of the things I'm going to be thinking about here as I'm thinking about

184
00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:56.060
technologically what to do to my product is that when I changed what I can do

185
00:12:56.881 --> 00:12:57.840
technologically,

186
00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:02.700
I am picking a different set of markets that I'm trying to compete against.

187
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:09.140
And these markets are going to look very different in terms of the kind of buyer

188
00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.300
issues and the complimentary is,

189
00:13:11.301 --> 00:13:15.180
and we'll talk about what I mean by that in a minute for each of these two parts

190
00:13:15.181 --> 00:13:15.990
of the market.

191
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:20.990
So I am choosing my competition in some sense by choosing my technology I'm

192
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:27.020
choosing to go against here I set of who's doing these cabbage things?

193
00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:33.900
These are surgeons.
Okay,
so these are surgeons.
They're cutting people up.

194
00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.890
Who is doing the angioplasty,
what?
What looks different about that?

195
00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:42.570
These are cardiologists.
They're being done in a different kind of an office,

196
00:13:42.571 --> 00:13:44.280
much less invasive procedure,

197
00:13:44.281 --> 00:13:49.281
very different features associated with these two parts of the market and my

198
00:13:49.561 --> 00:13:52.770
ability,
given what I am to compete in each of these two markets,

199
00:13:52.771 --> 00:13:54.930
it's going to vary much.
Very much so.

200
00:13:54.931 --> 00:13:59.931
The technological trajectory is influenced by the economics and the competitive

201
00:14:00.151 --> 00:14:04.410
piece of the story that you are not just imagining yourself a bunch of

202
00:14:04.411 --> 00:14:08.310
scientists in a lab just trying to make it better,
better,
better,
better.

203
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:12.390
You've got a sense set of managers on top who were saying,
you know what?

204
00:14:12.391 --> 00:14:16.710
We need to have an improvement on this dimension because otherwise we're never

205
00:14:16.711 --> 00:14:18.570
going to be any place in this marketplace.

206
00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:22.230
And a decision was made and we're going to turn to figuring out why this

207
00:14:22.231 --> 00:14:23.100
decision was made,

208
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:27.810
that it was going to be important to be in this part of the market and not just

209
00:14:27.811 --> 00:14:32.811
this part of the market to get myself some more functionality with the multi

210
00:14:33.011 --> 00:14:34.500
that with multi vessels.

211
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.220
Okay.
So to think about why I needed to go that way.

212
00:14:42.221 --> 00:14:44.500
I want to switch over a little bit to this piece.

213
00:14:44.501 --> 00:14:48.760
We're going to come back to this part in a minute as well and I want to think a

214
00:14:48.761 --> 00:14:52.010
little bit about the buyer issues.

215
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:57.530
So the woman in the back said,
if I want to do something about,
uh,

216
00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:02.210
knowing my,
my technology,
I've got to figure out what is the consumer want

217
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:08.990
that the relevant decision maker in this case.
So I'll put that here.
I got up,

218
00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:10.200
I got a patient,

219
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.400
I'll call that patient the consumer.

220
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.510
So when people go,
when they're trying to have some heart procedure,

221
00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.200
did they just,
you know,
there's something,
the matter with your heart,

222
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:29.460
they just come up to you and say,
Gee,
how do you want me to do that?
Well,

223
00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.680
how do you think,
what proceeds you think I should use?

224
00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.340
So who else is a decision maker in this situation now?

225
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:39.583
<v 1>Oh,</v>

226
00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:53.410
<v 2>and in fact there are actually three different doctors you might think play a</v>

227
00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:56.500
role in this situation.
The one you mentioned as a surgeon.

228
00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:03.090
Good.
So there's your basic GP or whatever it is.
You have some guy you go,

229
00:16:03.091 --> 00:16:05.160
you've put on,
I've got a pain in my chest,

230
00:16:05.161 --> 00:16:06.810
he says you better do something about that.

231
00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:12.890
And then there is a interventional cardiologist who does this piece of the

232
00:16:14.041 --> 00:16:18.660
business.
Okay,
so you've,
you,
some doctor says go see somebody.

233
00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:21.510
And typically he actually says,

234
00:16:21.511 --> 00:16:26.511
go see this guy and this guy figures out can he help you or can she help you?

235
00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:29.250
And if not,
they send you to a surgeon.

236
00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:34.140
So you've got interveners are decision makers all along,

237
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:36.210
uh,
the doctor element.

238
00:16:36.211 --> 00:16:41.211
Is there anybody else you think that if I'm the inventors of this little kit,

239
00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.930
is there anyone else I need to talk to,
need to think about?
Yeah.
Okay.

240
00:16:45.931 --> 00:16:50.370
Insurance Company.
So it turns out one of the curiosities about health care,

241
00:16:50.371 --> 00:16:54.390
and it's the one that's bedeviling the Obama team now in terms of figuring

242
00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:59.820
things out is we have this breakage of the link between people who make

243
00:17:00.901 --> 00:17:05.010
decisions about things and the people who pay for it.
So in this situation,

244
00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:09.960
the patients have some stake in the procedure.
The doctors have a lot to say,

245
00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.270
but the poor insurance companies

246
00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:19.970
and or the government or actually doing a lot of the paying for it.

247
00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:24.420
And needless to say,
and that kind of arrangement,

248
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.560
eventually the insurance company starts having your opinion too and making its

249
00:17:28.561 --> 00:17:29.390
opinion felt.

250
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:34.380
And if you are in the business of medical devices or Pharma in any way at all,

251
00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.840
you're going to be thinking a little bit about how's your insurance company's

252
00:17:37.841 --> 00:17:39.630
going to reimburse for this kind of thing.

253
00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:43.770
Is there anybody else that has an opinion about this?
Yeah.

254
00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:46.620
Hospitals.
Why do the hospital's care

255
00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.780
so good?

256
00:17:59.781 --> 00:18:04.781
So hospitals actually turn out to have an interesting set of issues about this

257
00:18:05.031 --> 00:18:06.020
particular thing.

258
00:18:06.021 --> 00:18:10.370
Hospitals to the extent that they are reimbursed by insurance.

259
00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:16.080
And that's going to be true for most of the patients in this,
uh,
in this,
uh,

260
00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:21.100
environment are reimbursed on what's known as a capitated basis,

261
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.430
which means an insurance company says to you,

262
00:18:25.431 --> 00:18:28.970
if you're treating somebody who has a particular heart problem,

263
00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.100
I'm going to give you a fixed amount for it.

264
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:36.290
That's quite a difference from the way we used to,
uh,
insurance used to pay,

265
00:18:36.291 --> 00:18:39.650
which was you treated somebody,
let me see what your bills are.

266
00:18:39.651 --> 00:18:43.040
I'm going to pay you in an attempt to get some kind of efficiency.

267
00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:47.850
They actually went to a system sometimes called DRGs,
um,

268
00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:50.780
in which they said,
you know,
for uh,
men,

269
00:18:50.781 --> 00:18:54.110
average more or less healthy guy who has this problem,

270
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:58.510
I'm going to pay you x to treat him if I'm going to pay,
if,

271
00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:02.420
if that's the way I have my hospital reimbursement happen.

272
00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.410
How does the hospital feel about my particular device?

273
00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:08.683
What do you think?

274
00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:17.040
Okay.
So one thing it doesn't like is it's just costing them money.

275
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.340
So it's kind of just taking it off the top.
Mike.

276
00:19:20.341 --> 00:19:22.200
There be anything about if they would like,

277
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:28.670
<v 1>yeah,
back
to recovery.</v>

278
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.920
<v 2>Uh,
again there could be other people care about the mortality in particular.</v>

279
00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:40.670
But the first thing you said was about recovery time.

280
00:19:40.671 --> 00:19:43.160
Why might the hospital be especially interested in that?
Yeah.

281
00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:44.483
<v 1>Well because</v>

282
00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:50.743
in

283
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:57.720
the run you recover and get them rolling.
Okay.

284
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:04.140
<v 2>So it's actually going to bury for different hospitals depending on the contract</v>

285
00:20:04.141 --> 00:20:04.980
that they're going to get.

286
00:20:04.981 --> 00:20:09.981
So for some hospitals I just give you a fee and that would mean if I get,

287
00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.770
if this procedure gets you out of your bed and to home faster,

288
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:18.210
that's benefit for the hospital because they basically only have to keep you in

289
00:20:18.211 --> 00:20:20.280
three days,
not seven.
I saved some money.

290
00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:25.380
On the other hand,
what does this device,

291
00:20:25.381 --> 00:20:28.830
due to the amount of time I need to use it as an operating surgeon

292
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.780
probably increases it.
And from the point of view of hospitals,

293
00:20:33.781 --> 00:20:37.530
most hospitals are more constrained in operating room time.

294
00:20:37.531 --> 00:20:40.500
Then they are in hospital bed time.
So again,

295
00:20:40.501 --> 00:20:44.250
it's gonna depend a little bit out in the hospital how they feel about this and

296
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:48.280
a little bit on how much we've pushed down in terms of the insurance.

297
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:52.000
But the hospital is definitely going to have some kind of say now notice

298
00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:53.680
something about these groups.

299
00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:58.980
They all have opinions.
They all have a role to play in the,

300
00:20:58.981 --> 00:21:03.981
in the kind of decision that's going to affect my ability to compete in these

301
00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:05.670
parts of the market.

302
00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.590
Did they all have the same kinds of preferences?

303
00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:13.870
<v 1>Guy In the orange?</v>

304
00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:22.930
<v 2>Talk to me a little bit about how each of these players are a couple of these</v>

305
00:21:22.931 --> 00:21:26.620
players.
Mike feel about,
uh,
the,

306
00:21:26.621 --> 00:21:31.621
I the idea of introducing this kit that enables people to operate on your heart.

307
00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:37.280
<v 1>Let me
actually,
like doctors can be,</v>

308
00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:43.830
uh,
less technologically inclined.

309
00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:47.600
I mean their previous
system.

310
00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.110
So each one of the buyer.

311
00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:59.290
<v 2>Okay.
That's a little vague.
So let's sharpen it up.
You can sharpen it up for us.</v>

312
00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:04.700
It's not wrong.
It's just a little vague.

313
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:06.510
<v 1>Yeah.
Okay.
So like sharpening</v>

314
00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:09.980
in terms of the pension and consume.

315
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:15.080
I think what he was trying to say was that with these new technologies it will

316
00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:21.020
require greater training but then Dr. May or may not be able to afford or go

317
00:22:21.091 --> 00:22:22.370
through.
Okay,
go ahead.

318
00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:26.380
The technologies will do

319
00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.970
if there's a higher risk,

320
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:34.990
involve as many testings as well medicine more so that could offset like the

321
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:42.030
Persian preference going under the knife to have something that isn't that
tough.

322
00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:44.380
<v 2>Good.
Okay,
so couple of issues here.</v>

323
00:22:44.381 --> 00:22:48.940
One is there's certainly a question about the doctor training and one of the

324
00:22:48.941 --> 00:22:52.540
things that's going to keep me awake at night as an entrepreneur is thinking a

325
00:22:52.541 --> 00:22:53.920
little bit about the doctor training,

326
00:22:53.921 --> 00:22:58.000
which we are going to get to in a couple of minutes and certainly the doctors

327
00:22:58.001 --> 00:23:02.590
are going to be right away at me and saying,
okay,
how am I going to get to learn?

328
00:23:02.591 --> 00:23:04.870
That kind of thing and you can already begin to see.

329
00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:08.740
It's not going to be the kind of thing I'm going to have a course that I charged

330
00:23:08.741 --> 00:23:09.670
for.
There's going to be,

331
00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:13.660
I'm going to have to figure out some way to incentivize these guys to come to my

332
00:23:13.661 --> 00:23:17.230
particular class and learn something about,
we'll talk about what that is.

333
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:19.810
The other thing I heard you say was something about risk.

334
00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:26.130
So let's think about the risk issues for the surgeon versus the patient and how

335
00:23:28.151 --> 00:23:31.870
they weigh those things.
Now in theory,

336
00:23:31.871 --> 00:23:33.490
if we're doing surgery,

337
00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:37.300
what's the medical benefit of this particular product?

338
00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:39.730
A guy in the red in the back.

339
00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.320
Okay,
so one thing it may do is reduce mortality rate.

340
00:23:48.321 --> 00:23:51.200
Although it's a little bit tricky in the beginning because we don't know how

341
00:23:51.201 --> 00:23:52.760
good the doctors are going to be.

342
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:58.300
The initial real kindness consumers sale people piece of this was less on the

343
00:23:59.091 --> 00:24:00.440
mortality.
More than one.
Yeah.

344
00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:09.390
Okay.
So some of it is I can reduce your recovery rate.

345
00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:11.220
So if we think about that,

346
00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:15.330
does the doctor care a lot about how fast you get back to work?

347
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.493
<v 1>Yes.</v>

348
00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:19.720
<v 2>Okay.</v>

349
00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:24.400
So one of the things we might think about the recovery angle is that the patient

350
00:24:24.401 --> 00:24:28.060
is going to care more than the doctor.
So that's going to be an element

351
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:35.510
recovery time in which we've got an asymmetry in terms of how much the people

352
00:24:35.511 --> 00:24:39.260
value these things.
What's another element?
Yeah,

353
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:45.500
<v 1>the trauma,
the trauma,
neurological complications that develop.</v>

354
00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:46.260
So subject.

355
00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:46.620
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

356
00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:51.120
So another thing about this surgery is you have to be on a heart lung machine

357
00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:56.340
and that actually has neurological problems potentially associated with it.

358
00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:00.660
So we've got something that it's actually potentially going to reduce some of

359
00:25:00.661 --> 00:25:02.280
our neurological problems.

360
00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:08.120
It turns out for various studies people have done who study doctors and medical

361
00:25:08.851 --> 00:25:09.930
care kinds of things.

362
00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:15.290
If you thought about the trade off to a patient and asked the question,

363
00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:21.350
how much incremental risk of death would you be willing to face to avoid the

364
00:25:22.621 --> 00:25:26.340
kind of um,
very serious neurological damage?

365
00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:30.870
The answer to that question is very different for patients than it is to
doctors.

366
00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.720
From the doctor's point of view,

367
00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:39.170
the danger of having someone die on the table is enormous relative to any other

368
00:25:39.361 --> 00:25:43.110
problem.
From the patient's point of view,

369
00:25:43.111 --> 00:25:47.250
there are times in which they are willing to trade off and say there are some

370
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:52.310
conditions that I could have that frankly I would just as soon take a chance of

371
00:25:52.501 --> 00:25:53.334
dying.

372
00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:57.570
And that's been actually a very complicated set of dishes for doctor patient

373
00:25:57.571 --> 00:26:01.920
relationships across a whole range of different operative uh,

374
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:03.300
and surgical procedures.

375
00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:07.820
And it says to me in this situation where we are talking about heart,
um,

376
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.710
heart recovery kinds of issues,
those tradeoffs are going to be calm,

377
00:26:11.711 --> 00:26:12.990
potentially very large.

378
00:26:12.991 --> 00:26:17.991
So when we have a risk of death that's going to be larger for the doctor and the

379
00:26:18.871 --> 00:26:20.100
risk of damage.

380
00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:25.530
It's going to be conversely more important from the patient's point of view.

381
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.903
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

382
00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:34.140
<v 2>Now let's think a little bit about these different players and look at these two</v>

383
00:26:36.221 --> 00:26:37.240
parts of the market.

384
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:42.160
Because we started this by saying that these guys did a whole bunch of

385
00:26:42.161 --> 00:26:47.161
technological things to try to move into this part of the market as opposed to

386
00:26:47.251 --> 00:26:49.950
staying in this rabbit larger part of the market.

387
00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:51.500
<v 1>Okay.</v>

388
00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:55.850
<v 2>As we think about these being the deciders among the things,</v>

389
00:26:56.930 --> 00:27:00.500
why is it technologically imperative to get out of this market and into this

390
00:27:00.501 --> 00:27:01.330
market?

391
00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:02.163
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

392
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:11.343
Good,

393
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.903
good.

394
00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:20.090
<v 2>So some people call about this,
the gatekeeper problem.</v>

395
00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.810
So it turns out in this particular market,

396
00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.030
I've got a gatekeeper problem,

397
00:27:26.031 --> 00:27:30.920
which is my big competition are the ones that are going to basically handle this

398
00:27:30.921 --> 00:27:35.080
themselves and their tendency to then say,
you know,
you've got,

399
00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.160
you've got two vessels,
I could deal with it,

400
00:27:37.161 --> 00:27:39.470
but I think he'd be better off going here.

401
00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.620
Now that we have a kit is going to be a much reduced.

402
00:27:42.621 --> 00:27:45.740
So I've got a problem that my competitor

403
00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:51.680
is a gatekeeper for me.
But there is,
there is another problem all selling this,

404
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:53.660
attacking this part of the market.

405
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:57.380
Let's think about it from the point of view of the patient.

406
00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:04.840
How does the patient who has just one or two vessels damaged feel about these

407
00:28:05.361 --> 00:28:06.380
two procedures?

408
00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:15.090
<v 1>Yeah.
Angioplasties already quit.</v>

409
00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:28.120
<v 2>Yeah.
So if you think about what this is,
um,
I,
Chile did some,
uh,</v>

410
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:32.630
work for Boston scientific in this market,
um,
as an economist.
And they,

411
00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:34.130
even though I was only an economist,

412
00:28:34.131 --> 00:28:37.830
they actually wanted me to watch one of these procedures for reasons that

413
00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:43.130
completely escaped me.
Um,
but if you watch one of these things,

414
00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:47.900
it's the person,
the patient is awake the whole time.
There's a,

415
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:51.710
basically what they do is there's a little blockage in one of your arteries.

416
00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:56.390
They put a,
a thing that looks sort of like this ball smaller up your leg.

417
00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:59.960
Think we've it up until it gets to the right part in which there's a blockage.

418
00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.490
They have a balloon at the end of it,

419
00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.670
they have a little machine that blows up the balloon.

420
00:29:04.671 --> 00:29:07.580
The balloon just presses against the wall of the artery.
Uh,

421
00:29:07.581 --> 00:29:11.990
all the junk that was clogging it up goes psh,
I'm kind of floats away.

422
00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:16.080
We hope to wherever nirvana is.
Um,

423
00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:21.470
and then they take it out and off you go.
So it's very noninvasive.

424
00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.990
That's very appealing to the consumer.

425
00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:27.770
I've got a gatekeeper here who's a cardiologist.

426
00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:32.210
What would the insurance company rather have me do?
Oh,

427
00:29:32.211 --> 00:29:34.660
this is way cheaper.
Xander,

428
00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:38.690
your plasty things are way cheaper than anything in the cabbage side.

429
00:29:38.691 --> 00:29:42.490
So anyone that's an insurer is going be thinking you've only got one or two

430
00:29:42.491 --> 00:29:43.324
vessels

431
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:49.890
go this way rather than trying to do a less problematic version of this.

432
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:56.490
So from the point of view of solving the needs of these people,

433
00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:02.800
I can't stay in this part of the business.

434
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:07.180
I don't have enough value ad to offer in that part of the business.

435
00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.220
I have got to go to the only part of the business in which I have potential

436
00:30:12.221 --> 00:30:15.610
value Ed,
which is this part of it.
And for that it says to me,

437
00:30:15.611 --> 00:30:19.180
even though I'm going to give up something in functionality,

438
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:22.960
I'm going to need to give that up in order to make myself more attractive in

439
00:30:22.961 --> 00:30:26.590
that part of the business.
Because from the point of view of everything,

440
00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:31.510
pretty much everything,
these guys care about this thing,
this dominated.

441
00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:36.190
Now we'll come to the little more on the competition in a minute.

442
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:38.343
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

443
00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:42.520
<v 2>Let me backtrack slightly from that.
Um,</v>

444
00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.940
aggressive comment I just made because there is one problem.

445
00:30:45.941 --> 00:30:47.620
For those of you that read carefully,

446
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:53.190
there is one problem that the angioplasty has that would be improved by me

447
00:30:54.551 --> 00:30:58.780
actually,
you know,
trying to do this in a less invasive way.
Yeah.

448
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.160
<v 1>Great.</v>

449
00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:13.930
<v 2>So an issue that we have from the point of view of an issue that this competitor</v>

450
00:31:13.931 --> 00:31:15.300
has,
it's something medically,

451
00:31:15.301 --> 00:31:19.240
it's called restenosis so that I could have this done,

452
00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.160
but I have to do it many times.

453
00:31:21.161 --> 00:31:24.310
And then you could think now what the patient is thinking is to,

454
00:31:24.311 --> 00:31:29.311
I want to have this with the kit done once or do I want to have this done every

455
00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:30.761
other year?

456
00:31:30.761 --> 00:31:34.300
Which sounds a little less appealing than it sounded a minute ago when I thought

457
00:31:34.301 --> 00:31:37.240
we could just do it once and for all.

458
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:39.760
So initially you might think,

459
00:31:39.761 --> 00:31:44.761
well it looks like there is some advantage I could build on in my discussions

460
00:31:46.751 --> 00:31:50.890
with patients and doctors and frankly even insurers and hospitals that would

461
00:31:50.891 --> 00:31:53.710
make me on a crack of alternative to this.

462
00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:59.770
But if I was thinking in a shrimper Tyrian way and going to build my business

463
00:31:59.771 --> 00:32:00.610
around that,

464
00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:06.540
what else would I want to be thinking about in terms of that strategy?

465
00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:10.600
So a strategy that says,
okay,

466
00:32:10.601 --> 00:32:15.601
I'm looking at what these guys are like now and I'm thinking about how I look

467
00:32:16.001 --> 00:32:20.860
relative to them and there's something they don't do very well and I'm going to

468
00:32:20.861 --> 00:32:23.350
just kind of hammer in on what they don't do well.

469
00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.360
What's the potential worry that I might have about that?
Yeah.

470
00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:51.730
Good.
So keep the mic so that tells me if I were going to go that way,

471
00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:53.500
what would I need to be doing?

472
00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:59.390
<v 1>You have to use Spanish to the interventionists</v>

473
00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.170
or eliminated.

474
00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.610
<v 2>Okay.
So I got to figure out a way to get over the gate.</v>

475
00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:11.350
What's a way to get over the gate

476
00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:20.930
target
target to patients so that they have been,

477
00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.690
so we could think a little bit about what's been happening.

478
00:33:25.691 --> 00:33:29.470
Those of you that watch television,
probably none of you anymore.
Uh,

479
00:33:29.471 --> 00:33:34.120
one of the things we've seen in the health care area is much more direct

480
00:33:34.121 --> 00:33:38.930
advertising to patients.
Even for things that you would think your doc,

481
00:33:38.931 --> 00:33:41.950
these are things your doctor is going to prescribe for.
You were warning,

482
00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.690
make a deal in one way or another.

483
00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:48.850
There's an attempt in a lot of areas to avoid the gatekeeper by going direct to

484
00:33:48.851 --> 00:33:49.690
the patients.

485
00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:54.760
How easy is that to do in this market as opposed to a market like um,

486
00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:58.840
allergy relief.
Okay.
You stairs there markets now for whatever,

487
00:33:58.841 --> 00:34:02.750
Claritin or some one of these drugs that is prescription.

488
00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:05.760
So the only way to get it is go to your doctor,
but the,

489
00:34:05.761 --> 00:34:09.460
the line is go to your doctor and ask him to prescribe this drug for you.

490
00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:15.070
Is it going to be easy for me to have on television something it says go to your

491
00:34:15.071 --> 00:34:18.280
doctor and tell him you don't want an angioplasty.

492
00:34:18.281 --> 00:34:21.430
You want your cabbage John with the beating heart kit.

493
00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.840
So why are you all laughing?
What's ridiculous about this?

494
00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:27.453
<v 1>Cool.</v>

495
00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:32.370
<v 2>Okay,
so eight's complicated information asymmetries.
Exactly.
Right.</v>

496
00:34:32.371 --> 00:34:36.120
You could think,
okay,
I could go to my doc with that,
but what the hell do I know?

497
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:37.530
Right?
I mean really,

498
00:34:37.531 --> 00:34:40.800
I'm not going to trust my own view of this even if the television telling me so.

499
00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:42.390
But here's actually another,

500
00:34:42.391 --> 00:34:47.100
just a sort of business issue which is there in some sense aren't enough people

501
00:34:47.101 --> 00:34:49.590
watching TV for whom that message is relevant.

502
00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:53.970
Even if I could really focus in on TV and do what I'm going to be,

503
00:34:53.971 --> 00:34:55.020
it's going to be a problem.

504
00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:56.510
<v 1>Okay.</v>

505
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:58.940
<v 2>But there are some possibilities maybe on the web.</v>

506
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:05.200
So you could imagine a set of web advertisements that when you're clicking on

507
00:35:05.331 --> 00:35:09.920
something that says,
what do I do about heart problem?
It clicks up to me.

508
00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:12.800
Talk to your doctor about the beating heart port kit.

509
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:18.140
So there are some technological things directed marketing that actually allow us

510
00:35:18.141 --> 00:35:21.230
in various markets to get away from gatekeepers and go direct.

511
00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:26.980
But there's actually another problem with building a lot on this strategy as I

512
00:35:27.621 --> 00:35:31.850
think about building a strategy to attack an existing player.

513
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:35.870
Any of you have game theory and have you ever take game theory?

514
00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:41.920
Did any of you had a do economics majors?
Okay,
good.

515
00:35:41.921 --> 00:35:44.680
I'm picking on you because you should know this business econ major.

516
00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:47.290
If you're thinking about um,

517
00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:51.100
you're thinking about positioning yourself against an existing competitor.

518
00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:54.670
I'm looking at what this guy's doing now.
What else should I be looking at?

519
00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.330
Exactly.
So I need to be thinking this guy's,

520
00:36:01.331 --> 00:36:04.300
what is he going to be just sitting around kind of,
you know,

521
00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.710
reaping in the profits.

522
00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:09.790
He's going to be thinking about here you came with this new business,

523
00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:14.320
what should,
and you're attacking me by my,
by virtue of my wrist analysis.

524
00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.090
What am I going to do

525
00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:21.370
now I want to think a little bit about if I'm the designer of this thing is who

526
00:36:21.371 --> 00:36:22.390
are these players?

527
00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:27.730
Anyone have any sense of who the guys are doing the angioplasty business,

528
00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:31.420
producing the,
these balloon catheters and so on.

529
00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.740
Well they're big companies.
Companies like some love.

530
00:36:35.741 --> 00:36:39.250
You may want to go work for Sunday,
Boston scientific,
Medtronic,

531
00:36:39.251 --> 00:36:43.330
Johnson and Johnson.
What's true about these big companies?

532
00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:49.180
They spend a lot of money on R.
And D.
Okay.
Cause they make a lot of money.

533
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:52.690
They have broad product lines,
they have big cash flows,

534
00:36:52.691 --> 00:36:54.130
they spend a lot on r and,
d,

535
00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:59.880
You some little pipsqueak making hard port are gonna wreck your whole business

536
00:36:59.921 --> 00:37:03.130
on the idea that you,
you uh,

537
00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:07.720
you can attack these guys by saying they're going to have you going back to the

538
00:37:07.721 --> 00:37:08.680
hospital a lot.

539
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:12.400
You can be sure they know that's an issue for their company and they're throwing

540
00:37:12.401 --> 00:37:13.270
a lot of money at it.

541
00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:18.250
And in fact what we see in this business is actually we get very shortly after

542
00:37:18.251 --> 00:37:23.251
this a physician I knew drug eluting stent that allows for less restenosis that

543
00:37:23.621 --> 00:37:26.540
they have spent many,
many,
many millions of dollars on.

544
00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:31.860
So I think it is very dangerous to stick with the two vessel thing because you

545
00:37:32.771 --> 00:37:35.170
know these guys a in the first place,

546
00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:38.800
you don't have a value proposition for consumers and B,

547
00:37:38.801 --> 00:37:41.830
you've got very strong competitors who have a lot of money to throw at the

548
00:37:41.831 --> 00:37:46.570
particular problem that they have.
So Cup,
just a couple more things.

549
00:37:46.571 --> 00:37:48.430
We want to think about the training issues.

550
00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:52.630
If I'm actually going to make this work in this business,

551
00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:57.720
I have got what economists would call a complement with an e not an I.

552
00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:05.870
I've got,
I got to somehow,
you know,
this kid doesn't do it itself.

553
00:38:05.871 --> 00:38:08.570
This kid is used by doctors,
surgeons.

554
00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:13.310
So I've got to figure out a way to train those guys.
And in the,
in the,
uh,

555
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:16.640
in the case they talk about some of the ways they try to train these guys.

556
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:18.950
What is,
they offered them trips to Hawaii.

557
00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:21.740
What's the problem with the trips to Hawaii to learn?

558
00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.153
<v 1>Go</v>

559
00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:31.060
just to look at the electrical Polish to another music they've heard about it,

560
00:38:31.061 --> 00:38:34.870
that interested just to learn more about it on that unit.
Okay.

561
00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:38.710
Actually stayed for the surgery.

562
00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:43.410
<v 2>Good.
And since you're an ECON major,
we'll test you a little more on the ECON.</v>

563
00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:47.610
So there's a problem in economics known as the selection problem.
Okay.

564
00:38:47.611 --> 00:38:50.100
So how does the selection problem play into this?

565
00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:51.930
What kind of doctor's got to Hawaii?

566
00:38:56.630 --> 00:39:00.020
Okay.
They like beaches and when they go to Hawaii,

567
00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:03.440
I'm paying for their transport.
But what am I not covering?

568
00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:09.020
What's the magic word there?
Only three magic.
Oh,
thank you.
That's the magic word.

569
00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:13.973
<v 1>You Bet.</v>

570
00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:18.090
<v 2>You Bet.
So a strategy that says come to Hawaii,</v>

571
00:39:18.091 --> 00:39:22.220
you tracks a bunch of doctors who aren't doing many surgeries because they got

572
00:39:22.221 --> 00:39:23.120
plenty of time to come to.

573
00:39:23.121 --> 00:39:26.570
Why the people that I want to attract are the people that are doing a lot of

574
00:39:26.571 --> 00:39:30.950
surgeries because they are an annuity word from those of you interested in

575
00:39:30.951 --> 00:39:35.720
finance.
Once I teach them every year,
they do more surgeries every year.

576
00:39:35.721 --> 00:39:38.810
I don't keep reteaching them every year they do something.
Moreover,

577
00:39:38.811 --> 00:39:41.780
I want the guys who are in teaching hospitals like Gail cause they gonna teach

578
00:39:41.781 --> 00:39:44.600
all the guys behind them and I want them to be big users.

579
00:39:44.601 --> 00:39:48.080
And that's why most of the training for these kinds of things actually happens

580
00:39:48.081 --> 00:39:50.780
in the hospital,
doesn't happen in Hawaii.

581
00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:53.680
Hawaii sounds great to someone who doesn't know anything about doctors,

582
00:39:53.681 --> 00:39:56.420
what do you want to do is you want to go where they are training where they are,

583
00:39:56.421 --> 00:39:58.510
where there's low opportunity cost,
uh,

584
00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:03.320
of learning as a way to capturing still it's going to be a tricky piece.

585
00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:05.960
Um,
it's going to be a tricky piece to try to do it.

586
00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:10.760
So we have a situation in which it looks like a good idea.

587
00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:17.340
We've got big hurdles to go over in terms of actually having a value add that's

588
00:40:17.341 --> 00:40:18.174
meaningful.

589
00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:24.610
Suppose I could suppose I did have something that I condensed.

590
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:27.200
I got enough doctors to know how to do it.

591
00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:33.120
I got enough stories to consumers and others that I got around the intervention.

592
00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:37.200
Cardiologists is a lot of ifs about this and are getting some penetration of

593
00:40:37.201 --> 00:40:39.120
this thing now what am I worried about?

594
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.233
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

595
00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:48.360
<v 2>Okay.
I could worry about is insurance going to cover it?
But suppose I got that.</v>

596
00:40:48.361 --> 00:40:52.050
I've managed to convince those insurance companies that,
you know,

597
00:40:52.051 --> 00:40:54.240
this has been to get people out of the hospital faster.

598
00:40:54.241 --> 00:40:56.640
This is going to be a good deal.
Here I am.

599
00:40:56.641 --> 00:40:59.280
I'm starting just starting to make money.
What is,

600
00:40:59.281 --> 00:41:01.500
what do we know when you're just starting to make money?

601
00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.153
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

602
00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:07.250
<v 2>What happens to you?
What kind of eScience is economics?</v>

603
00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:12.860
The dismal science.
Why is it the dismal science?

604
00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:18.230
Because the minute you start making money,
what happens?
People enter the market.

605
00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:22.670
That's the glory of why price has come down in this situation.

606
00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:25.190
What kind of a product do we have?

607
00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:28.250
We have a little platform for beating heart.

608
00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:32.960
When we convince the doctors to adapt,

609
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:39.620
we wanted to have something that was going to look pretty generic because I

610
00:41:39.621 --> 00:41:43.580
wanted to give doctors some sense of you can learn how to make this and I'm not

611
00:41:43.581 --> 00:41:47.840
going to hold you up.
Eventually.
The easier it is to copy.

612
00:41:47.841 --> 00:41:51.650
However,
the more problem I have from new entry,

613
00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:57.850
so even if I can crack this problem by attracting the right buyers,

614
00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:00.410
solving the complimentary problem,

615
00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:04.280
changing myself technologically to hit the only part of the market in which I

616
00:42:04.281 --> 00:42:05.690
have a chance to compete,

617
00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:11.090
I'm going to have a problem that I'm going to have the risk of new guys coming

618
00:42:11.091 --> 00:42:16.091
in and the more attractive I make this from a generic point of view in the

619
00:42:16.911 --> 00:42:18.200
beginning of my market,

620
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:22.670
the more problem I'm going to have protecting it in a later part of my market.

621
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:28.630
And that in some sense is really the Schumpeterian story that says to me the

622
00:42:29.091 --> 00:42:34.091
nature of an innovation is coming in against existing players with something you

623
00:42:35.481 --> 00:42:40.481
hope will be a better idea but then worrying and the end about other people who

624
00:42:41.211 --> 00:42:46.040
are going to imitate you until finally there are enough of them till another new

625
00:42:46.041 --> 00:42:49.790
comer comes in with another disruptive innovation that looks better than what

626
00:42:49.791 --> 00:42:53.930
you had before.
So I have to actually go teach my Mbas.

627
00:42:53.931 --> 00:42:57.560
And so your last five minutes Mr. Ray is going to complete for you.

628
00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:09.990
<v 1>Yeah.
As you can see she's done that.</v>

629
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:16.440
No.

630
00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:18.451
<v 0>The question,</v>

631
00:43:18.451 --> 00:43:23.451
the syllabus poses for you is concerned with social learning with whether the

632
00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:34.860
mark and companies like this one,

633
00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:40.850
our instruments by which society learns through both success and failure.

634
00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:45.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

635
00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:48.980
<v 0>Uh,
does anybody see a learning component to this?</v>

636
00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:50.773
<v 1>Okay.</v>

637
00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:52.330
<v 0>It's good.
A mic for somebody.</v>

638
00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:56.240
Let's go to purple shirt right here.

639
00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:00.580
What's the learning process here?

640
00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:09.000
Well,
I mean,
I mean something more abstract and bigger.

641
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:14.990
Is Society smarter in an in any important way toward the end of this story then?

642
00:44:16.711 --> 00:44:17.580
It was at the beginning,

643
00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:20.563
<v 1>I suppose</v>

644
00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:27.360
hold up turns out being a dentist because they didn't fit it a bit excited

645
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:32.070
because then in which case we had a technological innovation that will maybe
save

646
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.670
<v 3>some lives,
reducing recovery time.
But if the product never enters the market,</v>

647
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:41.160
I mean,
I guess,
I guess if there is this pressure to innovate,

648
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:42.990
even if it doesn't end at the mark,
maybe,
you know,

649
00:44:42.991 --> 00:44:46.500
the angioplasty guys will be out there trying to compete with it even though

650
00:44:46.501 --> 00:44:47.850
it's not really a major competitor.

651
00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:50.230
<v 0>Okay.
So in actual fact,</v>

652
00:44:50.231 --> 00:44:54.100
there's a learning story with a yes answer ama learning story with a no answer.

653
00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:58.930
And the learning store with the yes answer is very obvious.
Well,

654
00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:03.940
learning answer with the failure story is partly that we know one bad idea,

655
00:45:05.021 --> 00:45:09.010
so we don't have to repeat it.
Uh,
but in addition,

656
00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:14.370
it's part of a larger incentivation process which compels everyone to be

657
00:45:16.481 --> 00:45:20.650
thinking about the next step beyond what they already know how to do.

658
00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:25.390
In the case for Monday,
which is,

659
00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:28.600
its URL is posted on Classes v two.

660
00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:32.490
We have the Polaroid land camera,
uh,

661
00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:37.480
invented by Edwin land and it's,
it is a,

662
00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:38.620
uh,

663
00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:43.620
less bloody story that is a little like the,

664
00:45:43.671 --> 00:45:46.000
the one we just did a,

665
00:45:46.001 --> 00:45:51.001
the difference is that it is closer to the mass consumer and is in that way a

666
00:45:52.841 --> 00:45:55.670
more,
uh,
typical champagne,

667
00:45:55.720 --> 00:46:00.720
her story about how innovation in consumer product disturbs and old equilibrium

668
00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:05.260
in conventional photography,

669
00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:11.130
and then becomes a defender against a new disruptive technology with the

670
00:46:13.401 --> 00:46:17.620
emergence of digitization.
Uh,
we'll see you on Monday.
