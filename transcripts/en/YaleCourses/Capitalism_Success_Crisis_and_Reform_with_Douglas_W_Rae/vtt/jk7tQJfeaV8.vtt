1
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.130
The dog ate my homework.
Did you guys will understand what that means.

2
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.610
We're going to have to postpone the rapid Chunski case.

3
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.490
I got back from Washington late last night and,
um,

4
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.990
got the officer's morning and the SOM server was down.

5
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.130
I actually did some of the filming and visited their offices in Warsaw three

6
00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:28.950
years ago.
Um,

7
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.770
and I would like to divert us a little bit today.
Uh,

8
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.800
I want to talk briefly about what I've been doing in Washington and how it

9
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:43.710
relates to what we've been doing here.

10
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.990
And then you'll remember some weeks ago before the midterm,

11
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.470
we had a soft sketch,
soft scheduled to do the mores business plan.

12
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.700
And I brought with me today to distinguished colleagues who are going to help

13
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:04.200
us,
uh,
do,
uh,

14
00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:08.760
understand the mortgage business plan as a challenge.
Uh,

15
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.700
Chris Guttman,
uh,

16
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.370
immediately to my right is the president of the Mores Board of governors and a,

17
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.290
a,
a,
an eye iconic figure at Yale.

18
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.530
Uh,
he has been the owner of how many dapper Dans,
handsome,

19
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.790
handsome dance,
pardon me,
for and including the incumbent

20
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.480
and Jonathan Ingham.

21
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.830
And now immediately to my right is a former president of the Yale Club of New

22
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.840
York,
Yale College class of six,
four,
six,
five

23
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.980
a and has been one of the instrumental players in the more he's business plan.

24
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.220
Um,
before I get to that,
I want to want to talk a little about Washington.

25
00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:03.110
I'd been down there,
uh,
working,
uh,

26
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.560
for a company,

27
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.650
but it has brought me into contact with staff in the Senate and the house.

28
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.260
And I thought I'd share a little of the texture of that with you because it

29
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:19.920
relates
to capitalism in,

30
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.410
or at least two American capitalism in a,
in an interesting way.

31
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.380
Um,
as you know,
Saturday night at quarter to midnight,

32
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.410
the House of Representatives passed a version of the healthcare reform bill by

33
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.300
the margin of two 20,
Yay,

34
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.980
15 nay.

35
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.540
The first thing remarkable about that number is it adds up to 435.

36
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.280
Very few bills add up to four 35.

37
00:02:53.281 --> 00:02:58.281
This one was one where being absent would be the sort of a,

38
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.300
a fence which could cost you your seat in Congress because the intensity is at

39
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:06.070
high.
Uh,

40
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.080
the other feature of it or a,
and I read,

41
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.620
I can't claim to have read more than about 20% of the bill.
Um,

42
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.950
but the stunning,

43
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.580
the stunning feature of it is that the fingerprints of lobbyists are all over it

44
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.250
in a,
in a degree that
is just,

45
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.080
it was to me a pretty disturbing [inaudible].
I'm,

46
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.860
I'm reasonably cynical about how the world works,

47
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.510
but the number of cases where,
um,

48
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.460
the bill be going along talking about one thing and then there'll be a
paragraph,

49
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.910
it will be labeled section one,
seven,
five,
three,

50
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.280
and it will require the services of licensed podiatrists

51
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.960
or it will require,
uh,

52
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.110
a funding grant to a certain category of health providers in a region of several

53
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:11.980
western states.

54
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.870
It's just pockmarked with very intense lobbying.

55
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.770
And then when you talk to the staffs of the two parties,

56
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.080
you get two very different kinds of talk.

57
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.143
<v 1>MMM.</v>

58
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.620
<v 0>Let's leave my politics out of this.
Uh,</v>

59
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.340
which side do you think would sound more coherent right now?

60
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:40.180
The Republicans or the Democrats talking about the healthcare bill?

61
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.430
We got,
have I got a mic I can hand somebody.
Thanks.
Lastly,

62
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.640
who wants to take a shot at that one?

63
00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.730
<v 1>Uh,</v>

64
00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.820
<v 2>I would guess the Republicans,
since they haven't had to,
had,</v>

65
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.020
they haven't had to have made concessions to numerous special interests to get

66
00:05:06.021 --> 00:05:07.640
the bill passed or repick.

67
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.380
<v 0>You nailed it.
Are you a political science major?
Yes.
Good for you.</v>

68
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.290
Uh,
in Washington this year,

69
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.010
a two point $9 billion,

70
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.111
repeat that number.

71
00:05:24.111 --> 00:05:29.111
Two point $9 billion was spent on lobbying the federal government

72
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.060
and uh,
well compared to the cost of the healthcare bill,

73
00:05:35.061 --> 00:05:36.410
that doesn't sound like much.

74
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.460
It's an awful lot of lobbyists and the majority party on a bill like this is,

75
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.130
uh,
well how many,

76
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.470
let's suppose they did it as follows.
Obama brings in

77
00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:01.010
50 men and women from Harvard,
Yale,
Berkeley,
Michigan,

78
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.440
uh,
Texas and so on.

79
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.820
And they spend 30 days working,

80
00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:09.481
uh,

81
00:06:09.481 --> 00:06:14.481
on the best possible bill to get the most bang for the buck,

82
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.070
for the general public in a new health care plan.

83
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.440
And then he puts it on bloke and sends it up to the CAP,

84
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.070
sends it over to Capitol Hill,
bought how many boats,
if it were really well done,

85
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:32.470
do you suppose it would gap?
Maybe we're going to take a guess at that.

86
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:34.930
We have historical experience.

87
00:06:34.931 --> 00:06:39.931
This is what the Clintons did right nearly two decades ago and it got shot full

88
00:06:41.771 --> 00:06:45.910
of holes immediately.
Right?
There was just virtue.

89
00:06:45.911 --> 00:06:50.911
There was virtually no support for it because all the defensive interest groups,

90
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.460
uh,
staked out their ground,

91
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.690
no concessions or very few concessions were made and it just sank.

92
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:04.030
I does anybody remember how the Obama people handle this piece of legislation?

93
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.600
What did they say to the speaker of the house?
Nancy Pelosi?

94
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:15.410
Anybody?
You guys read newspapers?
Tom,
you,
do you have any memory though?

95
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:16.783
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

96
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.230
<v 0>Alright.
He more or less,</v>

97
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.670
I gave some broad outlines of principles for the building and said you do it

98
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.250
right handed the whole thing over to the legislature.
Okay.

99
00:07:26.251 --> 00:07:31.251
So he handed the thing to the House of Representatives and the lobbying process,

100
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:37.410
uh,
became very intense.
Andy,
it is a,

101
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.180
uh,

102
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:44.180
an incredibly intricate set of not most,

103
00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.410
most of it.
Uh,

104
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:51.420
an awful lot of it is like the earmarks for a bridge in Alaska,

105
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.750
but it's usually not a bridge in Alaska.

106
00:07:54.751 --> 00:07:59.340
It is a podiatrist in an office spread all the way across the country.

107
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:01.780
And,
um,

108
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:08.630
I really do believe in markets and there is so much in this bill that would not

109
00:08:09.511 --> 00:08:11.790
meet market test.
Right.

110
00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:16.140
If you said we're going to require the service of podiatrists in a certain

111
00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.560
certain aspect of it and you ask yourself,

112
00:08:19.561 --> 00:08:23.010
what would people sign up for that if it were not required by law.

113
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.720
And in an awful lot of cases,
the answer is yes,

114
00:08:27.721 --> 00:08:29.460
of course some would sign up for it,

115
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:35.390
but the amount spent would be billions less than if you do it this way.

116
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.400
No,
you all can have ma,

117
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:42.410
I voted for President Obama and I'm,
uh,

118
00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:47.550
deeply supportive of his and other people's goals for the country.

119
00:08:47.551 --> 00:08:52.140
But this bill,
um,
I can't,

120
00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.790
I really can't stand up for it.
Um,

121
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.240
anybody want to take the affirmative about why it is?

122
00:09:01.241 --> 00:09:02.920
We've just got to get this done.

123
00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.190
<v 1>I promise to be polite.</v>

124
00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:12.850
<v 0>Okay.
Well we'll go from something easy to something more difficult.</v>

125
00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.220
Morrie's is,
okay.

126
00:09:18.221 --> 00:09:22.810
Let's first of all find out how many of you have ever set foot in Maurice.
Wow.

127
00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.020
So we have a whole room full of experts.
Um,

128
00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:33.880
and would somebody like to recap what they think the last year or two of Maurice

129
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.713
Existence look like?

130
00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.150
This could be fun.
Go for it.

131
00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.520
<v 4>There was like a struggle to be much more inclusive.</v>

132
00:09:45.521 --> 00:09:46.870
So they were all of these promotions.

133
00:09:46.871 --> 00:09:50.780
So you could get a Morrie's membership for $10.
It could come in and get $10 off.

134
00:09:50.781 --> 00:09:52.820
You're like meal and um,

135
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.930
my friends and I totally made you sit back cause we'd like eating everywhere at

136
00:09:55.931 --> 00:10:00.280
Yale,
around yell.
Um,
so we did go a few times.
Um,
but we never got to,

137
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.680
I don't think we ever got really got him worries membership.

138
00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.210
Things fell through and then we never really heard about it.
Yeah.

139
00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:09.080
<v 0>Okay.
It closed on the 19th of December.</v>

140
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.900
Do you want your money back?
No.
Okay.

141
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:16.550
You don't have

142
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:22.400
anybody want to want to want to say anything about what they think the place was

143
00:10:22.401 --> 00:10:27.401
like from a member or customer point of view over the,

144
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.060
over the last couple of years.

145
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.100
Any complaint we have complaint,

146
00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.850
where did I see a hand here?

147
00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.690
Here's one back here.
The food,

148
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.320
the food and how was the service?

149
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.140
Meza.
Mass.
Yep.
Um,

150
00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:54.410
Maurice lost a lot of money in the last two and a half years.
It operated,

151
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:59.000
um,
roughly speaking

152
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.150
$1,000 a day.

153
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.530
<v 1>And uh,</v>

154
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.870
<v 0>Chris Suffocate,
Chris Jackman here became its president,
uh,
after,</v>

155
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:13.190
uh,

156
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:18.190
the disaster was revealed and has been working with a group of us to bring it

157
00:11:19.041 --> 00:11:22.970
back.
And I thought I would

158
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:29.210
start with
uh,
Chris

159
00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:35.740
and just get him to reflect for a minute on what the task looks like and what we

160
00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:39.900
hope to accomplish.
And then,
then we'll talk to Jonathan and,

161
00:11:39.901 --> 00:11:43.400
and then I'll come back with a summary of the,
of the business plan.
Well,

162
00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:47.390
let me start by saying that the,
how's this work?

163
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.410
Push it off or
it works.
Just that

164
00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:58.123
<v 3>thing.</v>

165
00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:02.203
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

166
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:09.873
Talk like this

167
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:16.750
first thing I did before I became president or

168
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:23.350
I can play
with the clothes,
the place,

169
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:28.860
everybody,
one person whose name is Robin foam

170
00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:31.223
rubber

171
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:36.480
and then we had a lay off all of us that

172
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:42.450
we were going to run out of money in the middle of January.

173
00:12:42.451 --> 00:12:44.280
We closed on the 19th of December.

174
00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.780
And actually this was a good thing because you said

175
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:55.240
do you have in the quality of the food and

176
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.580
we were not succeeding in that regard at all.
I think I want to be reopened.

177
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:11.370
It's going to be at a place where you guys are reaching out to the students.

178
00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.350
If you want to pretend that box back.

179
00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:23.420
I think I did after that was the job to work in addition to great guy.

180
00:13:27.241 --> 00:13:31.930
He was also a former web and as I think most of you know,

181
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:33.600
very important

182
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:37.910
along with a lot of other

183
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.420
faculty is a big part of,

184
00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:49.993
we

185
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:57.260
raise money to not only make capital improvements to the Clo that it was pretty

186
00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:02.270
rundown,
but structural improvements.
Um,

187
00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:07.650
it goes to the wiring all the way to getting working fireplaces.

188
00:14:07.651 --> 00:14:12.651
On a couple of the rooms and the cost to do what we hope to do is going to be

189
00:14:15.841 --> 00:14:19.340
something in the neighborhood of two point $9 million.
Um,

190
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:21.290
we're,

191
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:26.290
we're well along the way to do that and I hope to have good news about the fact

192
00:14:28.981 --> 00:14:30.200
that we've reached our goal.

193
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.330
You ready to talk to and can open and we're not going to sign it and longterm

194
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:39.350
contracts with electricians or plumbers or contractors until we know we'll be

195
00:14:40.231 --> 00:14:43.980
able to see the job all the way,
bro.
It's been fun.

196
00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:48.270
There's an awful lot of Mris is the largest private club in the world because in

197
00:14:48.271 --> 00:14:51.890
the old days there were,
you're a lifetime and it cost

198
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.470
<v 5>15 bucks to join from life.</v>

199
00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:59.780
And so we have 14,000 I probably 13,000 members now,

200
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.690
many of whom we don't hear from.

201
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:07.100
But there's an awful lot of loyalty and a positive sentiment about the club and

202
00:15:07.101 --> 00:15:11.210
we're very confident that this is going to happen and I'll just let Tom weigh in

203
00:15:11.211 --> 00:15:15.730
or Doug or
probably don't need it.
Yeah.
Um,

204
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:22.330
why Morris and why Morrie's as an association as opposed to an adjunct door,

205
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:31.040
some form of,
uh,
of an open house,
uh,
being run by Yale.

206
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.520
Um,
let's back up a little bit.

207
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.330
10 minutes ago Doug asked me is come in and share some of my,

208
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:43.750
my thoughts about more ease with you.
And,
um,
uh,

209
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:49.590
so this is,
I'm,
I'm talking as I'm thinking,
um,

210
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:55.580
and I'm going to try and relate it to,
um,
the purpose of this class,

211
00:15:55.581 --> 00:15:58.880
which is capitalism.
First of all,

212
00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.900
there's something wrong.
Did we do that?

213
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.333
Why Morrie's?

214
00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:13.740
I came back to the Yale bowl about five or so years ago when I was watching the

215
00:16:14.321 --> 00:16:19.050
Harvard game and I was sitting with some of my Harvard friends and,
and uh,
uh,

216
00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:21.920
about halfway through the game I wasn't having any fun.

217
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:27.250
I'm going to go back to new haven and a just hang out in new haven who was going

218
00:16:27.251 --> 00:16:27.790
on.

219
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:32.790
I couldn't find a door that was unlocked in the entire town of new haven.

220
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.730
And I'm thinking to myself,
where do you like me?

221
00:16:36.731 --> 00:16:41.731
Go on a heartbeat weekend or any other kind of weekend,

222
00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:44.740
or when I want to show up in town,
there's no place.

223
00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:50.050
And I wasn't a member of Morrie's before I got involved with this,

224
00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:53.530
because back when I was your age plus two or three years,

225
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:57.040
I didn't have the 25 bucks to,

226
00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:00.670
or at least I didn't think it was a good expenditure,

227
00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:04.090
$25 for lifetime memberships.
So I kind of ignored it.

228
00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.930
And then I started going back,
uh,
with a,

229
00:17:07.931 --> 00:17:12.310
with alumni group and we would sing on occasional Morrie's Mondays when the

230
00:17:12.311 --> 00:17:17.150
whips were somewhere else.
And it occurred to me that this was,
uh,

231
00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:22.660
a place that
deserves to be alive.

232
00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:27.230
But as I looked around and saw this place,
um,

233
00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.770
it clearly you didn't reflect the needs of the marketplace.

234
00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:35.560
It was basically a place where old guidance ago and,
uh,

235
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:40.780
have meals occasionally.
Um,
I didn't see any students there.

236
00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:45.460
He didn't,
there was no,
uh,
uh,
vibrancy,
no,

237
00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.250
no relevance to the place.
And,
uh,

238
00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:53.280
so then I got because of these guys and the whole concept of what Morrie's

239
00:17:54.691 --> 00:17:59.670
should be,
uh,
became crystallized my thinking.

240
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:01.103
Um,

241
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:06.690
it belongs because it represents a a hundred,

242
00:18:06.691 --> 00:18:11.010
150 years of experience.
So all the pictures up there,
all conditions,
cops,

243
00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.950
everybody has their own particular memories about it.

244
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:18.990
But collectively it is an important part of I think the Yale experience.

245
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.410
And I think sadly,
um,

246
00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:27.260
it's hasn't been an important part of your collective experience.

247
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:32.820
Um,
I think if you do a survey among graduate students,
for instance,

248
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:37.080
85,
90% of them won't even,
uh,
or,

249
00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:41.270
or never thought that they were eligible for membership in Morrie's.
Uh,

250
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:46.610
so I think what we were trying to do here is to preserve the memorable aspects

251
00:18:48.691 --> 00:18:52.470
of more easy icon,
a iconic nature of the place,

252
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:57.000
but also to open it up and make it a,

253
00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:01.260
a welcoming institution for the student body,

254
00:19:01.261 --> 00:19:02.850
both graduate and undergraduate.

255
00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:06.780
And by that I mean having expanding things like singing group nights,

256
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:12.180
doing things which we found to be successful at the Yale Club in New York,

257
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:17.150
which was to have poetry readings,
discussions that novels,
uh,

258
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:23.010
you kind of bought.
We want to be open to,
um,
uh,

259
00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:27.990
the student body to be able to say,
come on in and let's discuss this here.

260
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:33.500
And then of course we hope that that sort of activity will spill over and

261
00:19:33.901 --> 00:19:37.560
accrued if some selling drinks and food and stuff.
Terrific.
But basically,

262
00:19:37.561 --> 00:19:38.640
let me just finish one thing.

263
00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:43.550
It belongs run by market forces,

264
00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.810
not by Yale.
The alumni,

265
00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:50.880
the rose alumni house is useless as far as most graduates go.

266
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:53.490
And a Maurice,

267
00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:58.380
which would be run by Yale I think would similarly not be relevant.

268
00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:03.270
I believe in active welded on restaurant bar lounge,

269
00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:08.540
which is responsive to the needs of the student body is the way to go.

270
00:20:09.001 --> 00:20:11.850
And that's where I think we're trying to come out on this day.

271
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.800
<v 0>Okay.
Um,
now let's talk business.</v>

272
00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:20.720
A Morrie's in its last year of operation did about $900,000 of bar and

273
00:20:21.761 --> 00:20:26.290
restaurant business.
And when I say bar and restaurant,
uh,

274
00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:31.830
you may be confused by the first word where it's the bar at Morrie's.

275
00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.820
There is not
right.

276
00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:41.850
It's founded on drinking songs and it has no bar kind of odd.

277
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.290
Uh,

278
00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:49.290
it is all about Yale and only percent of Yale's enrolled students belong to it.

279
00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:55.120
Um,
it is a

280
00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:02.160
business with an absolutely natural market all its own.

281
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.960
Uh,
Steven Blumenfeld who's a junior in the college was in this course a year ago

282
00:21:07.961 --> 00:21:11.860
when I got started on this and he said,
why don't we do a survey?

283
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:16.570
So he did a survey monkey instrument and got 600 student answers.

284
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:22.180
And the most interesting thing about it was that something over 200 of the 600

285
00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.330
thought that they were ineligible to join Morrie's.

286
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.890
They thought it was somehow for all different reasons,

287
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.430
but a third of our market just thought can't go there.

288
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:39.420
Um,
so that's kind of an issue.
Well the,
the,

289
00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:41.403
the,
uh,

290
00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:46.560
also in the background university has done some focus groups over the last five

291
00:21:47.171 --> 00:21:52.171
years looking for a what students and the larger Yale community won in the

292
00:21:52.781 --> 00:21:57.280
Broadway block,
part of the unit,
part of part of town.
What do you think comes up?

293
00:21:57.281 --> 00:21:58.114
Number one

294
00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:02.830
bar and a specific kind of bar,

295
00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:07.570
a sports bar.
And uh,

296
00:22:07.571 --> 00:22:09.160
what we're going to do is,

297
00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:14.050
and the back of the building facing away from York steet street toward the

298
00:22:14.051 --> 00:22:18.160
bookstore toward Morse and stiles toward the retail block,

299
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.760
we're going to put a bar that will have a walkway and an indoor walkway into the

300
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:27.530
main building.
And we will be a kind of,
um,

301
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:33.720
it'll have characteristic Morrie's memorabilia and a Yale atmosphere to it.

302
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:39.010
But there will be plasmas and you can watch,
you know,
even some such,

303
00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:44.110
uh,
below the salt institutions as Michigan and the University of Southern

304
00:22:44.111 --> 00:22:48.130
California and so on,
uh,
on a plasma screen,

305
00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.620
the,
um,

306
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:54.280
and that slot into the,

307
00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:58.080
the basic bottom line goal.
Uh,

308
00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.830
Maurice did $900,000 in business.
You had had,
uh,

309
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:07.480
roughly a million and a half and expenses.
So last year you do the math.

310
00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:14.220
The average labor cost embodied in each meal served was $31 and 50 cents.

311
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:21.780
Cogitate that for a second.
I didn't say anything about the cost of the food.

312
00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.920
Heat,
electricity,
Labor,

313
00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.130
Labor 31 50.
Yes.

314
00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:32.760
I remember you mentioned in class earlier this year that it was because of the

315
00:23:32.761 --> 00:23:34.860
labor unions.
And so is that still a problem?

316
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.903
<v 1>MMM.</v>

317
00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:44.650
<v 0>One of the reasons we didn't do this a few weeks ago is that I can't give a give</v>

318
00:23:44.651 --> 00:23:46.820
a straight answered every question.

319
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:53.330
And that's one of the questions,
which is very much up in the air.
Uh,
it,

320
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:55.970
if I said it was because of the union,
I misspoke.

321
00:23:55.971 --> 00:24:00.230
The union is my assessment is that the problems for the union,

322
00:24:00.231 --> 00:24:04.670
we're about a quarter to a third of what was wrong.
And Chris,

323
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:08.330
you know,
mostly when,
when people say we've got a terrible labor problem,

324
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:12.500
first question you have to ask is don't you maybe have a terrible management

325
00:24:12.501 --> 00:24:15.010
problem and uh,

326
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:19.320
Maurice had both and often the trouble,
the,

327
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:24.050
the contract was onerous.
There's no question,
um,
uh,

328
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:29.060
tight work rules,
benefits a comparable to General Motors.

329
00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:34.970
Um,
it was,
it was a bad contract,
but,
uh,

330
00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:39.500
we have a very cooperative relationship with unite here and local to 17,

331
00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:45.160
and we're working on a constructive agreement that will include all kinds of

332
00:24:45.201 --> 00:24:49.250
things you don't usually see in labor contracts.
This is me speaking,

333
00:24:49.251 --> 00:24:51.110
not an official statement.

334
00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.310
It is my hope that it will include a uh,

335
00:24:55.340 --> 00:25:00.340
individual incentive story where if people work hard and help us produce

336
00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:06.680
profits,
they'll share in them beyond their wages.
Um,

337
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:11.090
and I actually think we might get to that.
I have no,
no,
nothing to announce,

338
00:25:11.091 --> 00:25:15.180
but just an aspiration.
Okay.
So,
uh,

339
00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:20.290
we eventually come up with a business plan and Maurice has to go from 900,000 in

340
00:25:22.041 --> 00:25:26.900
business to 1,000,009,
uh,
and much under 1,000,009.

341
00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:31.230
Uh,
it isn't going to work.
So,
uh,

342
00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.290
then you ask yourself,

343
00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.580
how many restaurants in new haven make 1,000,009 a year in gross revenue?

344
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:38.660
Anybody got a guess?

345
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:47.300
They're Mbas in the room.
You guys are good at guessing
Igor,

346
00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.970
will they have,
how many restaurants make a million?

347
00:25:50.971 --> 00:25:53.760
Nine a year gross in,
in new haven.

348
00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:58.530
Okay.
Zero.
You're not too far off.
Richard,

349
00:25:58.531 --> 00:26:01.080
will you have a handful?

350
00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:05.700
You nailed it too is the answer.

351
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:11.940
There are exactly two such restaurants and they're both,
uh,

352
00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:17.430
on the edge of the campus and therefore potentially competitors to Maurice.

353
00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:18.953
Can you name them?

354
00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:21.443
<v 3>No.</v>

355
00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:23.510
<v 0>Union league.</v>

356
00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:27.383
<v 3>Say Again?</v>

357
00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:36.010
<v 0>I think I heard the right answer.
Zinc.
Yeah.
And those are guests.</v>

358
00:26:36.011 --> 00:26:40.240
Those are guesses on my part there rather well educated guesses.

359
00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:44.870
It's not as if these restaurants gave me their books.
Um,

360
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:49.170
but they're my good gay there.
My guesses.
So that's the competitive standard.

361
00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:51.013
Um,

362
00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:57.490
Borys what drives the business?

363
00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:03.110
What's the first driver you have to think about?
Well,
the,

364
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:06.760
we all know it has to do with food,
drink service,

365
00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:09.100
quality of experience in every way.

366
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:11.143
<v 1>MMM.</v>

367
00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.980
<v 0>But why don't more people walk through the door?
Well,</v>

368
00:27:14.981 --> 00:27:18.520
partly because all those things are not very good,

369
00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.850
but partly because they don't think they're invited

370
00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:28.060
and because they don't think they're invited,
it never occurs to them to come.

371
00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.670
<v 1>Now what</v>

372
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:32.783
<v 0>if you were going to,</v>

373
00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:37.110
let's name a demographic by how old they are,

374
00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:40.350
how much money they make,
um,
and where they live.

375
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.160
Who should we think of as the people who,

376
00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:47.850
who can make more ease into,
excuse me,

377
00:27:47.851 --> 00:27:49.590
a one point $9 million business.

378
00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:53.003
<v 1>Okay.</v>

379
00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:58.640
<v 0>How about a Yale Alumni living in California?</v>

380
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:01.783
<v 1>Okay.</v>

381
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.490
<v 0>Hands up for that.
Okay,</v>

382
00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:12.790
so that's not so that the fact that Yale has 160,000 living alumni and that the

383
00:28:15.081 --> 00:28:18.560
vast majority of them have handsome incomes.

384
00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:20.170
<v 1>Okay.</v>

385
00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:21.760
<v 0>Does that solve our problem or not?</v>

386
00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.073
<v 1>Not.</v>

387
00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.630
<v 0>Okay.
Is there a subset that might help solve our problem?</v>

388
00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:30.793
<v 1>Okay.</v>

389
00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:34.340
<v 0>Yes.
Okay,
good.</v>

390
00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:38.200
It's a 30 mile radius,
right?
And there,

391
00:28:38.201 --> 00:28:43.201
there are about 7,800 yellow alumni in a 30 mile radius.

392
00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.510
Uh,
and we're now getting almost none of them.

393
00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:53.250
Can you think of another market segment that you might want to pay attention to?

394
00:28:55.430 --> 00:29:00.300
It's already been mentioned.
Yeah,
I'm holding up a mirror.
It's you

395
00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:04.210
<v 1>now.
Um,</v>

396
00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:09.460
<v 0>let's start.
May I presume to start with you?</v>

397
00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:11.560
Can I have one of these mics?

398
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:17.463
<v 1>Uh,</v>

399
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.290
<v 0>this is a sales call.</v>

400
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:21.303
<v 1>Okay.</v>

401
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.510
<v 0>I'd like you to join Morrie's.</v>

402
00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:26.853
<v 1>What is that?</v>

403
00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:33.450
<v 0>How much do I have to pay a,
you have to pay $15.
What year are you?</v>

404
00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.240
I'm a senior.
You're a senior.
Okay.

405
00:29:36.241 --> 00:29:41.241
Well you're not going to get the best deal because the price is for the duration

406
00:29:41.471 --> 00:29:43.660
of your years at Yale as a student.

407
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:49.500
The price is $15 and we're going to give you a $10 food and drink credit.

408
00:29:50.111 --> 00:29:52.870
Are you 21?
Yeah.
Okay,

409
00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:56.400
so a $10 drink and food credit.

410
00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:01.660
Um,
so the net cost to you,

411
00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.890
if you liked either drink or eat,
and we have good stuff is $5

412
00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:11.180
I picked my nose.
Yeah.
Five.

413
00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:15.250
Now you're going to have to write a check for 15 but you'll spike one of those

414
00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:18.640
rebate coupons.
You know,
you got to do it or not.

415
00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:23.600
I'd have to,
it depends on other people I know are going to do it.
Okay.

416
00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.650
That's a really good answer,
right?

417
00:30:25.651 --> 00:30:29.880
It depends on if other people I know are going to do it.
And,

418
00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:34.800
um,
just how I think you're exactly right.
But tell me,

419
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:38.640
tell me how you got what,
what are you thinking?
Um,
well,

420
00:30:38.641 --> 00:30:42.660
I've never been to Morrie's before and I don't want to just go and sit by myself

421
00:30:42.661 --> 00:30:45.180
with nothing.
No one else I know is going to be there.
Okay.

422
00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:50.180
That's absolutely the right answer,
right?
Because,
uh,

423
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.830
restaurants and clubs are so called network good.

424
00:30:55.500 --> 00:31:00.500
And the value of going by yourself and sitting in the corner is not very hot.

425
00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:05.820
Right.
It's meant to be friendly.
Okay.
So there's,
there's a huge insight there.

426
00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:06.950
Let me try a couple more people.

427
00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:12.950
<v 3>Um,
Jennifer,
how about you?</v>

428
00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:19.210
<v 0>I,
this was sales part sales call.
You already know the price.</v>

429
00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:22.830
<v 4>All right.
Well,
I'd want to know what kind of food they serve because if I have,</v>

430
00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:24.390
if I'm a picky eater,

431
00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:27.210
maybe I wouldn't even enjoy going there because I'm not 21 yet.

432
00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:32.340
<v 0>Okay.
You're not 21.
Are you a picky eater?
Uh,
for these purposes?</v>

433
00:31:32.341 --> 00:31:36.120
Yes.
Today.
Okay.
And w what are,
what are you,

434
00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:37.710
where are your criteria?

435
00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:41.030
<v 4>Uh,
let's say I'm a Vegan,
would I eat</v>

436
00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:43.733
well?

437
00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:45.500
<v 0>So the,
the,</v>

438
00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:49.400
the three quarter pound hamburger that we plan to serve is not going to do it

439
00:31:49.401 --> 00:31:53.810
for you.
Yeah.
Okay.
So you're going to want to have you don't insist,

440
00:31:53.811 --> 00:31:56.210
I insist that we serve only vegan food.

441
00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:59.950
<v 4>No,
but I want to know that if I go there,
I will enjoy my experience.</v>

442
00:31:59.951 --> 00:32:02.770
So if you have the options that I would eat.

443
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:07.650
<v 0>Okay.
So vegan options and uh,
we're,</v>

444
00:32:07.651 --> 00:32:11.410
we're going to be open a lot.
Used to be,
we roping 39 hours a week,

445
00:32:11.411 --> 00:32:14.380
we're going to be open 65 and a half hours a week.

446
00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:19.570
And a lot of that extra time is pub time where the restaurant will be closed,

447
00:32:19.571 --> 00:32:24.571
but the pub will be open and the ideas come in and meet your friends for a drink

448
00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.090
and have a big Vegan Burger.

449
00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.370
How are we getting anywhere with you on that?
With Vegan Burger or net?

450
00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:36.480
<v 4>Ah,
yeah.
And you know,
most things served at a bar are Vegan,
so I think I would,</v>

451
00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:37.323
sure.
Okay.

452
00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:42.410
<v 0>So you're excited.
You're,
did you sign up or not?
Still in doubt.</v>

453
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:44.240
Okay.
All right.

454
00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:47.060
<v 1>Uh,
uh,</v>

455
00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:48.810
<v 0>let's go right here.</v>

456
00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:52.523
<v 1>MMM.</v>

457
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:58.540
<v 0>So 15 bucks,
minus 10.
Um,
yeah,
I mean I actually,</v>

458
00:32:58.541 --> 00:33:03.460
I thoroughly enjoyed going even before the,
uh,
before it shut down.
But,
um,

459
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.210
even I never see,
I never went to it's,
he was the thing though.
We,

460
00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:09.500
we always went for,

461
00:33:09.501 --> 00:33:11.710
for cops to the group of friends or something along those lines.

462
00:33:11.711 --> 00:33:15.700
So I'm definitely attracted by the car.
And do you actually like cups?

463
00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:21.280
Um,
I,
I,
it was more just sort of the,
the experience,

464
00:33:21.281 --> 00:33:22.540
which is what was being discussed.

465
00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:25.270
I actually think there's this peculiar thing about cops.

466
00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:30.340
I know lots of people who do cups and don't like them

467
00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.170
and it's what they're doing and it's your point.
It's the social thing.

468
00:33:35.171 --> 00:33:38.380
It's with your friends that Chris,
can you claim to like cops?

469
00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.260
Um,

470
00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.560
probably not
quite right.
Yeah,

471
00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:55.000
it is the experience.
Jonathan,
I think I remember that.
You don't much care farm

472
00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:58.140
<v 1>and I liked to drink.</v>

473
00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:02.690
<v 0>Yeah.
We have that in common.
All three of us.
Yep.</v>

474
00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:06.740
<v 1>Uh,
so,</v>

475
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:10.430
<v 0>uh,
it's a pretty diverse student market,</v>

476
00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:13.450
<v 1>but,
uh,</v>

477
00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.620
<v 0>it turns out that the students are the drivers,</v>

478
00:34:16.621 --> 00:34:18.330
the biggest driver for the whole thing.

479
00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:24.290
And the reason is that the ambiance of the place is geriatric,

480
00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:31.050
right?
And Geriatric is boring.
Uh,
for example,

481
00:34:31.051 --> 00:34:34.910
I got my [inaudible] mother to move into an assisted living home a year ago,

482
00:34:34.911 --> 00:34:38.540
and she said,
promise me you'll get me out of here after a year if I hate it.

483
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:42.260
And after a year,
she said,
I hate being around these old people.

484
00:34:42.261 --> 00:34:46.300
Get me out of here and she's out.
Um,

485
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.950
and so we've got to get you involved to get other people involved.
Now,

486
00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:52.550
uh,

487
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:57.500
the faculty are also the term turns out the faculty are the biggest spenders on

488
00:34:57.501 --> 00:34:59.240
a per capita basis at Morrie's.

489
00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.860
It's moving a piano,
I guess.
Uh,

490
00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:08.740
but we're still way short of enough.

491
00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:13.240
What I've talked about now so far is about enough to do a million,
1,000,001,

492
00:35:13.241 --> 00:35:16.720
1,000,002.
Where else are we going to go looking for customers?

493
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:27.010
Anybody got a thought in the back?
That's that.
Let me get you the mic.

494
00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:38.080
Tourists and visitors.
New Haven.
Okay.
Um,

495
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.500
tourists and visitors.
What do you think guys?

496
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:48.720
John,
do you think that'll work or not?
Yeah.

497
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:51.090
The trouble with that is that we're a club now.

498
00:35:51.091 --> 00:35:54.600
It could be the people who have reciprocal agreements with the Morrie's club.

499
00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:57.750
And there are how many clubs like that right now,
there's only,

500
00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:02.940
but they're going to be several Rio.
Okay.
Okay.

501
00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:07.290
Uh,
we,
our business plan counts on no business from tourists.

502
00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:10.910
Uh,
anybody else got a thought?

503
00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:15.730
Making members renew membership annually.

504
00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.880
So even if they are not actually coming into the restaurant,

505
00:36:18.881 --> 00:36:21.190
they still pay the membership fee.
Okay.

506
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:25.870
Turns out that the membership dues are,
are they're a nice little add on,

507
00:36:25.871 --> 00:36:29.680
but they're there in the neighborhood of the last couple hundred thousand

508
00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:33.280
dollars.
Uh,
you know,
and that's not chicken feed for us,

509
00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:38.180
but it's not foundational.
Uh,

510
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:39.370
in the back,

511
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:45.430
one of the barriers for Maurice was the perception of exclusivity and you open

512
00:36:46.991 --> 00:36:50.620
up membership to the larger Yale Community broadly defined,

513
00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:53.650
that would open up new revenue streams.
So not just the students,

514
00:36:53.651 --> 00:36:58.150
but faculty and staff as well.
Okay.
That's huge.

515
00:36:58.750 --> 00:36:59.860
Uh,
first of all,

516
00:36:59.861 --> 00:37:03.040
the entire staff of the university becomes eligible for membership,

517
00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:07.660
whatever the rank or job description.
Uh,
and

518
00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.910
uh,
second,
uh,

519
00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:18.070
the subway alumni are a very important part of any university,
right?

520
00:37:18.071 --> 00:37:21.520
Like Notre Dame has a pot,
6 million subway alumni,

521
00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:27.570
people who identify with the school and do all the stuff and never set foot on

522
00:37:28.541 --> 00:37:33.400
an in the role of student.
Um,
and Yale has some of that to quite a lot of it.

523
00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:39.180
So where do we go looking for people who obviously love the institution,

524
00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:43.960
uh,
but don't,

525
00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:49.170
don't show up on our record of alumni and such like a bar associations.

526
00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:55.860
Say again,
like the parents of the students,
pair parents.
Uh,

527
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:57.360
yeah,
student parents are,

528
00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:02.410
are one segment of subway alumni and we think we probably get four or 500 of

529
00:38:02.591 --> 00:38:06.080
them to join,
uh,
annually.
And so that's,

530
00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:08.320
that's not inconsequential.

531
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:14.023
Yeah.
University

532
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.580
donors.
Okay.

533
00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:25.930
Anybody who has ever given a hundred bucks to Yale alumni or not a is clearly

534
00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:33.650
eligible.
Anybody else you might think of?
Richard?
Yes.
Sporting events.

535
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:36.940
Yale's sporting events.
Very good.

536
00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:41.800
And how would we,
how would we go about,

537
00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:45.040
how would we go about finding the right list there?

538
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.823
<v 3>Okay.</v>

539
00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:53.500
<v 0>It's first of all a club,
you know,
we're not Joe's bar and grill,</v>

540
00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:58.750
so we can't sort of walk around at halftime at a football game with assigned,

541
00:38:58.810 --> 00:38:59.710
come to Morrie's

542
00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:05.670
<v 3>affiliated with the university together.</v>

543
00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:07.700
Just kind of take it and get it for free.
He's,

544
00:39:07.701 --> 00:39:11.590
and your student card or whatever it is,
you want to listen to the,

545
00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:16.410
<v 0>okay.
So we want actual paying customers and the,</v>

546
00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:21.390
the people we would aim at our tick season ticket holders,
right.

547
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:25.230
Season ticket holders for Yale athletics.
Okay.

548
00:39:25.231 --> 00:39:27.480
There any other groups like that you might think of?

549
00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:31.853
<v 3>Okay.</v>

550
00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:36.600
<v 0>Let's talk about your parents and don't,
not about them being members of boys,</v>

551
00:39:36.601 --> 00:39:37.120
but what,

552
00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:42.120
what would trigger them to be members of Morrie's if they lived near Yale and

553
00:39:42.661 --> 00:39:44.010
we're not Yale alumnus.

554
00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:46.980
<v 3>Let me take a shot at that.</v>

555
00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:52.020
<v 0>Not really.
Okay,
that's fine.</v>

556
00:39:58.210 --> 00:39:59.043
<v 3>Where are we?</v>

557
00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:02.540
<v 0>These Mbas?
No,
at all.</v>

558
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:03.543
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

559
00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:10.280
<v 6>Well,
I guess,
uh,
as,
as parents coming to visit your student or your,</v>

560
00:40:10.281 --> 00:40:12.450
your son or daughter as a student,
um,

561
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:15.340
you may not necessarily be able to spend all the time that you're on campus with

562
00:40:15.341 --> 00:40:19.360
them and you want somewhere you can go and that just kind of kill some time

563
00:40:19.361 --> 00:40:20.110
while you're waiting.

564
00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:23.620
<v 0>Okay.
So that's the parent niche again.</v>

565
00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:29.040
How about people who have already shown a propensity to spend money in things

566
00:40:29.561 --> 00:40:30.640
like Mars?

567
00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:36.310
How about the membership roster of the new haven law and club?

568
00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:41.770
How about the membership roster of the Quinnipiac Club where the graduates club

569
00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:46.960
for the new haven country club or any one of 20 other comparable clubs in a 30

570
00:40:48.251 --> 00:40:51.040
Mile Circle,
what do you think?

571
00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:56.740
Who's got an intuition one way or the other about that?
Um,

572
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.080
let me,
let me,
let me give you another,
another,
another hint about that.

573
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:07.710
The dues at most of those clubs is measured in the low thousands per year.

574
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:11.990
The dues at Maury,

575
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:15.170
no one will pay more than a hundred dollars a year for Morrie's.

576
00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:17.210
<v 3>Okay.</v>

577
00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:20.000
<v 0>I have pro.
And if you are a member of the log club,</v>

578
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:22.080
the lawn club has food that is better than more,

579
00:41:22.081 --> 00:41:25.610
each bought a hell of a lot worse than union league.

580
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:27.370
<v 3>Okay.</v>

581
00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:32.320
<v 0>And if I came to you and said a hundred bucks,
a hundred bucks,</v>

582
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:36.470
2000 bucks,
100 bucks,
2000 bucks,

583
00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:40.010
I might get you to switch clubs,

584
00:41:40.011 --> 00:41:43.280
but more likely when I'd get you to do is to add Morrie's.

585
00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.000
Um,
yes,
Jim

586
00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:55.800
leaving out the all important a potential drinking business of the Grad and

587
00:41:55.920 --> 00:42:00.330
professional students.
We are,
and I should point out to you the Jim Alexander,

588
00:42:00.331 --> 00:42:04.480
whom you all know well,
not just from his Enron days,
uh,

589
00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:09.780
uh,
is in eight days from now assuming office as President of Alon Club.

590
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:14.360
And I was talking about stealing his members,
sort of just to have fun with it.

591
00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:20.190
And do you think he can keep that membership list secret from me?

592
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:23.370
I was president two years ago,

593
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:29.210
plus there's a membership directory that is published

594
00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.610
now.
Would I want to harden the lung club?
Not at all,

595
00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:40.280
but what I like to get in on the action.
Absolutely.
Now.

596
00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:43.540
Uh,
yeah guys,
I have a question.

597
00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:49.180
Does it follow this follow this line of sight?

598
00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:52.470
So just a criticism I guess,

599
00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:56.490
are you a bit concerned that if you open the net too broadly to Quinnipiac is to

600
00:42:56.491 --> 00:43:00.060
Shane's yeah,
long club,
etc. That you may be diluting.

601
00:43:00.061 --> 00:43:03.000
What was the value of the institution?
The first place,

602
00:43:03.001 --> 00:43:04.110
which is what we mentioned before,

603
00:43:04.111 --> 00:43:08.730
which is the history of being a Yale institution.
Okay.
Um,

604
00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:13.660
that's a good question.
And uh,
let me,
let,
let,
let's turn it,

605
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:18.540
let's go back to Jonathan and Chris about that.
If we let too many,
uh,

606
00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:21.930
non blues in the door,
does the,

607
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:25.050
does the value of it for the Blues Begin to erode?

608
00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.620
I don't think so.
Uh,

609
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:33.290
<v 5>I don't think you can tell a yield graduate from a nine graduate,</v>

610
00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:37.630
frankly,
out in the general marketplace.
Uh,

611
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.870
I believe that the nature of Morrie's is going to be self selecting

612
00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:48.330
people who are interested in do you want any,
um,

613
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.920
will will naturally go there.

614
00:43:51.921 --> 00:43:56.921
Those who might not fit what you considered the mold or alluded that probably

615
00:43:58.341 --> 00:43:59.174
would say you need.

616
00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:01.780
<v 0>Okay.
Um,</v>

617
00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:05.760
I actually think there is a little bit of a dilution problem and you know,

618
00:44:05.761 --> 00:44:08.970
there's a little bit of a kind of Groucho Marx things thing.
We're just saying,

619
00:44:08.971 --> 00:44:13.640
I don't want to be a member of a club.
They'll have me,
um,
the,

620
00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:19.450
but the segment of students that we think we're going to get quite a great

621
00:44:19.451 --> 00:44:24.100
change from that it started from zero is graduate and professional students.

622
00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.850
Uh,
Leslie,
uh,

623
00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:29.770
Leslie's a phd candidate in the political science department.

624
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:33.060
What are our prospects with you?

625
00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:37.950
<v 6>Well,
um,
I,
I'd say they're fairly good.</v>

626
00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:43.440
What we already pitched it to me as an upscale version of gypsy.

627
00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:48.053
<v 0>No,</v>

628
00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:55.230
the one,
one of the things,
how about Mbas?

629
00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:01.230
I,
I'm hoping we're going to get about an 80% response rate from Mbas.

630
00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:06.540
What do you think guys and what,
what is it and if you,

631
00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:11.280
and other than trying to try this please me at the moment,

632
00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:15.730
uh,
what are you going to get out of it?
Anybody?

633
00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:17.560
<v 6>Hey,</v>

634
00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:21.630
I think that for an Mba there's also a lot of benefit in the connections with

635
00:45:21.631 --> 00:45:25.470
other alumni that are willing to pay and come back as far as networking and

636
00:45:25.471 --> 00:45:29.160
future job opportunities and just getting to know people in specific areas.

637
00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:30.720
<v 0>Yep.
And one more,</v>

638
00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:37.290
<v 6>and also I don't know of another place aside from Gypsy that has a patio where</v>

639
00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:41.540
we can just share a pitcher and,
um,

640
00:45:41.541 --> 00:45:45.400
I think there's real value in just being able to have an anchor institution

641
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:48.610
that's close to the center of the university campus.

642
00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:52.660
<v 0>Absolutely.
Um,
so,
uh,</v>

643
00:45:52.661 --> 00:45:57.130
crash and we've got five minutes left and I'll actually

644
00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:04.800
circle back to this later in the course.
But,
uh,

645
00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:10.080
let's hear your pitch.
Chris is a born salesman.
Uh,

646
00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:15.640
he is the best fundraiser I've ever been close to.

647
00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:20.950
Um,
we've raised,
what was the number we determined this morning?

648
00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:26.470
One point $7 million so far.
And uh,

649
00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:28.780
Chris Pitch this thing.

650
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:33.720
<v 2>Well,
I been pitch it to the students or today</v>

651
00:46:33.830 --> 00:46:35.690
<v 0>pitch it,
pitch it general for what?</v>

652
00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:38.320
<v 2>First of all,
as Doug said,</v>

653
00:46:38.321 --> 00:46:41.050
right now the food at Morrie's is worse than the lawn club.

654
00:46:41.051 --> 00:46:45.970
I happened to be a longtime member of the lawn club and eat there,

655
00:46:45.971 --> 00:46:49.480
ate there yesterday only because I couldn't go to Maurice.

656
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:53.410
But I think that in the future,
the food at Morrie's is going to,

657
00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:54.340
this is our hope anyway,

658
00:46:54.341 --> 00:46:58.540
the food and the service is going to be something that people will want to go

659
00:46:58.541 --> 00:47:03.420
back to.
We had a lot of people who go there for the first time and say,

660
00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:06.670
oh,
this is so cool because it is a unique place.

661
00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:12.100
Blot their dining experience both food wise and service wise was,

662
00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.730
was mediocre so they didn't become regular customers.

663
00:47:15.731 --> 00:47:20.440
So our first hope is that all everybody and the bar in the back,

664
00:47:20.441 --> 00:47:25.441
we think with the pub is going to be ideal for students and grownups for that

665
00:47:26.591 --> 00:47:30.850
matter.
Uh,
and I just want add to what Doug was saying,

666
00:47:30.851 --> 00:47:33.490
another couple of other groups that we're going to,

667
00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:38.580
we're going to target our subscribers to the Yale Rep subscribers to the new

668
00:47:39.041 --> 00:47:42.790
haven symphony orchestra subscribers,
delong or the Schubert.

669
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:48.160
We're people that we feel won't really dilute the character of the place.

670
00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:50.890
Um,
man,

671
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:55.950
we were very optimistic that people are going to think that Morris is a good

672
00:47:57.971 --> 00:48:02.350
value,
it's fun and uh,
they'll work.
They're going to want to go back there.

673
00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:06.850
And we're very optimistic about this million nine in revenue.
I just,

674
00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:08.470
I think that's a slam dunk.

675
00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:10.053
<v 0>Um,</v>

676
00:48:10.290 --> 00:48:14.250
and we'll be recruiting a marketing team,

677
00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.210
uh,
in,
uh,

678
00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:21.360
the spring term to help us,
uh,

679
00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:26.250
hit the numbers we have to with a new student enrollments.

680
00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:30.720
And I hope one or two of you will take an interest in that task.

681
00:48:30.721 --> 00:48:35.430
And so it's actually a really interesting,
uh,
set of business problems.

682
00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:38.810
Um,
first let's think my colleague

683
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.000
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

684
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:47.340
<v 0>on Monday.
Next,</v>

685
00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:51.360
please read the Goldman Sachs IPO,

686
00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:56.430
which we'll take apart and we'll have the help of a Goldman partner while we do

687
00:48:56.431 --> 00:48:56.550
it.
