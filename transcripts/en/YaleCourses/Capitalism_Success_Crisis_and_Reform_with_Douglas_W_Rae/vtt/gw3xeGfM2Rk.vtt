WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.130
We're very privileged,
uh,

2
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.430
today and Wednesday to have my dear and good friend of 35 years standing Paulos

3
00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:16.760
I noni who,
um,
has,
uh,

4
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.840
for quite a long time.

5
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:23.841
I've been a partner of Goldman Sachs and is indeed the second most senior member

6
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.390
of the Goldman Sachs partnership by age,
by age.

7
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.470
And today we're going to do it very informal class with facts on the slide sheet

8
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.550
as background.
Uh,
we're going to have Paolo,
uh,

9
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.610
talk about,

10
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.300
talk about how Goldman actually works at scene from the inside,

11
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.350
which will be a rare opportunity to see the most remarkable,

12
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.470
uh,
American business from,
uh,
from the interior,

13
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.390
which is,
it's truly a great opportunity for all of them.

14
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.600
And then on Wednesday,
uh,
Paolo,

15
00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:19.601
we'll do a major European case managed by Goldman Sachs and a case which was in

16
00:01:22.941 --> 00:01:26.990
progress when he was here a year ago and which has now come to a resolution.

17
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.080
The slide set for that is posted that will be a little more formal than today,

18
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.790
but still an informal,
informal in style.
Uh,

19
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.770
please help me welcome Paulo Sedona

20
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.870
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

21
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.290
<v 0>Paolo.
Um,
let's talk about you.
To begin with,</v>

22
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.910
uh,
you are a northern rather than a southern Italian sent on us.
Yeah.

23
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.450
Yes.
Yeah.
Is there any significance in north south in Italy?

24
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.550
Yes.
I think significantly.
Are there.

25
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.460
How many people of southern Italian descent in the room?

26
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.330
Sort of.
Ah,
okay.
What,
how would,

27
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.050
how do most northern Italians look on the look on that distinction?

28
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.920
Uh,
they look if that distinction like,
uh,

29
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.150
like this house was almost a colony.

30
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.160
I will queue by the or conquest in 1861 and a never really sort of conquered,

31
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.480
but I never really

32
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.210
simulate a simulator.
Yeah.
I,

33
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.240
the the north is the industrial and business heart of deadly.

34
00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:48.710
Is that a fair statement?

35
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.140
The North say he's the most industrialized parts.
Yes.

36
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.610
But back in the styles you will have a tote.
The Heck I,

37
00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:00.400
I've known we want to go into

38
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.680
<v 2>the Italian political economic system,</v>

39
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.430
but in the south you have certain areas that are,

40
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.360
but as a reasonably high level of interest,
I say,
uh,

41
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.790
how old are you came from?
You first arrived in the stage in what year?

42
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.790
1973.
1973.

43
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.380
And you came as a graduate student in the Yale Political Science Department.

44
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:28.300
I remember it well.
Paolo became an outstanding and touch football player

45
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.700
and too small for that.
No,
no,
you're really good at it.

46
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.940
And you even picked up the raw language of the game.

47
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.060
That's the head say size.
There is the,
uh,

48
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.560
and you left Yale.

49
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.890
He was 78 and 78 to go to work for Johnny and yelly yet Fiat.

50
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.340
Yeah.
Uh,
tell us a little about that.
Stemmed,

51
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.350
uh,
that's the [inaudible] I worked for.

52
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.540
I worked for the chairman of the board and also the owner of the controlling

53
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:12.410
stakes that fear to for about five or six years.
Right.

54
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.270
And after I became,
I wanted to do some,
uh,

55
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.830
some moral cooperation on experience.
And so I went to,

56
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.860
to manage the international business development department fit.

57
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.110
And in that capacity,

58
00:04:29.111 --> 00:04:33.610
I spend about five years in Washington here because,
uh,

59
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.670
we had a chairman or Fiera USA because we had some issues with the,

60
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.220
with the then the US government and after I spent two years in Moscow in 1990

61
00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:52.270
and 1991.
And,
and what were you looking at in Moscow?
In Moscow,

62
00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:56.170
I was looking to acquire the largest,
uh,

63
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.420
lashon manufacturer of automobiles that,
uh,

64
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.890
the government,
uh,
first the government of the Soviet Union and second,

65
00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:06.730
the government of this,

66
00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:11.731
of the rational or a pub league when the Soviet Union wasn't dismembered or

67
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.750
these appeared,
uh,

68
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.460
and decide to buy that that was their company has been established by fear as a

69
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:20.950
wholly on,
uh,
uh,

70
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:26.670
company from all he owned by the Soviet state about 15 years earlier.

71
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.200
And so it goes based on peer technology and,
uh,

72
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.890
both Gorbachev first and yells and after would want you to pay that dies and

73
00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:40.810
they will send out to taken by it.
And I'm success ultimately,

74
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.150
you ultimately walked away from the deal.
I understand that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

75
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.270
Or we walked away because it was an ordeal for the simple reason that the

76
00:05:49.271 --> 00:05:51.970
management and the regional,
some are very,

77
00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.980
John wanted to become owners of the factory

78
00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.720
<v 0>and,
uh,</v>

79
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:06.020
and to have ownership of the asset and a 100% control on the pallets on the

80
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.070
cashflow.
And so they were definitely,
they were not,

81
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.840
they were not willing to sell it to a right to a foreign yet.

82
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.460
So that's a nonstarter.
Then after,
after the,
the,
uh,

83
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.180
stood in Russia,

84
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.250
I did a couple of years a more fee it and after I decide to join goal,

85
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.000
then you joined Goldman and you joined them as what,

86
00:06:30.001 --> 00:06:31.700
what was your title at that time?

87
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.910
Is that time Goldman did not have managing director as opposed to Oh,

88
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.000
it only vice president,
sorry,

89
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.270
associate,
sorry.

90
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.620
I analyst associate and vice president of various degrees of seniority and uh,

91
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.700
I joined them as,
uh,

92
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:57.490
the last degree of vice president and after I became a managing director in nine

93
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:03.650
t seven and a partnering to Samson.
Okay.

94
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:05.940
And,
uh,

95
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.560
let's now turn to Goldman,
the,

96
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.580
I'm talking to these people now for a second.

97
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.640
You'll remember the stark contrast we've drawn between the ownership form,

98
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.400
uh,
of joint stock corporation,

99
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:30.060
publicly traded joint stock corporation on the one hand and a partnership on the

100
00:07:30.221 --> 00:07:31.180
other.
Uh,

101
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:36.240
can somebody help us out by naming the two or three variables on which flows to

102
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.360
our most importantly different.

103
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.220
Okay,
I'll settle for one.
Variable

104
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.380
<v 1>liability.</v>

105
00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:57.120
<v 0>Okay.
Limited liability in the case of the Joint Stock Corporation.
Go ahead.</v>

106
00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.370
Another tall

107
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.770
a liquidity.
Liquidity.
Huge difference,

108
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.670
right?
You can't sell your partnership and Goldman

109
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.310
partnership income is not taxed separate.
Okay.

110
00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:30.311
The partnership is invisible in the tax code so that the procedure reading give

111
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.740
you too.
Thank you.
Once ones get taxed,
the individuals of course get taxed.

112
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:41.720
Okay.
But it's in a set in effect,
shaved one layer of taxation.

113
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:46.910
Yes.
The,
the right or ability,

114
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.670
um,
to make management decisions.
Okay?

115
00:08:49.671 --> 00:08:52.880
So that in the case of a partnership,

116
00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:56.430
every one has management job.

117
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:02.160
All the partners have management jobs where as with a corporation you have

118
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:07.290
centralized management or the board appoints a chief,

119
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:11.520
uh,
chief executive and the chief executive,
at least in theory,

120
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:16.110
is responsible for appointing everyone else.
Uh,
and finally,

121
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:22.250
how did the two do as media for raising capital mechanisms for raising capital?

122
00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:28.210
Uh,
back to tall,

123
00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:40.200
uh,
a core joint stock corporation as much more scalable.

124
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:41.670
It's got greater scalability.

125
00:09:41.671 --> 00:09:44.220
You can raise a lot more capital than a partnership.
Okay.

126
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:49.580
The joint stock corporation was created as a mechanism for gathering up capital

127
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:57.950
in very large quantities and it's good at now back to Paolo.

128
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.850
Historically Goldman was straight forwardly a partnership.

129
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.930
<v 2>What's a partnership up to 1999 but you ever had a,</v>

130
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.020
you ever read the case study with the IPL,

131
00:10:09.021 --> 00:10:11.930
Goldman Sachs and um,

132
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:19.120
<v 0>and it was an extraordinary partnership with an extraordinary record of success</v>

133
00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.060
in nearly all of its history.
Is that a fair statement?
You

134
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.230
<v 2>mean the 99 with</v>

135
00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:34.370
it's a first date when there are a couple of exceptions?
Uh,

136
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.490
1929,
tough one.
A lot of people,

137
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.560
yes,
top and a lot of people,
uh,
especially tough,

138
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:47.010
almost killed the partnership.
Uh,

139
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:52.500
there is another section we choose which is interesting for your class vehicles.

140
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:59.300
Usually a investment bank and securities for pain to do badly tend to be very

141
00:11:02.101 --> 00:11:06.500
cyclical and to do badly on the downturn.

142
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.390
And well from the op term there is one exception,

143
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.180
one exception of please just fire was born in Kurdistan,

144
00:11:12.181 --> 00:11:13.230
which is very interesting.

145
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:19.370
Everybody else was doing very well in 1994 what Goldman was doing very badly.

146
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:25.750
And it almost killed the partnership as badly as a,

147
00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.380
as badly,
as a 90,

148
00:11:28.381 --> 00:11:33.381
almost as badly in 1928 and as badly as the crisis for a petty center and in

149
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.370
dairy zone.
The reason for that and that,
uh,
again,
uh,
you know,

150
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.110
mixed blessings,
one of the,
uh,

151
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:50.300
one of the facts of life there reason why Goldman was doing very badly was

152
00:11:50.581 --> 00:11:55.581
because Goldman is as tried a very aggressively to do a proprietary trade,

153
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:02.210
especially in fixed income.
And,
uh,

154
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:07.500
that was not really part of the Goldman culture.

155
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:13.290
And,
uh,
the risk management in the trading,

156
00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:19.840
the trading organization or Goldman was very bad.

157
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.850
And uh,
in 19,
toward the end of 1994,

158
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.490
the second half of 1994,

159
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:33.450
Goldman start having losses that at that time were staggered or especially for a

160
00:12:36.191 --> 00:12:38.710
partnership and almost the Capitol,

161
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.290
the Capitol of the partnership was almost wiped down.

162
00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:47.220
And actually that's where,
uh,
that's where the,
the,

163
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:52.360
where the firm had their American bull ability of select a group of leaders that

164
00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:56.170
a new that came from trading new,

165
00:12:56.171 --> 00:13:01.060
proprietary trading very well.
Even if some of them were not born in the same,

166
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:06.090
that same organization in way able to restructure the trading,

167
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.840
the trading philosophy and this special is the risk management function or

168
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.063
Goldman.

169
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:17.080
And probably one of the reason why Goldman has done not so badly on the created

170
00:13:17.081 --> 00:13:21.100
Kranz is because of that whole level of uh,

171
00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.490
the risk or risk management end of,
uh,
end of the trading

172
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:31.790
or mat style in control of the autonomy of the traders.
Okay.

173
00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.390
Actually the two people that DDH,

174
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:38.430
one was [inaudible] who was the managing partner when the firm went public and

175
00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:42.520
the other was Lloyd Blankfein who is a CEO today

176
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:46.940
<v 0>and core design may be available shortly.</v>

177
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.820
You could go to cam back to Goldman.
I'm kidding.

178
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:53.360
Haven't seen he wants to

179
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:58.810
move the just notice,

180
00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:04.100
notice the style in which Paolo just said something.
He said

181
00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.580
Boldman has done

182
00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:14.080
fairly well in the current crisis now that's a huge understatement.

183
00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.750
Goldman has blown the doors off.
The current crisis

184
00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:27.380
end of 2008 wasn't the nice beard.
It was an ugly period.

185
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:32.450
But compared with all its competitors in this and in many other matters,

186
00:14:32.451 --> 00:14:37.451
Goldman has been absolutely tops and part of the culture is not to sort of chest

187
00:14:41.961 --> 00:14:45.620
thumping is not the Goldman style.

188
00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:51.130
There's a very understated style that emerges a and which I think it bodies.

189
00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:54.903
Um,

190
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:59.830
but now the move to a corporation corporate ownership for,

191
00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:05.630
uh,
has an obvious upside in raising capital,

192
00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:11.450
uh,
but an apparent downside in changing the incentives

193
00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:17.960
for top management in a way that might at first blush seems likely to undermine

194
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:25.190
the cultural strengths of the historical partnership.

195
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:32.120
And why don't I shut up for quite a while now and let's get you talking about,

196
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:39.650
about how that has been accomplished and how it works.
And,

197
00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:40.893
uh,

198
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:46.090
somewhere or another we ought to talk about how people are recruited to the

199
00:15:46.791 --> 00:15:47.930
partnership and,

200
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:53.290
and to leadership roles in the firm and how that might relate to the style of

201
00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.720
management that you,
that you get with [inaudible].

202
00:15:58.920 --> 00:15:59.140
<v 2>See,</v>

203
00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:03.220
I'm [inaudible] at you and I'm sure that at any bags course you're going to sit

204
00:16:03.221 --> 00:16:06.830
and wait.
And parties in the case that I have read,
uh,

205
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.730
the two advantages of a partnership,

206
00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:14.110
especially in the investment banking word and,
uh,
as securities for,

207
00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.420
I mean,
my opinion,
one is that,
uh,
as,

208
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:24.480
as opposed to the joint stock corporation and which a diag the diag discuss with

209
00:16:24.521 --> 00:16:26.730
you in a partnership.
Uh,

210
00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.100
there is no split between management and ownership.

211
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:36.750
The owners of the capital of the firm are also the managers of the company.

212
00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:41.800
And so that's,
that's accord,
creative set of incentive.

213
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:47.550
But by not distinguishing between provider of capitals in the,

214
00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:52.360
uh,
in the end,
the people that have the control of the operation of the firm

215
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.000
in Goldman,
every generation of partners,

216
00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:01.720
leaders have always been convenience.
The DDOS is a great advantage.

217
00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:07.700
Uh,
the other adventure that you have is that,
uh,
uh,

218
00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:08.860
and these are the an event,

219
00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:13.060
especially in an investment bank in new securities firm,

220
00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:17.470
which are people business,
they have no,
if you look at these,

221
00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:22.530
if you look at these companies that are America ball in the amount of sales or

222
00:17:22.571 --> 00:17:26.050
revenues that they have,
they have no fixed capital,

223
00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:30.120
have no buildings.
Most of the building at least

224
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.430
they have no plant and equipment.

225
00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:37.870
They have low patrons is just the people's business.

226
00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.400
And so when you are rounding the People's business,
uh,

227
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:46.470
one of your core competencies has got to be the ability of coordinate the

228
00:17:48.461 --> 00:17:49.860
behavior to those people.

229
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:55.010
So it's thousand 4,020 sounds and Goldman has always been convinced that the

230
00:17:55.261 --> 00:17:57.060
partnership structure,

231
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:02.840
it's a idea to coordinate the behavior or the top echelon of the firm.

232
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:13.130
And so the real challenge that Goldman was facing when Goldman decided to go

233
00:18:13.501 --> 00:18:18.501
public was to try to combine the advantages of the joint stock corporation,

234
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.350
especially in raising permanent capital.

235
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:28.020
Because the partnership capital is not permanent.
It's limited.

236
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.390
But if you are very successful,

237
00:18:30.391 --> 00:18:35.391
the limitation or not so much on size as they are on the availability of their

238
00:18:36.511 --> 00:18:38.580
capital for a long period of time,

239
00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.620
because of course you can put a restriction on the partners on taking away the

240
00:18:43.621 --> 00:18:45.690
capitol when they become limited.

241
00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:50.020
But those restriction we'll just put along the,
the,

242
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:52.950
their ability to take capital out.
But the,
if not,

243
00:18:52.951 --> 00:18:56.040
nobody would like to be a partner with the capital,
cannot be taken out.

244
00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:59.730
Goldman tie to the Goldman,

245
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:03.750
the then leadership of Goldman and try to combine the advantages of the

246
00:19:03.751 --> 00:19:08.250
partnership as far as having the owner management,

247
00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.410
uh,
to get the owners,

248
00:19:10.411 --> 00:19:15.411
managers manage the company and the ability to coordinate behavior.

249
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:21.750
So what Goldman tie to do,
and he's a unique form of corporate governance,

250
00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:26.400
is a partnership that is also a joint stock company.

251
00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:28.590
And so for instance,

252
00:19:28.591 --> 00:19:33.591
the title of partner was not eliminated and Goldman built a structure in which

253
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:41.570
partners are rewarded and incentivized in a different way from the other

254
00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:49.310
stockholders.
Uh,
the other thing that,
uh,

255
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.530
the other thing that goal and decided to do was,

256
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.720
which is unusual in joint stock company and you won't find it in any other

257
00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:01.800
partnership that has become a joint stock company was to maintain the structure

258
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:05.940
or the uh,
selection of leadership.

259
00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:11.930
I their selection of the partners almost as it was before it became a joint

260
00:20:15.211 --> 00:20:18.710
stock company where maybe so what you have let me die.

261
00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.720
Do what you have is that you have the legal form of a joint stock liability

262
00:20:25.771 --> 00:20:30.771
company in imposed into an organization that as organizational structure and

263
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:38.120
institution of government except at the top as maintain the same institution and

264
00:20:40.381 --> 00:20:45.381
the same type of leadership selection that you had in the partnership,

265
00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:48.730
let's Say Partnership Pre Ipo.

266
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:53.470
<v 0>Okay.
So let's talk about this leadership selection process.</v>

267
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:56.680
Beginning getting with the entering classes of employees.

268
00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.380
<v 2>Usually uh,</v>

269
00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:04.860
usually when you enter and golden man you are given a class like you are given a

270
00:21:04.861 --> 00:21:07.410
class.
When you went into,
Yay,
you are the class of

271
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:11.580
2007,
2008

272
00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:13.680
<v 0>w w we,</v>

273
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:18.090
we designate them by the year we designated by the year

274
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:19.263
<v 2>in which they start.</v>

275
00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:25.630
And that there is some sort of course was an arm in wheat.
Uh,

276
00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:30.690
you are generally considered for partnership once a year,

277
00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:37.030
spent a fair amount of time and the firm and uh,
once uh,
you have been,

278
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.540
you've done a stint as a managing director

279
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:47.160
and uh,
what,
when your,

280
00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.430
when your class is up for partnership.

281
00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:52.870
<v 0>Yeah.
How big are these classes?</v>

282
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:57.110
<v 2>More or less?
Depends.</v>

283
00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.690
But let's say that they are,

284
00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.420
if you wonder what people,

285
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.490
500 maybe know a little less boring book,

286
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:12.630
a forum between 400 and 100.
It also depends on cause you know,

287
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:18.000
Eh,
the partnership had been [inaudible] it's not,
there is no ratio.

288
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:22.830
When we went public,
the partnership or the partners were about 210 years ago.

289
00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:28.560
They were still lessons 303 years ago or four years ago.

290
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:33.030
Now there are more than four.
There will be a lot less in 2010.

291
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.610
Okay.
So

292
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:40.670
<v 0>we've got these groups of a few hundred and uh,
a certain point.
It comes time.</v>

293
00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.060
It comes down to be considered it time for someone that has done that.

294
00:22:44.061 --> 00:22:47.070
I've had a normal carrier.
It comes time to be

295
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.860
<v 2>conceited.
And the way,
the way,</v>

296
00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.440
the way the selection works,

297
00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:58.600
he's the partners of each division make oo or three,

298
00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:06.060
least of all the candy that have their own division,

299
00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.860
uh,
in a list B list and a c list.

300
00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.060
The alias theories,
they're the best candidate.

301
00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:19.900
There'd be least is the candy that are somewhere in between.

302
00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.080
In the Sealys there's a candy that's,
that are not,

303
00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:26.050
that do not have a lot of chances in that particular year.

304
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:30.430
The partnership selection every two years,
even years,

305
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.750
2000,
2002,
2004,
six,
eight,
10,

306
00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.300
uh,
once these,
uh,
selection one,

307
00:23:41.301 --> 00:23:43.040
this first selection has been done.

308
00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:48.820
What the firm diocese takes a group of people and charge them with

309
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.850
the task of asking,
uh,

310
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:59.950
the community of mostly of the professionals about the candidates.

311
00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:07.010
And so there are a group of people that,
uh,

312
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:12.400
conduct rigorous reasonably or eagers interview interviews,

313
00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.310
Amanda,
everyone that has worked with everyone,

314
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:18.680
the large number of the people of the professional,

315
00:24:18.681 --> 00:24:20.540
they've worked with the partners candidate,

316
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:26.800
be them more senior peers or more junior to try to gauge the quality of that

317
00:24:30.081 --> 00:24:30.914
individual.

318
00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:36.040
And even more the quality of that individual visa vi the girl that is being

319
00:24:39.171 --> 00:24:44.171
considered as part of this is a process that it sounds easy,

320
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:47.420
but he's opposed says that takes about two months.

321
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.010
And if I remember our conversation correctly,

322
00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:56.120
the from insists on people making pairwise comparison,

323
00:24:56.150 --> 00:25:01.150
the firm in cs people make doing a qualitative analysis and after making a

324
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:06.110
ranking of everybody they know first,
second,
third,

325
00:25:06.111 --> 00:25:11.111
fourth and fifth and in certain cases making pairwise when there are two

326
00:25:11.691 --> 00:25:16.250
candidates that are in your similar position making pairwise comparison,

327
00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.480
which is uh,
which is a nice,

328
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:26.030
which is an old way to do leadership selection because my understanding but it

329
00:25:26.031 --> 00:25:27.100
might end up,
it's,

330
00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:32.140
it's an understand ease that it was reasonably well used in the

331
00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:37.010
Catholic church,
uh,

332
00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:42.040
orders or in the well 11 century.

333
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:47.960
Right.
Actually there is someone that propose that in electing the pope,

334
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.930
the pope had to be elected doing pair.

335
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:55.840
Where pairwise comparison of the candidates,
well,

336
00:25:56.330 --> 00:26:00.830
the Roman Catholic church is one of the few organizations with a more

337
00:26:00.831 --> 00:26:05.090
distinguished administrative history that Goldman Sachs,
oh yeah.
I don't know.

338
00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:06.950
I don't know one of the few,
but definitely.

339
00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:11.600
So I think that Goldman consciously or unconsciously a copying some of the,

340
00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:16.700
some of the,
at least some of the criteria used by the Catholic church.

341
00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:18.110
As you listen to this,

342
00:26:18.111 --> 00:26:23.111
think about what this process would do to your thinking if you were a junior

343
00:26:24.651 --> 00:26:27.080
person at Goldman Sachs,
right?

344
00:26:27.081 --> 00:26:32.081
This is all designed to shape and mold a certain kind of purse of persona and

345
00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:41.250
management style.
Now what Mba mentioned behavior,

346
00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:45.690
pardon and and behavior in New York,
you know,
day your business.

347
00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:51.250
So you mentioned in our conversation this morning a,

348
00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.420
an element of the process called cross roughing.

349
00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:57.750
These Zicasso happening is the one that Jason Fire in the room

350
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:04.210
cross roughing.
Is it a bridge term?
I tried to find out about his six system.

351
00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.770
We just noise.
They're not one bridge player in this room.

352
00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:16.520
That's an interesting fact.
I think it,
lots of poker player here.
Um,

353
00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:22.010
so what's cross roughing in this process is,
this is a process of uh,

354
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:27.200
a group of people selected to search about deploy.

355
00:27:27.691 --> 00:27:30.670
He's the one that I've just described that search about the qualities of the

356
00:27:30.671 --> 00:27:35.140
barriers of the candidates,
but the itch from the,

357
00:27:35.141 --> 00:27:38.410
they're not in,
they're not getting the same image in their division,

358
00:27:38.411 --> 00:27:42.240
but not in the same division.
They belong to another TV or where's he,

359
00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.510
what are you looking at an organization you have to think about about the

360
00:27:46.511 --> 00:27:49.090
organization.
I get to see a graphical,
sorry,

361
00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:52.240
who apps that you have to think about the organization and to the main show.

362
00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:56.740
Okay.
Vertical in Arizona,
if you take the divisions,

363
00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:57.720
they are like the business.

364
00:27:57.721 --> 00:28:02.350
The only thing you are a normal industrial organization and they caught

365
00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:06.860
vertical.
If you take the partnership it Cathy Organization or its own.

366
00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:12.250
So if you want to have a very effective organization you should have,

367
00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:15.820
you should have a good blend.
And the two mics,

368
00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:21.490
all horizontal,
horizontal cleavage is let's say,

369
00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.630
and vertical ones.

370
00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:28.020
So the way the selection to the partnership is done because of course you cannot

371
00:28:28.031 --> 00:28:32.650
have a Google people that had 500 candy want a candy that you do it by division.

372
00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:36.160
The first selection is done by division.
When you,

373
00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:41.550
when you do the least the least are done by the division or afterward seems that

374
00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:46.680
you can set and the people that will do the selection and not the gatekeeper

375
00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:51.790
twin horizontal cleavage and in horizontal organization they got not those that,

376
00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:56.650
that gates are not capped by people from the same division but they are capped

377
00:28:56.651 --> 00:28:59.860
by people from another division because you are moved to a totally,

378
00:28:59.861 --> 00:29:02.010
because you had moved to Arizona Organization.

379
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:06.950
Does that shoe coordinate the top of the values of vertical division?

380
00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:12.230
So this is a way in part of checking the tendency of divisions to become yeah,

381
00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:16.480
becoming silos.
Silos.

382
00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:22.290
I heard last week a great expression for this for a frog at the bottom of the,

383
00:29:22.841 --> 00:29:25.150
well the sky is very small

384
00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.170
and that's certainly true in many organizations,
right?

385
00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:35.280
Where people get into their little part and they're not seeing what other people

386
00:29:35.321 --> 00:29:36.930
are seeing across other divisions.

387
00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:41.940
Now Tony and having gone so fair amount fracture in my professional life,

388
00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:46.780
both in an industrial organization,

389
00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.330
in a partnership and a in uh,
any,

390
00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:53.110
any investment bank that was a limited liability company.

391
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:55.930
When you get to a structure,

392
00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:01.920
it is very difficult to me

393
00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:08.480
to make a rational decision if the organization is mostly based on vertical

394
00:30:10.061 --> 00:30:12.550
division because

395
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:19.350
it was the vertical logic limits to some extent,

396
00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.780
not to some extent limits to a major extent

397
00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:28.990
the horizontal movement of individuals.
Right.

398
00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:34.410
And so you tend to consider them only on the vertical scale and went on the

399
00:30:35.471 --> 00:30:35.861
contract.

400
00:30:35.861 --> 00:30:39.940
You are trying to restructure the organization or Change Organization or reduce

401
00:30:39.941 --> 00:30:43.110
the number or develop new business units.

402
00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.860
You have to be able to cut across the vertical division because if not,

403
00:30:47.861 --> 00:30:52.420
you're utilize your manpower badly and your give your people a limited set of

404
00:30:52.421 --> 00:30:52.900
choice.

405
00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:57.740
They can only move either up or down but not sideways or they move side was

406
00:30:57.741 --> 00:31:01.060
becoming very diff and leave.
They move sideways becomes very difficult,

407
00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:06.330
very difficult for the organization to follow new business opportunities because

408
00:31:07.001 --> 00:31:07.834
those,

409
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:12.870
those tend to be latter is the increase in scope is not increasing depth.

410
00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:17.350
The um,
sorry.
We tend to be,

411
00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:21.890
we tend to become too abstract.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
The,
uh,

412
00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:28.440
what are the qualities that are most important to cultivate students'?

413
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:34.990
You've seen the 14 commandments in the case,
the business plans,

414
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:40.590
business principles stream from inside commandments seen from outside.

415
00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:44.590
Um,
what,
what,
what,

416
00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:46.470
what are we trying to achieve here in the,

417
00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:50.320
the behavior of the partnership

418
00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:54.220
and those who inspired to beat in the partnership.

419
00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:58.780
What would be the top two or three qualities we're aiming for?

420
00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:03.533
<v 1>Perfect.</v>

421
00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:11.050
<v 2>Eh,
are you using on a vote of the gooey?
Oh,</v>

422
00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:12.840
well the me and independence,

423
00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:18.330
but without getting too,

424
00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:20.783
<v 1>uh,</v>

425
00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:22.510
<v 2>independent,</v>

426
00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:26.050
without pushing the independent to some extreme that he getting disruptive

427
00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:31.570
for the organization.
So if you want,

428
00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:33.123
you would try to,

429
00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:38.260
you try to strike a balance between independence,

430
00:32:38.291 --> 00:32:42.080
creativity and conformity.
And historically,

431
00:32:42.081 --> 00:32:43.670
I seen Goldman has

432
00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:49.210
a premium to some extent on conformity versus creativity.

433
00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:53.180
I think that there are a fair amount that are fair amount of,
uh,
uh,

434
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:58.210
of innovations in which Goldman has come second or third and other firms have

435
00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:03.650
had,
have been a lot more creative or somewhat more creative.

436
00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:08.810
So you try to strike that balance.
Uh,

437
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:13.970
and of course,
one of the characteristic of their balances,

438
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:15.643
the idea,

439
00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:20.650
the idea and s to a very reasonably strict belief system or corporate culture.

440
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.810
How about chest thumping and the conspicuous display of wealth?

441
00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:32.120
Chest stamping definitely is,
uh,
is out out.

442
00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:34.430
You want to be a con speakers,
display of wells.

443
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:38.480
I would say consider the standard of the industry is not too bad,

444
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:41.480
but consider the standard of the industry.
If you look at it from,

445
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:45.280
if you look at it from a,
from the out from outside the industry,

446
00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:48.710
it's hard to judge,
but a c need from the out season,

447
00:33:48.711 --> 00:33:52.420
the from the inside at least it's frowned upon.
It's a,

448
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:57.430
it's not considered a actually sanctioned for sound cause Alex and decides that.

449
00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.240
And it can actually,
if I'm not mistaken,

450
00:34:02.241 --> 00:34:07.241
damage a Goldman career if you are sort of wildly ostentatious,

451
00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:13.050
uh,
and pick up $10,000 restaurant taps and that sort of thing.
Yeah,

452
00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:18.110
usually,
usually you usually don't do it twice.
Um,

453
00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:24.040
so Goldman,
he's the APP,
let me think about for a moment,
uh,

454
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:29.060
about another character
within the limits,

455
00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:33.630
within the limits of the idea.

456
00:34:33.631 --> 00:34:38.600
And to a straight belief system and I know that two things seems seems a

457
00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:39.530
contradiction.

458
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:44.810
It also pushes you to be entrepreneurial

459
00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:49.590
because
the facto

460
00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:56.270
partners around their own business unit

461
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.950
and
the levels of hierarchy

462
00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:09.890
are very,
very,
very short.
Your organization is very flat

463
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:17.170
and one of the reasons why he's flat is in try to four tie to foster

464
00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:19.880
interpreneur ship,

465
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:25.640
especially in the partners because see the business and we'd go and an AU pair

466
00:35:25.641 --> 00:35:29.990
aid the industry in which Goldman.
Okay.
All right.
And you will see it.

467
00:35:29.991 --> 00:35:34.520
I try to give some examples in the printout that you have changes very,

468
00:35:34.521 --> 00:35:38.880
very quickly.
So for instance,
if you,
if you take a picture,

469
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:43.620
we don't,
we don't give those details for many,
many reasons.

470
00:35:43.621 --> 00:35:45.380
One of which is as they change too often,

471
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:51.390
if you take the 36 they say 36 to 30 major business line of Goldman five years

472
00:35:51.391 --> 00:35:54.660
ago,
they are not the same and what they are today.

473
00:35:55.710 --> 00:36:00.710
So because the environment changes so fast that if you are,

474
00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:04.530
if you steal,

475
00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:09.590
tried to operate and maximize or be efficient in the business,

476
00:36:10.471 --> 00:36:12.900
you own it.
Of yesterday or this morning.

477
00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:16.950
Mostly you are.
So if you have a good manager,

478
00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:21.720
maybe you are a better entrepreneur and you are missing new opportunities that

479
00:36:21.721 --> 00:36:24.720
the changes in the environment creates.

480
00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:29.060
So what the firm is trying to do is to have eh,

481
00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:34.130
to have a global leaders that more or less think along similar lines are that

482
00:36:34.291 --> 00:36:39.291
are able to capture new opportunities and you a new business line,

483
00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.330
a steak.
Let's for instance,
I started to make some examples,
not we,
uh,

484
00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:48.720
we are under of being tortured to uh,
who abstract.

485
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:53.400
Let's take for instance,
I'm sure that uh,
some of you,

486
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:58.670
most of you are familiar with the crisis of the savings and loan association in

487
00:36:59.101 --> 00:37:04.080
the U or the end of the 1980s.
Before that crisis,

488
00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:10.430
Goldman Sachs,
they have never done a real estate principal investment,

489
00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.940
never didn't even own the building where they work

490
00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:20.700
because
they thought that there was no

491
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:27.010
capabilities inside the firm or making investment.

492
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:32.040
Actually when the,
uh,

493
00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.620
what was the national trust or whatever,
what was,

494
00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:39.900
what was the trust that the federal garden GC,
yeah,
when they started,

495
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:43.820
when the ITC or at least the national straddle,
the federal,
uh,

496
00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:48.060
federal owner of all the real estate property,
because if you're a member,

497
00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:53.320
most of the most of the crisis or originated from the loans that the,

498
00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:55.450
that the saving and loan association I've done,

499
00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.030
especially with real estate development.

500
00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.870
So of course they're the federal,

501
00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:04.320
the federal authority that a federal authority that uh,

502
00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:09.330
that ran that Randall that ran that a there,
sorry,
the men,

503
00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:12.530
they've the bureaucrats in good sense.
I planned that,
I'll throw it.

504
00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:16.800
He started selling a lot of idealistic,
cheap all over,

505
00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:17.820
all over the United States.

506
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:23.580
And it was obvious that there was a business opportunity there,

507
00:38:23.581 --> 00:38:28.290
but it was also obvious that Goldman didn't know anything how to do it because I

508
00:38:28.291 --> 00:38:31.470
mean,
Ipos,
a raid,
defense,

509
00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:35.950
trading of stock of loans,
yes.

510
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:41.010
But never real estate and exceedingly smart person who by the way happens to be

511
00:38:42.701 --> 00:38:46.360
a Yale Grad of course,
all of the opportunity.

512
00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:52.110
So the lack of capability and decided to form a partnership with someone that

513
00:38:52.391 --> 00:38:55.090
knew a lot about real estate all over the United States and didn't have any

514
00:38:55.091 --> 00:38:55.924
capital.

515
00:38:56.230 --> 00:39:01.230
And Goldman starting buying real estate and real estate loans or themselves for,

516
00:39:04.511 --> 00:39:08.760
for ourselves and for investors.
And uh,
the,

517
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:12.640
the massive investment,

518
00:39:12.641 --> 00:39:15.760
a history of going money in real estate,

519
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:21.130
both real estate assets and real estate loans started them just because of the

520
00:39:21.131 --> 00:39:21.970
opportunity,

521
00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:26.680
because of the opportunity offered by these trust corporation that we're selling

522
00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:31.720
a loud amount of real estate,
obviously very cheap in the end.
Uh,

523
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:35.410
the ability of one of the partners to see that there was an opportunity,

524
00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:37.690
but the doing side inside the firm,

525
00:39:37.691 --> 00:39:42.640
there was no capability and understanding which one was cheap and which one was

526
00:39:42.641 --> 00:39:43.474
not cheap.

527
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:47.170
It seems to buy me these two are too expensive or what he would have been a bad

528
00:39:47.171 --> 00:39:51.300
investment anyway.
And at the end of the partner that we had,
uh,

529
00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.810
got tired,
made too much money and uh,

530
00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:59.880
but he had transferred enough knowledge to the partners and we bought it out and

531
00:40:00.761 --> 00:40:04.990
made a,
it made whiter.
The same is to,
is our huge private equity.

532
00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:09.430
We,
when Dave joined the firm,
we didn't do much of private equity.

533
00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:12.430
We did it on behalf of client.

534
00:40:12.431 --> 00:40:14.500
We're advising them when they are buying or selling campus,

535
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:19.150
but we didn't do it on our own and the on the counter immediately after the

536
00:40:19.151 --> 00:40:23.830
crisis of the 2000,
the Dr Khan crisis,

537
00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:30.300
we started seeing an opportunity and starting seeing an opportunity that you are

538
00:40:31.441 --> 00:40:34.840
going to make a lot more money if you need it on your own.
Then if you're,

539
00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:37.630
if you advise Blackstone,
a lot of,

540
00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:41.930
a lot of banks saw it aware.
These are very interesting.
I,

541
00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:42.900
we've were,

542
00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:47.900
I've forgotten a lot of bank saw it but they decided not to do it for one very

543
00:40:49.661 --> 00:40:54.470
basic and valid reason.
The fact that if you do private equity,

544
00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:01.200
you start competing with your clients and that is supposed to be the scene

545
00:41:02.411 --> 00:41:07.180
number one in a service organization.
However,

546
00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.193
the

547
00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:14.310
Uber's of Goldman was such that Goldman believed that they were smart enough and

548
00:41:15.881 --> 00:41:18.640
good enough to be able to manage the country.

549
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:22.270
So it was a conscious decision.
There was a debate.

550
00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:25.000
I remember it because I was part of the debate.

551
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:28.540
I was not fat and fortunately we have the debate of going public,

552
00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:33.800
but I was part of,
it was on the outside actually.
I was so at the we joke.

553
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.730
Yeah,
I was actually cheated because I thought I was going to be in the next

554
00:41:37.731 --> 00:41:42.530
partnership and so the partnership was going public in [inaudible] 99 and I was

555
00:41:42.531 --> 00:41:47.531
up for election in 2000 the big prize was for or smash through a limited.

556
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:52.370
So Ashley was good price as we are.
Yeah,
you are very good.

557
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:57.680
But I was part of the PAG that Tegrity one.

558
00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:03.460
Can I get you to talk for a minute about how Goldman manages his relationship

559
00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:08.860
with power in government and other other branches of society?

560
00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:17.100
Not just in the stage were a one
is the,
and you have these caps days.

561
00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:22.110
I think that investment banking is a business where culture is very important

562
00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:28.323
and

563
00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:34.210
all of you that uh,
that are going to be on Wednesday.

564
00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:37.970
We'll see that when I speak about,
when I speak about,
uh,

565
00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:40.210
email and days a takeover,

566
00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:43.360
the financial variables are important.

567
00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:47.560
But I will say the variables that determined the winning or losing sometime a

568
00:42:47.561 --> 00:42:52.561
what we call soft soft variables that have little to do with pies and finance.

569
00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:58.210
And for a global firm that operates in this business,

570
00:42:58.460 --> 00:42:59.980
it is very,

571
00:42:59.981 --> 00:43:04.981
very difficult if not impossible to be able to understand the complexities of

572
00:43:06.281 --> 00:43:08.200
the business culture in which it operates.

573
00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:13.830
So your best way,
your best way to,
uh,

574
00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:18.900
to understand those complexities and to avoid the land mines that are in

575
00:43:20.651 --> 00:43:25.510
different business culture is to get someone that knows that business culture of

576
00:43:25.511 --> 00:43:27.310
that particular culture very well.

577
00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:32.890
So you end up selecting the globe advisor in any nation in which you operate,

578
00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:38.760
that have a very deep understanding of that particular business culture and can

579
00:43:39.971 --> 00:43:44.590
guide you and your client.
So that,
uh,

580
00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:48.330
so that,
uh,
so that particular,
so that particular card,

581
00:43:48.331 --> 00:43:51.320
I want to give you an example that he's so if not we have to abstain.

582
00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:54.350
I want to give you an example that it's a,

583
00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.560
actually it's personnel to some extent.

584
00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:00.820
Goldman was very late compared to the other firm in moving overseas

585
00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:07.530
and a Goldman started having a small operation in London in [inaudible] 87 when

586
00:44:07.841 --> 00:44:12.600
JP Morgan was big,
when Lehman was big,
when Mary was big,

587
00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:14.530
married,
no married,
started a little later.

588
00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:19.530
But definitely when Morgan Stanley was big and at one point that the problem

589
00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:22.060
that uh,
uh,

590
00:44:22.061 --> 00:44:26.110
that goal that the Goldman people send overseas phase was

591
00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:28.990
how do we get

592
00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:35.840
how we enlarge in New York without making too many states.

593
00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:42.270
The usual traditional where you've American firms to do that was to send

594
00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:49.370
investment bankers from the U S and waited until they learn the various culture.

595
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:56.130
Very smart banker at Goldman who,
by the way,

596
00:44:56.131 --> 00:44:59.410
he's one of the first graduate of these SOM Johnson.

597
00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:04.170
When he had the responsibility of Europe.
He said,
the reason why I know it,

598
00:45:04.171 --> 00:45:06.960
and I say it's personal because that the way in which I go to her coat it,

599
00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:10.680
he said,
wait a second here we have to do something totally different.

600
00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:15.880
We have to select for every nation where we operate.

601
00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:19.380
Someone that maybe is not a banker,
who cares,

602
00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:23.850
but that knows that business culture very well.

603
00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:28.830
And so we had a generation of lateral hires,
me,

604
00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:34.350
my colleague in France,
one in Spain,
one in Germany,

605
00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:38.880
one in England,
one in Ireland,
one in Sweden.

606
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:43.620
None of them came from investment banking.
Very few of them came from banking.

607
00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.960
My French colleague came from the state

608
00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:52.470
and when I,
when I did my interview with John Zorn phone for a set of selection,

609
00:45:52.471 --> 00:45:56.280
I said,
he said,
what would you say?
What did I do do?
I said,

610
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:59.220
how can I think about going in investment banking?
I can't even count.

611
00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:04.650
I can't count now.
I can't balance a checkbook is a tool to say,
oh,
we can.

612
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:05.760
He said,
don't worry.

613
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:10.230
We have hundreds of people that can do that and we will give you a smart VP that

614
00:46:10.231 --> 00:46:11.940
knows everything about investment bank,

615
00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:16.640
but can you operate in the Italian business environment?
I say,
I said,
yes,

616
00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:21.290
I think so.
Uh,
do you,
and we want to have 20 clients no more.

617
00:46:21.291 --> 00:46:26.220
I need to have the 15 colors.
You can always clients we want and which we don't.

618
00:46:26.221 --> 00:46:29.370
And I say,
I think so.
And he said,
do you know the way the client,

619
00:46:29.371 --> 00:46:32.160
we want to pair eight inside as I think so.
It's okay.

620
00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:34.230
Who cares if you can't balance a checkbook?

621
00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.750
That Goldman became the first,

622
00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:45.530
the first investment bank in Europe on 94th and 97 three years when in 90 in 90

623
00:46:50.911 --> 00:46:54.630
sleep eat as well below everybody else.

624
00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:59.610
And it is due to that particular career TBT of John [inaudible] who saw it

625
00:46:59.611 --> 00:47:01.590
clearly has at least these are cultural business.

626
00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:03.990
How can I send an American or a,
you need them.

627
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:08.640
They don't even speak the language now or in France.
They,
they,
I mean,

628
00:47:08.641 --> 00:47:10.800
how can you go?
Have you ever tried?

629
00:47:10.801 --> 00:47:14.070
We deal in France or in Spain.

630
00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:17.300
Even for someone that has had some sort of,
uh,

631
00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:21.770
exposure to different business culture lies like myself.
Ah,

632
00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:26.100
I will never be able to do it like someone else would like to try to do and to

633
00:47:26.101 --> 00:47:26.934
do it in Eaton.

634
00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:32.150
Tried to understand how fear works while Anal sinks or out [inaudible] so when

635
00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:39.190
in the,
in the context of the state,

636
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:41.550
<v 0>uh,
you said a</v>

637
00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:47.640
beaten up Dartmouth linebacker.
Yeah.

638
00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:52.520
<v 2>Washington.
No hand cores locked down their story about hankies.</v>

639
00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:59.290
He has always been a republican.
Okay.
You want to,

640
00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:04.300
you want to give you a little limitation of his voice style photo?

641
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:10.640
No,
he's a boy.
Boy's style was there even station,

642
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:14.410
oh no.
Going good to be his nurse

643
00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:22.610
at three o'clock in the morning.
So,
you know,
Hank has always been,
there,

644
00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:27.190
has always been very public.
He,
if you talk to him,

645
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:32.790
he ascribed these success at Goldman with the fact that he didn't know what to

646
00:48:32.981 --> 00:48:36.310
do when he got out of the Harvard business school and he went to work for the

647
00:48:36.311 --> 00:48:41.311
Nixon White House in the domestic affairs division.

648
00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:44.470
And he finds himself at 24,

649
00:48:44.471 --> 00:48:48.130
25 immediately afterward of gay.

650
00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:52.330
And everybody above him is either in jail or a head toward resigned.

651
00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:56.950
So he becomes the most senior person in that,
uh,
the more senior person in that,

652
00:48:57.010 --> 00:49:00.670
uh,
in that department.
And he has to deal with the CEO.

653
00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:03.640
He has to deal for a year and a half with,
uh,

654
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:08.670
with the CEOs of large corporation and a in Elan's.

655
00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:13.450
And at the end he decided he doesn't like the government and uh,

656
00:49:13.451 --> 00:49:15.850
he tries to get a job at Goldman and he gets fired.

657
00:49:15.851 --> 00:49:18.040
And what he was always standing,
we'll say,
see,

658
00:49:18.041 --> 00:49:21.310
the real skill that I had was not what they taught me at the Harvard business

659
00:49:21.311 --> 00:49:21.641
school,

660
00:49:21.641 --> 00:49:26.230
but the fact that I spent a year and a house in interacting with CEO and CFOs

661
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:29.800
from the largest corporation because I was at the White House and there was

662
00:49:29.890 --> 00:49:34.870
nobody who was more senior than me.
Okay.
No,
he wasn't he.
And so he had been

663
00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:37.573
<v 1>Bush.</v>

664
00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:43.840
<v 2>All right,
we'll get him to be the secretary of the Treasury,
my knowledge,</v>

665
00:49:43.841 --> 00:49:46.950
which is limited at least why before you accept.
Yeah.

666
00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:51.470
And at one point he decided that,
uh,
it was tying to let a blank find,

667
00:49:51.471 --> 00:49:56.170
do the chairman.
That was a perfect agency.
Okay.
Last question for today.

668
00:49:58.860 --> 00:49:58.981
<v 0>Oh,</v>

669
00:49:58.981 --> 00:50:03.981
simple observation would be that Goldman has essentially better,

670
00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:11.150
better life on the quality of people.
Josh,

671
00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:16.800
meaning all the things you're talking about plus something to do with just sheer

672
00:50:16.801 --> 00:50:19.530
mental horsepower.
Smart people.

673
00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:25.520
<v 2>Oh,
he is a proud dad.
There is a reasonable amount of smart,
uh,</v>

674
00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:27.950
wait.
Don't overstay Paul though.

675
00:50:27.951 --> 00:50:30.020
He's a reasonable amount of smart people by going to,

676
00:50:30.021 --> 00:50:32.900
do you know what the characteristic,
you know what I mean?

677
00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:35.830
Everybody who goes to an ivy league school with know it,

678
00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:39.330
determination,

679
00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:44.450
it's almost losing four then there's brainpower and definitely Goldman

680
00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:51.080
definitely you will not
get a chance.

681
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:55.570
They'll even it becoming a VP north,
a partner if you are no determined.

682
00:50:56.630 --> 00:51:01.630
The associate and the analyst working a hundred hour per week for years,

683
00:51:01.731 --> 00:51:04.250
for five years,
seven years,
10 years.

684
00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:08.150
The partner's work 70 or 80 hours per week until they write that.

685
00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:12.840
Unless you are ready to do that.
No Way.

686
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:17.720
And if the phone rings the phone,
I told you a Hank,
Hank was,
he used to,

687
00:51:17.721 --> 00:51:18.620
when he was a chairman,

688
00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:23.000
Hank was used to listen to voicemail because now we communicate via email.

689
00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:28.190
Then we communicate only via voicemail
in a firm that was,

690
00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:31.310
that had uh,
what,
25 billion in revenues.

691
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:36.740
You could leave a voicemail for Hank Paulson and unless he was on a plane,

692
00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:41.510
you've got an answer in less than five hours.
And if he was on a plane,

693
00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:44.750
it depends how long the flight was.
15 hours.

694
00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:48.290
You've got your answer after 59 terrific.

695
00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:52.730
So please review the slides for Wednesday,
and let's think,

696
00:51:52.731 --> 00:51:53.564
Carlo for this

697
00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:53.980
<v 1>very.</v>
