1
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.770
Okay,
let's go to work.
Um,

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.960
violating the syllabus.

3
00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:11.280
I've retitled today's discussion from Marxists to stores.

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.250
Historicism to Howard heads tennis racket.

5
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:19.230
And let's begin with Howard heads tennis racket.
Howard head was a,

6
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.930
um,
an alum of Harvard College,
uh,

7
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.430
a bright guy

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.070
and a not very good,
uh,

9
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.840
airframe engineer.

10
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.260
He was a second class designer of the details of airplanes for Mcdonnell Douglas

11
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.293
Corporation.

12
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.750
And he was an avid skier and an avid,

13
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:51.060
but very untalented tennis player.

14
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.580
And as he tells the story,
there was a night on a bus,

15
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.560
a motor coach,
to use his words,
uh,
bringing him,
uh,

16
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.600
back to New York from Vermont,
from Stowe.

17
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.020
And he'd had a rough weekend of skiing.

18
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.720
And he said,

19
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.750
what would happen if we took the aluminum wafer with which we're building

20
00:01:19.231 --> 00:01:22.020
airplanes and made a ski from it.

21
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.740
And sure enough,
he did that.
And the skiing industry,
not just the sale of skis,

22
00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:33.741
but the total size of the skiing market was transformed forever because skiing

23
00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:39.210
now became more fun and vastly easier.
Uh,

24
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.650
five years later,
uh,
he had the same,

25
00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:48.651
he applied the same thought process to tennis rackets at the time the world

26
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:53.730
market in tennis rackets had converged on the Bancroft,

27
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.290
uh,
wooden racket,

28
00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.750
a name for Jack Kramer who died in his own bed is in the times this morning.

29
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.463
Uh,

30
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.380
and everybody was competing on price and details of quality with the wooden

31
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:11.640
racket.
And there were no rules about how big a racket could be.

32
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.260
And it occurred to head that if he substituted in the bow of the racket,

33
00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:21.330
substituted aluminum for wood,

34
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.100
the structural properties of aluminum would allow the head of the racket to be

35
00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:28.370
much bigger.
Uh,

36
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.500
do any of you play with giant tennis rackets?

37
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.900
I know it's a point of pride among really good players not to do that.
Mine I,

38
00:02:37.901 --> 00:02:39.940
I retired from tennis three or four years ago,
but my,

39
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.080
at my retirement was about like that and it makes Tennessee's and it created a

40
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:52.440
mass market and it redefined the whole business.

41
00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:54.870
Now the idea of creative destruction,

42
00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.520
which is usually about things more complicated than skiing and tennis.
Uh,

43
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.580
the whole idea of creative destruction is that the process of competing to sell

44
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.560
the best product at the lowest price within the given market framework often

45
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:19.621
does it indeed lead to something like monopoly or at least oligopoly and uh,

46
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.660
a point made at length by Marxists,
critics of capitalism.

47
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.910
But as the,
as that happens,

48
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.780
it,
it occurs over and over and over again.

49
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.840
That's somebody like Howard head finds an alternative technology in variably

50
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.700
aimed not at luxury markets aimed at regular people and very seldom aimed at a

51
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.010
corporate or governmental buyers,

52
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.520
but again at private sector buyers and generates with that product an entirely

53
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:05.230
new market,
shatters the equilibrium,
hits it with a hammer.

54
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.880
And this thought is on the one hand antagonistic to marks that is,

55
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.920
it is a way of refuting Marx's idea about monopoly capitalism.

56
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:19.870
On the other hand,

57
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.250
it is exactly in the spirit of young marks,

58
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.940
the young Marx we hear in the communist manifesto,

59
00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:29.950
red for today's assignment,

60
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.030
who saw capitalism as an enormously productive system,

61
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.900
which was incapable of standing still,

62
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.140
which was always leaning forward into the wind,

63
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.910
which was do you Schumpeter's term?

64
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.950
Nothing more than a mechanism for economic change.

65
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.810
According to Schumpeter.

66
00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.840
The very essence of capitalism is that an s is a system always in the process of

67
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:08.410
revising itself.
It is never capable of standing still.

68
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.460
And Young Marx certainly believed just about that same thing and believed that

69
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.220
the productive forces,

70
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.270
I'm remember he's writing in 1847 1848 that the productive forces associated

71
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:28.030
with capitalism were unprecedented in world history.

72
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.390
And May I call on one of your classmates to read the pivotal paragraph from that

73
00:05:35.321 --> 00:05:36.154
work?

74
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:40.563
<v 1>Uh</v>

75
00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.283
Huh.

76
00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.190
Every last damn certainty in education.

77
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.430
The same support from all over your room.

78
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:13.140
All frozen relationships with that train of ancient is mineral questions are

79
00:06:13.731 --> 00:06:18.731
sort of the way our new from the ones that come antiquated when you put them all

80
00:06:18.751 --> 00:06:21.410
of the solid and all that is holy.

81
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.520
It's propane and man it did last compelled to face and some are sentence.

82
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.460
The real conditions of life and his relationship is kind of,

83
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.200
<v 0>thank you very much.
Okay.
So Mark's is,</v>

84
00:06:34.201 --> 00:06:36.370
they're talking about the,

85
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.050
at the time he's writing a railroads are just beginning to transform the

86
00:06:42.331 --> 00:06:43.710
European world around him.

87
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.160
Steam ships are a generation and a half into transforming world commerce.

88
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:55.070
The use of a newly efficient steam engines in manufacturing is creating ever

89
00:06:58.981 --> 00:06:59.880
cheaper goods.

90
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.360
The market in world tech styles has driven the price of ordinary cotton cloth,

91
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:08.310
uh,

92
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.310
nearly to zero so that nearly everyone in the market,

93
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:19.070
advanced market societies can afford to dress more or less the way all of you

94
00:07:20.011 --> 00:07:24.980
are dressed.
Uh,
that is to say,
well,

95
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.670
whatever,
look around.
Uh,

96
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.950
but the point is that the,

97
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:36.650
the revolutionary transformation of the means of production and of what is

98
00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:41.880
produced and at what cost itself is very much on marks as mine.

99
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:43.440
Additionally,

100
00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:48.590
Europe is politically unstable in the 1840s and there are five or six nodes of

101
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.900
apparent revolutionary activity stretching from,
uh,

102
00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.300
Austria through Germany into czarist,
Russia.

103
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:05.990
And Mark's imagines that his relatively abstract analysis of capitalism is

104
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.390
scientific.
And by scientific,

105
00:08:15.391 --> 00:08:18.180
he means that it has predictive force,

106
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:23.930
that his science of economy and society is so powerful that it allows him to

107
00:08:27.121 --> 00:08:28.320
foresee the future.

108
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:33.240
Not to foresee the exact dates and details of future history,

109
00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:39.140
but that the broad outlines are beyond human control.

110
00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.690
So there are actually two assertions here.

111
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.960
One is that the world's history is determined that it is like the machinery of

112
00:08:50.011 --> 00:08:50.844
the heavens.

113
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:56.120
It is like the planets revolving around the a good astronomer can readily

114
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:04.050
predict the phases of the moon,
the occurrence of eclipses,
all those things,

115
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.520
and that science,

116
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:10.150
which was in the past by Marxists time and which he saw he,

117
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:14.820
he has aspired to that level of confidence.

118
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.140
And we're going to look at his historicism.

119
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:23.730
That is the double belief that the world is deterministic and that he and his

120
00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:28.731
associates can actually unlock the keys to the future under six headings,

121
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:35.130
the first of which is monopoly capitalism and will we will take that up

122
00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:39.720
momentarily.
Second is the proposition that in the long run,

123
00:09:39.721 --> 00:09:42.900
the rate of profit for capitalist enterprises has to fall,

124
00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:49.840
uh,
third,
the immiseration of the working class that as profits fall.

125
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.640
So does the wage stream available to the working class?

126
00:09:55.330 --> 00:10:00.330
So both the capitalists and they're adversaries in the proletariat face,

127
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.790
a squeezing vice,

128
00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:09.210
which takes their discretionary power out of the system,
uh,

129
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:14.080
as the vice squeezes revolution becomes inevitable.

130
00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:18.360
That's the fourth point on the,
or the third point on the chart.
Uh,

131
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:22.300
the fourth point is Mark's is

132
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:28.800
I'm a great respecter of Marx's Brennan's,
uh,
but the,
the,

133
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.840
the theory of the universal class is almost childlike.

134
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.800
And the idea is that if you search out the bottom of the bottom of the bottom

135
00:10:39.251 --> 00:10:40.084
classes,

136
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.730
then that class will have the unique property that it has no one else to
exploit.

137
00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:52.060
And if it has no one else to exploit,
then there won't be exploitation.

138
00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:57.450
And since the purpose of the state is to defend the interest of an exploiting

139
00:10:57.971 --> 00:10:58.804
class,

140
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:04.360
then the state will become unnecessary and will as the bottom line says here,

141
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.010
wither away.
Now

142
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:11.110
<v 2>the the many decades</v>

143
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.181
<v 0>of experience,</v>

144
00:11:13.181 --> 00:11:18.181
we have lead us to be a friendly critics toward the top of this story and

145
00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:26.580
unfriendly critics toward the bottom because the story told that the bottom is

146
00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:31.750
not only a false,
uh,
but dangerous.

147
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.513
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

148
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:40.150
<v 0>Okay.
Monopoly capitalism.
You'll remember that I,</v>

149
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:45.120
when I was sitting with Jim Alexander last class,
uh,

150
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:50.430
talking about Adam Smith and the conditions under which the invisible hand

151
00:11:50.771 --> 00:11:52.000
remains invisible.

152
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.150
I used the porter forces commonly used in Mba,
uh,

153
00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.680
instruction,
uh,

154
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:03.970
to define the opposite of each of the conditions,
uh,

155
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:05.770
put forward by Smith.

156
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:11.730
And so I'm using them again here and in a monopoly capitalist situation,

157
00:12:13.391 --> 00:12:16.500
the monopolistic from,
uh,

158
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:21.250
has eliminated direct competition or rendered it trivial.
Uh,

159
00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:22.210
it has,

160
00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:28.140
it has caused the erection of high barriers to entry so that as its profits

161
00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:34.060
increase and other say,
what a good idea.
Let's get into that business.

162
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:39.780
It has ways of keeping them out or once they come in of punishing them,

163
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.060
uh,
to the point of bankruptcy.

164
00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.500
A third,

165
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.850
these are products that are not discretionary.
They're hard to substitute for.

166
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:56.740
You can't have a serious monopoly in children's games.

167
00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:02.520
You can't have a serious monopoly in a given fragrance of aftershave lotion or

168
00:13:03.911 --> 00:13:07.130
of perfume.
Serious monopolies are in,

169
00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:12.270
are always in things which people need and for which they don't readily find

170
00:13:13.541 --> 00:13:17.950
substitutes.
Uh,
the firm is vertically integrated and,

171
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.260
uh,
by by vertical integration,
I mean,

172
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:27.010
think about starting,
well,
let's take,

173
00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:30.760
take the laptop in front of you.
Uh,

174
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:35.050
starting with the aluminum,
the silica

175
00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:41.150
metal wires,
all that stuff.
Starting with raw materials that are in the earth,

176
00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:46.250
extracting those,
designing them,
fabricating them,

177
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:48.980
marketing the machine,
distributing the machine.

178
00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:54.460
That whole long trail of production from raw materials at the one end to finish

179
00:13:55.191 --> 00:13:56.650
product in the hand of a Bot,

180
00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:01.280
hands of a buyer at the other vertical integration in the extreme means that the

181
00:14:01.281 --> 00:14:04.010
corporation controls that whole sweep.

182
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:09.800
The part that reaches from manufacturing towards the buyer is called forward

183
00:14:09.801 --> 00:14:13.820
integration.
The part that reaches from the manufacturer back to raw materials.

184
00:14:13.821 --> 00:14:15.260
It's called backward integration.

185
00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:20.800
But this pattern of integration gives the company great power because there are

186
00:14:22.131 --> 00:14:26.910
no suppliers who can hold up the firm for a part,

187
00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.220
a part of its profits.

188
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:33.280
Buyers don't have leverage to control prices.
Uh,

189
00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:38.270
competitors can't manufacture a very similar machine,

190
00:14:38.271 --> 00:14:43.271
20% cheaper and drive down profits and people in substitute industries don't

191
00:14:45.381 --> 00:14:48.620
have any way of drawing away customers.

192
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:53.840
So that's the,
I'm caricaturing,
uh,

193
00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:58.250
but things which more or less fit that description historically would be.

194
00:14:58.251 --> 00:15:02.600
For example,
standard oil,
John D Rockefeller who controlled,

195
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:08.020
who came into control of oil all the way from exploration and the wellhead,

196
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:15.200
uh,
through refining and distribution,

197
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:20.420
he came to control the railroads which his rivals would need to use to

198
00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:25.421
distribute their product and managed to use the railroads to impose a

199
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:33.850
artificially high freight prices on his competitors so that he was able in

200
00:15:35.271 --> 00:15:37.790
effect to monopolize the whole industry.

201
00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:43.920
The US steel.
A similar story.
This would,

202
00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:48.050
this,
this would be Andrew Carnegie,
a Microsoft.

203
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.340
There are there,
there has been a long debate about,

204
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:57.050
about antitrust for Microsoft and um,

205
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.170
it's pretty close to a monopoly.
It's,

206
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:08.480
I look around the room and I see little white apples illuminated everywhere.

207
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:14.320
And
I have one myself.
Um,

208
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:20.560
my eldest daughter is a partner level executive at Microsoft and in her house,

209
00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.080
our apple computers,
which I have given her family.

210
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:32.960
Um,
uh,
another kind,

211
00:16:32.961 --> 00:16:36.350
another story of the same instance is the regulated airlines,

212
00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.300
regulated airlines.
This is before the late seventies,

213
00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:42.860
when the airlines were deregulated,

214
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:48.790
would own a route and monopolize it and they would compete,

215
00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:54.140
uh,
not on the basis of price because they would charge monopoly prices.

216
00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:59.180
They would compete on the basis of food and attractive flight attendants.

217
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:03.680
And there are,
I'm not going near that,
uh,

218
00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:08.810
the big pharmaceuticals or Pharma's,
uh,
are,
uh,

219
00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:13.840
sometimes in monopolistic or near monopolistic positions about drugs and many

220
00:17:15.261 --> 00:17:16.094
other cases,

221
00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:21.130
though fewer than the ideological critics of capitalism would make you believe

222
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:26.950
and fewer partly because of creative destruction as monopolies.

223
00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.870
Ossify people find ways to blow them up.

224
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:37.130
Okay,
so let's try,
let's talk about that.

225
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.940
And on the left side of this little diagram,

226
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:45.270
we have ways to build a monopoly and on the right side,

227
00:17:45.271 --> 00:17:46.730
ways to burn a monopoly.

228
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:51.150
And on the vertical we have market forces

229
00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:56.670
and on the horizontal,
the top horizontal,
we have market forces,

230
00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.140
the bottom horizontal,

231
00:17:58.141 --> 00:18:03.141
we have governmental forces and let's just get ourselves familiar with the four

232
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:05.970
resulting cells,

233
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:12.530
scale and scope.
Um,

234
00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:17.620
mostly scale if there are returns to scale so that each widget gets cheaper to

235
00:18:20.961 --> 00:18:22.700
produce as you produce.
Many of them,

236
00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.220
the firm which is producing the largest,

237
00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:33.940
the largest quantities in enjoys and enormous strategic advantage

238
00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:41.980
illustrated here if number of widgets produced is on the horizontal dimension

239
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:47.800
and the marginal cost of the last widget is vertical being positioned where this

240
00:18:47.901 --> 00:18:52.901
little green company is positioned is an enormous advantage in comparison with a

241
00:18:54.831 --> 00:18:57.350
little orange firms at the left.
The,

242
00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:02.420
these are boutique firms doing very level and the giant producer,

243
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:08.060
which in the American economy for a very long time was general motors for

244
00:19:08.061 --> 00:19:10.640
example.
Uh,

245
00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:15.140
and it's a general motors and it's an immediate competitors in Ford and
Chrysler.

246
00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:20.030
But if you,
let's,
I'll illustrate the point in,

247
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:25.150
at the time of the decade before World War One,

248
00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:32.300
there were 1200 automobile manufacturing companies in the United States.

249
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:39.100
And almost all of them got winkled out by the end of the 1920s,

250
00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.050
who were about a dozen at the end of the twenties.

251
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:45.830
And we're now approaching what number are we going to end up with?

252
00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:52.550
Zero is one real possibility,
uh,
more likely,

253
00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:57.530
I think one,
one and a half,
two,
something like that.

254
00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:03.190
But the eat the scale economies in that kind of business are enormously

255
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:05.263
important.

256
00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:09.770
Creative destruction.

257
00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:15.880
And here we have Schumpeter again and one way of using Schumpeter is to take a

258
00:20:19.611 --> 00:20:22.460
very long view of dominant,
uh,

259
00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:27.520
technologies for energy and production and look at how they have shifted over

260
00:20:28.131 --> 00:20:31.790
time.
And in this chart,

261
00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:37.760
is that legible for any of you are not?
Not really.
Okay.

262
00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:41.600
Uh,
the,
um,

263
00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:45.980
the chart begins with production based on water,

264
00:20:45.981 --> 00:20:50.981
power on mills based on falling water.

265
00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:56.560
And it turns out historically these were very important.
The first great,
uh,

266
00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:01.950
a great advances in the manufacturer of textiles occurred in plants located

267
00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:08.910
along the fall line of rivers where it was possible to extract a great deal of

268
00:21:09.071 --> 00:21:13.090
energy from falling water and drive mass manufacturing.

269
00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:16.060
Uh,
then a sec,

270
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:21.120
then you have creative destruction with the emergence of steam and rail as

271
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:25.000
alternatives.
Uh,
then electricity,

272
00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.510
and I won't pause long,

273
00:21:28.511 --> 00:21:33.511
but the great battle of the 1890s was between alternating current electricity

274
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:40.090
controlled by George Westinghouse and direct current electricity,
uh,

275
00:21:40.091 --> 00:21:41.620
controlled by Thomas Edison.

276
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:47.190
Both of them as corporate leaders and a Yale didn't fully give up on direct

277
00:21:49.271 --> 00:21:50.820
current,
uh,

278
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:54.790
technology until about 1985.

279
00:21:56.050 --> 00:22:00.670
Uh,
there were dorm rooms where the lights were actually run on direct current

280
00:22:00.671 --> 00:22:04.480
generated in a plant over near where the swing dorms are now.

281
00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.193
<v 2>MMM.</v>

282
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.270
<v 0>I'll leave it to sections for you to Parse this out.</v>

283
00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:12.040
It's actually a very interesting story.

284
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:17.110
The advantage of direct current electricity is it can't kill you.

285
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.780
It doesn't matter how much.
It's not going to kill you.
Uh,

286
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:25.950
the disadvantage of direct current electricity is that as you put it through a

287
00:22:26.261 --> 00:22:30.730
long transmission wire,
you lose most of it after the first five miles.

288
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.380
<v 2>So,
uh,</v>

289
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:39.830
<v 0>Edison control direct current electricity and wanted to make the government</v>

290
00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:45.330
regulate it in.
So what did he do?

291
00:22:45.331 --> 00:22:49.890
He stressed safety.
And so if Edison had one,

292
00:22:49.891 --> 00:22:54.891
there would have been a generating plant about every five miles all over the

293
00:22:55.201 --> 00:22:58.050
country in every urban neighborhood,
its own generating plant.

294
00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:03.490
And how did he dramatize that?
Yes.

295
00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:08.440
The electric chair.
Exactly.
He,
Eh,

296
00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:10.630
he put forward the view that,
well,

297
00:23:10.631 --> 00:23:15.130
Westinghouse has a great technology we're going to do is kill people and

298
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:19.300
actually did demonstrations on animals and all that sort of,
there's just awful.

299
00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:21.003
Uh,

300
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:26.070
but ultimately it was a case where the unregulated market one,

301
00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:31.380
the government stayed out of it and alternating current from the point of view

302
00:23:31.421 --> 00:23:35.380
of illuminating,
uh,
our classroom is pretty efficient.

303
00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:39.550
Then you get petrochemicals and digital networks.

304
00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.560
This is all very stylized as diagram.

305
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:47.070
But the point is that monopolies by one after another,

306
00:23:47.811 --> 00:23:52.811
after another get winkled out by these changes in the underlying technology.

307
00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.030
<v 2>Okay.</v>

308
00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:55.301
<v 0>Right.</v>

309
00:23:55.301 --> 00:24:00.301
New Haven at one time was arguably the leading manufacturing city for horse

310
00:24:03.521 --> 00:24:08.500
drawn carriages.
Well,
it was over and over pretty suddenly.

311
00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:16.870
Regulatory Capture,
a regulatory capture means what it says.

312
00:24:16.871 --> 00:24:21.070
And there's a basic political sciency kind of a thesis about this,

313
00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:24.950
which is that regulatory agencies,
uh,

314
00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:28.450
get captured by the companies they regulate.

315
00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:34.630
That if I'm a,
a bank or a brokerage,

316
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:37.870
I'm intensely interested in the sec

317
00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:44.200
and I develop friendly relations with it.
I feed information to its,
its staff.

318
00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:49.920
It staff comes to rely on me after spending a cycle of four,

319
00:24:50.501 --> 00:24:54.610
eight years in a politically appointed position in the regulatory agency,

320
00:24:55.510 --> 00:25:00.510
it occurs to people that they might pursue a career in the industry they've been

321
00:25:01.241 --> 00:25:02.074
regulating.

322
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:08.400
And so there gets to be a reciprocal relationship there,

323
00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:14.220
which allows a dominant firm to enjoy some advantage from its relationship with

324
00:25:15.851 --> 00:25:19.210
the regulator.
Um,
the,

325
00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:25.410
the current crisis in banking is a little different from this and it's not

326
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.400
really monopolistic,

327
00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:33.240
but it is not unfair to suppose that Goldman Sachs has enjoyed a fruitful

328
00:25:37.631 --> 00:25:42.631
relationship to the federal government in the last four or five decades.

329
00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:49.450
And that there have been very few times when there wasn't a Goldman Sachs

330
00:25:49.451 --> 00:25:54.451
partner in a position to influence a key decisions.

331
00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:59.370
The more classic story would be the airlines.
When I told you where,
um,

332
00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:04.750
Twa Pan Am and all the others of that era,
uh,

333
00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:10.660
had this monopolistic relationship created by airline regulation and what killed

334
00:26:10.661 --> 00:26:15.280
them was that enjoying the monopoly relationship to,

335
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.640
uh,
the,
uh,

336
00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.040
airline regulators allowed them to be pretty soft.

337
00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.560
They didn't have to control costs.

338
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:29.050
They could waste 15 cents of every dollar in profits and still look great to

339
00:26:29.051 --> 00:26:33.040
their investors.
But when deregulation came,

340
00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:37.220
the legacy costs,
uh,

341
00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:42.240
were lethal to many of these firms because they were up.

342
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.110
Now they were up against airlines like southwest,

343
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:50.970
which had no legacy costs and ran very efficiently.

344
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:56.560
Finally,
antitrust,
uh,

345
00:26:56.930 --> 00:27:01.930
antitrust emerges in states with the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890.

346
00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:03.590
Uh,

347
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:08.590
and is there is a continuous oscillation in government policy here and in most

348
00:27:08.931 --> 00:27:13.931
other market economies between strict and not so strict interpretation of what

349
00:27:13.971 --> 00:27:18.971
counts as a monopoly and what kind of counts as predatory monopolistic behavior.

350
00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:25.340
When we get to cases,
we will see several specific instances of this

351
00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:36.160
falling rate of profit.
Uh,
remember those of you who were here,

352
00:27:36.161 --> 00:27:40.630
the first class,
the slides that contrasted,

353
00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:45.070
uh,
labor intensive production.

354
00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.110
And for example,

355
00:27:47.111 --> 00:27:52.111
I had to JAKKS pulling a plow in Tibet juxtaposed to a,

356
00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:57.670
uh,
20 ton John Deere tractor,
uh,

357
00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:01.510
tilling earth in Minnesota,
Iowa or some such place.

358
00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:07.320
And on the one side you had relatively low production per labor hour and on the

359
00:28:10.151 --> 00:28:11.560
other,
uh,

360
00:28:11.561 --> 00:28:16.030
and enormously a high rate of production per labor hour.

361
00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.540
But based on outlays,
uh,

362
00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:24.360
capital outlays for the equipment like the John Deere tractor,
uh,

363
00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:25.780
well into six figures.

364
00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:28.933
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

365
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.970
<v 0>the Marxist idea.
I've got a better chart here.</v>

366
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:35.130
Um,

367
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:40.130
the Marxists idea of how capital makes money from Labor is that capital,

368
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:48.260
that Labor is a commodity and the Labor theory of value more of us applies to

369
00:28:49.351 --> 00:28:53.550
that commodity.
So how much do you have to pay for the commodity,

370
00:28:53.551 --> 00:28:57.330
which he calls Labor power are laboring power?
Well,

371
00:28:57.331 --> 00:29:01.980
you have to pay what it costs to feed the worker,

372
00:29:01.981 --> 00:29:06.840
to close the worker,
uh,
to rear his or her children.

373
00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:12.090
Uh,
you have to it,
the analogy is imagine you have a plow horse.

374
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:17.850
What's it cost you to maintain the plow horse?
Well,
that same reasoning,

375
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:23.030
Mark's applies to the workforce and you pay wages that are broadly consistent

376
00:29:25.681 --> 00:29:29.610
with that.
So in my diagram,
we make sure it's right.

377
00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:35.150
The laboring power is represented by the blue and capital pays labor that much,

378
00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.170
uh,
for its activity.

379
00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:45.740
The total pie represents how much value is produced by labor and what's leftover

380
00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:54.100
is called surplus value.
And capital.

381
00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:59.340
The capital capitalist firm keeps the surplus value by that means exploit's

382
00:30:01.091 --> 00:30:01.924
labor.

383
00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:07.530
And by that means increase its increases itch wealth to create wealth.

384
00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.073
<v 2>Now</v>

385
00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.230
<v 0>that leaves out a lot.</v>

386
00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:21.420
One thing it leaves out is the fundamentals of supply and demand for labor.

387
00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:25.520
<v 2>Um,
it</v>

388
00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:31.150
<v 0>doesn't take into account the idea that Labor would be extremely cheap in this</v>

389
00:30:33.201 --> 00:30:37.970
phase.
How many people here haven't seen the demographic transition?

390
00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.173
<v 2>Good,</v>

391
00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:44.770
<v 0>because we did it a couple of days ago,
but I never know about turnover.
Um,</v>

392
00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.650
so Mark's is oblivious to that.

393
00:30:47.651 --> 00:30:52.390
Except how would he answer if I said that?
He would say,
well,
no,

394
00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:52.841
uh,

395
00:30:52.841 --> 00:30:57.841
labor is cheaper in these conditions because the US socially shared expectations

396
00:30:58.871 --> 00:31:00.430
for how well they have to be fed,

397
00:31:00.431 --> 00:31:05.170
clothed and their children reared our law in those conditions.

398
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.730
So village India,

399
00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:12.360
the cost of labor power is vastly less than it is in midtown Manhattan.

400
00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:16.660
Okay,
that's,
that's one issue.
Another issue,

401
00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:24.840
this is the age curve and it's just an an embellishment of the demography.

402
00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:27.820
Another is how hard people work.

403
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:34.110
This is a Broil braggle 16th century picture of agricultural labor,

404
00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:38.020
which by the evidence there is not very intense

405
00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:41.110
and the,

406
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:46.950
the idea that you pay for what you get in labor is a powerful one.

407
00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:55.630
And the so called scientific management movement of a century ago,

408
00:31:55.631 --> 00:31:59.890
which grew up around large manufacturing companies in the u s and Europe,

409
00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:05.580
was that you develop incentives to make people work really hard.

410
00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:11.370
The simplest case was Henry Ford's $5 $5 a day salary,

411
00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.370
which was way above market prices,

412
00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:20.560
but allowed him to be very choosy about his workers to demand very intense labor

413
00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:25.990
and to demand that they allow him to inspect their lives.
He had a,

414
00:32:25.991 --> 00:32:29.590
what he called sociologists who went around to people's houses looking for

415
00:32:29.591 --> 00:32:33.880
alcohol or devices for gambling and so on.

416
00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.920
Uh,
but intensity of labor is another variable that needs to be thought of.

417
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:46.790
Now I just made that story sound really sensible,

418
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:49.940
I think,
right?

419
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:53.870
But the logic of it has always escaped me,

420
00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:55.520
right?

421
00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:00.520
The notion that Labor is different from any other standard for measuring value

422
00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:05.030
and that you can,

423
00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.670
you attribute to labor the whole pie,

424
00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:14.020
but actually you've got attribute much of the pie to capital and beyond capital.

425
00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:20.170
You've got to attribute much of it to ownership and intellectual to management

426
00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.950
and intellectual property knowhow,

427
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:29.420
the ability to actually make widgets well and effectively at low costs.

428
00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:33.500
All that is left out of Marxists story.

429
00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:39.250
He assumes he just says necessary labor time,
uh,

430
00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:44.320
and draws attention away from what capitalism is best at,

431
00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:49.670
which is again,
and again revising the way we produce something.

432
00:33:49.671 --> 00:33:52.700
The way we distributed,
the way we design it,

433
00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:56.690
the way we designed the machinery that creates it.

434
00:33:57.050 --> 00:34:00.860
Even the way we designed the machinery that designs the product.

435
00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:04.820
All of that is marginalized in a Marxist analysis.

436
00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:06.920
And for that reason,
uh,

437
00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:11.980
Marxism does not function well in analyzing a real companies in real markets.

438
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:21.010
Now the surplus value that can be extracted depends on how much labor is used in

439
00:34:24.681 --> 00:34:25.514
production.

440
00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:31.060
And as total labor used in production goes towards zero,

441
00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:36.560
the opportunity to exploit workers goes away and with it,

442
00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.290
profit with it,
profits have to fall.

443
00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:42.890
<v 2>Okay.</v>

444
00:34:42.890 --> 00:34:46.850
<v 0>Now and from that follows the immiseration to working class.</v>

445
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:49.670
Look at this bottling plant

446
00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:56.170
where the work is to sit at this control panel and adjust the process plus a

447
00:35:01.761 --> 00:35:02.660
little maintenance.

448
00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:08.350
If any of you been in a plant where there were virtually no workers present,

449
00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:12.320
can you hand him the mic?

450
00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:19.673
<v 2>This</v>

451
00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:30.890
sort
of putting them into bags and then they're like

452
00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:38.220
Rudy sitting at sqream
exactly.

453
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:41.880
<v 0>Other examples in the back.
Can we get,
um,</v>

454
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:44.880
get a mic back to the very last row?

455
00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:49.743
<v 2>Wow.</v>

456
00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.500
Gee.
Now if you're a factory in China,
uh Huh.
Uh,

457
00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:01.900
I mean it's fairly well
for guys

458
00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:04.700
that were with checking this,

459
00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:07.690
<v 0>so very high degree of automation.</v>

460
00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:08.683
<v 2>Okay.</v>

461
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:15.050
<v 0>I would,
some years ago in a textile factory in Turkey,</v>

462
00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:20.920
which covered six acres of interior manufacturing space and every,

463
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:25.640
every square foot of it was either a,

464
00:36:25.641 --> 00:36:30.641
an aisle between machinery or machinery and virtually all the machinery was

465
00:36:30.741 --> 00:36:35.741
working and the cloth was coming out in bolts like this at 10 or 12 different

466
00:36:36.111 --> 00:36:36.944
points.

467
00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:41.740
And automata were throwing it on conveyor belts and conveyor belts were,

468
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:42.710
uh,

469
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:47.210
taking it where it needed to be for shipping and labeling it and having it ready

470
00:36:47.211 --> 00:36:51.110
to go.
And when I was there,
there were about six people in the plant,

471
00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:55.520
uh,
all of them technicians.
Uh,

472
00:36:55.521 --> 00:36:59.930
and the story about the plant was that it could operate that way for as much as

473
00:36:59.931 --> 00:37:01.550
60,
60 hours.

474
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:06.490
And then there would be a shutdown for a few hours of maintenance and then an

475
00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:10.550
adjustment and then another 60 hours and so on.
Uh,

476
00:37:10.551 --> 00:37:12.900
another historical example is the bond sock.

477
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:17.900
Cigarette machine cigarettes were not popular before the bond sock cigarette

478
00:37:18.351 --> 00:37:23.351
machine and the bonds like cigarette machine could make 6,000 cigarettes per

479
00:37:23.361 --> 00:37:27.410
hour,
which they are now much better than that.
There are 100,000 an hour,

480
00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:31.730
but at 6,000 per hour with zero labor cost,

481
00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:33.530
uh,

482
00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:38.530
it occurred to the people who formed American tobacco that they could make an

483
00:37:39.231 --> 00:37:44.180
awful lot of money if they created a marketing end that would allow them to pump

484
00:37:44.181 --> 00:37:48.470
all those thousands of cigarettes out into the market.

485
00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:50.720
And they did it and did a very good job of it.

486
00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:54.920
But at the core of it was this little piece of technology,

487
00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:59.750
continuous production paper and,
and uh,

488
00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:05.290
tobacco leaf go in one end of the machine and cigarettes neatly stacked in

489
00:38:06.111 --> 00:38:08.150
consecutive order come out the other.

490
00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:12.380
So capital intensivity takes labor out of the picture.

491
00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:24.250
So in effect,
the dead,

492
00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:28.600
who created the machinery or the producers,

493
00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:34.060
uh,
inevitable revolution and advanced capitalist societies.

494
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.620
The idea here is that with

495
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:43.180
falling rates or capital and the immiseration,
the working class,

496
00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:46.570
this system ceases to be stable.

497
00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:53.310
And this is a guy named Georgie plucking off and plucking off was a Marxist who

498
00:38:57.521 --> 00:39:02.500
was a follower of Lennon's and he's famous for having asked the question,

499
00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:05.440
if the revolution is inevitable,

500
00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.670
why must we fight and die to make it happen?
Right.

501
00:39:10.671 --> 00:39:14.300
And that's an interesting question and it's,

502
00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:18.240
it gets the name plaque and offs pair a paradox.
Uh,

503
00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:23.620
and of course the answer to it is that the revolution wasn't inevitable and

504
00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:29.420
where it did happen,
it didn't happen for the reasons Mark's described.

505
00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:30.770
Where did,

506
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:35.770
where were the most advanced systems where you would expect the capital

507
00:39:35.781 --> 00:39:40.610
intensive production falling rate of profit,
uh,
and low wages to labor?

508
00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:45.230
Where were those systems?
What's name a few countries?
Yes,
US,

509
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:46.370
UK,
Germany,

510
00:39:46.371 --> 00:39:50.930
the u s and those are not the places where the revolution happened.

511
00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:56.850
It happened,
uh,
most dramatically in,
uh,

512
00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:01.880
Russia and then by conquest in the rest of the Soviet Union and Cuba.

513
00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:06.670
Uh,
this is,
uh,

514
00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:11.800
this is Fidel on the right and Che Guevara on the left there was the,

515
00:40:13.061 --> 00:40:17.710
I have a photograph in my collection at home of Fidel Castro at the new haven

516
00:40:17.711 --> 00:40:18.670
train station.

517
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.530
And a new haven policemen looking at him like he's from Mars.

518
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:27.520
And it was just after the revolution when they hadn't,

519
00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:32.740
when the break where the u s hadn't really hardened and he was on a university

520
00:40:32.741 --> 00:40:37.240
tour speaking on college campuses,
trying to raise money for the revolution.

521
00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:38.260
Uh,

522
00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:43.260
Cuba was not an advanced capitalist economy and still is the best thing you can

523
00:40:46.091 --> 00:40:50.320
say about you.
I've been twice and had been a guest of the government want.

524
00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:55.720
And the best thing you can say for them is that they actually have done a

525
00:40:55.721 --> 00:40:58.870
splendid job with rudimentary public health.

526
00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:04.560
So that on the longevity dimension of the data automation we looked at,

527
00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:11.050
if you'll screen it up tonight,
you'll discover a little green moon way,

528
00:41:11.051 --> 00:41:14.740
way high side outlier on longevity.
And that's Cuba.

529
00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.350
On the other hand,
they are dirt poor

530
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:24.110
China,
not an advanced industrial economy.
When this,

531
00:41:24.111 --> 00:41:25.460
when the revolution occurred,

532
00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:27.660
<v 2>okay.</v>

533
00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:31.740
<v 0>Then Swayla an oil state and whether they're,</v>

534
00:41:31.741 --> 00:41:34.490
what revolution has occurred or not is open to question.

535
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:41.360
And this at the height of the Cold War was the way the chessboard looked,

536
00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:45.880
where Red Meant Marxist and uh,

537
00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:48.950
and pink meant sort of Marxist.

538
00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.320
And the,

539
00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:57.350
the game of controlling emerging market countries was at the core of cold war

540
00:42:02.481 --> 00:42:07.070
strategy or very near it.
Uh,

541
00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:11.950
the theory of the universal class.
If the aristocracy,

542
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:17.790
a exploits serfs in a medieval European society and capitalists exploit

543
00:42:22.451 --> 00:42:27.451
proletarians in capitalist society and proletarians come to power,

544
00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:31.720
who are they going to exploit?

545
00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:36.370
There's no one below them since there's no one below them.

546
00:42:36.371 --> 00:42:39.760
They are the universal class and exploitation is over

547
00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:44.400
<v 2>now
please.</v>

548
00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:52.820
<v 0>So the reasoning is like the eastern division of the American League</v>

549
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.810
and Baltimore is the universal class because there's no one,
they can be

550
00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:04.093
the,

551
00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:09.220
the what's at the core of this last thing.
And,

552
00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:14.480
and it is truly dangerous reasoning is that the universal class being in a

553
00:43:15.321 --> 00:43:19.100
position superior,
no other class brings an end to exploitation.

554
00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:20.693
<v 2>Well,</v>

555
00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:25.880
<v 0>and since that's true,
the state can wither away.</v>

556
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:28.970
<v 2>Now,
uh,</v>

557
00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.670
<v 0>it doesn't happen in a hurt.</v>

558
00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:44.170
And behind this is a really fundamental issue of principal agency.

559
00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:52.700
Did we talk about principal agency a few days ago?
Maybe not.

560
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:54.590
Well let's just for simplicity,

561
00:43:54.591 --> 00:43:59.591
let's suppose the people on the country and the communist government is the

562
00:44:02.271 --> 00:44:07.271
agency that they have elected to choose or which has chosen itself to manage the

563
00:44:09.711 --> 00:44:14.360
country on behalf of the people.
The principal agency problem,

564
00:44:14.361 --> 00:44:19.361
which occurs in things as small as a grocery store is that the employees agents

565
00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:26.890
choose instead of serving the purposes of the owners or the country choose to

566
00:44:28.581 --> 00:44:30.410
serve purposes of their own.

567
00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:38.060
And the invariable fact about state socialism was that the people at the top of

568
00:44:42.481 --> 00:44:43.890
the state apparatus,

569
00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:47.820
a privileged themselves and their children

570
00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:54.330
and a new class struggle developed.
Now more generally.

571
00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:58.310
Uh,
and here I'm using the work of a,

572
00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:03.340
a sociologist named Ralph Dahrendorf economic sociologist who died just a few

573
00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:09.180
weeks ago.
Uh,
and Dahrendorf point,
which I'm sure is true,

574
00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:15.170
is that you can generate classes around any process of production and

575
00:45:15.681 --> 00:45:16.514
distribution.

576
00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:22.610
There is nothing final about the proletariat coming to power.

577
00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:29.600
And there is never a time in human history when we'll be done with the

578
00:45:30.781 --> 00:45:35.781
possibility that those who control the direct levers control them not to the

579
00:45:35.881 --> 00:45:38.400
benefit of others but to the benefit of themselves.

580
00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:40.790
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

581
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:45.790
<v 0>and so Francis Fukuyama who famously wrote a book called that had had the</v>

582
00:45:46.011 --> 00:45:50.270
punchline,
the end of history after the Cold War ended,

583
00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:55.940
his view was that capitalist democracy became the end of history,

584
00:45:55.941 --> 00:45:59.570
the unchangeable end point.

585
00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:01.580
And of course that's not true.

586
00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:07.570
The course of history is not contrary to Mark's a determinant.

587
00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:13.480
Mark's was not only wrong about his own ability to understand the course of

588
00:46:13.641 --> 00:46:14.480
future history.

589
00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:20.260
He was wrong about the very concept that there could be a deterministic theory

590
00:46:20.931 --> 00:46:24.830
which told us what was going to happen in the future.

591
00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:30.420
This guy,
Schumpeter who I know you hate the way he writes,

592
00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:37.600
but he understood that point profoundly and I'm out of time so I'm not going to

593
00:46:38.101 --> 00:46:40.820
elaborate him.
I'll do it at the beginning of class next time.

594
00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:46.600
But the guy who comes to center stage next time is f a Hayak who's most famous

595
00:46:50.091 --> 00:46:52.310
book was called the Constitution of liberty.

596
00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:58.330
And who believed that a market society had within it the capacity for enormous

597
00:46:59.871 --> 00:47:04.400
creativity and growth.
And we'll examine that in class on Wednesday.
