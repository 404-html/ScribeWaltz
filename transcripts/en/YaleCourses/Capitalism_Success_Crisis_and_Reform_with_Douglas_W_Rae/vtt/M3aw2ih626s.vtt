1
00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.500
I'm going to use today to actually cover some introductory material.

2
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.180
We will use most of the 50 minutes.

3
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.191
Uh,

4
00:00:13.191 --> 00:00:17.840
the last part of today's lecture,

5
00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:22.190
we'll describe the course,
it's requirements,
uh,
and so forth.

6
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.120
So let's begin capitalism.

7
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.290
We're going to break the subject today into three headings,

8
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.590
capital capitalism,
and of course three C's,

9
00:00:35.591 --> 00:00:36.424
if you will.

10
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.543
<v 1>The,</v>

11
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.820
<v 0>I've chosen an,
and I usually do this,</v>

12
00:00:42.821 --> 00:00:47.821
I've chosen a one segment of the economy as the theme for the day.

13
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.420
Uh,
and today that segment is revealed in this slide.

14
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.213
<v 1>MMM.</v>

15
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.490
<v 0>Calhoun athletics.
Xxl,
can you interpret the slide?</v>

16
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.790
<v 1>Okay.
What,
what in particular?</v>

17
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.083
Okay.

18
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.150
<v 0>Uh,
how bout Varick bottled water.</v>

19
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.210
Okay.
They are indeed crop circles,

20
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.800
a score one for Mbas.
Uh,

21
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.550
they are crop circles and all of us who travel,
uh,
from,
uh,

22
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.320
east to west across the country.
I have seen them,

23
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.150
but we haven't seen them quite in this density because this photograph is taken

24
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:37.080
from space.

25
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.940
It's a NASA image and it,

26
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.360
uh,
it's an extraordinarily elegant,

27
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.930
a display of something very simple.
Now,

28
00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:53.931
why would center pivot agriculture interest us from the point of view of

29
00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:57.420
capitalism?
The MS formatted slide here says capital.

30
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.670
Uh,

31
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.670
this is a definition that comes down to us through the Oxford English dictionary

32
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.580
from the early 17th century.
And uh,

33
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.470
let me read it in full and then we'll boil it down to more manageable terms.

34
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.920
Capitol is the art accumulated wealth of an individual company or community used

35
00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:28.131
as a fun to carry on fresh production wealth in any form used to help in

36
00:02:28.621 --> 00:02:33.600
producing more wealth.
And there's a shift between those two meanings.

37
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.790
The first is a very broad understanding of capital.

38
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.360
The second is very close to the way you would have to think about capital in

39
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:48.930
connection with an economic system called Capitol Ism.

40
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.193
<v 1>Okay,</v>

41
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.130
<v 0>so let's start with the broader usage.</v>

42
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.400
A Capitol is accumulated wealth used as a fund in carrying on production.

43
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.760
Uh,
it's a very broad idea.

44
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.950
It is one which arguably in fact,

45
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:11.220
I think without much argument,
uh,

46
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.270
it goes back 10,000 years to the establishment of agricultural society and very

47
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:20.320
possibly another hundred,

48
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.320
hundred and 20,000 years to organized hunter gatherers using weapons and tools.

49
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.110
Does this qualify?

50
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>

51
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.970
<v 0>Is that not capital?</v>

52
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.800
<v 1>Okay.
What do you think should I could for purple.</v>

53
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.830
Okay.
It is capital.
All right.

54
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.080
Excuse me.
Can you handle this?

55
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.590
<v 2>Oh,
I think have a use of capital because it's sort of kind of like accumulate</v>

56
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.090
wealth and you kind of use nuts from pain.

57
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.880
<v 1>No.
For,
for art to do it at,</v>

58
00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:13.714
well

59
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.690
does this meet the next step?
You need the mic a little closer.

60
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.090
<v 2>Well,
it doesn't really have any fresh productions.</v>

61
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.300
<v 1>Okay.
So what,
what does this role that?</v>

62
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.090
<v 2>Nothing in material.</v>

63
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.880
<v 1>Good.
It's pretty much the squirrel.</v>

64
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.323
Okay.

65
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.070
<v 0>Hand the mic to somebody else and we'll this,
it's the hot potato</v>

66
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.630
or just pass it around and wherever it is,

67
00:04:51.631 --> 00:04:53.370
when I ask a question that's your turn.

68
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.153
<v 1>Yeah,
that'll be good.</v>

69
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.730
<v 0>Uh,
the nest is producing Nass blanks.</v>

70
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.780
Um,
and it's a little closer to what we mean

71
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.820
beaver dam producing a working environment for beavers to carry out their

72
00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:19.570
business closer infrastructure,
if you will.

73
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.940
The honeycomb that bees years.
Uh,

74
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.960
this one is actually the one that is close to intuitively to capital,

75
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.370
right?

76
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.370
The accumulated wealth is the energy and silk required to weave the nest or

77
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:45.970
weave the web.
And the web is indeed an instrument,

78
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.120
uh,
for the work of capturing prey,

79
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.860
but there's no external product beyond them.

80
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.860
So even that is not quite what we have in mind.

81
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.360
<v 1>Now.
How about sheet the seeds used in agriculture?</v>

82
00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:04.880
Where's the job?

83
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.043
Okay.

84
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.980
Okay.

85
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.980
So you recognize that seems like this constitute capital holding like really

86
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.973
close.

87
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.680
<v 3>I don't really think so.
Okay.
Well,</v>

88
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.520
I guess that a seed produces a plant,

89
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.270
but um,
it doesn't really,
well I guess,
yeah,

90
00:06:40.271 --> 00:06:43.780
maybe the seed producing the plant and then the plant produces more seeds in it

91
00:06:43.781 --> 00:06:46.990
sort of keeps generating more and more seeds.

92
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.390
<v 1>Is that capital?
Um,</v>

93
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.330
<v 3>I mean like it to me.
Well,</v>

94
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.470
you know,
I guess the capital sort of,
uh,
um,

95
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.630
and never ending way of accumulating more wealth.

96
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:10.130
Um,
I think so.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Capitalists fail,
but good capitalists don't.

97
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:19.320
<v 1>Yeah.
Um,</v>

98
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.460
okay.
Uh,

99
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.550
kilograms of sheep.
Uh,

100
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.230
would anybody
say that there's,

101
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:39.310
that it isn't enough to count was capital
is if,

102
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.700
if is one seat,
does that make it capital

103
00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.810
<v 3>it I said what kind of seed is it</v>

104
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:52.140
<v 1>for throwing safflower</v>

105
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.920
explicit information for me.
You got to get you something back.

106
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:04.040
<v 3>I think seeds in any quantity can be capital because each,</v>

107
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.350
once you planted,
and if there is a like,
you know,

108
00:08:06.351 --> 00:08:10.850
successful pollination and everything like that before,
um,

109
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.390
you can always use the plants to produce more seed.
In fact,

110
00:08:14.391 --> 00:08:17.390
that's what a lot of farms do and that's what a lot of farms get in trouble for

111
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.950
because other companies want to control those seeds.

112
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.590
Pat Patent

113
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:27.500
<v 1>violation issue.
If I use hybrid seed to generate more hybrid sheet,</v>

114
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:31.500
there may be,
there's an argument there.
Okay,

115
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.240
so quantity doesn't matter at all.
Yes.

116
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.660
I would say quantity matters if you're a subsistence farmer because if you just

117
00:08:39.661 --> 00:08:41.910
have enough seed to feed yourself,
that's not capital,

118
00:08:41.911 --> 00:08:44.270
that's just keeping you alive.
You aren't producing any further well from it.

119
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.480
And if I gave you this much,

120
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.900
uh,
well,
if I'm not a farmer,
if I have some other means of supporting myself,

121
00:08:52.901 --> 00:08:56.220
that could be capital for upside business,
but that wouldn't

122
00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:01.100
<v 0>be for subsistence farmer.
I think it's really worth having the business over 26.</v>

123
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.700
Well,
no,
no,
I don't think so.

124
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:11.130
And what I'm driving at here is the notion of minimum efficient scale capital

125
00:09:13.541 --> 00:09:15.250
gets a resource,

126
00:09:15.251 --> 00:09:20.251
gets to be capital only when it's aggregated to a scale where it can be fic

127
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.620
effectively enough deployed to compete in an actual economy.

128
00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:31.570
Now what's your take
too big a note?

129
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.150
Let's take a dollar.

130
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.313
<v 1>MMM.</v>

131
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.590
<v 0>Have I just given you a capital or not?</v>

132
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:45.383
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

133
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.700
<v 3>technically yes.
But probably that wouldn't allow me to,
uh,</v>

134
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.070
set up a budding business over here.

135
00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.260
<v 0>How am I going to become a piece of cabinets?</v>

136
00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.970
<v 3>Well,
if somebody else gives me a dollar or more,</v>

137
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.120
<v 0>$3 is enough for you.</v>

138
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.180
<v 3>No,
but,
um,
if,</v>

139
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.630
if I have more investors and they will be giving more than a dollar.

140
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.670
<v 0>Okay.</v>

141
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:12.670
So your need some aggregation or collaboration.

142
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:17.490
And how does,
how does she,
how do we aggregate capital in an actual economy?

143
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.910
IPOS are a big way to,
yeah,

144
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.270
do what the end in general,
the joint stock corporation is a way to do it.

145
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.830
How do banks aggregate capital

146
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.113
<v 1>rolling</v>

147
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:37.940
<v 0>deposits.
Okay.
Thousands of little deposits make big funds.</v>

148
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:43.340
Okay.
So we're getting there with capital.

149
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:48.610
And what I want to do now is continue the agricultural theme.

150
00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:53.000
Uh,

151
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
see if we can relate what we're talking about to the generation of actual wealth

152
00:10:58.871 --> 00:10:59.710
in society.

153
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:02.183
<v 1>Okay.</v>

154
00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.510
<v 0>Uh,
this is called a seed drill</v>

155
00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:10.660
and it is a way of planning millions of seeds in a very systematic,

156
00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.540
precise,
and cost effective way.

157
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:19.560
And one characteristic feature of how capital works is combining different

158
00:11:19.871 --> 00:11:24.871
factors in the production of the same thing in an extremely intelligent way,

159
00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:31.450
a way that represents the accumulated experience,
uh,

160
00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:35.900
of society.
And when you do it well,
uh,

161
00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.170
you succeed.
And when you do it poorly,
you fail.

162
00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:41.080
You can actually fail even when you do it well,

163
00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:45.730
but you're very unlikely to succeed when you do it poorly.

164
00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:50.480
Now here I want to compare two,
uh,

165
00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:52.390
two very similar technologies.

166
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.310
This is a peasant farming in Tibet.

167
00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:58.570
Uh,

168
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:02.920
and the motive power here is a pair of yaks

169
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.430
and this was a John Deere tractor.

170
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.130
And the spectacular difference between these two things,

171
00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:17.131
it's obvious to us all it is that one of them is,

172
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.960
constitutes a large investment of capital.
Uh,

173
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:26.130
in the case of that tractor and the gear where the well over $100,000 must be

174
00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:30.400
invested,
uh,
the yaks,
well,

175
00:12:30.401 --> 00:12:34.180
I dunno what JAKKS cost in Tibet,
but less.

176
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:40.230
And we would say that the John Deere photograph represents something that's

177
00:12:41.381 --> 00:12:42.580
capital intensive.

178
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.470
And the Yak photograph represents something which is,

179
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:49.990
excuse me,
labor intensive,

180
00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:58.540
and we would expect a much higher return in pro and in food food generated per

181
00:13:03.351 --> 00:13:08.351
hour of labor invested fromm the highly mechanized capital intensive story.

182
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:15.790
And the history of the world in the last thousand years is essentially the

183
00:13:20.811 --> 00:13:24.020
history of substitution for,

184
00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:29.140
of the right hand picture for the lefthand of capital intensive,

185
00:13:29.511 --> 00:13:34.511
highly mechanized means of production in the place of labor intensive low

186
00:13:37.161 --> 00:13:40.220
capitalization,
uh,
means of production.

187
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:41.910
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

188
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:42.960
<v 0>Another comparison,</v>

189
00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:48.733
<v 1>excuse me.</v>

190
00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:55.120
<v 0>Uh,
the capital intensivity here,
the ratio of that watering cans,</v>

191
00:13:55.610 --> 00:14:00.610
capital cost to the center pivot that might be as much as 500 meters long would

192
00:14:02.811 --> 00:14:07.100
be measured in the thousands to one,
the tens of thousands,

193
00:14:07.101 --> 00:14:08.240
the hundreds of thousands,

194
00:14:08.241 --> 00:14:12.890
probably enormous difference in the level of investment.

195
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:19.530
Also those of you were interested in the environment and all of us should be a,

196
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.240
there is a huge difference in environmental impact.

197
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:29.350
The labor intensive agriculture essentially leaves the environment unchanged

198
00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:36.500
whereas this kind of agriculture practiced in a,

199
00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:38.480
it's now a world center pivot.

200
00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:43.510
Irrigation is a worldwide technology and in many places it draws so much water

201
00:14:44.961 --> 00:14:49.961
so fast and so much water is lost to evaporation that the underlying aquifer is

202
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:54.590
rapidly being depleted.

203
00:14:56.230 --> 00:15:01.230
I here are two center pivot photographs and they to differ in capitalization.

204
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:10.680
The one on the left is from Egypt.
Uh,

205
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:15.790
the one on the right is from Iowa and the difference between them in the cost of

206
00:15:19.071 --> 00:15:22.340
the land would be dramatic.

207
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:28.600
The market price of highly productive loam soil in one of the three or four

208
00:15:32.841 --> 00:15:37.841
richest agricultural zones in the world is much higher than in,

209
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:43.010
uh,
the margin of the world's largest desert.

210
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:52.000
Uh,
here's another,
I kind of get carried away with center pivot agriculture.

211
00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:57.100
Uh,
here's another slide of the same kind from the same source.

212
00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:02.020
And this is in southern France who's been to southern France.

213
00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:06.350
Pretty Great,
isn't it?

214
00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:11.910
I have many reservations about French politics,
uh,

215
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:16.760
but southern France is one of the nicest places I've ever been.

216
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.930
And I,
this summer we'll meet a guy here in a month,

217
00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:25.610
a named Paulos Arnone,
uh,
who is a robber baron,

218
00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.310
a Goldman Sachs partner,

219
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:34.600
and he just built a villa overlooking can in southern France and I had to be

220
00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:39.760
taken away by security.
Um,

221
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:47.050
what's striking about this photograph in comparison with the others?

222
00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:48.170
What's the,

223
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:52.610
what's the dramatic difference between this one and the Egyptian one and the

224
00:16:52.611 --> 00:16:53.450
Iowa one

225
00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.010
purple.
That's not what I'm fishing for guys.

226
00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:05.510
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

227
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:09.020
<v 0>Okay.
You got to talk really,
where do I have the mic?</v>

228
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:14.220
<v 1>Here it is.
Please pass this over again.</v>

229
00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:27.150
<v 0>Push the on button and it'll be on.</v>

230
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:31.160
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

231
00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.970
<v 0>I,
there's other things in the middle of the like the green and purple circles.</v>

232
00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.370
Okay.
And what are the other things?

233
00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:38.753
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

234
00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.870
<v 0>I can't tell if that's houses are well,</v>

235
00:17:41.871 --> 00:17:46.060
why are all these little polygons look at the right margin for example,
right.

236
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:54.580
They are take your gas,
they're not soccer fields,

237
00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:58.900
right?
Who wants to take a guess at fish?
Yes.

238
00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:06.050
Pasture.
Okay.
They might be pasture.
What they really,

239
00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.800
what they are more generally you have the,
uh,

240
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.340
we'll get better at this microphone thing as we go.
Um,

241
00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:17.840
what they are is very small farms.

242
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:24.310
There are farms where the meets and bounds pat trace back perhaps 800,

243
00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.720
1,012 hundred years.

244
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:32.710
And they were farms which worked economically when the world was less developed

245
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.250
in capital intensive agriculture,

246
00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:43.120
but they have been rendered marginal by the transformation of world agriculture.

247
00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.020
Now the question for you,

248
00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.220
you ready for a policy question?

249
00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.750
Okay.
Your name is now Sarcozi

250
00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.750
and the question is,
should we increase,

251
00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:08.650
let's suppose that 20% of these farms are failing a year and we're already

252
00:19:08.931 --> 00:19:10.460
subsidizing them pretty heavily.

253
00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:16.480
Should we subsidize them more so that the rate at which they closed down is

254
00:19:17.481 --> 00:19:21.140
diminished?
Mr Sarcozi must you,

255
00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:29.940
<v 4>I would say if you really want to effectively decrease the rate at which they're</v>

256
00:19:29.941 --> 00:19:32.190
failing,
you'd want to encourage consolidation.

257
00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:35.100
It looks like the problem here is a real fragmentation.

258
00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:39.310
<v 0>Okay.
The problem is fragmentation.
That's a really good start.</v>

259
00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:44.140
Now,
uh,
the person,
uh,

260
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:45.520
immediately to your right

261
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.250
is your political consultant

262
00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:57.810
and she's going to tell you whether what you just said is going to wash in Leo

263
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.473
or not.

264
00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:06.760
How's that the Sarcozi consolidation program.

265
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:11.760
How's that going to play?
Repeat the question please.
Okay.

266
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.610
<v 1>Sarcozi you just said</v>

267
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:22.710
these little fragments of land art in the street and we get efficient way to do

268
00:20:22.711 --> 00:20:26.670
agriculture and he,
she was right on that point.

269
00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:33.010
And it goes on to say that we should try and capture the stable economies

270
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.800
Bayfield by consolidating.

271
00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:40.680
And you're talking now you are a public official.

272
00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:47.800
Uh,
what,
how's that going to read for you statement

273
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:53.340
<v 0>that we should announce the Sarcozi agricultural consolidation.</v>

274
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:54.603
<v 1>Wow.</v>

275
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.300
<v 0>I don't think the public would like it.</v>

276
00:20:58.301 --> 00:21:00.910
Like the small fibers solars would hate it.

277
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:06.320
And it was slow cars play a special role in the life of the imagination of,

278
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.770
okay,
so probably won't happen.
And France,

279
00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:15.933
this is,

280
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:21.100
this is a characteristic fact about all the capitalist democracies is that

281
00:21:21.101 --> 00:21:26.101
pressure groups play an enormously important role in actual policy.

282
00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:32.240
And the one book which is available for purchase at labyrinth but which isn't

283
00:21:32.831 --> 00:21:37.180
actually required a is Christopher Buckley's.

284
00:21:37.181 --> 00:21:41.080
Thank you for smoking.
How many of you have read this book?

285
00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:45.373
<v 1>Pardon?</v>

286
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:48.600
<v 0>Oh,
the movie.
How many of you've seen the movie?</v>

287
00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:53.243
<v 1>Uh,</v>

288
00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:01.940
<v 0>it's all about the biases of pressure groups and public relations in the</v>

289
00:22:05.131 --> 00:22:09.450
capitalist in the largest capitalist democracy,
which is our own,

290
00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.410
I just couldn't resist throwing this one.
And this is the Libyan desert

291
00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.640
<v 1>and uh,</v>

292
00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:24.750
<v 0>center pivot agriculture plus maybe something else that,</v>

293
00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:29.700
uh,
uncles,
observers from the sky I found interesting.

294
00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:32.270
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

295
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:37.100
<v 0>Okay.
So a general theme here,
a strategy,
a strategy,</v>

296
00:22:37.101 --> 00:22:40.580
be a strategy,
a is labor intensive.

297
00:22:40.581 --> 00:22:44.090
Production Strategy B is capital intensive production.

298
00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.113
<v 1>The</v>

299
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.500
<v 0>single biggest story,
I'm repeating myself here because it's such a big point,</v>

300
00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:54.730
uh,

301
00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:59.730
in recent world history is the substitution of strategy be for strategy a and

302
00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:07.480
that happening on an extremely uneven basis.

303
00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:13.410
It's happening in a big way and fast some places and in a little way and slow

304
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:19.230
other places and that generates an enormous vertical dimension to the world.

305
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:25.950
So there are income ratios between households measured in the millions,

306
00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:31.270
millions to one.
Uh,
and that provides,

307
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.720
uh,
some of the interest,
uh,

308
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:38.740
in the functioning of capitalism,
which brings us to the subject

309
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:44.190
<v 1>now,
uh,
comparing,
uh,</v>

310
00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:50.650
<v 0>labor intensive,
the Red Arrow with capital intensive,
the Blue Arrow,</v>

311
00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:55.690
we have here a very simple production function where labor expended is on the

312
00:23:55.691 --> 00:24:00.310
horizontal axis and units produced is on the vertical.

313
00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.580
Oh,
for those of you who are actually taking this course,
these slides,

314
00:24:03.581 --> 00:24:08.550
I posted them just before class.
And so if you,
I mean,

315
00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:12.970
you can just,
you don't have to write this stuff down.
Uh,

316
00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:16.630
and if you project

317
00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:23.290
differences in rates of return over long periods,

318
00:24:23.291 --> 00:24:28.291
here I've put a hundred production cycles and one curve is increasing at 1%.

319
00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:31.323
The red one,

320
00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:36.840
the other is increasing at 4% per cycle and by the end of the period there is a

321
00:24:39.701 --> 00:24:44.701
monstrous difference in the rate at which they are accumulating and in actual,

322
00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:50.890
<v 1>okay.</v>

323
00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:55.390
<v 0>In actual fact,
very small differences,</v>

324
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:59.200
I've greatly overstated them in the production function here,

325
00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:04.680
the difference between 4% and 3% or between 2.5% and 1%,

326
00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:07.731
uh,

327
00:25:07.731 --> 00:25:12.731
are enormously consequential when projected over time and at a given moment in

328
00:25:13.961 --> 00:25:17.950
time are enormously consequential from a competitive point of view.

329
00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:22.690
Because if you are not the low cost producer,

330
00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:24.921
uh,

331
00:25:24.921 --> 00:25:29.921
the low cost producer is in a position where if she has sufficient scale of

332
00:25:30.531 --> 00:25:33.890
operation,
she can drive you out of business.

333
00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:37.490
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

334
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:41.060
<v 0>no,
everything we've said so far,
uh,</v>

335
00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:45.620
could be true of almost any economic system.
Uh,

336
00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.160
I put the grass here to suggest Tang China.

337
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:53.690
This was one of the great periods in Chinese cultural and economic history,

338
00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.780
uh,
ending more than a thousand years ago.
And the,

339
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.700
the use of capital,

340
00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:05.210
not necessarily in the highly intensive form,

341
00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:10.430
but the use of capital in this economic cycle we were talking about,

342
00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:15.180
uh,
it was a perfectly normal practice,
uh,

343
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:19.910
which the Tang dynasty would have understood easily.
And they were,

344
00:26:19.911 --> 00:26:20.744
by the way,

345
00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:26.990
just as inventive as we have been in the last couple of hundred years.

346
00:26:26.991 --> 00:26:30.530
What they didn't have was the ability to go to scale.

347
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.400
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

348
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:37.290
<v 0>Or it could have been in as [inaudible] as suggested in this Broyle painting.
Uh,</v>

349
00:26:37.291 --> 00:26:42.130
we could be thinking of Europe in the 15th century or the 16th Century,

350
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:43.231
uh,

351
00:26:43.231 --> 00:26:48.231
before the capitalist revolution because there was always the reliance on

352
00:26:49.201 --> 00:26:50.034
capitol,

353
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:55.550
lower levels of intent in intensivity because there was less capital in total.

354
00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:58.980
And it could even have been,

355
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:04.130
we could even be talking about an agricultural cooperative in the Soviet Union,

356
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:11.130
which,
uh,
used,
uh,
capital,

357
00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:12.870
uh,

358
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:17.870
in the form of tractors and land and seed and so on,

359
00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:24.890
but used it in a very different way than it is used in market economies

360
00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:30.490
<v 1>to capitalism.</v>

361
00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:34.373
Okay.

362
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:38.770
<v 0>Oh,
let's switch now to the lower,
the lower usage here.</v>

363
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.390
The acute,
the,

364
00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:45.430
it is the use of accumulated wealth to produce more wealth.

365
00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:51.120
Mark's makes a big point of this wealth commodity wealth WOC w and sees this as,

366
00:27:56.950 --> 00:28:01.250
<v 1>um,
as
pathological</v>

367
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:05.130
<v 0>as a distortion of human values.</v>

368
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:09.030
And we'll talk through Mark's,
uh,
in,
uh,

369
00:28:09.031 --> 00:28:10.470
about a week or 10 days.

370
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:15.480
Uh,
the great man,

371
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:20.730
how many of you have read as many as 10 pages of Marx's writing?

372
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.840
Okay.
Where do we read Mark's at Yale these days?

373
00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:27.170
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

374
00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:29.930
<v 0>Philosophy department.
Where else?</v>

375
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:34.430
Directed Studies and what is directed studies.
Read Marx.

376
00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:38.520
Communist manifesto.
That's great.

377
00:28:38.521 --> 00:28:41.910
You're well prepared for this class because we're going to read it next week.

378
00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:43.483
<v 1>MMM.</v>

379
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:48.950
<v 0>What would you say of marks as a writer?
First of all,
he wrote in German,</v>

380
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:52.063
<v 1>but</v>

381
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:55.600
<v 0>who's got an editorial opinion about Marx's riding?</v>

382
00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:02.340
Yes.
You got to shout without the mic.
Very talented,

383
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:07.980
very talented writer.
Uh,
I agree.
A very smart guy.

384
00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.113
<v 1>MMM.</v>

385
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:13.620
<v 0>If you were marking up marking of Mark's term paper up,</v>

386
00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:15.930
what would you find fault with

387
00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:25.190
very windy and a little overwrought,

388
00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:27.800
right?
I mean,

389
00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:32.260
he really wants to hit you in the face five times with each thought.
Um,

390
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:37.640
but what we'll discover is interesting is that Mark's,

391
00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.680
Mark's,
uh,

392
00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:44.710
in the manifesto and Engels look at capitalism in a way,

393
00:29:44.711 --> 00:29:47.380
very similar to the way we look at it today.

394
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:52.450
And they did,
they emphasize itch,

395
00:29:52.451 --> 00:29:54.190
enormous productive capacity.

396
00:29:55.180 --> 00:30:00.040
And they also emphasize that it is always on the edge of being out of control.

397
00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:03.453
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

398
00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:08.490
<v 0>Capitalism as a word comes into the English language in the middle of the 18</v>

399
00:30:08.861 --> 00:30:13.540
hundreds.
And it comes in because of Mark's and people like Marx,

400
00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:14.830
uh,

401
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:19.830
it is a pejorative use to attack the existing economic system.

402
00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:26.670
Capitalism is seen not as a highly productive system,

403
00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:32.150
but as an unjust system.
Uh,
and,

404
00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:35.500
and it's criticized in other ways,
which I'll tick off in a moment.

405
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.740
Anybody recognize this fellow?
Yes,

406
00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:42.820
it's JP Morgan.
And,
uh,

407
00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.990
does anybody know who took this photograph?
That's a little hard.

408
00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:52.210
Steichen and it's a very famous photograph.
What's famous about it?
What does,

409
00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.350
what,
what's striking about this image?

410
00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:58.943
<v 1>Great.</v>

411
00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:05.090
<v 0>Does he look friendly,
warm and fuzzy?
No.</v>

412
00:31:05.091 --> 00:31:09.140
And he wasn't,
I mean,
this,
this was a very hard edge guy.
Uh,

413
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:12.170
and what seems to be in his left hand,

414
00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:19.730
it is a chair.
It is the arm of a chair.
Uh,
but the reflection,

415
00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:23.420
uh,
makes it look like he's holding a dagger.

416
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:29.870
And it was no accident.
Uh,
[inaudible] was not a fan.

417
00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:33.230
Um,
and this has been used.

418
00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:39.020
Photographs been used thousands of times in a polemical way.

419
00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:44.800
Okay.
Capitalism as seen in the 19th century,

420
00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:50.310
a disease for which site?
Scientific Socialism,
that's Marx's term for Marx,

421
00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:53.020
uh,
is the cure.
Of course,

422
00:31:53.021 --> 00:31:58.021
there were 20 or 30 other brands of socialism that Mark's regarded as

423
00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:01.930
unscientific.
Uh,

424
00:32:01.931 --> 00:32:06.931
it is a method by which to steal the Labor of labor from the exploited masters.

425
00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:13.290
And the reasoning which we'll review in 10 days time is that capital can never

426
00:32:16.571 --> 00:32:21.571
make money except by using either labor now or the accumulated fruit of labor

427
00:32:23.561 --> 00:32:27.550
from the past.
And if capital ends up with a profit,

428
00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:32.850
that profit must be extracted from either living or fossilized labor.

429
00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.100
Uh,
this is not a thought which I share.

430
00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:45.750
It is a system which undermines traditional society in all its forms and

431
00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:50.100
undermines traditional skill sets.
And that's a perfectly true statement.

432
00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:53.730
And when it happens,
it is very coercive.

433
00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.900
It is indeed a trademark of the way capitalism works.

434
00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:03.650
That a skillset which was a competitive and AU courant in 1980,

435
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:08.640
uh,
may not command,
uh,

436
00:33:08.641 --> 00:33:11.730
as much as the minimum wage in 2009.

437
00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:20.340
And this is the kicker for Marx is the claim that capitalism inevitably will

438
00:33:21.731 --> 00:33:23.260
destroy itself.

439
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:27.640
It will undermine its own foundations and ultimately disappeared.

440
00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:31.340
Uh,
we will evaluate that

441
00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.273
<v 1>view.</v>

442
00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:35.823
<v 0>Oh,
am I,</v>

443
00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:41.360
this slide is cut off all the cut off the main part of the,
of what's here.

444
00:33:41.361 --> 00:33:42.830
So I'll have to remember it for you.

445
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:48.990
A capitalism is the name given to an economic system by its enemies.

446
00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:55.090
So 0.1 by its enemies point to a system which relies heavily on the private use

447
00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:00.283
of capital,

448
00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:05.890
heavily on the private use of capital combined with uh,

449
00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:11.540
the profit motive founded on self interest or family interest

450
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:18.250
so that there are hundreds of variations on the capitalist system,

451
00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:26.830
but the essentials are private deployment of capital,

452
00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:29.300
uh,

453
00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:34.300
open acknowledgement of profit as a motive and,

454
00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:38.960
uh,
a sympathetic understanding of cell for household interest.

455
00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:41.050
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

456
00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:46.050
<v 0>Another frequent part of the package is a tolerance for innovation.</v>

457
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
And one of the characteristic facts about historical society is a resistance to

458
00:34:56.051 --> 00:35:00.640
innovation.
And the temptation to resist change is always there.

459
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:06.220
It is absolutely always there.
And as people grow older,

460
00:35:06.221 --> 00:35:11.221
they grow more set in their ways and expect expectations and less tolerant of

461
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:18.260
fresh innovation.
Okay,
this course.

462
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:20.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

463
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:24.030
<v 0>Uh,
we're going to start with some excerpts from the wealth of nations.</v>

464
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:28.710
It is available on classes vitu posted under resources.

465
00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:34.690
How many of you have read at least at least a chapter of wealth of nations.

466
00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:41.610
Okay.
The of you are in for a treat.
Uh,
Smith is not only a great writer,

467
00:35:41.611 --> 00:35:42.660
but a great thinker.

468
00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:48.570
A He is a much more complex thinker than we usually imagine him to be.

469
00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:54.350
He was not a believer that it's just fine for the port of starve in the screech.

470
00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:03.840
Yet actually very complicated views about that which are broadly analogous to a

471
00:36:03.841 --> 00:36:04.351
philosopher,

472
00:36:04.351 --> 00:36:09.351
John Rawls and Rawls has difference principle about what inequalities are

473
00:36:10.321 --> 00:36:10.951
justified,

474
00:36:10.951 --> 00:36:15.951
namely those which redound ultimately in some way to the benefit of the least

475
00:36:16.411 --> 00:36:20.580
favored a Sh,
a straight up in an economy.

476
00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:25.650
Uh,
the manifesto already mentioned.
Um,

477
00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:31.330
and in both cases we'll,
um,
we'll leave be valid.
Good bit.

478
00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:33.660
A Smith is a very long book.

479
00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.860
I recommend to you the Bantam Paperback,

480
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:41.870
$7 and 95 cents of Smith because it has wonderful little,

481
00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:47.430
um,
summaries of each paragraph in Italics,

482
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.460
uh,
which allows speed reading,

483
00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:56.690
which is actually a very useful thing when a book would take a week to plow

484
00:36:56.911 --> 00:36:59.730
through in a careful,
careful reading.

485
00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.940
And we'll focus on just three or four points there,

486
00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:04.950
three or four arguments and Smith.

487
00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:09.780
But they are a really powerful and important arguments.
Uh,

488
00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:14.810
the Constitution of liberty is by FAA Hayak and we'll just read two chapters.

489
00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.720
There'll be in a packet which you'll get.
Um,

490
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:23.420
and high tech is the arch conservative,

491
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:25.950
the market conservative,
uh,

492
00:37:25.951 --> 00:37:30.330
from whom most of the conservative movement,

493
00:37:30.331 --> 00:37:32.220
not concerned with social authority,

494
00:37:32.221 --> 00:37:37.221
but the libertarian side of American conservatism relies primarily on high tech,

495
00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:45.150
actually
a farewell to alms.
Um,

496
00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:48.510
this book,
uh,

497
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:53.550
by a guy named Gregory Clark is a book which says capitalism more and better

498
00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:57.843
pour it on.

499
00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:02.920
And as capitalism is in increases its reach,

500
00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.350
the world will grow wealthier and better.

501
00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:11.050
It is a polemical work written by an economist,
uh,

502
00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:15.070
and you'll find things to argue with even if you more or less agree with him,

503
00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.610
you'll find many things to argue with him about.

504
00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:22.720
And that will be an important book in the course.
Uh,

505
00:38:22.721 --> 00:38:23.980
the mystery of capital,

506
00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:28.530
uh,

507
00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:33.530
by Hernando de Soto is an argument about why the less developed in the world are

508
00:38:35.801 --> 00:38:36.634
less developed.

509
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:42.390
And the gist of it is that formal and enforceable property rights are a

510
00:38:44.141 --> 00:38:48.340
precondition to capital development and it's a,

511
00:38:48.341 --> 00:38:51.880
it's a very powerful piece of work.

512
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:59.050
Richard Posner,
a failure of capitalism,

513
00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.930
a Posner,
anybody new who Posner is.

514
00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.273
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

515
00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:05.840
<v 0>Tell us loud and clear.</v>

516
00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:10.730
He's a judge and he's a judge of what persuasion would you say?

517
00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.890
He's a very conservative judge,
uh,

518
00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:19.430
teaches at the University of Chicago Law School and he has written a very

519
00:39:19.431 --> 00:39:24.050
penetrating analysis of the current crisis.
Uh,
it is,

520
00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:29.120
I read maybe 20 books to pick one on this subject and uh,

521
00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:33.920
this is the clearest and most honest I think.

522
00:39:33.921 --> 00:39:38.690
And he doesn't,
he does no ideological distortion here that I can detect.

523
00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:44.260
It is just a penetrating and straightforward analysis of what happened.

524
00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:50.150
And um,
for that reason very useful.
Uh,
the bottom billion

525
00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:56.920
by Paul Collier who is a World Bank economist who teaches at Oxford and,

526
00:39:58.970 --> 00:39:59.330
uh,

527
00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:04.330
in this maps out a diagnosis and a strategy for using market mechanisms and

528
00:40:06.801 --> 00:40:11.801
capital capital development to alleviate most of the world's poverty.

529
00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:15.813
<v 1>Finally,</v>

530
00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:20.940
<v 0>the white tiger.
This is fiction,</v>

531
00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:27.500
but there are times when fiction is better at describing the real world than

532
00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:28.763
nonfiction.

533
00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:34.230
And this is a brutally a penetrating novels,

534
00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:37.530
uh,
written from the point of view of a very poor,

535
00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:41.370
very smart,
uh,

536
00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:46.110
and in many ways flawed young man in south India.

537
00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:51.450
It won the man Booker Prize last year for uh,
fiction.

538
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:55.710
Uh,
it is,
uh,
for our age,

539
00:40:55.740 --> 00:41:00.090
it is as good as dickens and Zola,
uh,

540
00:41:00.091 --> 00:41:04.080
were for the 19th century.
It's a just a brilliant book.
I couldn't put it down.

541
00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.990
Um,
and I tend,

542
00:41:06.991 --> 00:41:10.320
people told me I had to read it and I kept shrugging my shoulders.

543
00:41:10.321 --> 00:41:14.440
Then when I started,
I read it front to back,
uh,

544
00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.630
in one long day.

545
00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:21.500
And it is if you want to understand why there are a billion or 2 billion people

546
00:41:24.661 --> 00:41:29.270
out there for whom capitalism looks not like,
uh,

547
00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:31.830
a powerful mechanism of production,

548
00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:36.710
but like extremely coercive system,
uh,

549
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:41.300
the white tiger is a great way to do that.

550
00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:46.980
Uh,
and Chris Buckley's thank you for smoking is optional.
Uh,

551
00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:51.650
we will also use the case method and the case method occupies,

552
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:57.250
occupies about a third of the course and we will use the ones in in white are

553
00:42:00.171 --> 00:42:03.590
straightforward cases,
the ones in gold,

554
00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:07.400
we'll have the people in the room or some of the people.

555
00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:09.033
Um,

556
00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:13.790
Polaroid is the story of,
uh,

557
00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:18.820
the land camera and a brilliant technology which ultimately crashed and burned.

558
00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:25.930
And it's the case is a Harvard business school case about the attempt to get

559
00:42:26.181 --> 00:42:27.490
that business,
uh,

560
00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:31.580
through its crisis at the time that it went broke.

561
00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:36.500
Goldman Sachs Ipo a terrifically it's a,

562
00:42:36.501 --> 00:42:41.480
it's a good HBS case and better yet we'll have paolos and only with us,

563
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.770
uh,

564
00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:47.770
to tell the story from the inside of the Goldman Goldman system.

565
00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:53.570
Uh,
wanting to wrap a chin ski is a story of,
uh,

566
00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:58.600
getting a business going in Poland just after the death of communism,

567
00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:03.910
a Yale trained business woman who,
um,

568
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:06.360
created something called [inaudible],

569
00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:11.410
which is the largest publishing company in East Europe and how she coped with

570
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:17.870
the toxic environment,
that toxic business environment,

571
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:21.230
a leftover by communism.
Um,

572
00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:26.430
Selco India is a micro finance story.
Um,

573
00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:32.590
cardiothoracic systems is a tech story and I'm going to have the dean of som

574
00:43:33.021 --> 00:43:37.790
come and do it as a business case with you,

575
00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.980
which means you're going to need to wear helmets.

576
00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:46.040
She is an aggressive cold call and oh,

577
00:43:46.041 --> 00:43:49.340
by the way,
I'm going to make two kinds of calls in this course,

578
00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:53.420
cold calls or the kind of thing I did today where that where you get no warning,

579
00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:55.670
uh,
and warm calls.

580
00:43:55.671 --> 00:43:59.450
I'll send you an email and say heads up about,

581
00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:01.390
and um,

582
00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:08.390
in the second case you really ought to have something to say.
Um,
and uh,
they'll,

583
00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:09.653
they're there.

584
00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:14.840
There's some of the fun in this stuff is the back and forth between you and me

585
00:44:14.841 --> 00:44:19.490
and you and you,
um,
the Enron case,

586
00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:24.140
uh,
Jim Alexander is an important guy in this course.
Jim,

587
00:44:24.141 --> 00:44:28.250
would you just stand up and wave?
Uh,
Jim was,

588
00:44:28.251 --> 00:44:31.840
Jim is a good friend of mine,
um,

589
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:35.760
who had a career in investment banking,
uh,

590
00:44:35.761 --> 00:44:40.761
and then at Enron and he was chief financial officer of Enron global pipeline

591
00:44:41.821 --> 00:44:42.654
and power.

592
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:46.860
And he saw what was happening and got out.

593
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:48.900
Um,

594
00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:53.900
he is referred to as the fly in the ointment in smartest guys in the room,

595
00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:59.790
which is,
uh,
the popularized story of Enron's crash.

596
00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:05.520
Uh,
he then went on and,
uh,
cofounded spinnaker exploration,

597
00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:10.260
who's operating principle was,
think what Enron would do and do the other.

598
00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:16.050
And,
uh,
spinnaker,
uh,
became a public company,

599
00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:19.890
uh,
and was extremely successful.

600
00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:21.930
A medley global advisors.

601
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:25.770
This is a case about gathering business intelligence and selling it for large

602
00:45:25.771 --> 00:45:28.260
price.
High prices,
excuse my voice.

603
00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:31.710
A medley is another Yale trained person.
Uh,

604
00:45:31.711 --> 00:45:36.711
he founded the company and the case is about his attempt to sell the company,

605
00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:39.180
which he did.

606
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:44.870
So he's selling a company that for which is eponymously his and,

607
00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:50.430
uh,
uh,
walking away,
he actually sold it for 57 million bucks,

608
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:54.750
and it's a no mentally medleys story and it's,

609
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:57.530
he's a very interesting guy.
Uh,

610
00:45:57.570 --> 00:46:00.720
and then maybe we'll talk about Maurice.

611
00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:06.090
I am chair of the workout committee,
which is trying to put more,

612
00:46:06.091 --> 00:46:10.410
he's back in business and it turns out to be a really interesting hard task.
