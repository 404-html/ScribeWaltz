1
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:12.030
[inaudible].

2
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.480
<v 1>Okay,
good afternoon.</v>

3
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.503
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.610
<v 1>Good.
The Labor Day afternoon.</v>

5
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.670
We're not for this.
Where would you be today?

6
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.580
There's a good twi night double header at Yankee Stadium.

7
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.083
<v 0>Where would you be?</v>

8
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.943
All right.

9
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.310
<v 1>It does seem strange that Labor Day comes in the second week of classes.</v>

10
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.230
Um,
we've got a lot to do today.

11
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.320
I'm going to try to cover the following topics.
First.

12
00:01:09.321 --> 00:01:14.321
We're going to look at the explosive change in the world economy,

13
00:01:15.231 --> 00:01:18.080
which is in mid stream.
Uh,

14
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.510
your handout is a snapshot of that.

15
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.060
Then we're going to look at heads up there.

16
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.300
There's a handout here,
folks who doesn't have the handout.

17
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.460
Okay?
They're the sources up near the door here on there.

18
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.203
<v 0>The,</v>

19
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.610
<v 1>so let's get the logistics out of the way.</v>

20
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.580
Okay?
Everybody has the handout.
Okay.

21
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:06.300
Let's begin organizing the,
uh,
the day's work.

22
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.770
I will love begin by taking the snapshot you have in front of you and then using

23
00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:18.921
the data animation on the board to give you a sense of the dynamic process,

24
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.160
which is hidden in the static diagram before you.

25
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.900
Our real interest is in the dynamic process.

26
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.730
And the statics are,
uh,

27
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.060
just like for example,

28
00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:39.630
a quote on the Dow Jones for two 32 in the afternoon.

29
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.280
It's a moving target and the motion is what's interesting.

30
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.700
So that's the first thing we're going to do.
Uh,

31
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.930
the second thing is to look at the dismal science of economics as conceived by

32
00:02:57.271 --> 00:02:58.440
Thomas Malthus,

33
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.080
whose principal work appeared in 1798 and 1800 and which put forward a theory to

34
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:13.051
the effect that nearly universal poverty was an essential and inevitable fact of

35
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:21.460
human existence.
Thank God he was wrong.

36
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.920
Third Wheel look at,
uh,

37
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.980
Gregory Clark's exploration of Malthus's world.

38
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.400
Clark is the author of farewell to arms,

39
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.600
which I hope all of you have begun to find your way through.

40
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:38.980
It's available at labyrinth.

41
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.660
A and Clark is something of a curmudgeon and he offers interpretations which,

42
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.810
uh,
should provoke argument.
For example,
uh,

43
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.980
he interprets,
uh,

44
00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.280
the demography of England in the Mall Fujian period before the great surge in

45
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:05.920
the economy,
in each essentially Darwinian terms,

46
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.480
Darwinian both with respect to,
uh,
culture.

47
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.030
Uh,
so social Darwinism but also with respect to biology.

48
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.400
Uh,
he,

49
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.520
he flirts with the idea that the children of the wealthy were genetically

50
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:28.360
superior,
uh,

51
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.960
two other children being born in early modern England and that that fact has

52
00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:40.561
something to do with why the Great Economic Serge took place first in England

53
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.840
actually more broadly the United Kingdom.
Finally,

54
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.390
and this is a long agenda.

55
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.570
Finally I'm going to look at economic biology and in particular at what is

56
00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:59.350
called the world demographic transition.

57
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.060
The world demographic transition takes,

58
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.900
it is it is as nearly regular as clockwork and it takes societies from poverty,

59
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.910
short lifespans,
high birth rates,
high death rates

60
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.470
to relative affluence combined with capital relative affluence with long lives,

61
00:05:28.091 --> 00:05:30.100
low birth rates,
low death rates,

62
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.090
and lurking behind the diagram before you is the confluence of the great

63
00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:42.340
economic surge and the world demographic transition.

64
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.810
So 45 minutes from now we should be at that point.

65
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.760
The Diagram on the board is the work of Swedish economist Hans Rosling and it is

66
00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.570
a data animation.
It's set up as follows,

67
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.320
a income per capita is on the horizontal dimension and that income per capita is

68
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:11.900
scaled logarithmically.
I'll switch that out in a minute,

69
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.540
but we'll start with the logarithmic scale.

70
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.470
And on the vertical dimension is a linear scale for life expectancy at birth.

71
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:27.650
And the bubbles represent countries.
The larger the bubble,

72
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:29.540
the greater the population of the country.

73
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.730
The bubbles are color coded,
uh,

74
00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:36.260
to the map upper right.

75
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.560
So all of the western hemisphere is shown in yellow,

76
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.220
uh,
Europe and north Asia in orange and so forth,

77
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.470
and notably sub Saharan Africa in blue.
Uh,

78
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:56.510
you will also find special interest in the green bubbles representing,

79
00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.540
uh,
the states of the Middle East.

80
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.100
Now let's just play this,
it,
is this a time series?

81
00:07:04.101 --> 00:07:06.680
It's 200 years of time series.

82
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.640
The bubbles start here in the year 18,
six

83
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.063
and begin moving.

84
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.363
Okay?

85
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:43.703
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

86
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.470
<v 1>Yes.
You're going to need a mic.
Let's hand it to you.</v>

87
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:50.563
<v 0>Okay.</v>

88
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.880
<v 1>Say it again.
Yeah.
They cast doubt on data.</v>

89
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:05.160
Uh,
what,
what while you're on stage here,
what,
what,
what'd you just say?

90
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.830
<v 0>Uh,
uh,</v>

91
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.490
<v 1>is he loud enough to hear in the back</v>

92
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.190
<v 0>great kind the entire time when there were a few,</v>

93
00:08:20.191 --> 00:08:23.770
a yellow balls or started overtaking all the other things around.

94
00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.670
And also there were a few that just kind of went up and down.

95
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:30.500
You know what the exact same income.
A prison for a long period of time.

96
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:31.270
Curtis Turner,

97
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.620
<v 1>some of them seem stuck.</v>

98
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:36.520
And was it mainly yellow balls or where there some orange balls out there?

99
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.920
<v 0>No,
no one's going up and down at wanting comfort.</v>

100
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:44.130
<v 1>No,
no.
In the ones that were in the lead.
Just a couple of,</v>

101
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.740
okay.
Now

102
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.280
hand the mic to somebody else.

103
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:54.110
We're just going to pass it around here and get people talking.
No,
no.

104
00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:54.953
Don't hand it on.

105
00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:57.423
<v 0>MMM.</v>

106
00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:04.440
<v 1>If you were going to describe to someone who wasn't here,
uh,</v>

107
00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.590
what the main pattern was taking into account the two variables,

108
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:10.563
<v 0>what would it be?</v>

109
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.291
<v 1>Okay.</v>

110
00:09:14.291 --> 00:09:19.000
Lower left to upper right and lower left upper right in,

111
00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.640
since they're not here,
they don't know what that means.

112
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:30.600
Okay.
So there is something by and large,

113
00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:33.960
good happening in the data.

114
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.430
Now there are,
uh,

115
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.720
let's pass it on to Yo Egypt tology here.
Um,

116
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:43.981
does the,

117
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:48.981
is the progress with respect to biology and wealth evenly distributed or not so

118
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:53.220
evenly distributed?

119
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:04.410
<v 0>Well,
they all
are</v>

120
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.950
still quite loud

121
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:15.210
<v 1>and when he actually go backward,
so mine,</v>

122
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:17.990
it's hard to ask you to remember all that with.

123
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.650
It's a rather complex basket ball game on the screen there.

124
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.233
<v 0>MMM.</v>

125
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.220
<v 1>Could we handed on what would you,</v>

126
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:33.040
if you were a god or Gods Accountant,

127
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:38.580
uh,
and you are God friendly to humankind.
Uh,

128
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.680
would you say by and large what you're seeing there?
Looks like

129
00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.220
the world getting better?

130
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.390
<v 0>Um,
I would say a general,</v>

131
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.470
but at the same time,

132
00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:55.460
the purple ones,

133
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.580
<v 1>I think they're blue.</v>

134
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.430
<v 0>We have,</v>

135
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.060
<v 1>oh yeah.
Yes.</v>

136
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.670
<v 0>Compared to the other countries,</v>

137
00:11:08.671 --> 00:11:13.671
even though overall shift to or the upper right hand corner.

138
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.340
Um,
but it wasn't it.

139
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.960
<v 1>Okay.
Terrific.
Pass the Mike Straight back please.</v>

140
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.793
<v 0>MMM.</v>

141
00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:31.390
<v 1>Do the dots or the bubbles show all the inequality involved with all the people</v>

142
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:38.780
in the world or do they mask something?
Let's take for example,
the,

143
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:40.830
the enormous upswing.

144
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:51.630
Look at the a very large light blue bubbles center stage.

145
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.430
It represents India.
Uh,

146
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:02.000
and as far as we can tell from this graph,
uh,

147
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:07.030
everybody has the same income and probably works for Wipro in Bangalore,

148
00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:14.000
but in actual fact,
I dunno,
do you know anything about India?

149
00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:41.783
<v 0>Uh,</v>

150
00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:49.010
<v 1>okay,
good.</v>

151
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:54.780
Now we could infer from that that the vertical side,

152
00:12:55.211 --> 00:13:00.211
the vertical dimension of the world economy can be thought of in two phases.

153
00:13:00.281 --> 00:13:05.281
One is the difference between countries measured here by mean GDP per capita and

154
00:13:09.131 --> 00:13:14.131
the differences within countries which would be represented by an income curve

155
00:13:14.441 --> 00:13:18.070
or a wealth curve,
uh,
within each of the countries.

156
00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.260
And it turns out that there's quite a lot of inequality inside the bubbles,

157
00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:24.911
uh,
and that,

158
00:13:24.911 --> 00:13:29.911
that inequality is most pronounced in the countries which are in the early

159
00:13:32.921 --> 00:13:37.630
stages of getting rich.
The general pattern.

160
00:13:37.631 --> 00:13:41.320
India is a good example and the fiction work assigned for,

161
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:42.670
for the course,

162
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:48.570
a white tiger is about that vertical dimension and how exhilarating it is on the

163
00:13:52.811 --> 00:13:57.811
one hand and the crushing disadvantage it imposes on people who aren't part of

164
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:04.600
the capitalist development story.
Okay.

165
00:14:04.601 --> 00:14:08.140
Now I want to change the diagram to get a little more

166
00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:14.490
little more finesse here and now I have made the uh,

167
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:19.670
the income curve linear so it no longer exaggerates movement at the low end of

168
00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:27.130
the scale.
And what I'd like you to do is watch this process

169
00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:31.570
and tell me what you think you're seeing.

170
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.250
These are the same data just projected differently.

171
00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:46.023
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

172
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.470
<v 1>Watch for some shooters.</v>

173
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.710
No.
Let me do the last half of that projection once more

174
00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:10.830
and then we'll try to talk about it.

175
00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:13.800
Could we get a mic up and going in that section please?

176
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.473
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

177
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:21.350
<v 1>Okay.
We're going to play from,
let's go around 1900 here.</v>

178
00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:36.953
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

179
00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.080
<v 1>Okay.
So over here,</v>

180
00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:49.420
<v 0>who's got the mic?</v>

181
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:57.020
<v 1>Can you describe the path that the vast majority of the countries follow?</v>

182
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:05.383
<v 0>Okay.</v>

183
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.530
<v 1>Okay.
So what,</v>

184
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:14.710
what's just been said is that the majority of the countries show modest gains in

185
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:22.240
income per capita and substantial gains in longevity.

186
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:28.450
So they move vertically more or less vertically and then they pass second base,

187
00:16:30.141 --> 00:16:33.620
so to speak and turn right

188
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.700
across the income field.
Let's run it once more

189
00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.780
and I'm going to ask it.
Pass the mic please.

190
00:16:41.781 --> 00:16:43.670
I'm going to ask the next person to take a shot

191
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.513
<v 0>at</v>

192
00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:50.620
<v 1>what countries are the shooters,
which defy what I just said.</v>

193
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.793
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

194
00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:18.480
Who's got the mic?
Who Do you think those shooters are?

195
00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.950
Europe and Middle East.

196
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:29.930
<v 1>Okay,
well is there,
what are the,
how would you go about</v>

197
00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:37.060
getting huge gains in income per capita without going through the prior step of

198
00:17:39.831 --> 00:17:43.270
having people live quite a while.
How would you get what?

199
00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.140
What might make that feasible?

200
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:49.930
<v 0>Especially for the green?
You need me to give her half.</v>

201
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:55.290
<v 1>Okay.
What don't hold us in suspense.</v>

202
00:17:55.291 --> 00:17:58.980
The green countries might have a lot of oil.

203
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:04.410
Okay,
so the oil states,
if you bracket the oil states,

204
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:08.880
you've got a very general worldwide pattern.

205
00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:17.380
Modest gains in income combined with substantial gains in public health,

206
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:24.010
followed by continued gains in public health though at a decreasing rate

207
00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:29.930
combined with large gains in income per capita.

208
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:35.320
Now notice that the point made,

209
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:38.060
made five minutes ago still holds.

210
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.720
When I say that a GDP per capita of a country doubled in a period,

211
00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:50.450
does it mean that the GDP of most people in that country doubled?

212
00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.350
And,
and the answer to that,
can we get the mic to center?

213
00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:56.490
<v 0>Okay.</v>

214
00:18:56.490 --> 00:19:00.750
<v 1>Well,
let's see.
I'm sorry.
Where's the mic here?
There we go.
Yup,
go ahead.</v>

215
00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:02.290
<v 0>Not necessarily</v>

216
00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.430
the country itself.

217
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:10.110
<v 1>Okay.
And let's think of the oil states for a minute.</v>

218
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:12.150
Uh,

219
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:17.150
what generally happens to the vast share of the large large shares of revenue

220
00:19:20.491 --> 00:19:25.491
from oil extraction in the middle decades of the 20th century,

221
00:19:26.161 --> 00:19:27.420
which is what we're talking about

222
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:32.993
<v 0>individuals.</v>

223
00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:34.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

224
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:39.370
They either remain in the hands of a local elite for the most part or they are

225
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:45.440
siphoned off by a large international energy company,

226
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:51.400
but the vast majority of people in such a society often don't benefit very much

227
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:58.130
from that.
And that becomes a huge issue,
uh,

228
00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:02.660
in world politics and in attitudes toward capitalism.

229
00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:08.540
Okay.
Uh,
the URL of this data,

230
00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:13.120
and I've,
I've explored here less than 1% of its potential,
uh,

231
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:18.050
is dubdubdub gap minder,
one word,
small letters.org.

232
00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:20.260
Not Com.
Uh,

233
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:25.490
and it is a resource I would like you to use in the background for this course.

234
00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.550
Just out of curiosity,
how many of you had used it before?

235
00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.250
<v 0>Okay.</v>

236
00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:34.440
<v 1>Okay.
The rest of you should join in.
This is,
uh,
this is,
uh,</v>

237
00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:39.690
the most useful technique for staying awake while thinking about numbers,

238
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:46.330
uh,
late at night that I have ever seen it.

239
00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.980
I showed to grandchildren ranging down to four and they all love it.

240
00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.293
All right.

241
00:20:55.090 --> 00:21:00.090
Now this is the diagram that Clark presents at the beginning of his book.

242
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:04.150
Uh,
it's taken from Angus Maddison,

243
00:21:04.151 --> 00:21:09.151
spelled with two ds who is the lead researcher on everything before 1800 and

244
00:21:11.801 --> 00:21:15.880
economic history these days.
Uh,
and literally every,

245
00:21:15.881 --> 00:21:20.881
if there perhaps 50 bucks a touch on this material and every one of them is

246
00:21:20.891 --> 00:21:25.210
Madison reformulated,
re sliced.
Uh,

247
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.240
these are the four things I told you we were going to do.
We've done one of them.

248
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:33.850
Uh,
Balsa and Clark refer to the left side before,

249
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:37.010
uh,
the great surge,
uh,

250
00:21:37.011 --> 00:21:42.011
and the biology part about the world's demographic transition concerns the

251
00:21:42.101 --> 00:21:45.220
movement across from left to right,

252
00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.310
which stands behind these changes.

253
00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:56.740
Okay.
Now I'm also shouldn't the logic of perpetual poverty poverty,
uh,

254
00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:01.870
Thomas Malthus was a Cambridge wrangler.

255
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:08.510
That meaning he was at the very top of the student body at Cambridge.

256
00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.400
He was a fellow of Jesus College.

257
00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:19.370
He was a devout Christian.
Uh,

258
00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:24.460
and he was a follower of David Ricardo and David Hume.

259
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:30.460
He was an empiricist,
uh,

260
00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.510
he looked at the world around him

261
00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:39.490
and devised a simple model and Clark makes it a good bit more complicated then

262
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.750
Malta stodge.
Uh,

263
00:22:44.751 --> 00:22:49.190
and the reason for that is at Clark wants to make it look like contemporary

264
00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.233
economics.

265
00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:55.930
And the actual equilibrium story is very different from the equilibrium story in

266
00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:02.230
a micro economics 101.
Okay.

267
00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:03.353
<v 0>The</v>

268
00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:11.880
<v 1>influence of David Ricardo,
there were three great classical economist,</v>

269
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.720
Adam Smith,
whom we're going to study on Wednesday,
David Ricardo,

270
00:23:15.721 --> 00:23:18.620
whom we're not going to study.
And Karl Marx who were,

271
00:23:18.621 --> 00:23:23.010
who were going to study in a week,
the

272
00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:29.570
contribution of Ricardo to Maul fuss was that Ricardo had devised what he called

273
00:23:32.281 --> 00:23:33.990
the iron law of real wages.

274
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:40.400
And the gist of that was that no matter what the technology,

275
00:23:43.441 --> 00:23:45.120
no matter what the demographics,

276
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.670
the inflation adjusted wages,

277
00:23:49.671 --> 00:23:54.671
play paid to unskilled Labor would always tend toward the bottom of the scale

278
00:23:57.891 --> 00:24:02.891
we've been looking at would always tend toward the level of mere survival or

279
00:24:03.081 --> 00:24:04.970
subsistence as they say.

280
00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:11.560
And in the back of Malthus's thinking is both Ricardo's iron law and the

281
00:24:16.641 --> 00:24:21.640
empirics of 200 years of stagnant wages,
uh,

282
00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:24.680
which the English working class had experienced.

283
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:27.150
So Ricardo,

284
00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:35.740
Ricardo's main intuition had to do with two forms of earth arithmetic

285
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.700
progression on the left,

286
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:45.970
counting by hundreds from 100 to a thousand in the production of goods in the

287
00:24:49.011 --> 00:24:53.810
center,
counting by doubling at each cycle,

288
00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.920
the population of the same society.

289
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.640
And on the right hand side,

290
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:07.040
product pork per capita,
uh,
Duh.

291
00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:11.630
The arrived obviously enough by dividing the one by the other.

292
00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:16.190
And let's say the subsistence point is half a bucket per person.

293
00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:23.050
You then this was maltose as big point that everything progresses until you get

294
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:30.190
to the point where people begin to fall below subsistence level and with a very

295
00:25:33.291 --> 00:25:36.540
unequal distribution of income,
which was,
uh,

296
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:43.090
inevitable in this period as it is inevitable in the present period or nearly.

297
00:25:43.941 --> 00:25:48.920
So,
uh,
you would find a solution.
Well,

298
00:25:48.921 --> 00:25:53.000
what would be the solutions?
There are two main kinds of solutions.
One,

299
00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:55.430
let's generate a lot more production.

300
00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:00.950
Let's get the scale of production to not be a linear flat line,

301
00:26:00.951 --> 00:26:05.690
but get it to do this,
get production to go north,

302
00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.660
uh,
in the same way population does.

303
00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:13.910
And Malthus asserted that that couldn't be done.
Now we'll see.

304
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:17.450
And we know in our own experience that he was mistaken

305
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:23.950
production has done exactly that through the introduction of capital intensive

306
00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.140
production.
The,

307
00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:33.670
the pessimism in this scenario can be linked to a correct intuition about,

308
00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:44.970
uh,
England or any other agricultural,
uh,

309
00:26:44.971 --> 00:26:48.630
in the period from let's say 1200 to 1800.

310
00:26:48.631 --> 00:26:50.130
That's a period Clark chooses.

311
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:54.390
The first thing that is,

312
00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:59.880
that strikes you about this is they're not making land anymore.

313
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:01.710
Only the Dutch make new land.

314
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:08.480
And so you're going to deal with a fixed total of arable land.

315
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.690
And you have,

316
00:27:12.691 --> 00:27:17.040
and let's assume that you have a growing population.

317
00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:20.760
The landmass is static,
the population is growing.

318
00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:23.750
Let's just assume that for the moment.
Uh,

319
00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:27.120
and it's just an assume it's growing in a mall.
Fujian way.

320
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:29.640
And let's imagine this,

321
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:34.700
this is a actually a photograph of Berry pickers in Poland in the year 19 nine.

322
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:41.160
Uh,
all the visual images here are virtually all the visual images here come from

323
00:27:41.161 --> 00:27:44.670
Wikipedia common.
And since we're being filmed,

324
00:27:44.671 --> 00:27:49.671
that's important so that we don't violate anyone's copyright because everything

325
00:27:49.891 --> 00:27:52.770
on Wikipedia common is public domain.

326
00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.473
<v 0>MMM.</v>

327
00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.440
<v 1>And we get seventies,
a little hard to read,
isn't it?</v>

328
00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.170
We get land acre,

329
00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:11.860
we've got a hundred units of land for this berry farm and production increases

330
00:28:13.641 --> 00:28:17.940
as we increased the number of workers from one to 12.
Uh,

331
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:22.990
it starts at 50 with one worker and ends up at 174 bushels or buckets,

332
00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:26.420
uh,
with 12.
So

333
00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:31.520
since the land is fixed,

334
00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:37.150
the marginal impact of each new worker is a little less than the marginal impact

335
00:28:37.941 --> 00:28:38.960
of the worker before.

336
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:45.310
And the blue series a boils it down to a bushels per worker and we have

337
00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:52.370
<v 0>cut uh,</v>

338
00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:57.640
<v 1>50 bushels to 15 bushels by going from one worker to 12 workers,</v>

339
00:28:57.651 --> 00:28:59.720
one.
Now this is all just made up stuff,

340
00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:03.350
but it captures the intuition

341
00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:06.760
<v 0>about,
about</v>

342
00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:11.820
<v 1>diminishing returns to intensification of labor and the constants in this story.</v>

343
00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:18.670
Our land and capital,
we're not adding new new land,

344
00:29:18.671 --> 00:29:19.990
we're not adding new capitol,

345
00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:23.890
we're just adding new workers to an existing quantity of land.

346
00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.473
So

347
00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.300
<v 0>the,
the</v>

348
00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:38.380
<v 1>intuition that guided guided Malthus was that as you intensified labor,</v>

349
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.890
you've got diminishing total returns.
The Red Arc,

350
00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:49.870
which implied by perfectly simple logic,

351
00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:54.310
a diminishing rate of production for each worker.

352
00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:00.600
And that intuition is really along that along with the iron law of wages is at

353
00:30:00.761 --> 00:30:05.761
the middle of [inaudible] thinking on the cultural and who here went to a high

354
00:30:06.461 --> 00:30:11.080
school where you learned Latin?
Ready for this one?

355
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:13.930
We got,
if we got a mic,
where's the mic for him?

356
00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:25.520
Okay.
If none loses no other acquirers.

357
00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.870
Yeah.
So the,

358
00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:33.920
and this was Saint Thomas and Saint Thomas was expressing,

359
00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:35.030
uh,

360
00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:40.030
the core conviction of classical Greece though not Rome,

361
00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.910
classical Greece and uh,

362
00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:49.210
Christianity in the Middle Ages and early modern times

363
00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.353
<v 0>and</v>

364
00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:57.080
<v 1>all the scruples,
all the rules about usury being not okay.</v>

365
00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:01.880
That is lending it interest being,
uh,
a violate,
a biblical violation.

366
00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:04.460
All those ideas come from this,

367
00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:10.180
that the total wealth produced by and for mankind,

368
00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:12.043
humankind.

369
00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:14.960
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

370
00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:19.960
<v 1>Buy In for humankind is essentially a fixed quantity so that as I get rich,</v>

371
00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:26.990
the act of getting rich imposes relative poverty on others.

372
00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:31.820
In schematic form,
we have a two person,

373
00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:37.670
two person society and going away from the origin means getting richer.

374
00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:43.810
The budget plane is a 45 degree angle where x plus y equals a constant some.

375
00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.470
So that movements of getting rich

376
00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:58.360
in either direction along that budget plane imply making others poor.

377
00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:03.880
And this was a deeply held assumption that the best educated and least educated,

378
00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:11.090
uh,
like shared.
And it accounts partly for the,

379
00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.970
the underlying trope and Malthus.

380
00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:19.310
And it tells us something about the brilliant originality of Adam Smith and his

381
00:32:19.311 --> 00:32:24.311
contemporaries in the Scottish enlightenment when they said not so.

382
00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:26.713
And

383
00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:31.430
if you represent the same thing with three,

384
00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.770
my artwork is a little limited.

385
00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.040
You have to imagine that these are three dimensions,

386
00:32:37.041 --> 00:32:41.240
like the two for me,
you and he,

387
00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:42.973
uh,

388
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:48.130
and that we've drawn that the budget constraint as a plane here.

389
00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:51.620
And then you have to imagine that the green.is on that plane.

390
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:56.820
Takes a little imagining.
I've stared at it a while.
Um,

391
00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:01.280
but the point is this,
that as you move the dot,

392
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:05.330
it's impossible to make any mo any movement,

393
00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:10.130
which doesn't disadvantage one of the three people or more

394
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:16.550
and za Za general assumption,

395
00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:20.900
more or less analogous to zero solemness in game theory.

396
00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:25.610
How many of you've done Ben pollocks course?
Okay?
Uh,

397
00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:30.440
more of us are now it goes to the zero sum theory or to the way a small children

398
00:33:30.441 --> 00:33:32.960
think about sharing Legos,
right?

399
00:33:32.961 --> 00:33:35.750
If I put more in my contraption,

400
00:33:35.751 --> 00:33:38.420
there are fewer for you to use in your contraption.

401
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:43.790
That is a fundamental assumption in this whole way of looking at the world.

402
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:47.480
And it corresponds to reality most of the time.

403
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:53.690
Most of the time in a,
a low capital,

404
00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.300
principally agricultural economy,

405
00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.870
the world act like this,

406
00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:04.390
new gold doesn't emerge.

407
00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:10.080
New ways of producing at much higher rate are invisible.

408
00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:15.340
And when we get to Mark's,
we'll see that he,

409
00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:20.440
he puts this rabbit in the hat by the way,

410
00:34:20.441 --> 00:34:24.640
he defines the value,
the exchange value and the use value of goods.

411
00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:29.530
He puts this zero sum condition in by the way.

412
00:34:29.531 --> 00:34:34.480
He measures labor and users Labor to define the value of everything.

413
00:34:35.410 --> 00:34:40.410
So that only by imposing surplus hours of work on the Labor on the working

414
00:34:40.901 --> 00:34:41.734
class,

415
00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:46.150
can we get Richard horsefeather's just not true.

416
00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:51.220
Uh,
but that's for another day.
Now,

417
00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:55.780
Clark's explorations,
excuse me here.

418
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.610
Yeah.
Clark,
who's had,
who's had an,
uh,

419
00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.370
an hour or more with Clark.

420
00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:11.160
It's a little worrying.
Um,
we've got a bike here.

421
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:19.230
Is it on?
Um,

422
00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:21.700
what do you think you like Clark or not liking

423
00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:29.670
convincing?
They did.
Okay.
He's convincing.

424
00:35:29.671 --> 00:35:33.900
He's clear.
He is empirical,
right?

425
00:35:33.901 --> 00:35:36.870
There's some kind of a chart or table for everything.

426
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:43.140
And uh,
he is opinionated.
He's,

427
00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:48.141
it's not the kind of cool dispassion that let's say Rick Levin might value in an

428
00:35:49.111 --> 00:35:53.350
economist.
It's a much more uh,

429
00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:57.900
heated style of argument.
I actually think he's sometimes a little off,

430
00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:01.320
but he's making the argument in a really interesting way.

431
00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:06.090
And one of the things he does is shown in this chart which is taken from I

432
00:36:06.091 --> 00:36:09.930
believe page 31 in his book.
Uh,

433
00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:15.150
and this is total population on the vertical dimension income per capita in the

434
00:36:15.151 --> 00:36:19.110
horizontal dimension.
The red dots represent,

435
00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:20.603
uh,

436
00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:26.190
estimates taken once every 10 years between 1200 and 1600.

437
00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:30.900
And they form an interesting pattern.
The interest,

438
00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:35.370
he combines this with something else.
So it's hard to find,
but if you combine it,

439
00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:39.090
it's almost as if there were a budget plane here

440
00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:45.120
and you can move up and down the budget plane but not through it.

441
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:50.370
So that the total,
it's,
it's this,

442
00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:55.020
these dots moving away that could be explained Malthus wise,

443
00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:56.550
uh,

444
00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:01.550
or Saint Augustine wise by assuming that there is a fixed total and use,

445
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:08.600
you can use it to feed more people worse or fewer people better.

446
00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:11.850
And indeed,

447
00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:16.880
if you pull out the data for the time of the great plague population goes down

448
00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:21.570
and per capita income goes up.

449
00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:26.930
Now how exact you think are records of incomes in England in 1380 are okay.

450
00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:36.240
It's,
it's,
it's a stretch to try and make this highly quantitative,

451
00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:40.970
but there it's probably not far off.
Uh,

452
00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:46.010
he then if you then add a 1600 to 1800,

453
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:52.880
you get something different and you begin to get a surgeon population that does

454
00:37:54.451 --> 00:37:57.750
not correspond to a huge loss in per capita income.

455
00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:03.590
So implicit in that is the idea that we are breaking through budget planes,

456
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:08.190
not in big ways,
not in elegant ways,

457
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:13.580
but there is something happening which takes us further and further from the

458
00:38:16.171 --> 00:38:19.740
central tenants of the Malthusian model.

459
00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:22.920
Uh,
this is,
uh,

460
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:27.300
Clark on real wages from 1200 on the left,

461
00:38:27.301 --> 00:38:32.301
1800 on the right and the spike in the middle is at least partly attributable to

462
00:38:34.411 --> 00:38:39.411
the influence of population decline in the century before it.

463
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.200
Uh,
and I've drawn it so it looks like a much bigger mountain than it is.

464
00:38:44.201 --> 00:38:48.820
It's actually a very gentle swale and you can find a version of it,

465
00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:52.300
no doubt,
more accurate than mine in Clark.

466
00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:58.770
The consumption patterns of ordinary workers in this period were very modest.

467
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:06.730
Uh,
food and drink accounted for three quarters of spending and I think this is

468
00:39:06.731 --> 00:39:11.620
pretty good.
Empirics
clothing and bedding,
10% housing,

469
00:39:11.621 --> 00:39:16.000
heating,
uh,
light and soap.
Not much.

470
00:39:16.001 --> 00:39:20.530
Life was a pretty dark,
pretty limited.

471
00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:26.220
The level of discretionary spending was a very slight,

472
00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:33.560
there's a general rule called angles law,
and it's,

473
00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.620
this is not the angles who worked with marks.

474
00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:41.100
This is Ernst angles lived in the 18 hundreds that as real incomes go up,

475
00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:44.590
the fraction spent on food goes down.

476
00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:48.580
And while that's not exactly a blinding insight,

477
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:53.980
it nonetheless as the advantage of being a true statement.
And,

478
00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:58.320
uh,
within food,
uh,

479
00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:02.260
the proteins principally meat to a lesser degree fish,

480
00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:03.693
uh,

481
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000
systematically displaced starches a until you get a two hour stage of gluttony.

482
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:16.023
<v 0>Uh,</v>

483
00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:20.450
<v 1>the most interesting piece in Clark is his handling of wealth and reproduction.</v>

484
00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:24.800
And I will,
um,

485
00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:29.510
ask you to read it for yourselves,
but the gist is this,

486
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:31.743
<v 0>that</v>

487
00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:40.050
<v 1>the number of surviving children produced by in each generation was greater</v>

488
00:40:43.361 --> 00:40:46.450
among wealthy families that among poor ones.

489
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:52.380
And it's pretty easy to think of reasons that might be true,

490
00:40:52.381 --> 00:40:54.200
for example,
uh,

491
00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:57.780
money for heating your house and feeding the babies.

492
00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.330
Uh,
but the,

493
00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:05.930
the point that Clark makes of that is more controversial.

494
00:41:07.261 --> 00:41:12.261
Clark wants to say that a cascade of children born at the top of the pyramid,

495
00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:19.640
a cascade of those children were forced to be downwardly mobile for a long

496
00:41:20.131 --> 00:41:21.060
period of time,

497
00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:26.390
populating each level of British society with adults who had a gun life with the

498
00:41:32.131 --> 00:41:33.680
advantages of being top.

499
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:39.400
And it's easy to make up a story which Clark does to the effect that the

500
00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:44.870
energetic effort you might expect from those people who had been pushed down

501
00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:50.210
might increase the intensity of effort and competition in the economy.

502
00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:51.913
He then,

503
00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:56.510
uh,

504
00:41:56.510 --> 00:42:01.510
makes a series of gestures toward biological Darwinism to the effect that

505
00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:09.760
Britain led the industrial revolution because it had a disproportionate number

506
00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:16.070
of very able people.

507
00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:20.270
And the assumption here is that the rich were more able than the poor.

508
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:22.370
Uh,

509
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:27.370
it had a disproportionate number of very able people in all the levels of the

510
00:42:29.031 --> 00:42:31.070
pyramid.
Now

511
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:35.030
the empirics on that one are really thin.

512
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:41.470
There's an awful lot of vapor in the intellectual process there.

513
00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:45.800
Uh,
but,
and this is characteristic of Clark.
He's really interesting,

514
00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:47.683
uh,

515
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:52.930
in throwing out thoughts that should provoke an argument and I should think you

516
00:42:53.271 --> 00:42:56.720
should be able to generate arguments among yourselves on that topic.

517
00:42:57.980 --> 00:42:59.570
Now,
biology gone good.

518
00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:06.380
And I'm going to tell this one in words and then give you the diagram.

519
00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:14.110
In every society in the Malthusian phase,

520
00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:19.490
life is short and babies are plentiful,

521
00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:25.840
so that a typical household might have eight or 10 children of whom perhaps

522
00:43:28.551 --> 00:43:33.320
three or four might survive into adulthood and having survived into adulthood,

523
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:38.570
many would die at your age or something like it,

524
00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:44.980
and the throughput of human beings was extremely fast.

525
00:43:46.461 --> 00:43:49.550
That's a way to think of it in relation to total population,

526
00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:55.460
then the death rate falls and when the death rate falls,

527
00:43:56.870 --> 00:44:01.370
the birth rate does not respond right away.
In fact,

528
00:44:01.371 --> 00:44:06.371
it takes several generations typically for birth rates to adjust to falling

529
00:44:06.591 --> 00:44:11.150
death rates.
The consequence of that,
there were several,

530
00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:12.470
but the most,

531
00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:17.830
the most fundamental for us is that the population of the world went north very

532
00:44:19.161 --> 00:44:19.994
rapidly.

533
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:26.270
You're having lots of babies and people are living long lives.
Uh,

534
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:31.040
then ultimately the birth rate does fall and when it,

535
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:36.030
we have both the birth rate and the death rate at low levels,

536
00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:42.320
so people live long lives and the population of their societies becomes more or

537
00:44:46.171 --> 00:44:50.850
less static.
Again,
it is then possible to go one step beyond that.

538
00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:56.660
And the one step beyond that is that the birth rate overtakes the death rate on

539
00:44:57.931 --> 00:45:02.931
the low side and the society begins to do two things at once to become smaller

540
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:08.370
and to have a higher and higher fraction of very old people.

541
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:13.440
And can anyone name a society that is in that stage?
Yes,

542
00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:17.010
Japan fine.
Uh,
Japan is there.

543
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.350
Russia is pretty much there.

544
00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:24.090
Much of Italy is right on the edge of that much of eastern Europe.

545
00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.460
Is there a now the picture,

546
00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:31.680
this is the population surge in every continent.
Uh,

547
00:45:31.681 --> 00:45:35.610
post the slides and I'll post them in a way that you can read them next time.

548
00:45:35.611 --> 00:45:40.380
I promise.
Um,
all the continents turned north,

549
00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:41.310
uh,

550
00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:46.310
beginning sometime after 1800 and that reflects the fact that they are in the

551
00:45:48.391 --> 00:45:50.940
progress of the demographic transition.

552
00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:55.640
Now this is a conventional,
uh,
representation,
uh,

553
00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:58.680
of the transition in four phases.

554
00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:04.190
In the first phase we have death and birth rates somewhat unstable but steadily

555
00:46:06.421 --> 00:46:10.260
high.
Then the death rate falls.

556
00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:15.690
The major cause is clean water,
clean water,

557
00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:20.160
uh,
household hygiene.
Uh,

558
00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:25.180
a little bit higher calorie diet.
Uh,

559
00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:27.660
and at the later stages,

560
00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:30.630
some aspects of modern medicine,

561
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:37.550
the birth rate doesn't adjust and phase two consists of the period when the

562
00:46:39.211 --> 00:46:43.620
death rate is falling fast and the birth rate remind remains more of us constant

563
00:46:43.621 --> 00:46:46.290
at a high level.
Then phase three,

564
00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:52.370
the birth rate is now stable at a relatively low level and the birth rate is

565
00:46:53.281 --> 00:46:54.720
falling to meet the death rate.

566
00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:59.940
And then in phase four you've got both of them at relatively low levels.

567
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:05.510
Now we come back at this point to the picture we began with and much of what you

568
00:47:09.631 --> 00:47:10.800
see in this diagram

569
00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:17.190
and much of what you saw in the dynamic animation at the beginning of the hour,

570
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:18.540
uh,

571
00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:23.460
consists of passage through the demographic transition.

572
00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:25.313
And

573
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.000
most of what you see on the left third in societies that are in Stage two or

574
00:47:34.031 --> 00:47:35.470
early in Stage three,

575
00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:41.190
most of the middle is phase three where the birth rate is falling but you're

576
00:47:41.801 --> 00:47:43.450
still building population.

577
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:47.980
And the prediction is that we are going to build the world population from

578
00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:52.600
little under 7 million to about eight and a half million,
uh,

579
00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:57.660
before you guys are my age and mostly stage four out on the right.

580
00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:00.430
Now,

581
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:05.430
the pertinent fact that you need to carry forward from that last little piece is

582
00:48:08.411 --> 00:48:10.840
this.
The

583
00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:17.320
world demographic transition has happened in a sequential fashion.

584
00:48:17.321 --> 00:48:22.150
So there are temporal offsets and societies that are in,

585
00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:26.080
in phase four,
low birth rate,
low death rate,

586
00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:31.890
10 to have a lot of capital and tend to be short on cheap labor

587
00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:39.600
and societies that are in phase two or phase three tend to be long on cheap

588
00:48:41.201 --> 00:48:42.850
labor and short on capital.

589
00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:47.710
And the dynamic of world trade,

590
00:48:47.711 --> 00:48:50.290
which is such an important part of capitalism,

591
00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:56.140
is a way of arbitrage thing between early and late phases in the world

592
00:48:56.141 --> 00:49:00.970
demographic transition.
So that cheap labor is,

593
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:06.000
maximizes its value by being combined with capitol from phase four societies.

594
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:13.690
On Wednesday,
we'll come back to the 18th century,

595
00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:18.240
uh,
with Adam Smith who is in my view,
uh,

596
00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:22.000
the greatest of all writers on economy and society.
