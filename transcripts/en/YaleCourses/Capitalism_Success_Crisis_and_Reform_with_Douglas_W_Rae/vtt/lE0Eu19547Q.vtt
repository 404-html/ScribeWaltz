1
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.750
Okay.
Um,

2
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.250
and I'm just going to briefly introduce it and then leave 48 minutes for you to

3
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.363
win.

4
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.840
He has to say it will get a graduate of this college in [inaudible] 78,

5
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.030
class of 78
with a

6
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.630
professional career in art history.
Uh,

7
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:33.703
and,

8
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.850
and that's not an easy combination and he does it with grace and with,

9
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.420
uh,
he liked Sharon.

10
00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:47.421
Oscar is a stand out in the school of Management Mba program,

11
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.780
Ivy direct,
uh,
the International Center for finance.

12
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.300
Uh,
and is the capitalist city.
I'm a gender switch.
We'll see,

13
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.973
uh,

14
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.070
in his slides and in his analysis is a truly impression.

15
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.690
Please help me.
Welcome.
We'll get it.

16
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.933
<v 1>Okay.</v>

17
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.840
<v 2>Well thanks a lot for the introduction and,
uh,
I'm,</v>

18
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.230
uh,
I was thrilled with the idea of this course.
So,
um,

19
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.770
was really looking forward as Doug was describing the idea of the,
uh,

20
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.630
of the course and,
um,
his plans for it and what you all have been doing.

21
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.760
It seems like a fantastic,
uh,
thing.
So,
uh,
the question in my mind was,

22
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.640
what could I add today that would be of interest to you?

23
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.620
And I thought what I would do is focus a little bit on the historical

24
00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:48.450
backgrounds to the current prices.

25
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.030
I know you've been doing some reading about the,
uh,

26
00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:55.200
the current crisis and its relationship to ideas of capitalism and so forth.

27
00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.540
I thought a little bit of historical foundation would be a good thing to,
to,

28
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.870
to lead off with and,
and uh,

29
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.600
give you an idea of how old these financial crises are.

30
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.370
This is a cuneiform tablet from the old Babylonian period,

31
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.610
roughly 1600 BC.
It's,
um,
it's,
uh,

32
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.570
a loan so that,
uh,
it was,
uh,

33
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.440
created with the terms of the loan on one side and,
and,
and typically,

34
00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:30.270
although you can't see it from this side,

35
00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:33.240
you'll have people that are witnesses to the loan on the other side.

36
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.120
So Deb has been around for a long time.

37
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.580
And one interesting feature about debt is that usually when you,
um,

38
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.580
if you are a lender,
you like to have some collateral,

39
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.070
the collateral for debts in this time period,
often we're human capital.

40
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.170
In other words,
if you defaulted on your loan,

41
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.770
the borrower could seize you for three years.

42
00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.060
And your family and make it,
and you'd have to work loan off.
So,

43
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:04.900
uh,
that,
um,
that sort of debt slavery,
um,

44
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.790
was something that began quite early in,
in a human culture.

45
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.410
You had when you had with the debt slavery,

46
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.750
there'll be periods when people would get themselves into a terrible mess and,

47
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.320
uh,
let's say crops failed and lots of farmers wouldn't be able to pay off their

48
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:27.310
loans.
You'd have lots of the society in deep debt.

49
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.290
And,
um,
the,
the,
uh,

50
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.340
king periodically would decree all debts no and void.

51
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.200
So wiping the slate clean.
So here is a,
here's a,
a,

52
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.530
a fragment of an edict by Sam [inaudible] Luna,
who was the son of Hammurabi,

53
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.330
um,
who by the way lived in the city,
um,
that,
uh,

54
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.710
Gail has had a longtime expedition to excavate,
uh,

55
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.070
uh,
called,
uh,
tell lay lawn.
Um,
anyway,

56
00:03:57.071 --> 00:04:00.880
this is releasing everybody from,
uh,
from,
uh,

57
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.970
from bankruptcy in the form of debt slavery.

58
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:07.360
But the issue there of course is where do you draw the line?

59
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.860
Which debts do you release?
And,
and,
and,

60
00:04:09.861 --> 00:04:12.610
and if you just want to take people out of slavery,

61
00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:16.060
but where you want to maintain a financial system,
how do you,

62
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:20.670
how do you differentiate?
Uh,

63
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.400
that's the solution of that problem?
Uh,
at least in the,

64
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.350
from the view of,
of,
uh,
writers in antiquity,
particularly,

65
00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:33.910
uh,
Aristotle who wrote about Salon,
um,
um,

66
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.530
comes in the form of a,
of another major debt crisis.

67
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.210
Um,
when Sala NovaThreads became the,
uh,

68
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.600
auto park or whatever you want to call it,
the leader of Athens,

69
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.800
it was about 600 BC or so,
somewhere in that timeframe.

70
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.930
And he was brought in because there was a terrible crisis,
uh,

71
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.860
much like the crises in the Middle East.

72
00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.890
There was a period when when a Athenian citizens had been seized a four debts

73
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.440
and these were debts and typically by farmers,

74
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.090
and then they'd been sold off outside of Athens and just sell them off shores in

75
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.010
export,
the export these debt slaves.
And it created terrible crisis.

76
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.410
So,
um,
Salam was from a wealthy family.
Uh,

77
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.100
he was elected by the sort of the rich people in Athens.

78
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.140
They thought that he would stand up for property rights and,
uh,

79
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.500
he wouldn't let the financial system go to hell just because of the pain

80
00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:36.940
inflicted on the,
on the poor,
uh,
portion of society.
Um,

81
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.660
what he did made nobody happy.
He said,

82
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.700
we're gonna preserve property rights.

83
00:05:42.701 --> 00:05:44.830
We're going to preserve the right to contract,

84
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.550
but we only thing we're going to forbid is the right to sell yourself into

85
00:05:48.551 --> 00:05:52.300
slavery.
So he drew the line,
um,
at that,

86
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.710
at that a debt slavery point.
And,
um,
ever afterwards,
people,

87
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.180
uh,
Athenians would look at him.

88
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:02.720
He sort of was like the George Washington of Athens in 200 years later,

89
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:06.290
people would write about this moment in time when he,
he,
he,
um,

90
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.170
he made the differentiation between the financial system and the,

91
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.000
and the system of,
of human slavery.
It wasn't,

92
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.860
not to say that slaves didn't exist,
but the ability to contract on your,

93
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.940
on your freedom,
uh,
was not allowed after,
after a solid,

94
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.800
I'm gonna skip forward through a lot of exciting financial history.

95
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.240
Those of you that,
like,
that kind of stuff might consider taking.
I,

96
00:06:31.241 --> 00:06:36.210
I teach a course seminar,
senior seminar,
financial history,
uh,
in the spring.
So,

97
00:06:36.211 --> 00:06:39.650
um,
if you are interested in those topics,
um,

98
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.140
love to have you participate,

99
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.570
I'm going to skip forward to our debt crisis because,
uh,
I worry,

100
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.400
I stay up late nights worrying that we're getting ourselves back into a debt

101
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:57.350
slavery situation.
Um,
and,
uh,
the recent,
uh,

102
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.240
code that we've,
we've,
uh,

103
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:04.330
the bankruptcy code has made it hard for people to shift off their debts or

104
00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:09.410
shake off their debts,
which is the term that solid used a solid use.

105
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:13.190
It was called Sys arc thorough or something like this as shaking off like an

106
00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:15.080
earthquake.
Um,

107
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:20.110
but I'm going to skip forward to 1892 and have you read this quote because it,

108
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:22.160
it,
it,

109
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.160
it lets you have some sense of where the policy for a real estate mortgage

110
00:07:29.421 --> 00:07:33.470
lending in the United States might have come from.
Um,

111
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.750
the occasion for this was a big festive dinner.
Um,

112
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.110
might've been at Delmonico's restaurant,
I'm not sure exactly where,

113
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.850
I don't think it says here,
but in New York and a bunch of guys,
uh,

114
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.690
in the real estate business in New York were getting together and they're really

115
00:07:50.691 --> 00:07:55.691
kicking off a and attempt to create a real estate exchange in New York City.

116
00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.010
And the exchange,
um,

117
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.730
there had been as something like a real estate exchange where properties were

118
00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:05.840
listed in brokers,
uh,
um,
were admitted and so forth.

119
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.740
The idea that they were coming to was that they needed an exchange for real

120
00:08:09.741 --> 00:08:11.150
estate securities.

121
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:15.860
Like real estate securities that we have now are,
are,
are,
um,

122
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.050
a lot of them are things like,
oh,

123
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.890
you've heard lots about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and,
and uh,

124
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.460
and sub prime loans and,
um,
uh,

125
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.570
commercial mortgage backed securities and things like that.
Well,

126
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.460
these guys were thinking about setting up an exchange to trade,
um,
uh,
debt.

127
00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:39.380
Uh,
maybe some equity to actually in New York in New York would be the center of

128
00:08:39.381 --> 00:08:43.640
real estate.
I'm trading.
What were they going to trade?
Well,

129
00:08:43.641 --> 00:08:47.720
here's a picture,
just a piece of a bond.
Um,

130
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.720
uh,
that,
uh,
have the kind they were going to trade.

131
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:55.490
These things are incredibly beautiful.
The new,
uh,

132
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.960
the U s bank note company made bonds for made stocks and bonds and money for all

133
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:03.980
the countries in the world.
And,
uh,

134
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:08.790
they had incredibly detailed filigrees and,
and uh,

135
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:11.520
and these beautiful motifs and so forth.

136
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.260
It wasn't to make these things more attractive to customers.

137
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:22.430
All of this detail was really to prevent counterfeiting because,

138
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:26.460
uh,
you,
you know,
if you could rep,
if you could counterfeit a bond like this,

139
00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:30.060
you could take it in and,
um,
and,
and uh,

140
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:35.400
you can take it in and get coupons.
So what's this bond?
It's a $500 bond.

141
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:41.540
It's issued to finance something called 44 Wall Street Corporation.

142
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.160
Um,
and it's the Manhattan company building.

143
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:51.210
So 44 Wall Street is still a building in Manhattan.

144
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:55.440
I don't know if anybody here might've worked there during the summer.
Uh,
but,
um,

145
00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:00.570
there was a corporation that was set up to build and operate one single building

146
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.070
and there were some equity capital in the corporation and there were some debt

147
00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:09.180
in the corporation.
The debt was issued to the public in bonds.

148
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.850
So,
um,
uh,
you,

149
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.410
you and I could go out and we could buy these bonds and then the coupons,

150
00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:20.220
the money that would come in from the bonds is money that would come in based

151
00:10:20.221 --> 00:10:24.540
upon the rents are we're being paid by people that leased space in this 44 Wall

152
00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:29.370
Street building.
So this is a fairly extraordinary kind of security,

153
00:10:29.371 --> 00:10:33.750
just particularly because we don't have security's like this anymore.
I mean,

154
00:10:33.751 --> 00:10:38.370
there are some bonds that have been issued against buildings.
Um,
and,
uh,

155
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.240
I'm thinking now of um,
uh,
things like,
uh,

156
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.450
in London you have this vast project in,
uh,
in the,
uh,

157
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.460
Canary Wharf and that was financed with some really interesting debt,

158
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:55.220
but one to one building to,
to bond.
Really,
we don't have a,

159
00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.970
in the modern day,
this one,
by the way,
it was issued one month or so,

160
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:03.510
right?
Right after a few,
not long after the great crash.

161
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.310
Here's a little bit about this market.

162
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.710
The market was nothing much.
This is a,

163
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:16.790
this is the total cumulated amount of outstanding debt based on the face value.

164
00:11:17.581 --> 00:11:21.160
So the face value of that removes $500.
Um,

165
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.870
you'd multiply that times the total number of bonds.
Um,

166
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.260
you add all of those bonds that existed up in this,
these are the numbers.

167
00:11:28.261 --> 00:11:31.170
You're getting 100 million,
200 million,
so on.

168
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.310
So you see that even in 1913,

169
00:11:35.311 --> 00:11:39.720
there were some of these bonds being issued.
Um,

170
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:43.560
and um,
then,
uh,

171
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.990
there are two companies here that we're tracking.

172
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:50.850
New York title and Mortgage Company and Lawyers,
lawyers,

173
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:51.810
mortgage company.

174
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:58.830
These two companies actually served as guarantors for debt in particular.

175
00:12:01.901 --> 00:12:03.730
Actually what they would do,

176
00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:07.480
the about eight companies got together or didn't get together,

177
00:12:07.481 --> 00:12:11.680
but eight companies offered a service.
They would take a residential mortgage,

178
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:14.980
put a guarantee on it,
and then,

179
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:18.220
and then sell that mortgage to somebody else.

180
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.750
So just like you have one bond,
one,
one commercial building,

181
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.860
uh,
you know,
uh,
offered through bonds.

182
00:12:26.861 --> 00:12:31.861
You also had won a house then guaranteed and offered a one mortgage for one

183
00:12:32.831 --> 00:12:34.810
house,
then guaranteed and offered for sale.

184
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:40.590
These firms also began to pull these mortgages and he pulled together a hundred

185
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:43.840
or so of these mortgages are a thousand of these mortgages,

186
00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:48.240
put a guarantee on them,
and then sell those,
uh,
those,
uh,

187
00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.280
pooled claims out,
uh,
as bonds.

188
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:55.960
So this picture represents not just those commercial bonds that I showed you,

189
00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.960
but also residential securities.

190
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:03.730
And you can see what happened is that they were coming along doing fine,

191
00:13:03.731 --> 00:13:06.580
small part of the business.
And then in the 20s,

192
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.340
both of them picked up dramatically.

193
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:11.800
As a matter of fact,

194
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:16.120
the first world war was an important hinge point in the history of this

195
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.540
particular kinds of financial innovation.
Um,

196
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:23.530
the first world war was the first us more that was financed by massive issues
of,

197
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.940
of,
uh,
of a war bonds.
And it became a pit.

198
00:13:26.941 --> 00:13:30.760
You patriotic duty to buy more bonds to finance the,
the effort.

199
00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:36.040
When the war was over and those bonds were,
we're,
uh,
we're,
uh,

200
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:40.030
uh,
were reclaimed by the government.
They were paid off by the government.

201
00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:43.420
People had been used to owning securities,

202
00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:48.460
a whole operation to sell the securities had existed as sales.
Uh,
operation.

203
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.150
Uh,
so then,
um,
uh,

204
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.410
the broker said,
what else are we going to sell?

205
00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:01.240
And a real estate bonds became a really important,
uh,

206
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.800
new product.

207
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:07.830
So you can see this might have been driven by demand actually for investment

208
00:14:08.201 --> 00:14:13.070
product in a,
in a marketing system that had grown,
um,

209
00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:18.280
uh,
for savings bonds,
uh,
earlier,
you know,
during the war.
Nevertheless,

210
00:14:18.281 --> 00:14:21.430
you can see this stuff really take off and uh,

211
00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.520
and peak and around 19,
late twenties.

212
00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.050
<v 1>Okay.</v>

213
00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:31.540
<v 2>Uh,
these,
that was cumulative.
This is just new,
uh,
new issues.</v>

214
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:36.370
There you see the,
the,
uh,
the drop,
um,
around the crash time,

215
00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:37.990
uh,
even more dramatically.

216
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:43.070
<v 1>Okay.</v>

217
00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:47.840
<v 2>Okay.
Um,
this is a picture of,
uh,</v>

218
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.741
the,

219
00:14:48.741 --> 00:14:53.741
those plotting those number of new for commercial bar for commercial properties

220
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.860
against a new buildings.

221
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.840
And here we only took a look at new buildings that were 70 meters high or so.
So,

222
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.620
uh,
so,
so we're looking at really tall buildings.

223
00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:13.070
Um,
this is a time period when,
uh,
the skyscrapers were,

224
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:17.150
was really born in the 19 1890s.
And,
uh,

225
00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.060
really got going in the early part of the 20th century.

226
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.220
So a question that,
um,
that we began to ask ourselves is,

227
00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:26.450
um,

228
00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:31.450
maybe the skyscraper was a response to the emergence of a new capital market for

229
00:15:31.851 --> 00:15:33.290
fixed income securities.

230
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:39.130
Maybe the financing drove the desire for big buildings rather than the the other

231
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:41.330
way around.
I mean,

232
00:15:41.331 --> 00:15:45.530
New York and other cities had existed for a long time without skyscrapers.

233
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:47.120
Um,

234
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:52.150
and there's a lot of interesting theory about how skyscrapers were a kind of a

235
00:15:52.281 --> 00:15:56.340
result of changes in zoning laws in some places and so forth.
Um,

236
00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:00.560
but if you think about it,
London did fine without skyscrapers for many years.

237
00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.550
Paris,
London,
other great capitals of the world did fine without skyscrapers.

238
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.950
Why would you suddenly have these,
uh,

239
00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:11.270
sort of immediate blossoming of skyscrapers war,

240
00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:15.800
truly coincident with an emergence of a capital market and an ability to sell

241
00:16:15.801 --> 00:16:19.270
these,
these bonds?
Um,

242
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.630
uh,
so,
um,
by the way,
how would,

243
00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:29.480
is there any way you can think of testing that theory about which,
uh,
um,
if I,

244
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:32.680
if my theory was finance made skies,

245
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.560
Scott skyscrapers or finance led to big buildings,

246
00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:39.440
how would you test that theory?
If you had some data

247
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.810
boy guy that was taking anybody?
I want to cold call on somebody,

248
00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.950
but your chances of being cold called um,
yes back there.

249
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.290
<v 1>That's okay.</v>

250
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.000
<v 2>Wait for the money.
That's okay.
I can hear you.</v>

251
00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:19.860
<v 1>Yes.
And comparing how that was.</v>

252
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:26.760
<v 2>Yeah.
Um,
so look across country,
uh,</v>

253
00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:31.690
and Lacrosse section where you'd like to find conditions that,
uh,
that,
um,

254
00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.250
maybe didn't have this,
uh,
financial explosion

255
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.730
<v 1>capital markets.</v>

256
00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:49.160
<v 2>Okay.
Does everybody know what endogeneity is?
A,</v>

257
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:53.820
everybody who's an econ major and you're a senior or junior,
you probably know.

258
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.690
Okay.
Other than that,
you probably think it's some kind of horrible skin disease.

259
00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.700
Um,
and dodge Djenne,
it means that,
um,
um,
that the,

260
00:18:02.701 --> 00:18:05.100
the factors that you're studying could actually be,
uh,

261
00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:09.030
it can be some reverse causality going on or there could be some,
a,

262
00:18:09.031 --> 00:18:12.360
a common on identified factor that could be driving both of them.

263
00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:16.680
And you have to find some way of sorting this out.
Uh,
so the question is,

264
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:21.280
so the one way to do this is to find some independent,
um,
um,

265
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.020
phenomena to observe.
That's what's being proposed.

266
00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.940
Any other suggestions?
Um,
Pierson College,

267
00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:35.493
<v 3>I will</v>

268
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:41.220
give you that.
It states

269
00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:46.630
the number of skyscrapers like this,
and I would read through that.

270
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.030
Probably the first skyscrapers were not playing with these types of,

271
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.300
at least initially driving skyscraper construction.

272
00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.030
<v 2>Okay.
So,
um,</v>

273
00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:02.290
if you can find a skyscraper that was the first skyscraper was if you can show

274
00:19:02.291 --> 00:19:03.970
that it wasn't financed by these bonds,

275
00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:07.630
you could prove that it's possible to have skyscrapers without the financing.

276
00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:12.410
So that's a,
that's a,
that's a way to test the basic proposition.
You know,
a,

277
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.520
it may be,
um,
may not,

278
00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:19.000
you can prove that it's an unnecessary condition.
If you can find one example.

279
00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.440
<v 1>Okay.
One more idea.</v>

280
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:30.610
Who's an SOM student?
We've got one here.
No,

281
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.350
<v 2>uh,
you hear in them?
Yes.
Gray,
a charcoal,
a tee shirt.</v>

282
00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:40.413
Any idea

283
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.020
<v 3>other than taking a survey,</v>

284
00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:47.050
looking at multiple cities and skyscrapers started to be built and when this

285
00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:51.270
capital work developed,
uh,
I don't think I could really add anything else.

286
00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:54.670
<v 2>That's good.
Take a look.
Cross-Sectionally at the different cities,</v>

287
00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:59.000
see if they have maybe access to capital markets different,
different,
different,

288
00:19:59.001 --> 00:20:02.350
differently across the cities and see what the timing is.
That's a good idea.

289
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.553
<v 1>Okay.</v>

290
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:09.720
<v 2>I'll tell you what we have been doing.
Um,
we figured that,
uh,</v>

291
00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:14.050
one interesting issue here is has to do with the size of the bond issue.

292
00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.320
If you have a really,
um,

293
00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:21.550
if you have a tiny building and you want to go to the public capital markets,

294
00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:27.670
um,
do you think an investment bank is gonna gonna give you the time of day?

295
00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:31.330
Absolutely not.
Um,
there are basic,
uh,

296
00:20:31.331 --> 00:20:35.890
issues of economies of scale that have to do with financing.
Uh,
so,

297
00:20:35.891 --> 00:20:39.940
um,
so what we did is we said,
let's take a look at the size of the bond issue.

298
00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.490
We also looked at the height of the building,
but the size of the bond issues,

299
00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.990
the legitimate thing to look at and presuming that the,

300
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.420
the biggest bond issue,
the bigger the building.

301
00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:55.050
And then we asked is the interest rate on the bond that is the,

302
00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:57.910
uh,
the,
the rate at which the bond was issued,

303
00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:02.890
was that lower or higher for bigger,
uh,
for,
for,
for bigger buildings.

304
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:06.820
And what we found pretty strikingly is that the bigger the building,

305
00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:10.540
the lower the yield,
the lower the cost of capital.

306
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:12.760
And so if you're thinking about,

307
00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:16.630
if you're a developer and you've got a plot and you could build two small

308
00:21:16.631 --> 00:21:18.100
buildings are one big building,

309
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.160
or you could finance it all at once or one at a time,

310
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.040
and you know that you're going to be able to have a lower cost of capital,

311
00:21:24.041 --> 00:21:26.980
what are you going to do?
You're going to build one really big building.

312
00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:29.470
So you can see,
you know,

313
00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:34.120
finance has this potential maybe to possibly even distort the way that,

314
00:21:34.121 --> 00:21:39.121
the way that the city's develop because of simple issues like cost of capital.

315
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.510
And,
uh,
those guys sitting around,
uh,
the,
uh,

316
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.150
toasting themselves that we saw in 1892,

317
00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:51.190
the creation of that market for those securities may have had an influence on,

318
00:21:51.191 --> 00:21:55.330
on the,
on the New York skyline,
uh,
during that time period.

319
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:59.350
Here's just a picture by the way,
of,
uh,

320
00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:03.220
of the tall buildings in New York and when they were all constructed and you see

321
00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:08.820
huge boom during this period and then along Malays during the middle of the

322
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:13.270
century,
during war time,
and then the market picked back up.

323
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:18.510
I'll tell you one sort of shocking thing to me is that the,

324
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:23.830
the residential mortgage backed security market completely disappeared in the

325
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:28.540
30s.
And that commercial,
a one building,

326
00:22:28.541 --> 00:22:33.541
one bond market completely disappeared at least by 1940 or so.

327
00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:37.180
I mean,
there's still bonds that may exist when I see disappeared.

328
00:22:37.181 --> 00:22:41.290
They stopped new issues and you couldn't easily trade these things.

329
00:22:41.291 --> 00:22:45.250
They didn't change hands.
So there are bonds that are still paying out.
I have a,

330
00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:46.750
a friend whose mother,

331
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:50.950
whose family has some securities that were used to build the empire state

332
00:22:50.951 --> 00:22:54.430
building.
They're still paying them money and they're proud to own these things.

333
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:57.670
But these are the fossils of the,
uh,
of the financial world.

334
00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:02.320
So what you had is this extraordinary period of innovation in,
in,

335
00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:05.170
in financing of real estate.
Um,

336
00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:10.060
the shift in the way that people were able to access mortgage money and the,

337
00:23:10.061 --> 00:23:13.090
and the change in the way that developers thought about how they would build

338
00:23:13.091 --> 00:23:17.770
buildings and all of a,
came to a grinding horrible.
And,

339
00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.470
uh,
as a result of the Great Depression,

340
00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:27.690
did that market caused the crash or was it a w w w was,

341
00:23:29.261 --> 00:23:32.710
was did the fallout from the crash destroy that market?

342
00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:36.940
That's the question we're asking ourselves today,
right?
We're saying,
well,

343
00:23:36.941 --> 00:23:41.610
subprime obviously caused the big problem that we're in.
And,
um,
so,
uh,

344
00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:46.130
the foolish bankers,
a idiots at want to do,

345
00:23:46.131 --> 00:23:48.980
own their own home and were bullying to borrow to the hilt,

346
00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:54.200
this horrible evil brew of,
uh,
of,
uh,

347
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.820
of,
uh,
people that,
uh,

348
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:59.750
couldn't plan ahead and bankers that were willing to give them a,

349
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:03.080
give them enough rope that they can hang themselves as sort of the theme,

350
00:24:03.081 --> 00:24:07.870
the drum beat.
We're hearing,
you know,
you,
you sort of wonder maybe that the,

351
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:12.620
the mortgage market is a,
um,
is a casualty rather than a,

352
00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:15.260
a,
a,
a cause of this crash.

353
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.033
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

354
00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:25.240
<v 2>So a dog is giving you some readings,
um,
that,
uh,
uh,</v>

355
00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:30.040
kind of a hard,
uh,
reading to slog through.
But,
um,
because,
uh,

356
00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.990
although if you're as,
again,
if you're an econ major,

357
00:24:31.991 --> 00:24:34.810
you should be able to snap your way right through this thing cause it's got a

358
00:24:34.811 --> 00:24:38.710
bunch of regressions and tables and,
and uh,
and plots.

359
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:42.940
But let me just tell you a little bit about the idea of this paper.

360
00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.610
I'm doing it with a,
with a Liang Pang who was,
um,
a colleague of mine.

361
00:24:48.611 --> 00:24:51.730
He's now at Colorado.
Um,
and Jackie Yen,

362
00:24:51.731 --> 00:24:55.720
who's a doctoral student at Yale and Jackie,
um,
uh,

363
00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:00.410
is studying to be a finance professor,
but she also,
uh,
worked in,
uh,

364
00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.780
Wall Street for quite some time and knows a lot about,
uh,

365
00:25:02.781 --> 00:25:05.890
about these capital markets,
particularly about mortgage data.

366
00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:11.590
And the question we're asking is a simple one,
like many scholars right now,

367
00:25:11.591 --> 00:25:16.090
we want to try and help,
uh,
the world,
uh,

368
00:25:16.091 --> 00:25:18.460
understand what the causes of this crisis are.

369
00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.430
But we're in a position that we don't,

370
00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:23.890
I'm not quite sure I know what the causes are.

371
00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:27.790
And so the way that we're dealing with that is we're gathering some data and

372
00:25:27.791 --> 00:25:32.040
we're looking at it and putting questions to this data.
Um,

373
00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:36.640
the data that we got or housing indexes,
those come from Bob Schiller,

374
00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:41.950
uh,
and chip case,
who developed these when I was a graduate student here,

375
00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:46.930
Bob and chip case had just started building these indexes of housing.
Um,

376
00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:50.890
and so,
uh,
we really have data going back.
Uh,

377
00:25:50.891 --> 00:25:54.670
I think they stretch back their data start from about,

378
00:25:55.610 --> 00:26:00.280
well,
late eighties or so.
And what they do is they take sales of housing,

379
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:05.400
they take houses that had been sold twice in a given city and they get thousands

380
00:26:07.061 --> 00:26:12.061
of those and you can sort of figure out what's the best measure of return to

381
00:26:12.341 --> 00:26:14.860
explain all of those repeated sales.

382
00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:19.310
So it's actually transactions based measures of housing.
Uh,

383
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.790
we've got those for all the,
the city,

384
00:26:21.791 --> 00:26:25.780
the big cities in the country and metropolitan statistical areas about 320 or

385
00:26:25.781 --> 00:26:26.890
330 of these.

386
00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:31.180
Then we have some additional city level information we can compare that to.

387
00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:35.440
Then we've got,
um,
mortgage issuance by city.

388
00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:40.450
And finally,
this is pretty amazing.
For one year,
for 2006,

389
00:26:40.451 --> 00:26:45.451
we took all the mortgages that were issued in the entire country and we have a

390
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:48.960
detailed data about those mortgages.
Uh,

391
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:53.280
so we figured somewhere buried in this data,

392
00:26:53.281 --> 00:26:57.300
we're going to be able to get some sense of what,
what the problem was.
Okay.

393
00:26:57.301 --> 00:26:58.200
Here's a chart

394
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:05.690
on this axis is past price growth from 1999 to 2005,

395
00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:10.470
end of 2005.
So what did we do?

396
00:27:10.471 --> 00:27:12.630
We took each one of those cities.

397
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:16.860
We look at that index that Bob Schiller had created and we said,

398
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:17.903
um,

399
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:23.010
we just plotted the total growth that that index had undergone over the period

400
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:26.610
over the,
over the,
over the two thousands up through 2005.

401
00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.860
So we wanted to look at the hot markets,
which are the really hot markets,

402
00:27:31.861 --> 00:27:33.660
which ones had really grown a lot.

403
00:27:33.661 --> 00:27:38.661
And you could see some of them are grown by almost a factor of three Las Vegas.

404
00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:40.973
Uh,

405
00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:45.570
there are parts of California and Nevada and Florida that were just off the

406
00:27:45.571 --> 00:27:49.680
charts having grown like an amazing amount.
And by the way,

407
00:27:49.681 --> 00:27:52.650
there are a lot of cities where there wasn't much growth at all.

408
00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.880
The whole cluster here of cities that had grown by a factor of,
well,

409
00:27:56.881 --> 00:28:00.660
they'd grown 30%,
but that was over a long length of time.

410
00:28:00.661 --> 00:28:05.250
They're probably growing at less than 10% per year.
Well,

411
00:28:05.251 --> 00:28:08.280
10% per year over this time period was actually a pretty good investment.

412
00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:12.900
When you think about it,
the stock market was doing terribly.

413
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:17.040
We just got off this horrible bender from the tech bubble.
People said,

414
00:28:17.041 --> 00:28:19.920
stocks are terrible.
I don't want to invest in them anymore.

415
00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:25.170
Bonds were decent investment,
but there were people really wondering,

416
00:28:25.171 --> 00:28:28.470
what are we going to put my money in?
And a lot of people thought,
you know,

417
00:28:28.471 --> 00:28:32.790
housing,
although a modest growth in many of these cities,

418
00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:37.590
housing might not be such a bad thing.
You think about it.

419
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:42.560
If you're sitting in the year 2000 having just been burned by the tech bubble,

420
00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:46.020
you know,
the saying where,
how am I going to save for myself and my family?

421
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:52.020
You know,
why not put your money in your house?
At least you can watch the asset.

422
00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:56.280
You can take care of it,
you can improve it.
Granted,

423
00:28:56.281 --> 00:28:58.960
you have to be taxes on it and you have to fix it up and uh,

424
00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:03.630
it's not very liquid.
Okay.
But you balance these things off.
It might be,
you know,

425
00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:07.220
it,
it was the new asset class of the era.
It was a idea.

426
00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:11.940
It was not a speculative asset.
It was a savings related acid.
Okay.

427
00:29:11.941 --> 00:29:16.890
How about this other access subprime approvals in 2006,

428
00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.250
uh,
the log of the dollar amount in thousands,

429
00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:23.160
we looked at all of these,
uh,

430
00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:26.940
we looked at the rate CD by city of subprime approvals.

431
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:31.650
That is people that had applied for a subprime mortgage and then,

432
00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:32.550
um,

433
00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:37.550
being approved for a been approved a subprime mortgage means you don't qualify

434
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:41.860
to get a prime mortgage.
To qualify for a prime mortgage,

435
00:29:41.861 --> 00:29:44.530
you have to have steady source of income,

436
00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:47.720
you have to have a good credit rating.
Um,

437
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.530
there has to be a good loan to value ratio.

438
00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.600
That means you don't ask trying to borrow too much.

439
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:57.070
You have to have a house that is appraised in such a way that the loan to value

440
00:29:57.071 --> 00:30:00.190
ratio is a legitimate measure that some of the bank can trust.

441
00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:05.530
If you're not in that circumstance,
then you're us in sub world of subprime.

442
00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:07.390
Okay.

443
00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:12.390
So what we see here is sub prime approvals were more frequent in markets where

444
00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:18.220
the prices had gone up.

445
00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:21.413
<v 3>Why would that be</v>

446
00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:27.290
<v 2>okay.
I'll ask you this as a general question.
Why would you expect</v>

447
00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.350
<v 3>that?
Yes.</v>

448
00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:36.143
Yeah.

449
00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:54.490
Okay.
Yeah,

450
00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:59.110
<v 2>this sounds like endogeneity.
That's good.
Um,</v>

451
00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:03.760
people,
uh,
the houses would go up too fast.
They,
the normal loan,
they can't,

452
00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:05.800
they can't get a normal loan to buy a house.

453
00:31:05.801 --> 00:31:08.050
They might have been able to buy 10 years ago with a prime loan.

454
00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:12.670
So therefore you've got a necessity of more demand,
uh,

455
00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:15.460
for subprime loans.
These are approvals though.

456
00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:20.200
That means the bankers had to say yes.
Okay.
So bankers had to go along with this,

457
00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:21.880
uh,
to,
to get this graph.
Yeah.

458
00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:29.380
<v 4>Crisis
just score upwards.</v>

459
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:34.420
So people in general just start eating more risks and financial institutions

460
00:31:34.421 --> 00:31:37.690
which grabbed the subprime loans also become overly optimistic.

461
00:31:37.691 --> 00:31:38.381
They are to be led,

462
00:31:38.381 --> 00:31:42.700
prices have to go up and they feel that the real value passive increase.

463
00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.240
<v 2>That sounds like,
it sounds like your rational exuberance.</v>

464
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:51.940
<v 3>Okay.
Um,
so,
um,</v>

465
00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.360
<v 2>it's easy to say that they're irrational.</v>

466
00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:58.900
It's harder to say that they're rational.
Okay.

467
00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:03.490
It'd be nice to know if,
uh,
um,

468
00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:07.250
first of all,
Bob Schiller is a good friend of mine and uh,
I've,

469
00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:12.370
I love his book and I love his wonderful intuition about when the cart is going

470
00:32:15.311 --> 00:32:18.670
off the track a and he's tends to be right.

471
00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:22.630
So it's hard to deny that irrational exuberance is behind a lot of the big

472
00:32:22.631 --> 00:32:26.230
messes we're in.
Um,
however,

473
00:32:26.231 --> 00:32:29.890
as an economist you sort of want to see how much you can get with the,

474
00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:33.790
with the rational stories first and then have the remainder be the,

475
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:39.620
the exuberant.
So we're going to push on that a little bit.
Yeah.
Interpret this.

476
00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.040
Sorry.
I

477
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:40.821
<v 3>interpret this to try to,</v>

478
00:32:40.821 --> 00:32:45.290
as prices of asset values are going up and separate approvals are going at the

479
00:32:45.291 --> 00:32:48.500
same time,
I think to strategize to be increasing and leveraged this,

480
00:32:48.501 --> 00:32:49.580
that's the only way to fill the gap.

481
00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:52.190
You're not saying that so prime incomes are going up,

482
00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:55.610
but you're saying the approvals are going up,
so something has to fill that gap.

483
00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.460
Purchase prices,
that means they're being more heavily leveraged.

484
00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:02.240
<v 2>Yeah.
I think that there's some evidence,
a consistent with your,</v>

485
00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:03.500
with your observation,

486
00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:07.220
it's amazing how much you can get off staring at a graph like that because

487
00:33:07.221 --> 00:33:11.960
buried behind it or a whole bunch of decisions by individuals applying and by

488
00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:14.390
bankers.
Um,
uh,
deciding,

489
00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:20.960
I'm going to show you a picture of just from one city.
This is from a Seattle.

490
00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:25.880
And what we've done here is we've gone from 2006.

491
00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.200
Um,
what we've done is we've said,

492
00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:34.700
let's extrapolate the housing price from two in 2006.

493
00:33:34.701 --> 00:33:39.140
Let's extrapolate it and then use some econometrics to figure out how far down

494
00:33:39.141 --> 00:33:43.520
we think it could go and how far up it could go.
Those are those two lines there.

495
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:44.190
Um,

496
00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:47.960
and then there's a wiggly line which shows you exactly what housing prices did.

497
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:52.550
Um,
and so,
uh,

498
00:33:52.551 --> 00:33:55.400
actually I'm going to show you some more in just a second when I want you to

499
00:33:55.401 --> 00:34:00.380
understand the geography of this first.
Um,
these are confidence bands.

500
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:04.370
And if you're thinking,
if you're a banker and you're going to make a loan,

501
00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:06.170
the first thing you want to know is,

502
00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:10.360
is this loan devalue ratio gonna um,

503
00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:13.550
change a lot over the time period of loan,

504
00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:17.000
a lot of subprime loans sort of reset after three years and so forth.

505
00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:22.390
You'd like to have some confidence or at least know how far down the value could

506
00:34:22.671 --> 00:34:24.950
go so that,
you know,

507
00:34:24.951 --> 00:34:28.910
cause you're worried about the loan value being higher than the loan being

508
00:34:28.911 --> 00:34:32.960
higher than the,
than the house value that's called underwater.

509
00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:35.900
So you're worried about the value of the asset.
Bless you.

510
00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:40.370
So this picture is really couldn't confidence bounds on the value of the asset.

511
00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:45.740
And um,
what this is saying is that in 2006,

512
00:34:45.741 --> 00:34:48.560
if you just extrapolated the prices from that time,

513
00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:52.670
you'd get a kind of a flat line and then you didn't,

514
00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:56.930
you wouldn't find any reason to expect that over the next three years or prices

515
00:34:56.931 --> 00:35:01.410
could drop more than,
than 20% or so.
So,
uh,

516
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:05.440
only one time out of 20,
would you get a shock?
More than 20%?

517
00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:09.093
<v 3>Oops.</v>

518
00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:14.330
<v 2>How would you get that?
Oops,
here we are.
Now here's a hole here,</v>

519
00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:17.230
a whole bunch of these,
uh,
uh,

520
00:35:17.231 --> 00:35:19.960
the same exercise and I'll tell you a little bit about the exercise.

521
00:35:19.961 --> 00:35:21.700
Here's where the econometrics comes in.

522
00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:27.330
We take those indexes that chiller gave us for all the different cities,

523
00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:30.480
these major cities,
and then we did it.
Um,

524
00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:34.780
we did something that any red blooded econometrician would do.

525
00:35:34.781 --> 00:35:39.010
We did an auto regression,
which says a that past growth,
uh,

526
00:35:39.011 --> 00:35:42.030
estimates relationship to him,
past growth and future growth.

527
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:47.510
And what you see from all of these housing indexes is that past trends seem to

528
00:35:48.031 --> 00:35:49.650
be followed.
Uh,

529
00:35:49.651 --> 00:35:53.220
there seems to be on a huge amount of momentum and inertia in these,

530
00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:58.380
these movements of these markets,
even when they're going down,
once they start,

531
00:35:58.381 --> 00:35:59.880
here's a,
here's a Minneapolis,

532
00:35:59.881 --> 00:36:03.510
it was going up like this incredible auto correlation and past trends.

533
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:07.200
And then of course,
once it starts going down,
it just keeps going down.

534
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.060
This is not a random walk.

535
00:36:09.061 --> 00:36:12.840
Housing doesn't follow random walk by any stretch of the imagination.
It's very,

536
00:36:12.841 --> 00:36:15.360
very predictable.
You could predict,

537
00:36:15.361 --> 00:36:20.361
the models tell you that you could predict the housing prices with a huge degree

538
00:36:20.791 --> 00:36:25.650
of confidence for three years out,
just given about 20 or 20,

539
00:36:25.651 --> 00:36:29.730
you know,
15 or 20 years worth of,
of,
of past data.
So,

540
00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:34.920
uh,
so all of these pictures show you that for each city there is a line,

541
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:37.440
which is the past price increase.

542
00:36:37.441 --> 00:36:41.580
That's a not Las Vegas went up like crazy at one point.

543
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:45.900
Then there are the two confidence bands,
then there's the orange bar saying,

544
00:36:45.901 --> 00:36:49.140
what do we expect the PR the price trend to be?

545
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:52.740
But it's not the expectation that's so important.
It's this lower bound.

546
00:36:52.741 --> 00:36:57.240
How bad can it get if you're a banker?
That's the thing.
It tells you,

547
00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.480
you know,
uh,
is this loan going to be a disaster?

548
00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.450
And every single one of these cities,

549
00:37:03.451 --> 00:37:08.160
virtually the actual price just plunged right through the,

550
00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:12.430
the bankers confidence bands.
So,
uh,

551
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:15.120
if you've got a model that's an,
uh,

552
00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:20.170
an econometric model that's based on past price trends and you ran that model in

553
00:37:20.851 --> 00:37:25.440
2006,
you wouldn't have been able to predict any of this crash.

554
00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:29.430
You would have felt pretty confident that when you are writing those mortgages,

555
00:37:29.431 --> 00:37:34.380
even the,
even the subprime mortgage that,
uh,

556
00:37:34.381 --> 00:37:39.150
that those were good bonds,
tubs,
a good loan,
you know,

557
00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:42.330
a subprime loan doesn't mean that the house is bad.

558
00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:48.390
It just means that the lender is bad.
It's a subprime borrowers bad.
The,

559
00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:52.470
it's a subprime borrower,
not a subprime house.
So you say,
look,

560
00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:54.150
what's the worst that could happen?

561
00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:59.370
My borrower can't.
Uh,
we get into some trouble.

562
00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:01.710
My borrower can't make the payments on the house,

563
00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.710
then the bank has to repossess the house.

564
00:38:04.711 --> 00:38:07.650
But if the house price isn't going to move much,
then what the heck?

565
00:38:07.651 --> 00:38:11.910
We'll just turn around and sell the house.
So we've got good collateral.

566
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.130
Um,
and,
and we all know what happened.
Uh,

567
00:38:17.131 --> 00:38:21.690
that model turned out though that econometric model turned out to be complete a

568
00:38:21.691 --> 00:38:25.920
disaster.
Okay.

569
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:28.590
Actually one more point on this.

570
00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:32.670
What do you need for an econometric model

571
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:36.430
aside from a econometrics textbook?

572
00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:41.260
Sas I use are,

573
00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:45.190
I did this and this was a program called our data.
Some people use that.

574
00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:47.440
What else do you need to run an econometric model?

575
00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:52.013
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

576
00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:53.640
<v 2>this isn't a trick question.</v>

577
00:38:57.330 --> 00:38:59.580
Um,
you have a blue scarf on.

578
00:38:59.581 --> 00:39:03.990
What do you need to run them to estimate a model like this data.

579
00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:08.760
Okay.
You need data.
And um,

580
00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:14.040
so the data come from Robert Shiller and the fact is,

581
00:39:14.041 --> 00:39:17.700
unless you have those housing indexes,
you can't run this model.

582
00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:23.450
The irony of these indexes is that although they opened a world to us of what

583
00:39:24.091 --> 00:39:25.500
housing prices do,

584
00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:30.650
they also made econometrician is believed that they could estimate the risk

585
00:39:31.021 --> 00:39:34.080
associated with the housing.
Before we had those indexes,

586
00:39:34.081 --> 00:39:35.340
we couldn't do any prediction.

587
00:39:35.341 --> 00:39:39.400
We couldn't do any of this sophisticated mathematical calculations.

588
00:39:39.401 --> 00:39:43.740
And we couldn't walk into a,
to uh,
uh,
to the president of the bank and say,
look,

589
00:39:43.741 --> 00:39:47.970
we've done a value at risk calculation using these fantastic indexes that tell

590
00:39:47.971 --> 00:39:52.860
us that the probability of us losing more than 20% of,
of our capital.
Um,

591
00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.770
it,
it is a 0.005,

592
00:39:56.130 --> 00:40:00.900
you couldn't do it suddenly with this data,
a little bit of information.

593
00:40:00.901 --> 00:40:02.800
It's a really dangerous thing when you,

594
00:40:02.801 --> 00:40:05.850
you put it in front of somebody that knows how to crank through a regression.

595
00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:10.680
And,
uh,
so it's a terrible thing to blame Bob Shiller,

596
00:40:10.681 --> 00:40:15.681
the person that forecast this crash to blame him on the other hand for providing

597
00:40:16.171 --> 00:40:17.900
the,
the,
the matches,

598
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:21.570
the law people to burn down the house who was a failure of models,

599
00:40:21.571 --> 00:40:23.640
but you can't run the models without the data.

600
00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:31.750
Okay.
I'll just give you a little bit more flavor for what we do.

601
00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.550
We run a whole bunch of regressions,
we're looking for relationships,

602
00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:41.450
but mainly what we do is we divide things up into world of the demand side for,

603
00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:44.530
for loans and the supply side for loans.

604
00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:47.200
And what we want to ask is,

605
00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:52.740
was it a stupid or avaricious banker that drove the crash or was it the stupid

606
00:40:55.091 --> 00:41:00.091
or an or an average this homeowner borrower that drove the crash neither or

607
00:41:00.881 --> 00:41:03.810
both.
Okay.
And,
uh,

608
00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:08.110
here we have subprime mortgages and prime mortgages.

609
00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:13.690
And so,
um,
roughly when we look at relationships,
here's what we find

610
00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:19.030
we find for both subprime and prime,
the numbers of,
uh,

611
00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:23.860
applications and measured by dollars and numbers of applications.

612
00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:28.300
We're increasing in those home prices.

613
00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:31.000
So when the home price goes up,

614
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:34.790
you make your forecast of what the worst scenario might be.

615
00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:39.590
And if you had a positive trend,
you would think that,
um,
you know,
uh,

616
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:43.760
lenders would be more comfortable that what the bottom line,
uh,

617
00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:48.290
that they'd be able to get their money out.
And so Mike Borrowers,
if they think,

618
00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:52.550
hey,
look,
I'm buying a house.
I'm putting every dime,
dime I have into it,

619
00:41:52.551 --> 00:41:54.740
but the trends look pretty good.

620
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.660
I should be able to get my money out the other end.
Um,

621
00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:02.450
then you ought to see a positive relationship between past price increases and,

622
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:07.100
um,
applications.
Uh,
however,
what you want to slice it.

623
00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:12.590
Somebody mentioned,
you mentioned leverage.
Okay.
Exactly.

624
00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:17.360
That's exactly what happened.
Uh,
uh,
there was a greater loan to income,

625
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:19.050
uh,
requests for,
um,

626
00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:24.520
higher leverage requests for both of those two people actually also tended to,

627
00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:29.030
um,
this is loaned income,

628
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:33.000
a measure of leverage,
not loan to value,
uh,

629
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:37.400
the loan to value actually also the value to loan when up.

630
00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:41.000
Why is that people felt comfortable putting more of their own money into houses

631
00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:45.890
and then people bought more expensive houses.
But the indoctrinate of the issue,

632
00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:50.030
who mentioned that that was a really important point there.

633
00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:53.300
There were more expensive houses,
so that was inevitable.

634
00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:58.490
Okay,
so where people being foolish?
Well,

635
00:42:58.491 --> 00:43:03.470
that's a hard thing to say.
They looked at at it as a savings opportunity.

636
00:43:03.471 --> 00:43:04.880
You could say this was,
uh,

637
00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:10.190
this was a crisis driven by over too much demand for savings.

638
00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:14.450
It's just that it didn't save and just at the savings vehicle was the house.

639
00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:20.660
Um,
we're the irrationally exuberant.
Well,

640
00:43:20.661 --> 00:43:22.040
if you look at those trends,

641
00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:25.790
maybe I would have been fooled by the same trend as well.

642
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:30.380
How about on the banker's side?
Now the banker's job is to say no.

643
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:34.250
Okay,
so to reject loans.

644
00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:37.160
And what do we find here now?

645
00:43:37.161 --> 00:43:40.310
The weirdest thing that we completely,

646
00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:44.810
the completely shocked us is that approvals didn't really,

647
00:43:44.811 --> 00:43:49.811
the rate of approvals for subprime once we control for a lot of things didn't

648
00:43:50.571 --> 00:43:52.940
change as much as that we had expected.

649
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:57.380
And in fact the rate for approvals for prime actually went down,

650
00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:01.490
which is strange.
That means bankers were getting tougher.

651
00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:06.650
Well are only getting tougher because the demands were,
we're increasing.

652
00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:11.450
Okay.
So,
um,
you have to look at this as the environment was changing because the,

653
00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:15.740
the,
the demand for loans was increasing a lot,
but uh,
so that,
so that their,

654
00:44:15.741 --> 00:44:18.170
their,
their approval rates were actually going down,

655
00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:21.020
but it really doesn't look like

656
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:26.120
that doesn't look like irrational exuberance on the banker's part,
um,

657
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:30.980
for prime loans.
Um,

658
00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:33.930
and mostly on the prime side,

659
00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:39.180
bankers to appear to be behaving really pretty rationally.

660
00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:43.560
Um,
less so on the,
on the,
on the subprime side.

661
00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:49.860
So,
uh,
the,
uh,
loan to income ratio that was going up,

662
00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:55.140
um,
uh,
the value to loan ratio was going down.

663
00:44:55.141 --> 00:44:55.974
In other words,

664
00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:00.360
people were having to put up there the less of their own cash to own the home

665
00:45:00.361 --> 00:45:03.320
and people were having to,
um,
uh,

666
00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:06.030
people were getting a higher loans with lower incomes.

667
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:08.430
So if anything,

668
00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:13.460
I think what we're beginning to convince ourselves using this loan data that the

669
00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:18.711
subprime market and the prime market were to kind of slightly disjointed markets

670
00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:23.700
with a different decision processes.
It in operation,

671
00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:28.860
both sides had securitization going on.
Um,

672
00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:31.440
and um,
and uh,

673
00:45:31.441 --> 00:45:35.700
we have an attack the question of whether securitizer Bible loans were driving

674
00:45:35.701 --> 00:45:38.910
all of this,
but other people have been,
have been asking that question.

675
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.440
<v 1>Okay.</v>

676
00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:45.130
<v 2>Okay.
So,
um,
uh,</v>

677
00:45:45.131 --> 00:45:49.540
we certainly found evidence of high of increase increasing,
um,

678
00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:53.290
uh,
demand,
uh,
in prices.

679
00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:57.790
So it could be the people chasing after chasing the trends.

680
00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:03.040
Um,
but it could be also that,
uh,
the expectation of the,
of the,

681
00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:05.080
uh,
of the,
uh,
of the,

682
00:46:05.081 --> 00:46:09.520
of the liquidation value of the house was going up and made them feel safer

683
00:46:09.521 --> 00:46:12.230
about the borrowing
a,

684
00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:15.700
the riskiness of mortgage applications is increasing and past price,

685
00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:21.520
everybody wants to buy more expensive homes.
Um,
but,
um,

686
00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:27.130
uh,
uh,
that we documented and as I mentioned,

687
00:46:27.131 --> 00:46:29.380
there's this disjunction between the,
the two.

688
00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:34.590
So that's sort of a kind of a flavor for how a professor and some graduate

689
00:46:35.501 --> 00:46:40.030
students look at the crisis you've been reading Posner,

690
00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:43.800
um,
uh,
and um,

691
00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:48.140
you see how somebody tries to put the whole thing together.
Well,
our,

692
00:46:48.141 --> 00:46:52.450
our goal was to kind of deconstruct it.
Let me see if this,

693
00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:58.120
well that's just the kind of more documentary evidence of what I was talking

694
00:46:58.121 --> 00:47:01.600
about.
Um,
and uh,

695
00:47:02.830 --> 00:47:05.320
um,
I don't know.
I've looked at history,

696
00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:10.360
been interested in that and uh,
looked at current data.
So,
um,

697
00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:14.440
without,
uh,
I don't know if we have time for questions or not,
but yeah,

698
00:47:14.441 --> 00:47:16.270
I think there's time for a water

699
00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:24.450
back there.
Notre Dame,

700
00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:30.090
on one of your previous slide I mentioned that the side,
it seemed

701
00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:35.090
<v 3>to be almost constraint and you seem to attribute read that to I guess</v>

702
00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:40.800
potentially greater responsibility on the part of the bankers and not approval

703
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:43.480
increased in a low number of applications.

704
00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:46.600
And I was wondering if you think that that is the case or if there's evidence

705
00:47:46.601 --> 00:47:48.100
that it could just be that there was a,

706
00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:53.140
a constraint on the supply where banks just were not able to issue more loans

707
00:47:53.141 --> 00:47:57.520
due to capital requirements or other financial regulation.

708
00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:03.200
<v 2>The beautiful part about this work is that we're taking,
as given that people,</v>

709
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.780
everybody,

710
00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:08.390
the banks and the borrowers are operating in their own best interests.

711
00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:10.300
Uh,
so that we're,

712
00:48:10.301 --> 00:48:13.310
we're looking at this as sort of an equilibrium outcome where they've taken into

713
00:48:13.311 --> 00:48:17.210
account the potential for the capital constraints and what have you.

714
00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:21.650
So that negative coefficient actually,
um,
you'll see it here,
uh,

715
00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:25.910
this negative coefficient on approvals for a prime versus subprime.

716
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:27.900
Um,
I,

717
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:31.580
my tone of voice may have led you to believe that I thought that was a foolish

718
00:48:31.581 --> 00:48:36.350
thing.
It's certainly no evidence that it's foolish of all,
uh,
at all.
Um,

719
00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:39.080
but it's,
it's an interesting puzzle.
I mean,

720
00:48:39.081 --> 00:48:42.840
we expected to see everybody lifting the flood gates and,
and,

721
00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:45.990
and make writing all these loans.
And the,
the notion that the,
the,

722
00:48:45.991 --> 00:48:50.930
the prime a lenders we're actually clamping down suggests that they were

723
00:48:50.931 --> 00:48:53.220
exercising a,
some,
you know,

724
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:57.200
judgment about quality of loan that resulted in this net negative.

725
00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:59.263
Right.

726
00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:04.960
One last question here.

727
00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:07.300
<v 3>Yes.
So on the same slide</v>

728
00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:16.040
is the same slide.
You also implied that the uh,
the supply side,

729
00:49:16.041 --> 00:49:20.720
the bankers were,
we're not accepting these overleveraged,

730
00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:23.980
uh,
mortgage applications as much as you would expect,
but,

731
00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:28.550
but does your research indicate anything about how over leverage the banks were

732
00:49:28.551 --> 00:49:32.630
themselves in how much capital,
you know,
they were taking out of the market?

733
00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:38.080
<v 2>Um,
so the cow,
the question you're asking,
asking really implies,</v>

734
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:42.950
uh,
uh,
uh,
a point of view about,
um,
uh,

735
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.160
bank capital requirements.
Um,

736
00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:49.420
and certainly I just use the data that I showed you so we didn't use that.
Uh,

737
00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.240
any information,
as you know,

738
00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:56.920
this is a big spider web of different relationships that scales all the way up

739
00:49:56.921 --> 00:49:59.920
to the role,
the government and the role of capital requirements and regulators.

740
00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:02.470
We just didn't,
we didn't pay attention to all of that.

741
00:50:02.471 --> 00:50:04.030
Our job is not to put thing together,

742
00:50:04.031 --> 00:50:09.031
but t two s to see if we can find certain pieces that help us understand whether

743
00:50:10.091 --> 00:50:11.200
decisions were good or bad.

744
00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:13.830
<v 1>Max Roach,
a terrific.</v>
