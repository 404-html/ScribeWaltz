WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.450
While we get settled in are as usual gradual fashion.

2
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.280
I'm going to turn on,
uh,

3
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.390
one of the videos involving the last two CEOs of Polaroid.

4
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.910
And then after that we'll get into our normal routine.

5
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.520
<v 2>Most people thought that the company needed to change,
um,</v>

6
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.330
uh,
not because they thought it was in deep trouble or again,

7
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.590
you hear that in the back burning platform at the time,

8
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.870
but they thought that we needed to find the next big technology,

9
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.800
the next big idea when,

10
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.280
and they felt that it was out there someplace and we would invent it again.

11
00:00:54.281 --> 00:00:57.040
The culture would,
would say,
we'll find it,

12
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.290
we'll invent it and we'll develop it and create better.
Um,

13
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.740
there was not a lot of thought partnering outside or using other people's

14
00:01:05.741 --> 00:01:06.560
technology.

15
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.190
<v 3>I think that's one of the panes probably convinced demise because</v>

16
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.830
it was a member of the family died and that was tough.

17
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.120
Very tough for me and I know tougher,
a lot against,
um,

18
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.450
and almost get weepy about it at times.

19
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.793
<v 1>Oh.</v>

20
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.160
<v 3>And to come to the conclusion</v>

21
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.593
<v 1>that that</v>

22
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.903
<v 3>train,</v>

23
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.160
that that family was based on or that thought that the family was based on the

24
00:01:40.451 --> 00:01:43.360
products and Dr Lands visions and all that,

25
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.500
who is going to change was like saying,
you know,

26
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.220
I'm terrible my analogies,
but,
um,
you know,

27
00:01:52.221 --> 00:01:56.810
the family has got to change guys.
And that was tough.
That was very tough.

28
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.360
But,
um,
and I should have been more forced to.
That's fine.
You know,

29
00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:05.630
I should have probably been,
oh,
it's going to change guys.

30
00:02:05.631 --> 00:02:07.390
And if you can't get on the boat,
you know,

31
00:02:07.391 --> 00:02:09.980
they'll get off in her instead of getting off next week.

32
00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:11.240
You've got to get off the staff or,
no,

33
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.830
<v 2>it clearly had,
uh,
a culture,
uh,</v>

34
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.540
very talented people.
I'm very proud,
great competition.

35
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.740
Um,
highly intellectual,

36
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.670
very self sufficient,
can do,
uh,

37
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.940
well to work very hard.
Uh,

38
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.130
but a very entitled culture.

39
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.170
A very clear to me that they felt everyone felt entitled to.

40
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.550
Um,
they're things,

41
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.200
whether it be material or intellectual,
uh,

42
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.810
their role,
their department.
Uh,
so,
and also,
you know,

43
00:02:54.811 --> 00:02:58.350
their benefits,
probably the richest benefits.

44
00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.980
A Houston company,

45
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:03.850
which who are consultants compensation cause all the richest benefits they'd

46
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:05.050
ever seen in America.

47
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.080
<v 3>Where are we spoiled?
Because we made large margins on film.</v>

48
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.403
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

49
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.160
<v 3>I think possibly that's,
you could argue that point.
We weren't,
I mean we had,</v>

50
00:03:17.161 --> 00:03:22.161
competition is an instant photography was competing constantly with conventional

51
00:03:23.071 --> 00:03:23.904
photography.

52
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.230
Now if you call image making the field to call it [inaudible] photography,

53
00:03:30.631 --> 00:03:33.840
if you narrow it down to insert the diary,
we had no competition until 19,

54
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.591
whatever it was,

55
00:03:34.591 --> 00:03:39.000
76 or something like that and go that came in and then Fuji came in later.

56
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.490
Um,
did that make us complacent?
Is that the question?

57
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.873
<v 1>MMM,</v>

58
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:47.623
<v 3>possibly.</v>

59
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.843
<v 1>MMM.</v>

60
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.480
<v 3>I never felt I was resting.</v>

61
00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.420
I always felt I had more on my plate that I could barely choke down.

62
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.120
We had an inferiority complex I think for a long time.

63
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.070
And that the quality of instant photography was not up to the quality of

64
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.320
conventional photography.
Um,

65
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.240
and we were spent hours,

66
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.150
hours and hours and millions and billions of dollars,
I guess almost focusing on,

67
00:04:20.151 --> 00:04:25.120
uh,
getting closing that quality yet.
And we got pretty darn close to me.

68
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:26.650
And,
um,

69
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.500
I don't think we ever got par exactly,

70
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.180
but we got very close.
Did we spend too much time on it?

71
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.943
<v 1>Well,</v>

72
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.453
<v 3>it's,
um,</v>

73
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.750
how much time did we spend on trying to be good?

74
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.600
I don't know if you can put a value on it.
Maybe we did.
Maybe we did.

75
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.510
Dr Land was obsessed with it.

76
00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.110
I became infection infected and was obsessed by spend a lot of my lifetime

77
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.450
trying to get that product on a level playing field.

78
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.900
<v 2>I think every product has a life cycle.
Um,
I think every company has a lifecycle.</v>

79
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.850
I think every human being has a lifecycle.

80
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.390
I think you have to recognize part of your job is as a CEO is to recognize where

81
00:05:20.211 --> 00:05:24.410
you are in that life cycle and not where you wish to be.

82
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:25.523
<v 3>I think</v>

83
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.530
certain members of the board will surely interested in that.

84
00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:35.580
We spend more of our energy and effort,

85
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.220
um,
covering the big marketing picture,
um,

86
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.840
and not,
uh,

87
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.110
be solely influenced by the research and engineering kind of mentality.

88
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.010
They wanted us to pay attention more to what the customers were potentially

89
00:05:56.641 --> 00:06:01.460
thinking about versus what we thought we had the grand idea and really all had

90
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.640
on now,
which I think historically

91
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.903
you might

92
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.070
too simplistically say that,
uh,

93
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.030
that was the origin of the company was more of the invention of the idea.

94
00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:19.730
And then here it is customer.
Um,

95
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.000
versus what do you need out there and let us try to provide it to you.

96
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:29.450
We never,
I think that a full concurrence on what marketing you've met,

97
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.440
there were those that said,
well,
Gee,
you should have raised the price,
the film,

98
00:06:33.441 --> 00:06:36.590
or cut the price of the film and you know,
price the film wasn't,

99
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.960
it wasn't gonna change it.
This was technological change.

100
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.730
This was not a marketing problem.
My price break at the time was under $50.

101
00:06:43.731 --> 00:06:46.180
I thought that electronic image cameras had to get down to,

102
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.250
and I thought in 10 years they would get there and low and behold sake,

103
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.990
and just about 10 years for it to get there.
Um,
but I,

104
00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.930
<v 0>what'd you think of those guys?
Do I go?</v>

105
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.943
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

106
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.173
Great.

107
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.470
<v 0>We're going to see part of each slide.
Oh,
there we go.
Um,</v>

108
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.210
we've got two cases this week.
Polaroid an Enron.

109
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:34.160
Uh,
there are two cases of dramatic success,
uh,

110
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:35.770
and then dramatic failure.

111
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.150
And in understanding capitalism,

112
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.570
think back to everything we've done so far.

113
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.440
The idea of abrupt change of equilibrium,

114
00:07:49.931 --> 00:07:54.790
always being dislodged,
equilibrium always disrupted.

115
00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:56.653
Uh,

116
00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:02.160
the CARDIOTHORACIC systems case from the end of last week

117
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:08.020
was exactly such a story.
And Polaroid,

118
00:08:08.021 --> 00:08:10.140
it's very much such a story.
Uh,

119
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.220
and Ron has a darker cache to it.
Uh,

120
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.430
it entails,
uh,

121
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.940
the darker side of the human soul,

122
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:27.640
and we'll hear about that from a Jim Alexander,
uh,

123
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.480
who lived right through the middle of it on Wednesday.

124
00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.330
This is a

125
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.450
tracing of the sales volume of Polaroid,

126
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:47.370
uh,
from 1957 until the firm's demise.

127
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.940
Uh,
one of the things you can,

128
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:56.870
that is of interest about this diagram is that the sales at death,

129
00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.790
we're not dramatically below their all time peak.

130
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:09.750
So sales alone don't tell you enough to understand what happened.

131
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:17.020
Uh,
and this is the stock price

132
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.590
and this is what our stock price is about.

133
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.520
What's the,
what are the drivers?

134
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.070
I'm not asking for anything fancy here.
What are the drivers?
Yes,

135
00:09:34.071 --> 00:09:34.904
back left.

136
00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:43.420
Okay.
Expected future earnings,
uh,

137
00:09:43.421 --> 00:09:48.421
along with some special sauce having to do with future strategy to maintain

138
00:09:49.271 --> 00:09:50.104
share price

139
00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.700
and how would interest rates play into this?

140
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:58.423
<v 1>Wow.</v>

141
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:01.901
<v 0>Okay.</v>

142
00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:06.901
But just for those of us who are from Illinois,

143
00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:13.720
uh,
spell it out a little at a time.
Who's from Illinois here?
I apologize.

144
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:20.980
I should have said Indiana.
I'm from there.
Okay.
Spell it out for us.

145
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:21.690
<v 4>Oh,</v>

146
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:25.750
a lower interest rate will yield a higher stock price because there'll be a west

147
00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:30.751
of a trade off between a spending today and once you get tomorrow,

148
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.790
<v 0>well,
sort of,
Jim,
do you want to help with that?</v>

149
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:39.443
<v 1>Uh,</v>

150
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:47.500
<v 4>they really are a projection of future cash flows to the shareholders that just,</v>

151
00:10:49.671 --> 00:10:52.820
that uh,
it used to be in the fifties,
sixties,

152
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:58.330
seventies dividends that where the bulk of those assumptions and today it's a,

153
00:10:58.791 --> 00:11:03.020
it's a rare company that pays more than one or 2% dividend yield on that stock

154
00:11:03.021 --> 00:11:06.740
price.
So really it's a projection of earnings encapsulated.

155
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.230
And when you look at that chart,

156
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.460
what you see is the typical problem with a lot of growth stocks and that is that

157
00:11:13.461 --> 00:11:18.461
people buy onto a whole new paradigm and then extrapolate for decades.

158
00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.840
Uh,
and you end up with a,

159
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:25.250
with a stock price that really bears no resemblance to a,

160
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:26.720
to current earnings

161
00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:29.740
<v 0>and an increase in interest rates.
How would that,</v>

162
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.290
<v 4>well that would uh,</v>

163
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:35.610
an increase in all other things being equal and increasing and current interest

164
00:11:35.611 --> 00:11:40.170
rates would lower the stock price because you'd have to be compensated for the,

165
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.580
the extra time value of money involved.
Right.

166
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.791
<v 0>Sales.</v>

167
00:11:50.791 --> 00:11:55.791
This is a curb in red that we saw in the slide with a longterm debt super posed.

168
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:04.380
Sales reads on the left axis and depth leads reads on the right.

169
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.310
You think learn from that slide.

170
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:15.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

171
00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.420
<v 0>You want to get this?
This is not a,
this is not a curve ball.</v>

172
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:22.443
<v 1>Okay.</v>

173
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:28.710
<v 0>Polaroid didn't have any debt until relatively recently in their lifecycle.</v>

174
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:33.010
We pretty much started during the recession in the 1980s.
Right.

175
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.790
Was the debt likely to be important there toward the end?
Well,

176
00:12:39.791 --> 00:12:42.920
yeah cause they filed for bankruptcy.
They did.

177
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.990
But what was the precise event that caused them to file it?
Sit in the queue.

178
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:52.530
The 10 Q filing in the case they might notice that takeover attempts?

179
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:54.843
<v 1>No</v>

180
00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.850
<v 0>back.
She cock</v>

181
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:04.090
<v 1>nine 11.
Uh,
not really.</v>

182
00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.270
<v 0>It was related to nine 11.</v>

183
00:13:07.271 --> 00:13:12.271
What happened was they failed to make a scheduled payment on the death and that

184
00:13:13.031 --> 00:13:17.770
triggered an avalanche of adverse results.

185
00:13:17.771 --> 00:13:21.220
Drove the stock price close to zero.

186
00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.500
And how does the firm ended up w what becomes of it?

187
00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:28.783
<v 1>It gets</v>

188
00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:33.530
sold,

189
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.580
<v 0>sold to private equity.
And uh,</v>

190
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:45.420
how much of its value do you think is of its peak value?

191
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.940
Is there at the end when it's sold to private equity?

192
00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.030
You don't have to give me a number.
Just give me a lot of level.

193
00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:03.440
I think last sold for 265 million at that end stage.

194
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:05.870
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

195
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:09.230
<v 0>Now what was the value proposition?
I guess that's a hint.</v>

196
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:11.001
What was the,

197
00:14:11.001 --> 00:14:15.620
what would have caused you here is a Polaroid Pronto,

198
00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:21.980
which hasn't made a picture in a lifetime.
Uh,

199
00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:26.180
what would it cost?
I probably bought over the years,

200
00:14:26.181 --> 00:14:27.500
three or four of these cameras.

201
00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:33.430
I was never terrifically happy with them.
And have you ever owned one?

202
00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.310
You're all way too young.
Almost all.

203
00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.670
<v 1>Tell us,
can we get a mic here?
Yeah.</v>

204
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.720
<v 0>Uh,
yeah.
I got one as a birthday present and it was fun.</v>

205
00:14:46.721 --> 00:14:51.230
Novelty for like three months.
Uh Huh.
How,
how old were you?

206
00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:53.520
Um,
I was eight.
Okay.

207
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:58.450
So you probably didn't happen independent account for buying Phil?
No.

208
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.720
Do you have any memory of how the film's price compared?
Well,

209
00:15:03.721 --> 00:15:06.860
you didn't buy the camera?
No,
I didn't know anything about the pricing.

210
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:11.990
I just liked that it came out instant.
Okay.
Did anyone own one?
Edit,
edit,
edit,

211
00:15:11.991 --> 00:15:16.410
age older than eight
back center?

212
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.430
Uh,
I had my grandmother's old one,
I was 11,

213
00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.330
so I guess I can guess what you paid for the camera?
Yeah,

214
00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:33.500
I mean it was a hand me down and I took like 10 pictures with it and that there

215
00:15:33.501 --> 00:15:37.370
was no film left.
And I asked my mom if we could buy more and she was like,
no,

216
00:15:37.371 --> 00:15:41.450
we're just going to get a disposable.
Okay.
So

217
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.680
the sales metaphor in the case,
anybody remember what,
what,

218
00:15:47.681 --> 00:15:50.530
what analogy do they draw in the end?

219
00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.640
The marketing strategy back there?
Yes.

220
00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.860
Raise and boy and help us understand that.

221
00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:01.590
<v 5>Yeah.
Basically,
um,
you know,
a current instance,
a company that sells razors,</v>

222
00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.640
they're not making that much money on the actual price of the razor.

223
00:16:04.641 --> 00:16:07.830
And you know,
some can argue they could even give that to you.
They can,

224
00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.810
their profit really comes from that.

225
00:16:09.811 --> 00:16:12.650
People have to buy blades in order to use the razor.

226
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.080
<v 0>Okay,
great.
Can we think of any,
uh,</v>

227
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:20.170
any other analogies in marketing strategies here in the alligator shirt,

228
00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.140
printers and ink cartridges,
printers and cartridges.
You,

229
00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:31.780
you've noticed that the printer itself or nothing and the cartridges cost your

230
00:16:31.781 --> 00:16:32.770
first born child?

231
00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.173
<v 1>MMM.</v>

232
00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:39.840
<v 0>Yeah.
And it,
it's not a bad strategy,
right?</v>

233
00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:43.410
Because most of us,
uh,

234
00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:49.820
try to try to minimize the initial cash outlay when we buy something and then

235
00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:53.430
you get hit in the back of the head by the maintenance of it.

236
00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:58.850
And that was the strategy for Polaroid and it was in some periods a very

237
00:17:01.921 --> 00:17:05.250
successful strategy.
Um,

238
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:10.410
what's the value proposition?
We get two dimensions here.
Not Very,

239
00:17:10.411 --> 00:17:11.940
let's put them together.
Actually,

240
00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:20.350
the quality dimension think this is 1948.

241
00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:24.610
This is the first Polaroid camera on the retail market.

242
00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.673
<v 1>MMM.</v>

243
00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:31.040
<v 0>It was much too,
I was nine at the time,</v>

244
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:34.150
so I can empathize with you guys.
Uh,

245
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:39.080
but I was nowhere near rich enough to purchase a Polaroid land camera was a,

246
00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:43.520
it was a very upscale,
fancy idea.
Uh,

247
00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:48.521
but I did see pictures made with it and they were Sepia tone,

248
00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:54.000
uh,
and muddy,
a very low contrast.

249
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:58.810
They were very bad compared with,
uh,

250
00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:01.560
what could be produced by conventional photography.

251
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.020
And the,

252
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:09.420
the question was let's think about three kinds of consumers.

253
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.260
And this was largely a consumer product.

254
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:18.090
It had scientific and business applications in industrial applications,

255
00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.940
but from lands point of view all the way along,

256
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:26.310
a real darling was the amateur photographer.

257
00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:28.243
And

258
00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:30.490
<v 1>okay,</v>

259
00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:33.340
<v 0>let's use indifference curves</v>

260
00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:36.030
in this space.

261
00:18:36.031 --> 00:18:40.750
So we've got speed on the horizontal dimension and quality on the vertical

262
00:18:40.751 --> 00:18:43.870
dimension.
And a person who says,

263
00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:47.140
I'm indifferent between all these outcomes,

264
00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.310
how would we describe that person's preference?

265
00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.800
Sorry,
a professional if,
if he's indifferent to the speed.
Um,

266
00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:06.440
Lincoln Lincoln's earnings quality.
I'm on April.
Go to what?
Kate,
you wave.
Oh,

267
00:19:06.441 --> 00:19:11.310
hi.
It would be a professional or perfectionist,
right?

268
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:13.680
The model might be ansul Adams,

269
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:20.320
somebody who makes wonderful pictures and is willing to wait and is virtually in

270
00:19:21.401 --> 00:19:22.730
different to the time dementia.

271
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.600
So that person is trying to climb in this direction.

272
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.110
Indifference curve difference club.

273
00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:30.563
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

274
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:35.320
<v 0>And this person,
Tim,</v>

275
00:19:35.321 --> 00:19:36.460
what's this person up to?

276
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:39.953
<v 1>MMM,</v>

277
00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:42.700
<v 0>they're trying to go out that way as fast as they can.</v>

278
00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:50.020
They're trying to get faster and faster pictures.
Yeah.
Cheap thrills.

279
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:52.630
Just like our friends back here when he was eight,

280
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.430
all they want is speed.
Well,

281
00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:01.260
how many customers do you think fit either of these descriptions?
A few fit.

282
00:20:01.261 --> 00:20:05.760
The first description,
a few fit,
the second description,
but most

283
00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:10.470
are more like this.
They have a trade off,

284
00:20:10.471 --> 00:20:12.360
which I've simplified with straight lines.

285
00:20:12.361 --> 00:20:16.470
They probably would actually go in toward the origin like this.

286
00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.310
Uh,

287
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:23.390
but these people want some combination of speed and quality and the central

288
00:20:29.011 --> 00:20:31.200
drive,
uh,

289
00:20:31.201 --> 00:20:36.201
for the Polaroid land camera from 1948 all the way to the end was to do as well

290
00:20:41.341 --> 00:20:46.341
as possible in competing for the business of these people who were trading.

291
00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:52.450
Uh,
the two dimensions,
uh,
the SX 70,

292
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:54.280
uh,

293
00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:59.280
which was in some ways the high point of Polaroids history and in other ways,

294
00:21:00.131 --> 00:21:05.010
the low point.
Anybody remember what was wrong with the SX 70

295
00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:13.470
had battery problems it had.
Yeah.
How do you remember from the case how,

296
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.430
how the,
how the battery was related to the thing?

297
00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:21.440
Okay.
Um,
I think Jim,

298
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:26.240
Jim Alexander and I are the only people here who ever,
ever experienced this.

299
00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:31.690
The battery was included in the film pack and for the first couple of years they

300
00:21:32.601 --> 00:21:35.690
made it.
About half the batteries were no good.

301
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:41.710
So if you spent a premium for the film pack and the battery wouldn't make the

302
00:21:42.261 --> 00:21:45.800
camera run,
you are likely to be on an unhappy customer.

303
00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:50.660
And they had a very high complaint rate about that.

304
00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.970
Does anybody remember what they did to resolve the battery problem

305
00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:59.140
back or yeah,
up here.
That's fine.

306
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.920
They might have punctured their own butteries.
Yeah,

307
00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.800
they went into the battery manufacturing business,

308
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:09.220
which is as we'll see in a minute,

309
00:22:09.221 --> 00:22:14.221
it's an integration move where they reduce their reliance on outside suppliers,

310
00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:20.730
but create a whole set of new problems for themselves because it turns out it's

311
00:22:21.011 --> 00:22:25.540
not for easy to manufacture batteries.
Well,
um,

312
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:30.600
the Polaroid SX 70 had gained enormous ground on conventional photography on the

313
00:22:33.641 --> 00:22:37.780
quality dementia.
It was a lot better than the old Polaroid.

314
00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:44.100
A buddy was still nobody drunk or sober.

315
00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:45.490
Uh,

316
00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:50.490
would argue that the picture is produced by the Polaroid SX 70.

317
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:56.190
We're as good as those produced by a conventional single single single,

318
00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.680
what's it called?
Slr Single Lens Reflex,

319
00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:06.430
35 millimeter camera with competent processing.

320
00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:12.660
And so they were in a position where they had a deficit on the quality side,

321
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.640
which they never actually overcame.

322
00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.400
They did better and better on picture quality,

323
00:23:18.401 --> 00:23:23.080
but they never really got to where they matched conventional photography.

324
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.450
Uh,
so the,

325
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:29.590
I've drawn this so that they're on a higher indifference curve for this

326
00:23:29.591 --> 00:23:33.940
particular consumer.
Then the conventional photography.
Uh,

327
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.780
but there were several problems lurking in that.

328
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:42.183
One of them.

329
00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:48.270
How could this have happened without any improvement in either the film or the

330
00:23:48.831 --> 00:23:50.780
camera?
On the conventional side,

331
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:55.850
the conventional photographic technology,

332
00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:02.030
uh,
gained ground on the speed dimension and gained a lot of about

333
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:05.743
<v 1>mmm.</v>

334
00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:12.290
<v 0>With the advent of the one hour photo.
Okay.
So the one hour photo process</v>

335
00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:19.350
talk three days or five business days and brought it down to an error.

336
00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.610
You dropped the film off,
go have a cup of coffee,
come back.

337
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:30.510
So that conventional photography with no internal improvement was closing the

338
00:24:33.191 --> 00:24:38.191
speed gap and diminishing total demand for instant photography.

339
00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.040
Um,
now there's a,

340
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:48.070
there's an incident at about this stage between Polaroid and Kodak neighboring.

341
00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:49.870
Remember how that goes?

342
00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:57.420
How had had Kodak played any part in Polaroids business?

343
00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.350
Any cooperative part in the early years?

344
00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:04.570
<v 1>Sasha?</v>

345
00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:07.660
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

346
00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:12.660
It pull up at Kodak was manufacturing for Polaroid and as it manufactured,

347
00:25:16.421 --> 00:25:18.910
it learned the secret sauce

348
00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:25.740
and then went into the business competing and competing effectively against

349
00:25:28.151 --> 00:25:33.151
Polaroid with a tricked up reconfiguration of Polaroids technology.

350
00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:38.300
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

351
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.850
<v 0>And Polaroid responded with a washer.</v>

352
00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:43.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

353
00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.580
<v 0>And they won the lawsuit.</v>

354
00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:46.440
<v 1>Okay.</v>

355
00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:51.350
<v 0>They nonetheless got screw.
How could that be?
They win.</v>

356
00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:56.100
They get a $1 billion in damages or just a little short of $1 billion in

357
00:25:56.101 --> 00:26:00.640
damages.
And yet Polaroids,
uh,

358
00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:04.890
theft is all but lethal to them.

359
00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:09.370
<v 5>I think it took them a lot of time and effort to fight that case.</v>

360
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.670
And when they finally got the reward,
it wasn't as much as they expected.

361
00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:17.080
And then there was also this comment later that they kind of wished that Kodak

362
00:26:17.081 --> 00:26:21.310
had been merged with Kodak and that hadn't even happened either because Kodak

363
00:26:21.311 --> 00:26:24.270
did not had too much of an ego kind of do that either.

364
00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:28.160
<v 0>Both sides had a lot of ego.
Okay.
So that's,
that's you,</v>

365
00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:32.790
you got what was needed was an immediate intervention.

366
00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:37.280
The case went on almost 15 years.
And Bob,

367
00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.730
what was going on?

368
00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:43.910
Kodak was eating into the competitive position occupied by Polaroid.

369
00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:51.840
There's of course something else going on here and that's the emergence of

370
00:26:51.841 --> 00:26:56.841
digital and digital photography with one important asterisk,

371
00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:03.160
a trumped everything and it didn't stand still.

372
00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:08.540
It traced a path and it's still on that path of virtually continuous

373
00:27:09.061 --> 00:27:09.894
improvement.

374
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:15.770
A $200 digital camera now is as good as a $10,000 digital camera a decade ago.

375
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:21.150
And the

376
00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:27.390
hands up if you use a digital camera.
Yeah,
everybody.

377
00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:29.670
And on average,

378
00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:34.980
my guess is that your digital cameras are about like that.

379
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.850
They're tiny.
Are they hard to work?

380
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:45.400
Do the batteries fail?
It's only one thing they don't do very well.
What's that?

381
00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:53.360
Well,
they don't,
they actually do that better than conventional cameras,

382
00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.480
but no camera does that very well.

383
00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:01.190
What's my mother hates him?
Why would,

384
00:28:01.191 --> 00:28:03.820
why would a 95 year old,
they don't,

385
00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:09.340
they don't print her idea of a photo in something you hold in your hand and it's

386
00:28:10.581 --> 00:28:15.470
not a real photo unless she can hold in their hand,
put it on the coffee table,

387
00:28:15.471 --> 00:28:19.250
show it to her friends from the coffee table.
Right.

388
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:23.600
And Edwin land actually agreed with that and it was part of his,

389
00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:24.993
uh,

390
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:30.070
part of his infatuation with the original Polaroid idea was that you make the

391
00:28:33.051 --> 00:28:33.884
picture,

392
00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:38.300
waive it for a minute until it dries and hand it to the people who are in the,

393
00:28:38.301 --> 00:28:39.134
in the view.

394
00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.013
<v 1>No,</v>

395
00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:48.480
<v 0>we're going to go back to the case in this informal way in just a minute,</v>

396
00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:54.140
but I'm going to talk about integration here because vertical integration is a

397
00:28:54.871 --> 00:28:59.280
huge part of the Polaroid story and it's a part,

398
00:28:59.281 --> 00:29:04.080
an important part of most,
uh,
corporate stories.

399
00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.610
Vertical integration is the,
it,

400
00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:14.790
the think of the dimension that starts with a raw product,

401
00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:18.240
uh,
or coming out of a mine,

402
00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:23.610
a sugar cane coming out of a field,
uh,

403
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:26.250
bananas coming out of a rain forest.

404
00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:32.300
And then there is a progression toward a manufacturing or processing plant or

405
00:29:34.171 --> 00:29:38.880
perhaps a series of manufacturing steps.
Uh,
then,

406
00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:39.360
uh,

407
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:44.360
the distribution of the product to wholesalers and from wholesalers to retailers

408
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:51.250
and from retailers to the family picnic and a fully,

409
00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:55.600
a full story of vertical integration looks like this.

410
00:29:55.650 --> 00:30:00.070
Everything's in the corporate box from beginning to end.

411
00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:05.890
The plus of that is obvious.

412
00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:11.970
The trouble you might have with your suppliers is completely eliminated.

413
00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:15.820
And the,

414
00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:21.780
the ability to direct the details of every step,

415
00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.550
uh,
is seemingly unlimited.

416
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.740
The downside there,
at least two obvious downsides.

417
00:30:29.741 --> 00:30:34.741
One is a lot of companies are good at the front end without being good at the

418
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:38.140
backend.
So if they go from the front end,

419
00:30:38.141 --> 00:30:43.141
from marketing or retail product all the way back to the first steps of its

420
00:30:43.211 --> 00:30:44.044
production,

421
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:49.360
they may well screw up because it's just not what they do well.

422
00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:55.450
Uh,
that's one difficulty.
Another difficulty is governance.

423
00:30:55.740 --> 00:31:00.740
The management of a vertically integrated company is a very complicated process

424
00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:08.800
and it tends,
as with the railroads we saw a week ago,

425
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.040
it tends to bloat the administrative apparatus,

426
00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:17.520
make it have many dimensions from top to plant for uh,

427
00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.650
and presents serious challenges.

428
00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.440
Now that's only half the story.

429
00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:27.700
The other half of vertical integration has to do with ideas.

430
00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:33.190
There's a pair of the,
what I just talked about has to do with physical stuff,

431
00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.600
material things.

432
00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:39.280
There is also an intellectual track or ideational track,

433
00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:45.180
which starts with dreams or ideas drawn on the back of a Napkin and then invoke

434
00:31:47.561 --> 00:31:51.160
science and engineering and design and a marketing plan.

435
00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.510
It is in effect the brains behind the lower box.

436
00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:01.380
And with Polaroid you had a fully integrated company.

437
00:32:03.491 --> 00:32:05.500
Now they didn't do mines and fields,

438
00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:11.490
but you had a high degree of vertical integration in the ideas process and

439
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:18.330
almost as high a degree of integration in the material,
uh,

440
00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:19.333
<v 1>process.</v>

441
00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:25.710
<v 0>So you end up there now.</v>

442
00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:30.163
<v 1>Okay.</v>

443
00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:35.500
<v 0>Why did this company fail?
Let's,
uh,</v>

444
00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:39.280
let's,
let's start with,

445
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:43.400
I've got a warm calls,
Ahmed.

446
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:49.340
Yeah,
I'm mad.
Why do you think the company failed

447
00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:56.880
feel because of the capabilities and beliefs of the 1980s,

448
00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:01.200
um,
that influenced their strategies?

449
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:06.350
Couldn't they were more technology driven and not market driven and reasons so

450
00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:11.550
forth because of the senior management.
Okay.
That's in the chain.

451
00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.410
Uh,
who was this Edwin Land Guy

452
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:22.310
who's a scientist?
He was a scientist.
When does he get his start as an inventor?

453
00:33:22.311 --> 00:33:26.190
Does anybody remember from the case?
37,
pardon?
Oh,

454
00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.810
Harvard College.
He's an undergraduate.

455
00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:35.850
Any advance Polaroid filters.
Clever lab.

456
00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:42.440
And he gets fixated I think on a certain view of how you do wonderful things and

457
00:33:46.681 --> 00:33:49.020
it focuses on law,

458
00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:53.760
costly time consuming research.
Uh,

459
00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:59.100
Lindsay Jackson.
Uh,
anything to add to that

460
00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:05.300
about,
about land or about the causes of failure?
Oh,

461
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:08.200
I think did go off of,
uh,
land.

462
00:34:09.490 --> 00:34:14.350
It was genius when he was able to do and he was so technology driven and he was

463
00:34:14.351 --> 00:34:19.351
able to create such a successful company and at a certain point they did have

464
00:34:20.021 --> 00:34:24.220
any competition or no real competition,
no direct competition.

465
00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:28.060
And because the technology was what was driving them and proved to be
successful.

466
00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:29.590
As the company grew older,

467
00:34:29.591 --> 00:34:32.940
they got fixated on this idea that technology was with was what,

468
00:34:32.941 --> 00:34:36.250
what was going to drive them.
So they were hesitant to change.
That's terrific.

469
00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:41.640
So we combine an initial fixation on a very intellectualized r and d process,

470
00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:52.120
which is very slow and mildly contemptuous of marketing cutting.

471
00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:58.830
And we combine that with a wildly successful market product,

472
00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:05.400
which was not designed by careful analysis of consumer indifference curves.

473
00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:09.400
It was designed by Edwin Lands,

474
00:35:09.401 --> 00:35:12.370
passion for this product.

475
00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:16.450
He correctly guessed,
he lucked out.

476
00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:22.890
He correctly guessed that it would command and enormous,

477
00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:26.680
uh,
consumer market.
And sure enough it did.

478
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000
So we've got a kind of path dependence story there and Ben Chu,

479
00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:41.430
uh,
is there anything left to talk about on this or are we done

480
00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:47.100
when Polaroid was developing its newer technologies,

481
00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:51.690
it's important to realize that it's not that they were just stuck in the stone

482
00:35:51.691 --> 00:35:56.640
age.
They were trying to develop date made forays into digital imagery.
Yeah.

483
00:35:56.670 --> 00:36:00.670
But they still were
there,

484
00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:05.700
were still shackled by the idea of making money with the razor blades,

485
00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:11.040
a marketing strategy and really making money with putting on film.

486
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:15.950
Absolutely.
There's a wonderful quote toward the end of the page.
You guys read,

487
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:20.560
you remember it?
Yeah.
There's no need.

488
00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:24.570
You don't need to,
I can tell it.
Ah,
here it is.

489
00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:29.520
The uh,
um,
they're talking about what a wonderful,

490
00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:31.093
um,

491
00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:36.110
and highly marketable device the digital camera is and the,

492
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:39.230
and this is a,
um,

493
00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:43.890
a marketing person talking to a senior executive and the senior executives

494
00:36:43.891 --> 00:36:48.060
responses.
Where's the film?
That's where the money is.

495
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.140
And of course there is no film and there is no money in film.

496
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.480
All the money is in the hardware.

497
00:36:55.560 --> 00:37:00.030
And that was a hard idea for Polaroids,

498
00:37:00.031 --> 00:37:05.031
top management to square with the initial model based based on razors and razor

499
00:37:06.811 --> 00:37:08.400
blades.
The,

500
00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:11.940
there's another idea that appears in,

501
00:37:11.941 --> 00:37:16.830
this is one of the papers cited at the end of the,
the uh,
case.

502
00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.430
There's another idea there that may be important and it's called bounded

503
00:37:20.431 --> 00:37:25.110
rationality.
Hum.
If bounded rationality is a familiar concept,

504
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:31.740
okay,
we should stop.
And talk about it.
Uh,
Edwin land,

505
00:37:31.741 --> 00:37:33.930
let's say his Iq was 290,

506
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:39.840
uh,
I,
since they divide by age,

507
00:37:39.841 --> 00:37:43.620
I think he would've had to be about age three when it was measured for that to

508
00:37:43.621 --> 00:37:48.570
be even logically possible.
But,
uh,
that's,

509
00:37:48.571 --> 00:37:53.060
suppose he's the smartest guy in the world.
Uh,

510
00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:56.310
he nonetheless thinks in bounded rationality.

511
00:37:57.330 --> 00:38:01.380
And what that means is in order to get started thinking about something,

512
00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:05.790
you have to explicitly or implicitly make a bunch of assumptions.

513
00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:12.330
And those assumptions are typically arbitrary.

514
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:18.840
You can't examine every aspect of every assumption and ever get anything done.

515
00:38:18.841 --> 00:38:23.580
Intellectually.
It's a true statement.
Uh,

516
00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:28.610
and the task of managing a company is exceedingly complex and Edwin land and

517
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:40.000
Mack booth and the other people,

518
00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:44.810
you have this very messy chart here that I took down from the,

519
00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.610
the case.
Uh,

520
00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:51.810
none of these senior executives was ultimately able to think in a way that was

521
00:38:54.551 --> 00:38:59.260
effective because the bounding assumptions,
uh,
prohibited it.

522
00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:01.443
<v 1>And</v>

523
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:04.970
<v 0>what's so hard about this?</v>

524
00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:10.900
What would make it hard to run Polaroid for Ford Motor Company?

525
00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.260
Uh,
what?
Yes,
because the assumptions,

526
00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:23.121
<v 6>all right.</v>

527
00:39:23.121 --> 00:39:26.690
To begin with was basically a research driven company and the assumptions that

528
00:39:26.691 --> 00:39:31.280
they were making,
the benchmark was the [inaudible] research different company,

529
00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:36.110
which in effect was not correct because as the markets were changing,

530
00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:40.910
if SAP [inaudible] ability to be nimble and respond to the competition that was

531
00:39:40.911 --> 00:39:41.330
there.

532
00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:42.640
<v 0>Okay,
great.
Is there,</v>

533
00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:47.070
is there an analogy and what happened to them in anything about the

534
00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:48.950
CARDIOTHORACIC systems case?

535
00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:55.070
What was the,
what I thought Karen did,

536
00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:57.880
Sharon Sharon did a fabulous job of teaching it.

537
00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:03.580
And why was that?
The two artery strategy force,

538
00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:07.600
a cardiothoracic systems had to be abandoned.

539
00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:12.830
Remember some of you said it.

540
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:19.700
Well it is this,
that the companies who were making the,

541
00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:24.140
the devices for nonsurgical intervention,

542
00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:29.090
the stamps and the little balloons and all that stuff were what kind of

543
00:40:29.091 --> 00:40:32.930
companies,
huge well funded companies,

544
00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:36.590
which we're not going to let somebody come in and take market share without

545
00:40:36.591 --> 00:40:39.950
developing a new step of competitive device.

546
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:46.270
And one of the very hard things about running a big company is that you have to

547
00:40:46.851 --> 00:40:51.851
be aware of all the other players out there who may be doing something to damage

548
00:40:52.341 --> 00:40:56.470
your market.
They probably already been trying to damage your market.

549
00:40:57.220 --> 00:41:00.260
They are probably not even thinking much about you,

550
00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:06.400
but instead trying to develop their own bound Dively rational idea of their

551
00:41:07.821 --> 00:41:11.840
company.
And in this case,

552
00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:16.910
Polaroid was badly bitten both by,
uh,

553
00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:22.220
a one hour film processing,
uh,
and by,
uh,

554
00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:26.810
digitals.
And in the case of the one hour film processing,

555
00:41:26.811 --> 00:41:31.811
it wasn't even the processors so much who were in competition with Polaroid,

556
00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:37.040
but the conventional film people such as Kodak.

557
00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:44.410
<v 1>So</v>

558
00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:50.380
<v 0>part of the story then is bounded rationality.</v>

559
00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:55.440
Part of it has to do with drawing the wrong wrong lessons from early success.

560
00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:00.430
Part of it has to do with something totally irrational,

561
00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:04.620
which was the commitment to a founder figure.

562
00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:10.180
Those is it generally the case that Brennan engineers run huge companies which,

563
00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.540
uh,
produce the product based on their ideas.

564
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:18.110
So generally it's not generally the case.

565
00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:22.760
I mean we can all name cases,
but in general,

566
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:28.600
the engineers who create devices are forced out of top management and replaced

567
00:42:34.581 --> 00:42:37.640
by people who are general managers.

568
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:42.140
And that's what happened.
That's what happened to Polaroid.

569
00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:44.120
But it happened too late.

570
00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:50.580
It happened much to right now,
if you were going to save Polaroid,

571
00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:53.790
let's say in the 1980s,

572
00:42:55.080 --> 00:43:00.080
let's suppose you are Mac booth and it's your task to give this company the best

573
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:07.740
chance of preserving its value going into the future,
what would you do?

574
00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:13.730
Or what they did do was a hell of a lot of r and D on a long string of projects

575
00:43:13.741 --> 00:43:16.500
which fail right from up.

576
00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:19.380
Some of them were artistic or engineering successes,

577
00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:22.020
but none of them were economic successes.

578
00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:28.210
Polar vision was a disaster.
Helio's was a,

579
00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:31.330
uh,
was actually a really good product,

580
00:43:31.331 --> 00:43:35.170
but they didn't manage to recoup their investment.
Uh,

581
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:39.590
what would you have done if you're,
can we have the mic?

582
00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:42.100
I'm about to cold call you.
You're ready?

583
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:45.783
Okay.

584
00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.500
<v 5>Okay.
I'm actually visiting.</v>

585
00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:52.910
<v 0>Well,
I'm going to cold call you anyway.</v>

586
00:43:57.070 --> 00:44:01.660
The nice thing is you don't have anything at risk.
Okay,

587
00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:05.200
well you didn't read the case,
so that's unfair.
Um,

588
00:44:06.070 --> 00:44:10.210
are you okay,
go ahead.
Uh,

589
00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:12.100
what my tube done to save this company?

590
00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:14.570
<v 5>I really do agree with,
with boots side.</v>

591
00:44:14.571 --> 00:44:18.380
He said that he would have probably merged with Fuji and kind of use the best

592
00:44:18.381 --> 00:44:22.010
aspects of both cause Fuji was moving forward hopefully in digital and they were

593
00:44:22.011 --> 00:44:25.310
still kind of doing instant photography because one of the things that they were

594
00:44:25.311 --> 00:44:29.540
still,
I think fixated upon was into photography,
what the founder founded.

595
00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:29.961
So they are,

596
00:44:29.961 --> 00:44:33.690
it was that kind of cult and they weren't really moving on towards other things

597
00:44:33.691 --> 00:44:35.590
and like improving on other things.
Right.

598
00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:40.520
<v 0>Okay.
So a merger prompt,
a merger might well have been the best place.
Now.
Why?</v>

599
00:44:40.521 --> 00:44:42.710
Why would it,
what would make it hard to do?

600
00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:46.610
<v 5>I think it's the culture of the company,
um,
that they wouldn't,</v>

601
00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:48.110
it's a whole ego trip thing.

602
00:44:48.111 --> 00:44:50.870
They were really proud of what they had achieved in the front row integration

603
00:44:50.871 --> 00:44:52.600
and was part of the reason they were so proud of it.

604
00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:55.690
<v 0>Okay.
So part of it is culture.</v>

605
00:44:56.170 --> 00:45:01.170
I think that depth of theirs would weaken their bargaining position.

606
00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:03.110
<v 1>Great.
Um,</v>

607
00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:04.963
<v 0>yes.</v>

608
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:06.263
<v 1>Yup.</v>

609
00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:11.880
<v 6>Other than a module company.
But I think Paul Right.</v>

610
00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:14.590
Could have done something in the lines of what IBM is doing now.

611
00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:17.140
Become a completely research based company,

612
00:45:17.141 --> 00:45:21.990
cut off their marketing out the consumer processes and just research for Foodie

613
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.740
research for conduct new research designs for other companies who are in the

614
00:45:26.741 --> 00:45:28.780
consumer field.
So cut diamond on.

615
00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:34.010
<v 0>Okay.
So that may,
that might actually,
that makes a certain kind of sense.</v>

616
00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:36.560
Talk a little more in defend the idea.
What

617
00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:40.690
<v 6>uh,
because at the end of the day,
the whole company culture was driven,</v>

618
00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:44.850
I was driven towards cutting edge research a lot of the successful products for,

619
00:45:44.851 --> 00:45:49.670
because they were able to invent and create products that were successful on

620
00:45:49.671 --> 00:45:54.320
lines of not success in marketing box,
not successful marketing strategies,

621
00:45:54.321 --> 00:45:59.270
but they were able to create products which were ahead of the curve in terms of

622
00:45:59.271 --> 00:46:02.270
technology.
So since the whole market,

623
00:46:02.271 --> 00:46:04.790
the industry was moving towards the digital platform,

624
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.770
perhaps they could become leaders of developing these technologies,

625
00:46:09.771 --> 00:46:12.290
which will improve digital products in the future.

626
00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:16.410
<v 0>Okay.
That's a very interesting suggestion.</v>

627
00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:18.323
Yes.

628
00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:24.880
<v 3>That the merger wouldn't go well because of the vertical integration that,</v>

629
00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:29.220
um,
that Polaroid had in place.

630
00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:34.250
They had huge facilities and machines designed for peak times of sales and,

631
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.710
um,

632
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:39.710
these high fixed costs would have been a big problem for Kodak,

633
00:46:39.761 --> 00:46:41.070
so I think that would merge with them.

634
00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:44.220
<v 1>Hi.
Um,</v>

635
00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:48.270
<v 0>that might well be,
I mean,
they might've,</v>

636
00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:53.020
it might've liquidated those two private equity and kept intact.

637
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:54.583
Morales,

638
00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:58.460
<v 3>well,
I think there were specialized on the films of Polaroid.
Yeah.</v>

639
00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:03.720
<v 0>Okay.
Um,
let's turn to an run now.</v>

640
00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:08.340
Enron is another innovation company.

641
00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:14.400
Uh,
Jim,
can you come up for just a second?
I didn't warn him about this.

642
00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:16.890
Uh,
Jim as,

643
00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:21.540
as I said to those of you who were here at the beginning of shopping period,
uh,

644
00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:26.570
Jim was chief financial officer of Enron global power and pipeline and saw the

645
00:47:32.891 --> 00:47:36.890
process from the beginning.
He came from a,

646
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:41.440
a long career in investment banking before that,
um,

647
00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:46.420
culture of innovation at Enron.

648
00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:51.040
Was it important from day one when you arrived there as a consultant?

649
00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:56.220
<v 4>Yes,
it was.
There was a culture of innovation,
uh,</v>

650
00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:02.040
that was impressed upon the organization by kind of lay,

651
00:48:02.741 --> 00:48:07.741
because he was trying to avoid the mindset that was typical of natural gas

652
00:48:08.411 --> 00:48:09.430
pipelines at the time,

653
00:48:09.431 --> 00:48:14.210
which is very much a monopoly rate based rate of return,
uh,

654
00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:17.230
doesn't matter to make any money type of mindset.

655
00:48:17.231 --> 00:48:19.900
And he went way overboard and reversing that.

656
00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:24.970
<v 0>Okay.
And what was Ken lay or famous manager and,
uh,</v>

657
00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:27.410
was Enron receiving prizes,
for example,

658
00:48:27.411 --> 00:48:31.220
from the Harvard business school as the best run company in the country?

659
00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:35.200
<v 4>Um,
yeah,
so I've always thought that a,</v>

660
00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:39.770
<v 0>well,
Jim is a graduate of Yale College at HBS,
so we've website here.</v>

661
00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:42.560
<v 4>One of the things I've always thought people ought to do though,</v>

662
00:48:42.561 --> 00:48:45.920
in terms of looking at industry industries,
an imminent decline is,

663
00:48:46.310 --> 00:48:51.230
is look at plaudits from HBS and the percent of graduates from HBS going to a

664
00:48:51.231 --> 00:48:52.064
given industry.

665
00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:57.260
<v 0>Okay.
So,
uh,
the case,
uh,</v>

666
00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:01.780
for Wednesday is a innovation corrupted,

667
00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:07.060
it's an HBS case.
It was in that packet of three,
which you got a week ago.

668
00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:12.240
Uh,
please read it with care.
Uh,
Jim and I will do this.
Uh,

669
00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:14.710
uh,
interogate Tivoli out.

670
00:49:14.711 --> 00:49:19.711
We'll sit together and talk it through and turn to you intermittently for help

671
00:49:21.211 --> 00:49:22.990
in solving Enron's dilemmas.
