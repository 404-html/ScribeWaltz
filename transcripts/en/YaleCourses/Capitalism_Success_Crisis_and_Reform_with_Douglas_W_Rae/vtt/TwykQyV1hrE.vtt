WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.430
So today professor ray is not going to be here.

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.690
And so we're going to watch two videos and instead one of him and a second one

3
00:00:08.691 --> 00:00:11.480
is a Paul Collier talking a little bit about his book,

4
00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:15.560
but also about recent research that he's done and especially on governance and

5
00:00:15.561 --> 00:00:17.090
commodities.
So,
uh,

6
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.200
we're going to start with the first video and then go straight into the Paul

7
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.280
Collier video.
So enjoy.

8
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.743
<v 1>Okay.</v>

9
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.700
<v 2>Yeah.
Hi there.
Um,
as you know,</v>

10
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:40.150
I'm in Washington today and,
uh,

11
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.350
Jim Alexander has been kind enough to preside over over the Monday class and I

12
00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:50.430
want to get in 20 minutes or so of,
uh,

13
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.960
background thought,
uh,

14
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.460
taking us from the Selco case where the question was how to organize the

15
00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:03.720
distribution of distributed electrical generating,

16
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.490
uh,
two bottom billion,
uh,

17
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.940
areas of India.
Uh,

18
00:01:11.941 --> 00:01:16.941
from that very specific set of questions to the much larger question about

19
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.160
understanding the plight of the world's bottom billion and the available

20
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:27.030
strategies for,
uh,
trying to be helpful to them.

21
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.860
Uh,
the main text,
uh,
for these class,
this class.

22
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:36.270
And the next is Paul Collier's bottom billion,
uh,

23
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.650
which is,
uh,

24
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.320
while not a page turning thriller like White Tiger,
uh,

25
00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:44.820
is a very solid,

26
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.440
a serious and substantial a piece of scholarship by somebody who has been

27
00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:52.270
engaged.
Uh,

28
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.650
both with the best of growth economics as a scholar and with the practical work

29
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.200
of the World Bank where he was head of research for a good long time.

30
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.013
Um,

31
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.710
the default assumption in thinking about the bottom billion is to begin with the

32
00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:20.610
world demographic transition.

33
00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:25.611
And the thought that most of these people are the products of stage two and

34
00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:34.071
stage three demographies where birth rates were vastly higher than death rates

35
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.830
and she had a huge surge in population.
And you found,
uh,

36
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.840
and many people in those societies,
uh,

37
00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:50.841
found themselves in the same predicament as the protagonist in white tiger as

38
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.080
being one of way too many candidates for every job.

39
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.070
And,
uh,

40
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.130
having little or no market power and consequently little or no,

41
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.770
uh,
income.
Uh,

42
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.670
and Colliers take is to,
is to say,
well,

43
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:17.560
let's just grow incomes and it's not a bad approach.

44
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.090
Um,

45
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.070
and he's perfectly aware of the objections I'm going to make to it,
uh,

46
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:28.510
in the next few minutes.
Uh,
but let's just catalog what,
what,

47
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.770
what it means.
The,
uh,

48
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.190
gross domestic product is,
uh,

49
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.400
at once too broad and too narrow as a measure of value generated by the economy.

50
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.220
Uh,
for example,
uh,
if

51
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.360
a housekeeper and her employer or his,

52
00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.780
uh,

53
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.780
marry one another and he or she continues to keep the house,

54
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.550
but now on the basis of spout a spousal relationship,

55
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.313
uh,

56
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.480
the cash goes away and the value is deducted from the GDP.

57
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.380
While in fact,
nothing has much changed.

58
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.950
Or suppose a crime wave hits a society and enormous damage is done to property

59
00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:34.090
by crime.
Uh,
it requires repair.

60
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.720
Those repairs get recorded in GDP and can easily be mistaken for an improvement

61
00:04:40.691 --> 00:04:45.040
in the condition of people living there.
A further,

62
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.960
people buy better locks,
uh,
video cameras,
uh,

63
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.670
perhaps even weapons.
And those two are recorded as improvements,

64
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:59.020
when in fact they really aren't improvements or take disease.

65
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.540
A,
uh,
uh,
one society is relatively healthy,

66
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.220
uh,
and has relatively lower,
uh,

67
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.200
medical expenses than the other.
Uh,
yet the,
the second,

68
00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:19.130
the one with a high medical expenses would be accounted as better off,
uh,

69
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.930
finally to,
to get the how,

70
00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:27.160
just how mechanical is measure is if for any reason,

71
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.160
uh,
we were,
uh,
prepared,

72
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.920
the government say was prepared to pay people to dig holes,
uh,

73
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.150
and then fill them back up with the same dirt and pay him a salary for that.

74
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.770
Uh,
we would,
we would have increased GDP.

75
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.930
So those are ways in which the measure is,
uh,

76
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.830
to inclusive.
Uh,
there are other ways in which it's not inclusive enough.

77
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.940
Um,
uh,
it doesn't include,

78
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.030
you know,
the saying the best things in life are free.
Well,

79
00:06:02.031 --> 00:06:06.260
that may not be entirely true,
but some of the good things in life are free.

80
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.420
And those need to be measured in an accounting of,

81
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.320
of how well office society is.
Uh,
the,

82
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.920
the leading substitute measure these days for GDP per capita is,

83
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.760
uh,
the human development index as put forward by the World Bank and parallel

84
00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:28.770
institutions,
which gives,
uh,

85
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.390
which takes GDP per capita is one part of the story,

86
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.750
adds to it longevity.
Uh,

87
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:39.560
and then supplements that by adding a measure of education.

88
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.400
So you get a somewhat broader measure that captures the,

89
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.940
the surge we see in Hans Rosling's wonderful data animation as lives become

90
00:06:53.511 --> 00:06:55.970
longer and prosperity greater.

91
00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.860
So one thing to do is just tinker with a measure.

92
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.920
A,
there's a second set of issues

93
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:11.270
that have to do with the value of income.
The,

94
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.040
I've got some childlike drawings here to share with you.

95
00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.720
Uh,
if,

96
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.900
if we represent the dollar income of Mr a on the horizontal access and of ms be

97
00:07:26.811 --> 00:07:29.620
on the vertical axis,
uh,

98
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:34.630
then GDP for these two people is calculated just by adding the one to the other,

99
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.930
uh,
with no attention to the distribution between them.

100
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:44.080
So that all the points on this indifference curve would correspond to the same

101
00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:46.190
GDP as one another.

102
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:51.050
And all the points on this indifference curve would likewise,
so of correspond.

103
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.310
Well,
that's okay.
There's nothing wrong with that,

104
00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.900
except if you want to infer from it the value shared by a and B,

105
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.740
uh,
in the use of that income.
And

106
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:13.240
the a generally accepted hypothesis is that the value of income and economists

107
00:08:16.581 --> 00:08:21.500
would use the term utility.
Let me just stick with value.
The value of income,

108
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:22.341
uh,

109
00:08:22.341 --> 00:08:27.341
first increases and then decreases at the margin so that you get an s shaped

110
00:08:27.801 --> 00:08:28.850
curve like this.

111
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:33.380
On the horizontal axis we have how much income people get,

112
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:37.220
and on the vertical axis,
how much value they derive from it.

113
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.710
Now imagine down here around point a,
uh,

114
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.170
where people have precious little income,
uh,

115
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.880
so little that they cannot feed and clothe and lodge themselves.

116
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.740
Well,
Duh,
I think of a setting like an American city,

117
00:08:54.741 --> 00:08:59.741
and imagine a doubling your income annual income from $25 to $50.

118
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.420
Well,
that would move you a little ways along the horizontal axis,

119
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.590
but it wouldn't really lift you up the vertical axis because it's not going to

120
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.600
make a difference until you get to some threshold where you actually begin to

121
00:09:15.361 --> 00:09:20.361
get increasing returns from a rising incomes,

122
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.740
uh,
as in the zone I've labeled be here.
Uh,

123
00:09:25.741 --> 00:09:30.390
and then eventually at incomes like,

124
00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:34.440
uh,
Richard Medley whom we met a month ago,

125
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:35.700
or Apollos or Noni,

126
00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:39.900
who we'll meet in a couple of weeks at their incomes.

127
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.080
The,
the,

128
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:48.000
so wide arrange of material needs are already satisfied

129
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:53.640
that the marginal dollar gets less and less valuable.

130
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:54.841
Uh,

131
00:09:54.841 --> 00:09:59.841
the implication of this for the relationship between GDP per capita on the one

132
00:10:00.181 --> 00:10:05.181
side and a judgement of how well a society is doing on the other is that there's

133
00:10:06.421 --> 00:10:09.750
pro,
we should probably,
uh,

134
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:15.530
have some egalitarian bias in the way we interpret the numbers where most people

135
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:20.460
get to the level that I'm pointing at here,

136
00:10:20.461 --> 00:10:25.461
where the dimunition of marginal value really sets in where most people get to

137
00:10:26.131 --> 00:10:30.660
that,
uh,
that's kind of where you want to be.
And Colliers,

138
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.620
emphasis on the bottom billion a response to that.

139
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:40.120
Uh,
and the SELCO project for example,
which we saw,
uh,

140
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:45.090
a moment saw,
well actually I'm speaking just an hour after class,

141
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.770
which we saw in Wednesday's class,
uh,

142
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:54.080
is aimed at trying to bring people up that steep part of the curve,

143
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.940
maybe not very far,

144
00:10:56.941 --> 00:11:01.941
but a little ways by judiciously providing the opportunity to purchase a

145
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.020
electric light,
uh,

146
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:10.130
or electric power for such other purposes as running a sewing machine,

147
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.510
uh,
or,
uh,

148
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:16.410
preparing a goods of some kind for sale.

149
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:22.280
So the common sense response to this s curve is to pay special attention to

150
00:11:26.701 --> 00:11:31.701
people who are near its bottom and try to find ways to help them push themselves

151
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.240
up the curve.
Now,

152
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:46.560
as a sidebar,
let me just mention,
uh,
John Rawls,
uh,

153
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:49.990
who published in 1971,
a,

154
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.610
a classic book,
a book that will be read hundreds of years from now,

155
00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:59.140
I imagine a called a theory of justice and Rawls,

156
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:04.650
Rawls.
Ask people to imagine that they were,
uh,

157
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:07.510
behind what he called a veil of ignorance.

158
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:12.880
And the idea of the veil of ignorance is roughly that you have no idea who you

159
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:13.714
are.

160
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:19.450
It's a little like Adam Smith's device in a theory of moral sentiments.

161
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:24.400
But the question is,
if you had no idea who you were,
uh,

162
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:29.460
before we set up the basic institutions for a country or for the world,

163
00:12:30.641 --> 00:12:35.050
if we think of it on a global scale,
uh,
what,

164
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:40.710
what would be your way of structuring alternative arrangements so that you could

165
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:47.650
find one that you thought was best from your,
for your,
for you,

166
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:51.850
from behind this veil of ignorance and on which you could agree with everyone

167
00:12:51.851 --> 00:12:56.140
else behind the same veil.
And his idea,

168
00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:57.443
um,

169
00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:02.880
stated way to simply is that you should maximize the welfare of the least

170
00:13:09.101 --> 00:13:10.900
advantaged group in society.

171
00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.140
The intuition is that that group would be unskilled labor.

172
00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:19.010
And that doesn't mean that you should,
uh,

173
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:24.310
knock down inequalities necessarily.
Uh,
indeed.
If,

174
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:28.450
if allowing,
uh,
uh,
bankers,

175
00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:33.130
engineers and entrepreneurs,
uh,
to reap substantial,

176
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:33.851
uh,

177
00:13:33.851 --> 00:13:38.851
and very unequal benefits from their work will ultimately read down to the

178
00:13:41.141 --> 00:13:45.700
benefit of this unskilled labor straight up,
uh,

179
00:13:45.701 --> 00:13:48.520
then that's great.
A Rawlsian,

180
00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:53.710
a Rawlsian picture of,
um,

181
00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.470
the,
the indifference curves,
which for,
um,

182
00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:03.160
before utilitarianism just run at minus 45 degrees here,

183
00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:05.320
Rawls is our l shaped.

184
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:10.530
And so if we're here so that this person is way better off than this person,

185
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.940
we tried to move to a higher indifference curve from the point of view of the

186
00:14:15.941 --> 00:14:20.590
less advantaged person and symmetrically here we try to move in this direction

187
00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.640
so that the l shaped indifference curves.

188
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:29.050
If there were just two people in the society would drive us to seek the highest

189
00:14:29.051 --> 00:14:33.280
one and it would have a powerful middle of the road bias to it,

190
00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:39.060
but it wouldn't have so powerful and egalitarian kick that it would knock down

191
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:45.550
equality to an extent which hurt even the less skilled parts of the workforce,

192
00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:50.980
uh,
societies.
And we know of societies that have reached that level,

193
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.190
uh,
in my judgment,
uh,

194
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:58.570
Castro's Cuba is a just such a case and I know it fairly well.

195
00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:04.520
UH,
North Korea,
which I know much less well,
appears to be such a case.

196
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.960
Okay.
So that's all by way of background.

197
00:15:08.961 --> 00:15:13.961
And now I just want to talk a rather briefly about the,

198
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:20.860
the introductory series of traps in Collier's book.

199
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:22.820
And the traps are,

200
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:28.750
are his way of summarizing things that can go very wrong for a country,

201
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.300
uh,

202
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:36.860
and put it way behind the rest of the world in economic growth.

203
00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.780
Now,
as background,
Collier is really thinking about,
uh,

204
00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.710
what we would call emerging market countries.

205
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.890
He's not thinking about Germany,
Japan,

206
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:54.260
Canada or the states.
He's thinking about,

207
00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:58.790
uh,
India,
Bangladesh,
uh,

208
00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:03.020
Kenya,
uh,
Zimbabwe,
Bolivia,

209
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:08.210
uh,
Mexico,
uh,
countries which are

210
00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:15.220
just finishing the world demographic transition and are relatively late entrance

211
00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:21.560
as full players,
uh,
in capitalist development.

212
00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.370
Uh,
the majority of them,
uh,
and call your,

213
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:30.260
gives very little stress to this and you probably should give more.
Uh,

214
00:16:30.261 --> 00:16:35.261
the majority of these countries were colonial sites for a European powers.

215
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:41.660
And,
uh,
India is just such a case.
For example,

216
00:16:41.661 --> 00:16:43.880
in the British empire was enormous.

217
00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:48.350
Other countries were subject to the Dutch,

218
00:16:48.351 --> 00:16:50.930
the French and,
and other,

219
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.980
and the Spanish in Spanish actually are quite important,
uh,

220
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:59.590
European powers,
which treated them as,
uh,

221
00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.093
um,

222
00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:07.060
subordinate economies and structured their governance to the advantage of the

223
00:17:08.841 --> 00:17:13.790
metropolitan country.
So trap one may,
may be,

224
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.983
um,

225
00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:20.900
be a colonial colonial site and be set back by it.

226
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:25.250
The other side to that story is that the colonial power sometimes left something

227
00:17:25.251 --> 00:17:29.600
good behind the extraordinary quality of,

228
00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.850
uh,
technical education in India,
for example,
uh,

229
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.680
is,
uh,
in part a,
an outgrowth of,

230
00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:44.330
uh,
uh,
British education and,
uh,

231
00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:48.400
the,
the systematic,
uh,

232
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:53.500
inculcation of a British educational values wouldn't want to go too far

233
00:17:56.341 --> 00:18:01.200
stressing that,
but,
but it's there somewhere.
Okay.
So the,

234
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.370
the Collier traps,

235
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:11.070
the first one is what he calls a conflict trap.
And,
uh,

236
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.340
according to him,
a 73% of,
uh,

237
00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.380
the bottom billion,
uh,

238
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.880
live in countries which are now in civil wars or have recently been in civil

239
00:18:23.791 --> 00:18:28.170
wars.
That's a stunning number.
Uh,
and the,

240
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:29.310
the,

241
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:34.310
the world which occupies the front page of,

242
00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:39.210
uh,
every major newspaper,

243
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.610
uh,
Somalia,
uh,
uh,

244
00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.560
Iraq.
Uh,

245
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:51.810
the incredible miss in Afghanistan,
uh,

246
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:56.220
many other,
uh,
less dramatic cases,
uh,

247
00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.280
these are all,
uh,

248
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:03.390
countries where civil strife has defined life to,

249
00:19:03.391 --> 00:19:07.560
uh,
to a considerable degree in let's say the last 25 years.

250
00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.293
Well,

251
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:14.390
the call spend some time asking the causes of that.

252
00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:17.200
Uh,
he rejects the,

253
00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:21.120
the common sense popular explanation is ethnic conflict.

254
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:26.990
And he says that ethnic conflict is actually quite a lot less important than

255
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:28.590
simple poverty.

256
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:34.230
That countries with very low GDP per capita,
uh,

257
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:35.730
are greatly,

258
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.360
greatly at much greater risk of civil war.

259
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:44.780
Then countries with higher GDP per capita and that countries with growing GDP,

260
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:51.870
uh,
are more secure than those with static GDP,

261
00:19:51.871 --> 00:19:56.640
particularly particularly static GDP at a low level.
Not much news in that.

262
00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.980
Um,
but it's,

263
00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:03.030
it's actually very important because if you think about the logic of capital

264
00:20:03.031 --> 00:20:06.940
development,
capitalist development,
and you take,
uh,

265
00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:12.410
either the Coase theorem or a desotos development of the Coase theorem a

266
00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:17.250
seriously,
which I do.
And,
uh,

267
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:19.530
and I urge you to,
uh,

268
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:24.270
it's built on the foundation of the Westphalian nation state system,

269
00:20:24.271 --> 00:20:27.000
which came into being in the middle of the 17th century.

270
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:31.620
And we're civil wars are still in progress.
That system isn't there.

271
00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:34.500
A civil war,
uh,

272
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:39.560
is indicative of a failed state and a failed state can't perform the

273
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.490
capitalizing functions of government,

274
00:20:44.491 --> 00:20:47.100
which are so central.

275
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:52.030
The story desoto tells us and about which I think he is,
is,
uh,

276
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.990
very right.
Okay.

277
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.100
<v 3>Uh,
the,
the,</v>

278
00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:00.693
the

279
00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:04.700
<v 2>palliatives for this are not obvious.
Uh,</v>

280
00:21:04.701 --> 00:21:09.701
one thing we've pretty much learned is that third party interventions in civil

281
00:21:10.461 --> 00:21:11.880
wars,
uh,

282
00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:15.560
by and large are not a terribly successful.

283
00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.460
The second of his traps is,

284
00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:24.440
is the natural resource trap where the,
the standard case would be oil.

285
00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.110
Uh,
but it could be,
uh,

286
00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:32.200
any other commodity that is it at great value with and which can be,

287
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:36.740
uh,
uh,

288
00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:41.860
harvested and processed and shipped without developing a huge economic

289
00:21:42.021 --> 00:21:46.970
infrastructure,
uh,
or a,
uh,
uh,

290
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.370
nimbly functioning internal market.
And the,

291
00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.330
the gist of this one,
uh,
hinges on what,

292
00:21:55.331 --> 00:21:57.260
what he calls Dutch disease.

293
00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.850
And the idea here is that when the Dutch,
uh,

294
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:07.270
began to export North Sea oil at great profit to their,

295
00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:13.160
uh,
to,
to the value of their currency,

296
00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.910
uh,
the inflation of,
uh,

297
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:20.970
in the value of the currency made their other export products less and less

298
00:22:21.051 --> 00:22:25.710
competitive and caused a kind of lethargy in the country.
That's,

299
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:29.090
that's one piece of it.
Um,
it's the,

300
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:34.110
the other piece which I think is actually more important has to do with the

301
00:22:35.121 --> 00:22:40.121
relationship between a democratic rule and,

302
00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:44.480
uh,
oil or other export products.

303
00:22:44.481 --> 00:22:49.481
And if you'll look carefully at page 43 of Colliers book,

304
00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:55.290
he tells a story which,
which is actually a,
it's a fairly subtle story and,
uh,

305
00:22:55.291 --> 00:22:57.720
and I think it's a true story.
Uh,

306
00:22:57.721 --> 00:23:02.721
and the just of it is that where an economy functions largely by exporting

307
00:23:05.271 --> 00:23:06.530
something like oil,

308
00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:12.760
that the impact of democratic government on the economy is to reduce the rate of

309
00:23:15.411 --> 00:23:20.030
growth.
Uh,
whereas in economies where,

310
00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:21.793
uh,

311
00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.270
that form of export production is not important,

312
00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:30.770
a democratic government and the rule of law,
uh,

313
00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:36.230
re relates to an increasing rate of economic growth.

314
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:41.830
So his slightly smart Alec Term For this is survival of the fattest,

315
00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.060
fattest.
Um,

316
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:50.290
and if you look at the behavior of classic oil states,

317
00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.700
uh,
they seem to respond to this.

318
00:23:55.790 --> 00:24:00.790
And once you have an authoritarian government with a,

319
00:24:01.941 --> 00:24:04.730
an oil export economy,
uh,

320
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:09.850
much of what happens is ugly and a good part of,

321
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.560
uh,
the ugliness we see in Russia these days,
for example,

322
00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:21.100
uh,
is made possible,
some might say inevitable,
uh,

323
00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:22.130
by Itch,

324
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:27.220
powerful export resources in petroleum and natural gas.

325
00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.313
Uh,

326
00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:35.550
the landlocked trap.

327
00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:40.920
And here the classic case that will concern us,

328
00:24:40.921 --> 00:24:45.180
we'll be Bolivia where we'll do a,

329
00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:51.140
we'll do a case two weeks from now about trying to re trying to improve water

330
00:24:51.181 --> 00:24:54.810
resources in a major Bolivian city.
Uh,

331
00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:59.840
and being landlocked is a bad thing and it's not hard to capture the intuition

332
00:25:01.561 --> 00:25:03.510
of that because,
uh,

333
00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:08.960
commerce with distant states historically is largely done by marine marine

334
00:25:10.291 --> 00:25:15.291
transportation and absolutely ports of your own.

335
00:25:15.601 --> 00:25:20.070
You depend on ports of other countries,
so that for example,

336
00:25:20.071 --> 00:25:25.071
Switzerland depends on Italian and German porch.

337
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.890
Um,
and uh,
um,

338
00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.010
Uganda or Rwanda,
uh,

339
00:25:32.011 --> 00:25:36.410
would depend on Kenyon port.
And,
uh,

340
00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:42.320
it's probably a better idea that to depend on porch systems like those of Italy

341
00:25:43.021 --> 00:25:46.620
or Germany,
then like those of Kenya because there are far more developed.

342
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:51.510
But there's another side to the story which is that,

343
00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.500
uh,
it has call your points out.

344
00:25:56.250 --> 00:26:01.250
Having rich countries for neighbors means you have large markets which don't

345
00:26:02.191 --> 00:26:05.100
require ocean going shipping so that

346
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.440
for example,

347
00:26:07.441 --> 00:26:12.441
Germany and Italy are not just in the way of a exports from Switzerland,

348
00:26:15.121 --> 00:26:19.650
but become markets for those exports and uh,

349
00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.350
breed a great deal of wealth.
Indeed.

350
00:26:22.351 --> 00:26:27.351
Call your shows that a 1% increase in GDP per capita in a neighboring state,

351
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.880
uh,

352
00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:34.880
correlates generally with about a 0.4% of an increase in GDP,

353
00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:38.930
uh,
in the landlocked country.

354
00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:41.660
We're almost done here.

355
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:49.730
The last one is bad stage are a really bad for economies.

356
00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:56.370
Uh,
and this one is,
is a no brainer.
Um,
and there are two,

357
00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:58.840
two main ways,
uh,

358
00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:03.470
for states to be bad by being a week,

359
00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:08.780
uh,
and unable to enforce the rule of law.
Uh,

360
00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:13.980
tuned in to tonight's,
uh,
six 30 world news.

361
00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.490
And I prophesied,
uh,

362
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:23.300
five days in advance that there will be an account of death and destruction,

363
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:30.190
uh,
in Afghanistan where the Taliban channel challenge,
uh,

364
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:35.010
the state for control of territory and,
uh,
our,

365
00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:37.200
uh,
soldiers,
uh,

366
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:42.780
try to bring a degree of order,
uh,

367
00:27:42.781 --> 00:27:45.000
under almost impossible conditions.

368
00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.960
So weak states failed states.

369
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:52.650
The famous case of Somalia with it's pirates would be another case,

370
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.170
uh,
Iraq after the,

371
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:59.460
after our intervention was for a period,
a failed state.

372
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:01.133
And it,

373
00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:06.260
it gives every indication of remaining either a failed state or a,

374
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.860
uh,
uh,
well,

375
00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:14.760
why don't I not prophesied about Iraq?
I don't need to have a dog in that fight.

376
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:20.010
Um,
the other,
uh,
bad government story is kleptocracy.

377
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:24.270
Um,
and where the government,

378
00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:30.140
where the elite at the top of the government use it as a means for collecting

379
00:28:30.301 --> 00:28:34.720
rent from the rest of society.
Uh,
it is,
uh,

380
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:38.880
extraordinarily destructive to the economy because it takes away all the

381
00:28:38.881 --> 00:28:43.881
conditions which allow people to make investments and execute business project

382
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:51.230
and shell product in a sufficiently predictable way to grow the economy.

383
00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:58.100
Um,
the other clip you're about to see is,
um,

384
00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:03.360
Paul Collier himself in a Ted talk explaining,

385
00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.600
uh,
no doubt better than I can.
Uh,

386
00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:09.660
what it is that the bottom billion is about.

387
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:12.960
I look forward to seeing you on Wednesday.

388
00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:32.843
Okay.

389
00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:51.420
<v 4>So can we dare to be optimistic?
Well,</v>

390
00:29:51.421 --> 00:29:56.421
the thesis of the bottom billion is that a billion people have been stuck living

391
00:29:57.650 --> 00:30:00.900
in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years

392
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:04.890
and hence the virgin from the rest of mankind.

393
00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:09.690
And so the real question to pose is not can we be optimistic?

394
00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:13.620
It's how can we give credible hope to that billion people?

395
00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:18.420
That to my mind is the fundamental challenge now of development.

396
00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.850
What I'm going to offer you is a recipe,

397
00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:28.530
a combination of the two forces that change the world for good,

398
00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:34.220
which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self interest compassion.

399
00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:41.840
Because a billion people living in societies that have not offered credible hope

400
00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:47.850
is that is the human tragedy,

401
00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:50.610
enlightened self interest.

402
00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:56.250
Because if that economic divergence continues for another 40 years,

403
00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:01.530
combined with social integration globally,

404
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:04.890
it will build a nightmare for our children.

405
00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.050
We need compassion to get ourselves started.

406
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:14.910
An enlightened self interest to get ourselves serious.

407
00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.390
That's the alliance.
The changes the world.

408
00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:24.260
So what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion?

409
00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:30.730
What can we actually do?
Well,

410
00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:35.920
a good guide is to think what did we do last time the rich world got serious

411
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:43.200
about developing another region of the world that gives us,

412
00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:44.730
turns out quite a good clue,

413
00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.690
except you have to go back quite a long time.

414
00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:54.630
The last time the rich world got serious about developing another region was in

415
00:31:54.631 --> 00:31:56.040
the late 1940s

416
00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.760
the rich world was you,

417
00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:05.480
America and the region that needed to be developed was my world,

418
00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.600
Europe.
That was postwar Europe.

419
00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:12.720
Why did America get serious?

420
00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:18.690
It wasn't just compassion for Europe though.
There was that.
It was,

421
00:32:18.691 --> 00:32:23.691
you knew you had to because in the late 1940 [inaudible] country after country

422
00:32:24.181 --> 00:32:28.050
in central Europe was falling into the Soviet bloc.

423
00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:29.821
And so you knew,

424
00:32:29.821 --> 00:32:34.140
you'd know choice Europe had to be dragged into economic development.

425
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:38.940
So what did you do last time you got serious?
Well,

426
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:43.970
yes,
you had a big aid program.
Thank you very much.
That was Marshall Aid.

427
00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:48.950
We need to do it again.
Eight is part of the solution,
but what else did you do?

428
00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:55.460
Well,
you tore up your trade policy and totally reversed it

429
00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:01.160
before the war.
America had been highly protectionist.

430
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:05.660
After the war.
You Open your markets to Europe,

431
00:33:05.661 --> 00:33:09.290
you drag Europe into the then global economy,
which was your economy,

432
00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:13.280
and you institutionalize that trade liberalization through founding the general

433
00:33:13.281 --> 00:33:17.840
agreement of tariffs and trade.
So total reversal of trade policy.

434
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.420
Did you do anything else?
Yes.

435
00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:24.110
You totally reversed your security policy before the war.

436
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:28.550
Your security policy had been isolationist after the war.

437
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:34.010
You tear that up.
You put 100,000 troops in Europe for over 40 years,

438
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:39.260
so total reversal of security policy.
Anything else?

439
00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:42.710
Yes.
You tear up the 11th commandment,

440
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:47.660
national sovereignty before the war.

441
00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:52.910
You treated national sovereignty is so sacrosanct that you weren't even willing

442
00:33:52.911 --> 00:33:56.030
to join the League of nations after the war.

443
00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:58.040
You found the United Nations,

444
00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:01.250
you found the Organization for Economic Cooperation and development.

445
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:06.410
You found the IMF,
you encourage Europe to create.
The European community,

446
00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:09.020
all systems for mutual governance support.

447
00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:16.030
That is still the waterfront of effective policies,

448
00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:20.620
aid,
trade security,
governments.

449
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:24.840
Of course the details are policy are going to be different because the challenge

450
00:34:24.841 --> 00:34:27.280
is different.
It's not rebuilding Europe,

451
00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:34.030
it's reversing the divergence of the bottom billion so that they actually catch

452
00:34:34.031 --> 00:34:37.270
up.
Is that easier or harder?

453
00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:41.800
We need to be at least as serious as we were there.

454
00:34:44.410 --> 00:34:48.340
Now today aren't going to take just one of those four.

455
00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:51.640
I'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest,

456
00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:55.870
the one that's just motherhood and Apple Pie governance,

457
00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:58.010
mutual systems of support for governance.

458
00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:03.450
And I've got to show you one idea in how we could do something to strengthen

459
00:35:05.111 --> 00:35:05.944
governance.

460
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.870
And I kind of go to share you that that is enormously important.
Now

461
00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:17.140
the opportunity we're going to look to

462
00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:19.713
is,
um,

463
00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:24.100
is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion.

464
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:29.200
And that is the commodity booms,
the commodity booms,

465
00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:35.050
a pumping unprecedented amounts of money into many.

466
00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:38.010
They're not all of the countries of the bottom billion.

467
00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:43.380
Partly they're pumping money in because commodity prices are high.

468
00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:49.230
But it's not just that.
There's also a range of new discoveries.

469
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:55.050
Uganda's just discovered oil and about the most disastrous location on earth.

470
00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.080
Ghana's discovered oil.

471
00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:03.090
Guinea has got a huge new exploit exploitation of iron all coming out of the

472
00:36:03.091 --> 00:36:07.560
ground.
So mass of new discoveries between them,

473
00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:12.000
these new revenue flows,
dwarf aid.

474
00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:14.340
Just to give you one example,

475
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:19.500
and Golar alone is getting $50 billion a year in oil revenue.

476
00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:25.130
The entire aid flows to the 60 countries of the bottom billion last year with 34

477
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:28.260
billion.
So the,

478
00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:32.730
the flow of resources from the commodity booms to the bottom billion or without

479
00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:36.570
precedent.
So there's the optimism.

480
00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:41.190
The question is how is it going to help their development?

481
00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:46.470
It's a huge opportunity for transformational development.
Will it be taken?

482
00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:52.410
So here comes a bit of science and this is a bit of science I've done since the

483
00:36:52.411 --> 00:36:53.760
bottom billions.
So it's new.

484
00:36:55.080 --> 00:37:00.080
I've looked to see what is the relationship between higher commodity prices of

485
00:37:00.271 --> 00:37:03.600
exports and the growth of commodity exporting countries.

486
00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:05.130
And I've looked globally,

487
00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:09.390
I've taken all the countries in the world for the last 40 years and look to see

488
00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:14.190
what the relationship is and the the short run.

489
00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:19.560
So the first five to seven years is just great.

490
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:23.310
In fact,
it's Hunky Dory.
Everything goes up,

491
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:27.420
you get more money cause you terms of trade to improve.

492
00:37:27.421 --> 00:37:30.570
But also that drives up output across the board.

493
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:35.550
So GDP goes up a lot.
Fantastic.
That's the short run.

494
00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:40.470
And how about the long run come back 15 years later?

495
00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:45.600
Well the short run,
it's Hunky Dory,
but the long run,

496
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.430
it's Humpty dumpty.
You go up in the short run.

497
00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:55.520
But then most societies historically have ended up worse than if they'd had no

498
00:37:56.401 --> 00:38:01.320
blooms at all.
That is not a forecast about how commodity prices go.

499
00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.840
It's a forecast of the consequences,

500
00:38:03.841 --> 00:38:08.841
the longterm consequences for growth of an increase in prices.

501
00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:14.250
So what goes wrong?
Why is there this resource curse as it's called?

502
00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:16.441
And again,

503
00:38:16.441 --> 00:38:21.420
I've looked at that and it turns out that the critical issue is the level of

504
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:22.463
governance,

505
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:26.640
the initial level of economic governance when there is all spoons accrued.

506
00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:31.650
In fact,
if you've got good enough governance,
there is no resource.
Boom.

507
00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:36.250
You go up in the short term and then you go up even more in the long term.

508
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:40.150
That's Norway,
the richest country in Europe,
it's Australia,
it's Canada.

509
00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:46.210
The resource curse is entirely confined to countries below a threshold of

510
00:38:46.211 --> 00:38:48.790
governance.
They still go up in the short run.

511
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:52.390
That's what we're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment,

512
00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:54.610
the best growth rates they've had

513
00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:56.003
<v 5>ever.</v>

514
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:59.680
<v 4>The question is whether the short run will persist.</v>

515
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:02.170
<v 5>Okay</v>

516
00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:05.290
<v 4>with bad governance,
historically over the last 40 years,
it hasn't.</v>

517
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.540
It's countries like Nigeria,
which are worse off than if they'd never had oil.

518
00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:14.563
<v 5>So</v>

519
00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:19.390
<v 4>there's a threshold level above which you go up in the longterm below which you</v>

520
00:39:19.391 --> 00:39:22.870
go down just to benchmark that threshold.

521
00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:26.920
It's about the governance level of Portugal in the mid 1980s

522
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.030
so the question is at the bottom billion above or below that threshold.

523
00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:39.500
Now there's one big change since the commodity booms of knife and seventies and

524
00:39:40.441 --> 00:39:43.170
that is the spread of democracy.
So I thought,
well,

525
00:39:43.171 --> 00:39:47.220
maybe that is the thing which is transformed governance in the bottom billion.

526
00:39:47.221 --> 00:39:51.780
Maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy,
so I looked,

527
00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:58.340
democracy does have significant defects and unfortunately there are adverse

528
00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:03.390
democracies make even more of a mess of these resorts spoons.

529
00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:07.800
Then autocracies at that stage,
I just wanted to abandon the research,
but

530
00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:13.230
it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that because

531
00:40:13.231 --> 00:40:18.231
sort of two distinct aspects of democracy is electoral competition,

532
00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:23.670
which determines how you acquire power and the checks and balances which

533
00:40:23.671 --> 00:40:25.080
determine how you use power.

534
00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:30.840
It turns out that electoral competition is the thing that's doing the damage

535
00:40:30.841 --> 00:40:35.841
with democracy where a strong checks and balances make resources becomes good,

536
00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:38.340
and so what the countries are,

537
00:40:38.341 --> 00:40:41.760
the bottom billion need is very strong checks and balances.

538
00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:43.530
They haven't got them.

539
00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:48.830
They got instant democracy in the 1990s elections without checks and balances.

540
00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:55.040
How can we help improve governments and introduce checks and balances in all of

541
00:40:56.450 --> 00:41:00.960
the societies of the bottom billion that are intense struggles to do?
Just that.

542
00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:07.680
The simple proposal is that we should have some international standards which

543
00:41:07.681 --> 00:41:11.850
will be voluntary,
but which would spell out the key decision points

544
00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:17.520
that need to be taken in order for it to harness these resource revenues.

545
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:22.140
We know these international standards work because we've already got one.

546
00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:25.140
It's called the extractive industries transparency initiative.

547
00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:30.600
That hell is the very simple idea that governments should report to their

548
00:41:30.601 --> 00:41:32.610
citizens what revenues they have.

549
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:38.560
No sooner was it proposed then reformers in Nigeria or adopted it,

550
00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:41.870
pushed it and published the revenues in the paper.

551
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.720
Nigerian newspaper circulation spiked.

552
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:49.990
People wanted to know what their government was getting in terms of revenue so

553
00:41:50.421 --> 00:41:51.560
we know it works.

554
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:56.480
What would the content be of these international standards?

555
00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:01.520
I can't go through all of them,
but I'll give you an example.

556
00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:06.350
The first is how to take the resources out of the ground.

557
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:09.890
The economic process is taking the resources out of the ground and putting

558
00:42:09.891 --> 00:42:14.891
assets on top of the ground and the first step in that is selling the rights to

559
00:42:14.961 --> 00:42:15.950
resource extraction.

560
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:20.210
You now how rights resource extraction of being sold at the moment,

561
00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:24.470
how they've been so level of us.
40 years a company flies in,

562
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:29.300
does a deal with a minister and that's great for the company and it's quite

563
00:42:29.301 --> 00:42:33.530
often great for the minister and it's not great for the country.

564
00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:38.960
There's a very simple institutional technology which can transform that and it's

565
00:42:38.961 --> 00:42:41.270
called very fine auctions.

566
00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:45.043
The

567
00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:50.510
the public agency with the greatest expertise on earth is of course the treasury

568
00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:55.100
that is the British Treasury and the British Treasury decided that it would sell

569
00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:58.910
the rights to third generation mobile phones by working out what those rights

570
00:42:58.911 --> 00:43:01.070
were worth.
It worked out.

571
00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:04.850
We were worth 2 billion pounds just in time.

572
00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:08.450
Instead of economists got there and said,
why not try an auction,

573
00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:12.830
it'll reveal the value.
It went for 20 billion pounds through auction.

574
00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:18.370
If the British Treasury can be out by a factor of 10 think what the Ministry of

575
00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:19.910
Finance in Sierra Leone is going to be like.

576
00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.110
When I put that to the president of Sierra Leone,

577
00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:27.590
the next day he asked the World Bank to send the team to give expertise on how

578
00:43:27.591 --> 00:43:28.760
to conduct auctions.

579
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:33.200
There were five such decision points.

580
00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:37.970
Each one needs an international standard.
If we could do it,

581
00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:40.700
we would change the world.

582
00:43:40.701 --> 00:43:45.701
We would be helping the reformers in these societies who are struggling for

583
00:43:46.281 --> 00:43:49.400
change.
That our modest role,

584
00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:51.830
we cannot change these societies,

585
00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:57.040
but we can help the people in these societies who are struggling and usually

586
00:43:57.111 --> 00:44:00.170
failing because the odds are so stacked against them

587
00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:07.580
and yet we've not bought these rewards.
If you think about it,

588
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:11.570
the cost of promulgating international rules is Zilch.

589
00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:15.710
Nothing.
Why on earth are they not there?

590
00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:23.100
I realized that the reason they're not there is that until we have a critical

591
00:44:23.771 --> 00:44:27.460
mass of informed citizens in our own societies,

592
00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:32.940
politicians will get away with gestures tha tha tha unless we have an informed

593
00:44:34.981 --> 00:44:39.240
society.
What politicians do,
especially in relation to Africa,

594
00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:43.800
is gestures,
things that look good but don't work.

595
00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:50.210
And so I realized we had to go through the business of building an informed

596
00:44:50.221 --> 00:44:51.054
citizenry.

597
00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:56.340
That's why I broke all the professional rules of conduct for an economist,

598
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:59.550
and I wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach.

599
00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:05.230
However,

600
00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:10.230
I have to say the process of communication does not come naturally to me.

601
00:45:10.781 --> 00:45:13.270
This is why I'm on this stage,
but it's alarming.

602
00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:19.240
I grew up in a culture of self effacement.

603
00:45:20.290 --> 00:45:23.500
Um,
my wife showed me,
uh,

604
00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:28.950
a blog comment on one of my last talks and the blog comment said,

605
00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:32.380
Kalia is not charismatic.

606
00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:33.373
<v 1>Okay.</v>

607
00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:38.160
