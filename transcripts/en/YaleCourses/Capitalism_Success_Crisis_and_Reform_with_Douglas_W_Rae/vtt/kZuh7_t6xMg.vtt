WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.800
Uh,
let me,
uh,
uh,

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.060
give a forward view of today in relationship to the week afterward.

3
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.190
Uh,
today we have Jim Alexander on Enron,

4
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.970
and we'll do this as a conversation except that at a certain point he's,

5
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.500
he's gonna just do a little straight lecturing on some basics.

6
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.610
It too unfamiliar ideas in the HBS case or potentially unfamiliar ideas.

7
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.450
Uh,
this is,
uh,
a,

8
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.710
the Enron case is arguably the most important meltdown in the modern history of

9
00:00:50.481 --> 00:00:51.710
American capitalism.

10
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.960
It is certainly the one which has rebutted the world's attention more than any

11
00:00:56.961 --> 00:01:01.820
other.
And Jim was there,
uh,

12
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.830
at the beginning or not at the beginning,
but they're in a,
it,

13
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.030
uh,
an almost perfect vantage point.
Um,

14
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.140
so we're
fortunate to have him today.

15
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.110
Before I go further,
I should say it's his birthday.

16
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.863
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.320
<v 0>He,
I think does want me to tell you which one it is.
And</v>

18
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.270
there we go.
Um,

19
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.130
on Monday we'll have Richard Madely,

20
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.690
a founder of a medley global advisors.

21
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:45.130
Uh,

22
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.780
and that case is about his chalet medleys selling medley global advisors and

23
00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:52.630
quitting.
And the question is,
how could it,

24
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.660
how could a business have tens of millions of dollars worth of value when it is

25
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.080
entirely framed around the personality of one person?

26
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.930
And the answer is she got it done and he will be a very interesting,

27
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.690
uh,
gassed.
He's completely unpredictable.
Um,

28
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.350
and he is famous or infamous or George Soros attack on the pound.

29
00:02:19.871 --> 00:02:21.870
Sterling.
Uh,

30
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.910
this was nearly 20 years ago when a Soros famous hedge fund,

31
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.110
uh,

32
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.950
decided it was going to attack the pound sterling and

33
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.070
Richard Medley was then working for Soros and medley had inside information

34
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.060
about the behavior of the central banks of continental Europe was able to

35
00:02:48.281 --> 00:02:51.430
predict their behavior,
sort of Soros,

36
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.430
the Soros Fun,
uh,

37
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.790
made well over a billion dollars on one transaction in an attack on the value of

38
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:04.820
the pound,
which was an,

39
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.830
and the attack was controversial and medleys rolling and controversial.

40
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.840
And we'll have some fun with him about that.
Uh,

41
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.420
you should begin now reading poster.

42
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.490
The pages are small.
Uh,
but it's a,
it's a,

43
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:22.710
it's a dense book.
It's,

44
00:03:22.711 --> 00:03:27.711
it's a challenging book and you'll need it for Wednesday of next week when we

45
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.620
have,
we'll get spun in as a guest.
A will is,
uh,

46
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.000
the director of the Yale International Center for finance,

47
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.310
uh,
and like Jim,
a Yale college alum and uh,

48
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.650
uh,
something again,
like Jim,
something of a renaissance man.
Uh,

49
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.020
but he's going to be talking about the crash of Oh eight,

50
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.380
which is a pretty intricate story.

51
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.290
And the Posner is

52
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.270
easily the best book written about it though,

53
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:03.480
not easily the easiest book written about.

54
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.850
So without further ado,

55
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.080
a gym is a 1973 graduate of Yale College.

56
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.310
And let's,

57
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.060
let's talk to them about your life after yoke.

58
00:04:19.061 --> 00:04:24.061
There is life after Yale college and how it began for you and how it carried

59
00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:27.730
forward until the date you arrived at Enron.

60
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.580
<v 2>I'll shorten the version and this other,
the details get to be sort of tedious.</v>

61
00:04:34.581 --> 00:04:39.140
Uh,
um,
let's see.
Okay,

62
00:04:39.141 --> 00:04:44.000
well anyway,
I went to HBS because all the smart people,

63
00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:45.440
we're going into law or medicine.

64
00:04:45.441 --> 00:04:49.400
I had a primitive sense of markets and I knew that I should avoid,
uh,

65
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.840
the smart people much as I did in my classes.
And,
um,

66
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.080
I then from HBS went to Aetna life and casualty,

67
00:04:57.081 --> 00:05:01.040
investing their money on investment department to my then wife announced either

68
00:05:01.041 --> 00:05:04.010
weaken,
leave Hartford or she could leap Hartford.
Uh,

69
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.180
at which point I sort of started searching for a job in New York and landed one

70
00:05:08.181 --> 00:05:12.860
at a venerable old firm called Kuhn Loeb and company may mate rest in peace,

71
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.810
um,
which promptly merged out of existence about nine months after I joined it.

72
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.270
And,
uh,

73
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.270
at the time I emerged the Lehman Brothers at the time I listened to my uncle who

74
00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:28.610
was a client of Lehman and avoided Lehman.
Um,

75
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.420
I went to work at first Boston,
another may it rest in peace,

76
00:05:32.421 --> 00:05:36.640
actually sort of firm and um,
um,

77
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.820
then,
and an astonishing move of true idiocy.

78
00:05:40.821 --> 00:05:44.390
I went back to Lehman in 1981 and the industry department,

79
00:05:44.391 --> 00:05:48.920
cause I was interested in energy,
uh,
until uh,
sheriffs in acquired Lehman.

80
00:05:48.921 --> 00:05:51.170
And it had all the human characteristics of Lehman,

81
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.920
the economic characteristics of Shearson.
I you the worst of both worlds.
Um,

82
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.610
and then I being that the flying Dutchman,

83
00:05:58.611 --> 00:06:03.560
a finance went to Drexel to live when puff.
Uh,
and,
uh,

84
00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:08.370
it went broke in 1990.
Um,
and,
um,

85
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:09.850
I then,
uh,

86
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:15.060
I had one last job and conventional investment banking with a New Orleans from

87
00:06:15.061 --> 00:06:18.480
to the head of the firm announced I had a quote on economic attachment to

88
00:06:18.481 --> 00:06:22.560
quality unquote,
which was about the worst thing you could say about anyone.

89
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.820
So I took my quixotic approach and became a consultant,

90
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.340
um,
uh,
charging sort of minimum wage by investment banking,

91
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.010
uh,
standards and maximum wage by college professors.
Okay.

92
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.160
I don't,
I don't know,
uh,
economic college professors standards.
So it's not,
uh,

93
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.280
but,
um,
I think Steve Ross makes a lot of money,

94
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.200
but it doesn't make it here or an MIT hello.

95
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.570
That's a separate issue.
But anyway,
um,
so I was,
uh,

96
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.550
one of my past clients and I was there actually at the start of Enron cause I

97
00:07:02.551 --> 00:07:07.080
was there.
Uh,
we help refinance and Ron's huge amounts of,
of,

98
00:07:07.081 --> 00:07:10.230
of death that we're about to go into default unless we had done something when

99
00:07:10.231 --> 00:07:14.770
they,
when the Enron was created in 1984 or five,
uh,

100
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:20.050
85,
I think.
Um,
and,
um,
one of my clients have been Enron.

101
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.100
I became a,
uh,
an investment bank.
It conventional investment banking.

102
00:07:23.101 --> 00:07:27.770
I became a consultant then Ron sorta working on,
uh,
their,
uh,

103
00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:32.400
attempt to roll up their aggregate into one into one

104
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.560
legal entity.
Uh,
all of their,
uh,
foreign projects.

105
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.080
Um,
and,
uh,
after a while,
uh,

106
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:46.710
the complexities were such that virtually no one had the institutional memory

107
00:07:46.711 --> 00:07:51.270
required to be able to complete the deal except for one or two people.
Uh,

108
00:07:51.271 --> 00:07:53.650
and,
um,
uh,

109
00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.990
they needed someone who knew what they knew that story to be able to,

110
00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.400
to really stay on with the company.

111
00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:03.950
And they asked me if I wanted to do that and I ended up,
uh,

112
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.920
uh,
a greening,
uh,
and,
uh,

113
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:12.390
then I was there a full nine months until this was a 1994.
A four,

114
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.460
is there about nine months before I,

115
00:08:14.461 --> 00:08:19.461
the general counsel and the controller all resigned and the fall of 1995 you

116
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.690
spend those nine months,

117
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:26.750
all of them I think as chief financial officer of Enron global pipeline and

118
00:08:28.081 --> 00:08:30.500
power.
Yes.
I was um,

119
00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:35.570
those nine months were spent at the subsidiary level as the CFO of this one

120
00:08:35.761 --> 00:08:39.390
little a subsidiary company of theirs.
But during that time,

121
00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:41.573
mmm.

122
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:47.140
Anyone who walked the halls of Enron good pick up lots of information and the

123
00:08:48.711 --> 00:08:52.010
only issue is whether you wanted to ignore it or not.

124
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.060
And of course a lot of people's uh Huh.

125
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.070
Excellent livelihoods dependent,
dependent on,

126
00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:03.810
they're ignoring the information freely available in the halls.
Uh,

127
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.300
which turned out generally to be quite accurate.

128
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:11.620
<v 0>Was the ethical texture Enron a noticeably different from the general mine run</v>

129
00:09:18.651 --> 00:09:20.360
of investment banking as you,
it?

130
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.610
<v 2>Well that's an excellent question.
The problem is there a,</v>

131
00:09:24.611 --> 00:09:28.320
you can either trace Tracy declining curve,

132
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.990
constantly declining curve and investment banking from the time I entered

133
00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:38.991
investment banking in 1975 or postulate a somewhat easier or sort of old style

134
00:09:42.151 --> 00:09:44.100
investment backing and new style.
Um,

135
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.020
and the old style really was a gentleman's game.
I'm not talking about pre sec,

136
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:50.340
pre 1929 crash,

137
00:09:50.341 --> 00:09:55.341
but certainly when I entered there was an old generation that was um,

138
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:59.820
um,
quite ethical,
upright and gentlemanly.
Uh,

139
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:04.850
and of course those people died out or were pushed off the edge and uh,

140
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.880
were replaced by people who have like different ilk and which were,

141
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:12.390
who were much more like Enron.

142
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.670
<v 0>But for like Enron,</v>

143
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:19.070
Enron is a very young entity and grew up in the period after the fall,

144
00:10:20.501 --> 00:10:21.334
so to speak.

145
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:26.550
<v 2>What do you want them off the hook a little about that or not and run off the</v>

146
00:10:26.551 --> 00:10:28.850
hook.
Yeah.
And buy,

147
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:33.000
I don't think you will by saying how would I let them off the hook by the way,

148
00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:34.621
<v 0>you know,
they,</v>

149
00:10:34.621 --> 00:10:39.621
they were brought up by wolves and therefore behave like walls there.

150
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.420
<v 2>Well,
if you,
if you are a wolf,
you are typically brought up by wolves.
But,
um,</v>

151
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:47.570
uh,
the,

152
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.640
one of the things is I've been listening to your course,

153
00:10:52.641 --> 00:10:54.920
all the lectures and looking at the readings.

154
00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.050
One of the things that I've been trying to piece in my own mind together,

155
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:05.450
uh,
is,
is what went wrong.

156
00:11:05.451 --> 00:11:06.320
When did,

157
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:11.160
in the course of development of the theory of capitalism did,

158
00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.050
uh,

159
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:16.550
the theoreticians decided there was no need for morality.

160
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.810
Uh,
and uh,
when did,
when did morality,

161
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:25.640
it replaced by efficiency.
Um,
and um,

162
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.400
you know,
at Enron it,
um,
it would be a

163
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:36.210
situation where,
uh,
the,
uh,
ethical extremes,

164
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:41.520
the ethical environment was so a completely different,
uh,

165
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:43.540
that it begs the question of,
of,

166
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:47.550
of what is morality and,
uh,

167
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:51.720
and what do we base it on?
Uh,
because,
uh,

168
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.370
the people that work there would find any concepts

169
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:58.720
<v 3>of morality laughable and merely a trap for the unwary.</v>

170
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.233
Hmm.

171
00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:01.070
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

172
00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:06.070
Stating the case has lots of lots of jargon in it that is business speak and

173
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:15.820
Leslie huff and some others have suggested that it might be useful to go through

174
00:12:15.821 --> 00:12:20.020
some of that.
Okay.
Some of that background language before we do the case.

175
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:25.320
And I'm going to descend to the audience and take you in the lecture lecture.

176
00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.470
Well,
well,
we're lecture lap.
Um,

177
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:33.490
<v 3>well Enron,
um,</v>

178
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.800
like a number of other firms got very involved in,

179
00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:42.450
in commodities and commodity financing and commodity contracts.

180
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.200
And um,

181
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.200
if you're the typical commodity small producer,

182
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.400
oftentimes over leveraged,
you know,

183
00:12:53.401 --> 00:12:58.401
hand to mouth existence really can't take a big plying leap and then hope to

184
00:12:59.041 --> 00:12:59.761
make a lot of money.

185
00:12:59.761 --> 00:13:03.750
What you typically start to do is in the case of an oil and gas producer,

186
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.240
let's say gas producer in particular,

187
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:11.800
I have a general view as to what I'm going to produce each month and I,

188
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.160
and this,
these are prices,
not production amounts,

189
00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:18.000
but I have a general idea what I'm gonna Produce.
The January,
February,
on and on,

190
00:13:18.001 --> 00:13:22.730
it's very hard to shut down a gas.
Well you don't,
it's typically not really,
uh,

191
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.820
done.
Uh,

192
00:13:23.821 --> 00:13:28.050
you typically just produce flat out and then try to do the best you can with

193
00:13:28.051 --> 00:13:29.400
your price realizations.

194
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:33.750
But I know I'm going to be producing a certain amount and the first question is,

195
00:13:33.751 --> 00:13:35.190
okay,
do I take a flyer or not?

196
00:13:35.191 --> 00:13:39.810
Most people who have a lot of debt or squeezed for other reasons don't take a

197
00:13:39.811 --> 00:13:44.370
flyer.
So what they do is they can go to a commodities broker and say,

198
00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:48.750
what price will you give me for each month for the rest of the year?

199
00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:50.890
And,
um,

200
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.200
the typic end or else they can go to a commodities exchange and get the same

201
00:13:55.201 --> 00:13:57.660
result.
But what they do is they will say,
okay,

202
00:13:57.661 --> 00:14:02.661
I'll sell you the equivalent of a thousand barrels of oil and gas terms about,

203
00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:08.130
um,
in,
in January four,
$5 equivalent of price in February.

204
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.810
It'll be slightly declining in,
in spring,
uh,

205
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.830
as a result of expected,
a lack of demand for gas,

206
00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.480
then start to middle level out in summer,
and then we'll start going up.
So the,

207
00:14:21.481 --> 00:14:26.481
so the commodities broker will commit to buy a certain amount each month.

208
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:33.060
Now,
if you're the producer though,
there's only one problem you don't,

209
00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:34.680
you expect to be able to produce.

210
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.870
But what if something goes wrong with your well?
Well,

211
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:42.390
if something goes wrong with you,
well you're committed to sell each month.
Okay?

212
00:14:42.391 --> 00:14:47.391
So what oftentimes will happen is that instead of actually committing to sell a

213
00:14:47.491 --> 00:14:48.480
certain amount each month,

214
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.580
that producer will buy a a put.

215
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.440
So that in case the price does go down,
he can make money,

216
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:01.070
but he's not obligated to sell a certain volume.

217
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:06.230
So will you start doing is having very many very variations on a theme of

218
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:11.150
helping producers and consumers were on the other side who also want to hedge.

219
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.520
They want to determine their costs of good sold.

220
00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:19.040
You started having very many types of of of mechanism contractual mechanisms to

221
00:15:19.371 --> 00:15:24.371
allow producers to fix to varying extents the likelihood of certain outcomes for

222
00:15:28.671 --> 00:15:32.810
their firm for the year.
And they get hugely complex.

223
00:15:32.811 --> 00:15:35.120
This is just just the start.

224
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.000
There are huge numbers of variations on a theme.

225
00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.240
Ways that you can lock in certain types of spreads,

226
00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:46.360
ways that you can hedge all sorts of variables beyond just the,

227
00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.730
the pricing in south Louisiana.
Um,

228
00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:53.510
so that's what Enron got in the business of doing.

229
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.010
And if you look at it the first 12 months,
there's a very broad liquid market,

230
00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.870
whether it's done by the commodity exchanges or competing traders,
everyone,

231
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.930
very clear forward market,
everyone can see this.

232
00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:09.243
And,

233
00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:15.040
and if you're looking at taking positions as an Enron to the extent they relate

234
00:16:15.471 --> 00:16:20.471
to widely traded commodities for the F in short periods of time going into the

235
00:16:21.051 --> 00:16:23.330
future,
it's very obvious what you have.

236
00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:27.410
You can tell whether you're making money every day by what happens to the

237
00:16:27.411 --> 00:16:31.250
commodity relative to the risk positions you've put yourself in.

238
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:37.760
And that's if Enron had stayed with this type of situation,

239
00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:42.770
they wouldn't have made a lot of apparent money,
but they'd be alive today.

240
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.380
It's a tough business.
It's a low margin business,

241
00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:50.830
but you can make a lot of money in it if you stick to your knitting.

242
00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.190
But if you want to make a lot of money very quickly,

243
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.400
you start looking at other approaches.

244
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:06.100
And
if you sort of look at,
and this is for a trading company,
a,

245
00:17:06.101 --> 00:17:08.180
you know,
and manufacturing companies have different,

246
00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.310
different types of situations,

247
00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:15.590
but you start with the lowest risk type of asset and that'd be cash,

248
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:19.850
you know,
uh,
presumably barely highly,

249
00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:24.350
highly rated short term loans,
uh,
to,
to uh,
uh,

250
00:17:24.351 --> 00:17:29.120
the best types of corporations or ideally the u s government.
That's great.

251
00:17:29.121 --> 00:17:33.530
But that's a very low,
low return asset.
Marketable securities,

252
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:38.480
still very liquid,
but you're starting to increase the volatility of the,

253
00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:41.990
of the returns and you can make more money here,

254
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:46.820
but it's another place where,
um,
you,
you have to,

255
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.040
you really have to have an information advantage.

256
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.360
What we're doing is we're just sending,

257
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.960
we're going from things that are easily valued to more and more difficult

258
00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.060
exchange traded derivatives.

259
00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:00.630
That's the type of thing I was talking about where you have a forward what's

260
00:18:00.631 --> 00:18:04.830
called a forward market where people can sell or buy a commodities for very

261
00:18:04.831 --> 00:18:06.870
clear prices and and it's,

262
00:18:06.871 --> 00:18:10.140
and it's very well known what exactly the market is.

263
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:14.700
Although at the farther you go out on the the forward market,

264
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:18.090
the less liquid it is.
So we're even here,

265
00:18:18.091 --> 00:18:23.091
we're starting to to get to a situation where I know that I've committed to say

266
00:18:23.101 --> 00:18:23.851
if I'm an Enron,

267
00:18:23.851 --> 00:18:28.851
I've committed to buy the equivalent of a million barrels of oil a year out.

268
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:35.600
Well how do you value that is one you get one value.

269
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:39.850
If you're,
if you're saying,
well I'm going to liquidate it and other value if,

270
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:41.880
if you're saying how much would someone pay for it?

271
00:18:41.881 --> 00:18:45.540
So even there you're starting to have divergences in terms of how you look at

272
00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:47.100
value,
which can be exploited.

273
00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:51.480
Then we started going as we get down to further down the line in terms of the

274
00:18:51.481 --> 00:18:52.680
levels of certainty.

275
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:57.570
You have certain types of derivatives like options,

276
00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:02.070
which might instead of being a year out might be five years out.

277
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:07.060
So people can take the sorts of algorithms,
uh,

278
00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:12.140
useful in inferring or infer the algorithm from the exact existing trading of

279
00:19:12.691 --> 00:19:13.710
short term options,

280
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.920
apply them to long term options and you get a value which is plausible.

281
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:23.550
So it's based upon clear,
clear market inputs.

282
00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:28.020
But a result which is not self evident because there is no clear trading market.

283
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.530
Finally,
and this is what Enron really got into,

284
00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:36.570
you have unimaginably diverse one off deals.
I'll give you an example.

285
00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:41.940
So a family wishes to buy price protection 20 years out against increases in

286
00:19:41.941 --> 00:19:43.080
yield tuition costs.

287
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:46.980
And that sounds far fetched.

288
00:19:46.981 --> 00:19:50.550
But that's the sort of thing that Enron was doing that was yell tuition costs,

289
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:55.730
but taking very exotic situations and then pricing them and,

290
00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:01.350
and so I sort of took an example,
40,
50,
60,

291
00:20:01.351 --> 00:20:04.020
70,000 a year,
years out.

292
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:08.070
And I'm sure we'd all have a point of view as to how yells tuition is going to

293
00:20:08.071 --> 00:20:10.410
go up.
I mean if it,
if it continues constant,

294
00:20:10.411 --> 00:20:14.940
it goes up probably about inflation plus two or 3% a year.
You'd have a curve,

295
00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.660
but it would be very judgmental.
There,
you know,
be,

296
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:22.350
there'd be some plausibility to it.
But who knows?

297
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.290
And no one else is making a market in this.

298
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.770
So if you're Enron and you and you've staked a huge amount of money,
for example,

299
00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:30.720
on this one trade,

300
00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:35.610
how do they decide how much money they've made in a given year?
Will?

301
00:20:35.611 --> 00:20:40.230
The answer is they use their own curves and if there,

302
00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:41.850
and if they want to make more money,

303
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.390
they just change the assumptions and who's to say they're wrong?

304
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:51.850
No one.
And that's what it was.
That was,
that was what was happening.
So you have,

305
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:57.280
you have one off assets,
risk positions,

306
00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.620
which were nearly impossible to value,

307
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:06.630
where the ability to recognize income could be affected with the stroke of a

308
00:21:06.671 --> 00:21:07.504
pen.

309
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:13.990
And if you're able to recognize income pretty much any way you want,

310
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.840
perversely,
your view of the risk of that type of asset,

311
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.030
it'll slowly start creeping into your mind that it's a low risk asset because it

312
00:21:25.031 --> 00:21:29.200
always has this wonderful profitability that never seems to go down.

313
00:21:29.201 --> 00:21:32.590
Never problematic.
Now.

314
00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:37.390
Normally you'd expect external auditors to question these assumptions,

315
00:21:37.391 --> 00:21:41.650
but Arthur Anderson was making 50 million bucks a year off of Enron.

316
00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:44.680
They going to question anything.
No,

317
00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.730
so they could basically create income anytime they want.

318
00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.810
The problem though is you end up having an increasing divergence between the

319
00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:57.811
income you're creating and cash can't real cashflow and you're having increasing

320
00:21:59.141 --> 00:22:03.580
divergence between what I might call the intrinsic risk of an asset category and

321
00:22:03.581 --> 00:22:07.600
the risk that you perceive based upon your own manipulative control over

322
00:22:07.601 --> 00:22:08.830
recognition of profits

323
00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:16.050
and that becomes the source of Enron's own downfall is that they

324
00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:24.910
right at the start of each transaction,
they are manipulating the numbers.

325
00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:28.930
It wasn't a top down type of adjustment like Worldcom where basically all the

326
00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:32.410
people at the subsidiary level where we're doing honest things and they're right

327
00:22:32.411 --> 00:22:36.790
at the top,
they started monkeying with the results at Enron,

328
00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:41.800
every single transaction with a gamed to figure out how it could create income,

329
00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.990
maximize income,
short term income.
But once you start doing that,

330
00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:52.030
it starts becoming harder and harder and harder to figure out,
well,

331
00:22:52.031 --> 00:22:55.420
where should I be investing my money?
Where should I be placing my,

332
00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:59.350
how should I be adjusting my risk portfolio?
How much debt should I take on?

333
00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:03.160
Because no one has any idea what the risk is and no one has any idea what the

334
00:23:03.161 --> 00:23:06.580
profitability is and that,
that sounds crazy.

335
00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:11.800
That's what it was.
Um,
one of the things,
so you,

336
00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:15.140
so you have so on the asset side of the business where you're,

337
00:23:15.141 --> 00:23:19.960
you're actually taking risks on behalf of the firm and,
and,
and,
and working,
uh,

338
00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:24.700
with,
with outsiders,
uh,
and making money that way.
That was all screwed up.

339
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:28.500
But they had another problem.
You know,
we,

340
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:33.900
and we have basically every public company has to provide annually something

341
00:23:34.751 --> 00:23:38.650
called a balance sheet and an income statement and the balance sheet is opposed

342
00:23:38.651 --> 00:23:43.270
to represent the market value.
But in general terms,

343
00:23:43.271 --> 00:23:48.271
the market value of what you own and the obligations you have to outsiders,

344
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:54.110
which offset some of those assets and give you a net result,

345
00:23:54.111 --> 00:23:58.100
which is what the stock holders,
uh,
really have and the w in the firm.

346
00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.590
So you might have $1,000 worth of assets,

347
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:05.210
you might have debt longterm debt.
Just,
it could be a mortgage to someone,

348
00:24:05.211 --> 00:24:10.100
a $500 you subtract that and you get stock holders equity cause stockholders on

349
00:24:10.101 --> 00:24:13.910
the residual when,
when,
when a firm is liquidate if $500.

350
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:18.890
So assets always by definition equal to sum of debt of liabilities and

351
00:24:18.891 --> 00:24:22.430
stockholders' equity.
But you may say,

352
00:24:22.431 --> 00:24:25.610
well if you're in Ron,
well I don't want to show all that debt

353
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:32.390
what you can do.
And I think the techniques would take too long today.

354
00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:35.960
I mean I wasn't set up to go through the techniques I can if people really want,

355
00:24:35.961 --> 00:24:38.000
but it'd be have to be another day.

356
00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:41.450
Basically the accounting rules

357
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:47.960
like the Internal Revenue Code have a series of precise uh,

358
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.250
procedures,

359
00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:54.350
criteria tests for determining how accounting will work.

360
00:24:56.030 --> 00:25:00.200
The problem with that is that if you are really smart,

361
00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:05.980
you can figure out how to end up with the economic equivalent of a given a

362
00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.193
treatment,

363
00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:17.600
but have it appear just the way you want in the account.

364
00:25:17.601 --> 00:25:22.601
So right here I could take this debt and I could move it and associated assets,

365
00:25:26.811 --> 00:25:28.460
$500 out of each column.

366
00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:34.390
And I ended up with $500 of assets at $500 a stockholder's equity smaller firm

367
00:25:34.401 --> 00:25:35.750
to be sure but no debt.

368
00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:41.680
So there are techniques which exploit loopholes so that something that is an

369
00:25:43.491 --> 00:25:48.370
economic terms of debt suddenly disappears or that,
um,

370
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:51.710
if,
if I want to be able to sell assets to myself,

371
00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.200
I can create an alter ego,

372
00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:58.290
something that looks a little bit like an independent company but isn't,

373
00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:02.270
I couldn't recognize gain on the sale even though I'm really selling it to

374
00:26:02.271 --> 00:26:03.104
myself.

375
00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:08.790
And that's because the loopholes and the accounting allow you to achieve form

376
00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:13.220
over substance.
To break the code though,

377
00:26:13.221 --> 00:26:17.970
you have to have a complacent auditor.
And in the case of,

378
00:26:17.971 --> 00:26:21.590
of Arthur Anderson,
over half of their services weren't even auditing services.

379
00:26:21.591 --> 00:26:26.260
There were consulting services,
so they are completely bought off.
Uh,

380
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:28.730
and you also have to have,

381
00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:33.650
well,
okay,
so

382
00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:38.900
the way the system worked when I started in finance,

383
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:42.890
you had people who have high,

384
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:49.650
who were the,
you might call them this sort of the,
the trust gatekeepers.

385
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:54.450
They would have included a major accounting firm,

386
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:58.980
high quality law firm,
high quality board of directors.

387
00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:06.110
But the problem is that Tim is that very often the reality,

388
00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:07.970
<v 1>okay,</v>

389
00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:10.610
<v 3>of the A,
or put it another way,</v>

390
00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:15.110
the perception of reputation and trust and quality

391
00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.250
lags the reality.
So in other words,

392
00:27:19.251 --> 00:27:22.310
if you want to make a lot of money in a short period of time,

393
00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:27.730
you take a firm that has existing good reputation and the you use that

394
00:27:29.271 --> 00:27:34.210
reputation to be able to generate high profits in the short term.

395
00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:37.940
The way you do that as you say,
ah,
AH,
Arthur Anderson,
well,

396
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.200
the high quality firms,

397
00:27:39.201 --> 00:27:43.730
so I don't have to worry about a funny stuff and the accounting,

398
00:27:43.731 --> 00:27:47.120
I don't have to worry if I'm a reader of those financial statements and
investor,

399
00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:51.950
I don't have to worry about whether they're basically disguising debt or whether

400
00:27:51.951 --> 00:27:56.480
they are basically,
uh,
you know,
creating their own earnings out of thin air.

401
00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.300
Because Arthur Anderson is a high quality firm,

402
00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:04.400
so generations of people could have built up the reputation of a firm.

403
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:07.370
But maintaining a reputation,

404
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:11.810
like maintaining a building requires a lot of ongoing investment.

405
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:15.470
And if you really want to get a lot of cashflow in a short period of time,

406
00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.950
you just let it start to disintegrate.

407
00:28:18.951 --> 00:28:22.910
But people won't notice what's really going on for a long period of time.

408
00:28:22.911 --> 00:28:26.690
And while,
and while you're fooling them,
you,

409
00:28:26.691 --> 00:28:31.040
if you're Arthur Andersen and run one of their clients can make a lot of money

410
00:28:31.041 --> 00:28:32.240
because this is easy money.

411
00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:36.140
This is easy cause cause basically you don't have to create value.

412
00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:41.810
You merely have to engage in an exchange with another member of a capitalist

413
00:28:41.811 --> 00:28:44.540
society who thinks they're informed but isn't.

414
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:49.790
That's I mean when we think about how capitalism creates value to my way of

415
00:28:49.791 --> 00:28:54.350
thinking,
it's part,
it's a series of informed and voluntary exchanges.

416
00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:56.310
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

417
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:58.050
<v 3>But what does it mean to be informed?</v>

418
00:28:59.170 --> 00:28:59.560
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

419
00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:02.080
<v 3>One of the problems with,
with,
you know,</v>

420
00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:04.720
capitalism as exists and not as I read the,

421
00:29:04.721 --> 00:29:09.721
some of these crazy economists is that almost no one is true rational economic

422
00:29:11.351 --> 00:29:13.480
man.
It would probably be a few geniuses that are,

423
00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:16.000
but most people don't have the time.

424
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:20.860
Don't have the intellect or don't have the cynicism to understand what they're

425
00:29:20.861 --> 00:29:25.210
up against.
So they say,
well,
a good firm,
I don't have to worry about it.

426
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:29.920
Well the answer is you do have to worry about it.
And that's one of,

427
00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:31.300
that's why my view,

428
00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:36.310
this all came a cropper and the last 10 or 20 years is that the self imposed

429
00:29:36.311 --> 00:29:37.270
restrictions,

430
00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:44.980
which limited short term self interest kept the whole system stable for many

431
00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:52.090
decades.
But once people started to say,
well,
I don't have to worry about ethics,

432
00:29:52.091 --> 00:29:52.631
I mean that's,

433
00:29:52.631 --> 00:29:57.631
I just have to worry about being a rational and realizing my own goals.

434
00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:01.870
Well the answer at that point is the whole system starts to go,

435
00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:06.550
and this is a perfect example because these are people that people are getting

436
00:30:06.551 --> 00:30:08.650
engaged in this sort of deception,

437
00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:14.110
did not have any ethics and would actually view ethics is laughable.

438
00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:17.230
That's really important to realize what people are up against.

439
00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:22.780
And that is their view is if they're creating economic efficiency,

440
00:30:22.781 --> 00:30:25.360
even though they lost side of that too.
Who Cares about ethics?

441
00:30:25.361 --> 00:30:29.610
Ethics is another constraint of a little man.
Um,

442
00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:31.750
so,
hi.

443
00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:38.240
So let's just make sure you link this to,
to,
uh,

444
00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:42.480
off balance sheet accounts.
Did you see the connection there?

445
00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:47.100
The techniques?
Are there techniques or are are

446
00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:53.460
they're intricate.
I was going to bring a piece of paper and have a xerox,
um,

447
00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:57.540
but it's,
it's a diagram of a,

448
00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.480
of a,
uh,

449
00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:05.460
transaction among eight different entities involving,

450
00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:06.170
uh,

451
00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:11.170
probably 1,015 hundred pages of documents to be able to,

452
00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:14.170
uh,

453
00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:19.170
exploit every loophole possible to create an alter ego entity,

454
00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.040
which you control what,

455
00:31:22.041 --> 00:31:26.670
what looks independent enough to be able to shuffle off,

456
00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:32.280
uh,
maybe a billion dollars worth of debt,
billion dollars worth of assets.
Um,

457
00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.520
I didn't,
you know,
it's one of these things where,
here's the problem

458
00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:40.650
in modern finance,

459
00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:46.270
one of the tools of the trade is obfuscation.

460
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:50.530
The transactions are meant to be

461
00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:57.420
mind bogglingly complex.
So lesser people,

462
00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:58.890
lesser intellects,

463
00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:04.440
who rely on reputation to simplify their lives will fall for it.

464
00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:09.210
They'll say,
I don't understand this stuff,
but you know,
I know,

465
00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:12.710
I know that guy on the board and he's a quality guy.
The I,

466
00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:17.130
but the problem then is,
well,
how do you know?
Well,
I've asked Joe.

467
00:32:17.131 --> 00:32:18.840
Joseph is a quality guy.
How's he know?

468
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:23.400
How can you ultimately investigate all these things?
Well,

469
00:32:23.401 --> 00:32:26.490
the answer is you don't have the time and you may not have the intellect and you

470
00:32:26.491 --> 00:32:31.190
certainly don't have the money to be able to hire people to do that's,

471
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:35.670
that's how you can start to gain this whole system because there are a lot of

472
00:32:35.671 --> 00:32:40.190
people who expected the old rules of reputation and quality,

473
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:45.190
<v 2>which were developed after the 1929 crash as part of an overall change in our</v>

474
00:32:45.231 --> 00:32:46.790
system still prevailed,

475
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:52.700
but they didn't because basically everyone started being alone and into this

476
00:32:52.701 --> 00:32:57.680
strange sort of idea that markets are perfect and and rash and rational people

477
00:32:57.681 --> 00:33:01.160
will always come up with the most economically beneficial solution.

478
00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:06.140
I agree with that.
If in fact there's some,

479
00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:10.640
there's some limits because the fact is when I think of capitalism creating

480
00:33:10.641 --> 00:33:15.590
value,
I think of it getting around constraints,
but those constraints,

481
00:33:15.591 --> 00:33:16.610
what types of constraints,

482
00:33:16.611 --> 00:33:21.590
the constraints are physical constraints or maybe legal constraints where the

483
00:33:21.591 --> 00:33:26.591
law really is sort of a of a dead letter or a or bad idea.

484
00:33:26.601 --> 00:33:29.210
But like creating the wiggle,
you know,

485
00:33:29.211 --> 00:33:34.070
you have getting around some of the constraints of gravity and creating,
writing,

486
00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:37.640
being,
getting around other constraints.
I mean those are,

487
00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:42.860
those in my way of thinking are very beneficial ways of solving PR,

488
00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:48.260
problem solving.
But the other constraints that people have started to view as

489
00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:53.600
just a minor problem for lesser people are ethical constraints.

490
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:59.590
<v 0>So there's an intersection between a sheer complexity and ethical relaxation.</v>

491
00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:07.640
We had it a year ago when things got really ugly.

492
00:34:07.641 --> 00:34:11.990
Steve Schwarzman put together a little round table,

493
00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:17.080
which I attended in New York and Nancy Ferrets Smith made the most interesting

494
00:34:17.871 --> 00:34:21.800
point,
which is is the one you just pay that if,

495
00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:23.630
uh,

496
00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:28.630
if there are asset categories which are so intricate that nobody has really

497
00:34:30.681 --> 00:34:35.090
worked through,
nobody has really worked through,

498
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:40.230
uh,
all the mechanics of the thing in a way that allows them to understand the

499
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:44.750
impact of all of the variables in the system.
Then,
um,

500
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:47.090
uh,
the,

501
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:52.210
all the sort of market mechanisms which enforce a degree of rationality are

502
00:34:53.871 --> 00:34:55.730
disconnected from the instrument.

503
00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:02.000
<v 2>Yes,
I agree that there's no [inaudible] if you had,</v>

504
00:35:02.001 --> 00:35:07.001
if you had accountants and boards of directors who in effect did not give

505
00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:13.790
traders the benefit of the doubt,
probably be okay.

506
00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:19.450
But the fact is most people will give the benefit of the doubt to the people

507
00:35:21.501 --> 00:35:26.390
that you smarter.
And that is,
that's a road to extinction,

508
00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:29.790
<v 0>right?
That is the road to extinction.
Um,</v>

509
00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:33.660
let's talk about the road to Houston.
Um,
you,

510
00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:36.620
the book,
uh,

511
00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:41.660
smartest in the room where you are referred to it one point as the fly in the

512
00:35:42.121 --> 00:35:45.270
ointment from and Rod's point of view.
Um,

513
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:51.710
the most conspicuous characters there are a lay showing and fast out scaling.

514
00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:56.760
Fast out.
Uh,
tell us a little bit about those.

515
00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:01.190
<v 2>Well,
um,
um,</v>

516
00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:07.650
lay was someone who always operated from 30,000 feet and a big picture guy

517
00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:11.860
super,
you know,
all about strategy.
Uh,
um,

518
00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:16.150
never got into the operating the tails.
Never really wanted to know anything.

519
00:36:16.151 --> 00:36:19.780
If you produced consistent results,
there were absolutely no questions asked.

520
00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:25.270
Um,
and he didn't want to know decent guy in your impression

521
00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:32.750
he was at least as nice as most people I met.
Yeah.

522
00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.160
Uh,

523
00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:39.290
<v 0>how,
how did it nice and decent connect in your mind?</v>

524
00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:46.280
<v 2>Not at all,
but,
okay.
So he was decent,
decent,
you know,</v>

525
00:36:46.281 --> 00:36:50.810
I mean,
it's okay to hit her personally.
Interpersonally.
He was,

526
00:36:50.811 --> 00:36:55.640
he was not abrasive.
That's one good.
Okay.
And,
um,

527
00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:59.960
um,
so,
uh,
and scaling,
uh,

528
00:36:59.961 --> 00:37:03.890
was the,
uh,
was,
was the genius,

529
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:07.280
a true genius.
Um,
Ooh,
uh,

530
00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:12.960
spanned a span,

531
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:18.080
a huge range of,
of intellectual,

532
00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:22.340
um,
expertise is,
uh,
there are a lot of people,

533
00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:28.100
a lot of people in life who can only look at the details but are very good at

534
00:37:28.101 --> 00:37:28.934
details.

535
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:32.960
And there are other people who seem only to be able to grasp the big picture but

536
00:37:32.961 --> 00:37:36.830
then cannot convert it into actual specifics of action.

537
00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:42.470
And scaling was able to move seamlessly from the most detailed aspects of each

538
00:37:42.471 --> 00:37:47.300
transaction to the broadest reach of,
of,
of corporate vision in a way.

539
00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:51.920
I've never seen it before.
He,
uh,
uh,
very,
very skilled.

540
00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:56.140
<v 0>So he was quite literally the smartest guy in the room.
Yes,</v>

541
00:37:56.770 --> 00:38:00.400
I think he was.
Uh,
and as for fast out,

542
00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:09.730
<v 2>Arthur Anderson has been killed off,
so one cannot,
um,</v>

543
00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.860
with one can,
with legal,
without legal risk,

544
00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:17.790
say whatever you want about Arthur Anderson.
Uh,
there are others that,
that,
uh,

545
00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.230
that,
that,
um,

546
00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:23.750
there was another party that I'll leave it as the elephant in the room,
uh,
that,

547
00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:25.900
um,
that helped fast.
Now,

548
00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:32.120
let's just say that the professionals who should have been showing some small

549
00:38:32.961 --> 00:38:36.920
degree of allegiance to the shareholders instead of helped avast out,

550
00:38:36.921 --> 00:38:39.920
concoct all these,
uh,

551
00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:44.770
gnarly schemes because he himself was completely unable to do so.

552
00:38:44.771 --> 00:38:48.530
He was just someone who was a,
um,

553
00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:49.523
<v 1>hm.</v>

554
00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.460
<v 2>Like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern and one of the indifferent children of the</v>

555
00:38:53.461 --> 00:38:54.294
earth.

556
00:38:57.590 --> 00:39:02.060
<v 0>Uh,
so he was not appear upscaling?
No,
no.</v>

557
00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:03.650
He's a jokester.
He was a joke.

558
00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:09.130
<v 2>He was a foil.
All he was,
he was just,
you had to have somebody that,</v>

559
00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:13.370
that was basically in there in addition to the professionals from the outside.

560
00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:16.040
And he was there,
but he didn't

561
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:21.330
<v 0>so fast out gets possession on both sides of many transactions.</v>

562
00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:25.650
And if,
uh,

563
00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:31.640
and they talk their way through the obvious conflict of interest by claiming his

564
00:39:31.951 --> 00:39:34.260
special expertise justifies the role.

565
00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:35.190
<v 2>Right.</v>

566
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:39.380
Then only able to get deals done much more quickly because he knows the assets

567
00:39:39.381 --> 00:39:41.580
so well.
Right.
Blah,
blah,
blah.

568
00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:45.710
<v 0>Now.
So they waived the corporate conflict of interest policy in his case.</v>

569
00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:50.880
Now if scaling and delay had been able to program you

570
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:56.990
entirely as they wished,

571
00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:03.080
would your role have been analogous to fast rope?
Sure,
sure.

572
00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:08.460
<v 2>Scaling is scaling asked me to in effect to be fast style.
Um,</v>

573
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:09.703
um,

574
00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:13.950
when I started at the APP and I just said no,

575
00:40:13.951 --> 00:40:18.090
I was hired to hire it to be CFO,
VP and that's all I'm going to do.

576
00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:20.910
<v 0>Okay.
So let's talk,</v>

577
00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:26.150
let's talk about the early days when you're in the role of CFO at p.

578
00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.130
How does,
what,
what's the,

579
00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:36.120
what's it like when you get up in the morning and go to work and the phone range

580
00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:39.340
and you're off off the well,

581
00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:44.160
<v 2>great.
So Epp was 51% owned by Enron,</v>

582
00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:48.490
49% by the public.
Um,
and

583
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:54.130
the,
uh,
while I was the CFO and then later president of Vpp,

584
00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:58.450
the CEO and chairman of the board was,
um,

585
00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:03.620
uh,
rod gray who was a,
an executive at Enron,

586
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:05.590
uh,
and,

587
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:09.850
and the parent and who made most of his money from the parent.

588
00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:12.640
And so,
uh,
what,

589
00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:17.620
what happened is that rob rod would come up with some new scheme for

590
00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:24.170
and Ron to be able to dump some expenses on the minority on Etp,

591
00:41:25.391 --> 00:41:28.420
but really I wasn't concerned about Enron is concerned about the minority

592
00:41:28.421 --> 00:41:32.800
shareholders,
minority shareholders,
which was not the first to pay,
uh,

593
00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:36.330
in view.
Um,
and um,
um,

594
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:42.110
maybe once a week he would come up with some new scheme and maybe,
you know,

595
00:41:42.111 --> 00:41:46.610
over the first six months,
probably total of 50 or $75 million worth of,

596
00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:49.760
of,
of schemes that,
that,
you know,

597
00:41:49.761 --> 00:41:53.570
we just got to keep shooting down.
Uh,

598
00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:55.740
and of course once he did that,
uh,

599
00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:59.570
every time Enron and wanted to sell us a project,
uh,

600
00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:03.110
the process being so tainted,
we had to,
uh,

601
00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:08.720
trade very hard because,
um,
in effect I was trading with my own boss.

602
00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:22.550
What risks did you feel yourself exposed to in that situation?

603
00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.370
Well,
I didn't,
I didn't worry about,
uh,

604
00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:32.080
I didn't worry about legal risks,
um,
because I was doing the right thing.

605
00:42:32.081 --> 00:42:34.870
I just assumed I had no career.
I was going to have no career.

606
00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:40.480
But on the other hand,
I know there's a little company,

607
00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:45.250
uh,
and uh,
I had helped father this little company that,

608
00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:48.880
that Ron was sort of trying to tear apart.
And so I was,

609
00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:52.990
I would be God damned if they were going to get away with it until they finally,

610
00:42:52.991 --> 00:42:54.510
uh,
um,
uh,

611
00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:58.600
announced they were taking away my accounting staff and then they were going to

612
00:42:58.601 --> 00:43:01.390
bill me for the cost,
but have them report the skillings group.

613
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:03.700
And that's convenient.

614
00:43:03.701 --> 00:43:07.030
That's a very convenient so that at that point that general counsel and the

615
00:43:07.031 --> 00:43:11.230
controller and aisle resign.
So if,
you know,
by the way,

616
00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:16.510
uh,
own,
the only disclosure of a resignation was mine.

617
00:43:16.511 --> 00:43:19.120
They never disclosed the fact that general counsel were designed or the

618
00:43:19.121 --> 00:43:23.190
controller resigned.
The person who replaced me,
um,

619
00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:26.350
ultimately indicted.

620
00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:29.230
I'm not sure whether she was sent to jail.

621
00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:33.040
Indicted paid a big fine,

622
00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:36.970
and I think turned state's evidence there was what war?
Sentencing to prison.

623
00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:39.730
I know.
I saw it.
I know.
I thought it was all over it.

624
00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.270
<v 4>Uh,
no,</v>

625
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:46.670
<v 2>spinnaker exploration was the next chapter for you by,
right?</v>

626
00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:51.170
Yeah.
Um,
um,
I um,

627
00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:54.330
helped started spinnaker,
uh,

628
00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:58.350
the year after I got fired or actually that my position I was fire,

629
00:43:58.351 --> 00:44:02.690
their position is I quit and run.
Um,
and um,

630
00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.090
uh,
it was a,
uh,

631
00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:10.550
justice Enron was based on making money off of false information.

632
00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:15.510
Spinnaker was an attempt to make money off of good information and it's a

633
00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.600
completely different ways of playing information.

634
00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:22.060
It was the capsule of the business model for state was say,
uh,
uh,
the base,

635
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:26.690
it was engaged in exploration for oil mostly gas and the Gulf of Mexico.

636
00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:32.130
Uh,
with the basic strategic point of view that most,

637
00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:36.030
uh,
most independent oil and gas companies,

638
00:44:36.031 --> 00:44:41.031
whether it's at the overconfidence of their CEOs or macho man mentality,

639
00:44:41.251 --> 00:44:46.251
systematic under value information and would rather dry drill 10 dry holes,

640
00:44:46.411 --> 00:44:49.820
then,
you know,
spend 10% of the money buying a good dataset.

641
00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:53.660
So we got the best data we could seismic data,
which,

642
00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:58.020
which allows you probable inferences about the,

643
00:44:58.021 --> 00:45:01.970
about the structures underneath the earth and sometimes,
uh,

644
00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:05.490
some direct insight into whether gas is around.
Anyway,

645
00:45:05.491 --> 00:45:07.440
we bought a lot of seismic data,

646
00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:11.100
spend a lot of time with processing and spent a lot of time,
um,

647
00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:15.960
making sure we had the,
the best,
uh,
exploration group we could find and,

648
00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:19.980
um,
went into business on that basis.
Uh,
and,
uh,

649
00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:24.630
consistent with our view that information is key.

650
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:28.700
Not only do we try to get the best external information,
oh,

651
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:33.790
we also made sure that internally there was a free flow of information so that,

652
00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.430
uh,
for example,

653
00:45:35.431 --> 00:45:39.630
every Monday we had a meeting with all the employees where everything was up for

654
00:45:39.631 --> 00:45:41.670
discussion.
There were no questions,

655
00:45:41.671 --> 00:45:46.080
Bard and all the answers where candidate on the basis that it doesn't do any

656
00:45:46.081 --> 00:45:51.000
good to have great external information if the internal flows are not good and

657
00:45:51.001 --> 00:45:51.250
if,

658
00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:55.800
and the internal flows won't be good unless you truly care about what employees

659
00:45:55.801 --> 00:45:56.600
think.

660
00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:01.160
<v 0>And spinnaker was actually a quite,
was,
it is a quite spectacular that,</v>

661
00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:06.100
<v 2>well,
I live in spot by Nordisk hydro a couple of years ago,
uh,
what it was,</v>

662
00:46:06.101 --> 00:46:07.930
it was a multibillion dollar company,

663
00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:11.830
certainly when it was bought and it was started at a $50 million.
Um,

664
00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.900
a venture capital deal to start.

665
00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:16.123
<v 0>So,</v>

666
00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:19.203
<v 4>uh,</v>

667
00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.270
<v 0>spinnaker,
you,</v>

668
00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:26.810
I've heard you say it's been occur was the inverse of every decision,

669
00:46:27.871 --> 00:46:29.200
rule competent and Ron,

670
00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:33.050
<v 2>whenever we weren't sure what to do,
what you thought,
what would end run do?</v>

671
00:46:33.051 --> 00:46:33.920
I did the reverse.

672
00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:38.900
<v 4>Uh,
well that's,</v>

673
00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:45.250
<v 0>let's finish.
We've got,
we've got about 90 seconds.
Uh,</v>

674
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:46.920
let's finish with,

675
00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:47.903
<v 4>uh,</v>

676
00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:50.380
<v 0>chip it.</v>

677
00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:55.380
Jim is a scholar of the Old Testament at the Yale divinity school scholars,

678
00:46:55.801 --> 00:46:56.634
a little strong.

679
00:46:58.730 --> 00:47:03.730
I don't know many people who have read as many sources on arcane aspects of the

680
00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:10.260
Old Testament as you,
I think you're pretty,
pretty serious.

681
00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:16.260
That's why I was in project finance.
It was said,

682
00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:18.603
<v 4>all right.</v>

683
00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.580
<v 0>You know,
are we all</v>

684
00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:21.843
<v 4>MMM.</v>

685
00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:27.970
<v 0>Is American capitalism in a state of advanced moral and ethical or</v>

686
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.090
<v 2>not necessarily?</v>

687
00:47:31.091 --> 00:47:35.170
If people can grasp the requirements,

688
00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:39.910
the need for,
for ethics,
just to keep the system going.

689
00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:42.340
If people don't come to grips with that,

690
00:47:42.341 --> 00:47:44.590
I think it's just going to get worse and worse.

691
00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:48.210
<v 0>Okay.
There,
there's a big point there.
It's thick,
thick.</v>

692
00:47:48.211 --> 00:47:53.030
Now back to a Smith's invisible hand,
uh,

693
00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:58.220
and to Hayak and the creative powers of a free society.

694
00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:02.730
Uh,
all that thinking

695
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:07.260
has built into it at the very most basic level,

696
00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:13.250
an assumption about a truth telling an access to broadly correct information.

697
00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:19.530
And every single,
uh,

698
00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:24.090
every single tenant of the,
uh,
tradition,

699
00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:28.380
which runs from Adam Smith through modern economics,

700
00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:33.570
uh,
is founded on them.
And for Smith,

701
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:36.750
the ethical side of it was explicit with the theory of moral sentiments.

702
00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:41.820
The way economics is taught and the way business management is taught,

703
00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:47.930
the emphasis on an ethical commitment to truth has been somewhat subversion.

704
00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:54.420
It doesn't have the central status,
uh,
for us,

705
00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:55.410
uh,

706
00:48:55.410 --> 00:49:00.410
intellectually that it did for a Smith's a generation.

707
00:49:00.781 --> 00:49:05.280
I think that's a fair statement.
Uh,
but,

708
00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:08.400
uh,
Jim,
this has been,
uh,

709
00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:13.760
as it always is a very illuminating and even inspiring.

710
00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:16.403
Thank you very much.

711
00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:18.650
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
