WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.130
Okay.
Let's begin
a,

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.080
we continue,
uh,

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.110
Monday's a look at a Goldman Sachs and Goldman Sachs,

4
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.720
a role in the world of financial capitalism.
Um,

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.300
and
as on Monday,

6
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:25.230
we have my good friend Paulos the Noni with us.
Uh,

7
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:30.231
he remarked after Monday's class that he didn't get a single nasty question or

8
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.950
gesture or anything of that nature,
uh,
here.

9
00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:39.890
And then he spoke to his,
uh,

10
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.800
chairman Lloyd Lloyd Blankfein Blankfein who has been going around IB schools

11
00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:49.740
talking lately and Blankfein reported,
uh,

12
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.540
no hostile response at Columbia or where,
where,
where else did we go?

13
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.800
Pardon?
Princeton.
Good.
Yeah.
So,

14
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.283
<v 1>okay.</v>

15
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.060
<v 0>Okay.
So let's try it.</v>

16
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.440
Let's try an anonymous poll here.
We'll use the technology of humming.

17
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.790
And what I'd like you to do is,

18
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.810
if you think that a great many people who are in responsible positions at

19
00:01:23.051 --> 00:01:28.051
Goldman Sachs and similar banks make more money than they really should,

20
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.433
<v 1>you did.</v>

21
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.880
<v 0>Don't be shy.
And those who don't think so.</v>

22
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.190
Okay.
I read that as 65,

23
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.580
35 in the affirmative.
Um,

24
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.250
at any rate,
the,
what we're gonna do today is begin with,

25
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.200
uh,
an informal discussion.
Uh,

26
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.740
looking at some of Paulos work over the,

27
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.110
over the years at Goldman.
Um,

28
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.720
whereas last time focused within the firm,
uh,

29
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.460
today we're going to focus on the firm as an actor in the larger world.

30
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.710
And a polo is going to,

31
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.770
going to respond to a few questions about other endeavors and then he is going

32
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:25.200
to take the,

33
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.240
take the mic and a lecture on the,

34
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.200
the case of the huge Spanish,
uh,
energy company,
uh,

35
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.590
and the battle for control of it.

36
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.500
And you'll see when he does that,

37
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.820
that the activities of an investment banker are a pretty challenging and

38
00:02:47.371 --> 00:02:51.270
extremely complex.
Uh,
but we'll continue with.

39
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.240
Well,
let's start with,

40
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.890
do any of you own any garments from dolce

41
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.040
there?
Does anybody know what it is?

42
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.210
What pray.
Tell.

43
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.140
Okay.
They're a designer.

44
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.740
Do they just draw things or do they make and sell things?

45
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.510
Okay.
And are they for the value conscious shopper?

46
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.690
No.
Uh,

47
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.720
they are the inverse of Walmart.

48
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.320
Uh,
who,
who's higher on the price schedule than them?
Paulo,
anybody?

49
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.650
Hermes,
Hermes may be higher,

50
00:03:45.651 --> 00:03:48.260
but it's a luxury goods company.

51
00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:52.880
And Paolo who dresses well,
but so far as I can tell,

52
00:03:52.881 --> 00:03:56.580
doesn't care a bit about luxury goods.
Uh,

53
00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.400
is it's chairman.
Um,
tell us about,

54
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.830
just in a few minutes about what the object of your roll there is and how it

55
00:04:06.831 --> 00:04:10.040
relates to the CEO and the strategic challenges.
The company,

56
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.320
<v 2>you know,
my role is,
uh,</v>

57
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.230
the company don't take advantage.
It's about 23,

58
00:04:19.231 --> 00:04:23.790
24 years old.
He'd want to started by the two design yet,

59
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.830
and by the CEO,
he has grown at Airway,

60
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.360
have about a 20,
25% per year.

61
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.431
Well,
I'd,

62
00:04:35.431 --> 00:04:40.431
before the right before the credit crunch was a,

63
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.910
the multiples were about,
uh,

64
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.320
let's say 13 to 14 times a,
it'd be dot.

65
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.790
They can't find,
he was more or less was about,
uh,

66
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.800
$6 billion.

67
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.940
But the culture of the company has to remain like the small company.

68
00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:05.190
The two designers started it.

69
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.920
And so the reason why we developed a friendship out of a,

70
00:05:09.921 --> 00:05:14.550
I would have a chance,
they have an excellent,

71
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.430
uh,
CEO,
I believe it verbally in a counter.
You were,

72
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.670
uh,
ladies CEO's or rather than usual,
could I think she might be the only one,

73
00:05:24.671 --> 00:05:25.950
only a company of that size.

74
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.380
She's really for me to pull one of the best CEOs I have met.

75
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.060
And so we developed a friendship with our first thing with Edwin,

76
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.710
with the two designers afterwards.

77
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.770
And at one point they thought that the main challenge of the company wants to

78
00:05:43.261 --> 00:05:46.170
become more institutionalized.
Because if you look,

79
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.720
especially if you look at luxury goods companies,

80
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.790
few of them are institutionalized because for instance,

81
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.910
just to take a few Armani is not

82
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.000
five days.
No,
it would take up by an ice.
No.

83
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.940
Gucci visa institutionalized.

84
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.180
<v 0>Help us make sure we understand what's meant by institutionalized</v>

85
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.960
<v 2>additional lies.
I mean,
uh,
uh,</v>

86
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.110
companies where the,

87
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.860
let's say the corporate functions are very strong and companies where you have

88
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.030
culture and processes and personalities and uh,

89
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:38.470
recruitment policies and the leadership selection policies that are likely to

90
00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.810
make the company successful over the long period.

91
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.200
Regardless,
all the influence and the survival of the,

92
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.180
<v 0>so the firm,
it's strategies and the,
and the job structure,</v>

93
00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.240
the structure of employment responsibility becomes permanent enough to transcend

94
00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.940
the founding group.
Yes.

95
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:10.160
<v 2>Usually the best way,
usually the best way,
the best way,</v>

96
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.410
one of the effective way to do it.
So he would go back to Monday.

97
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:20.470
Why don't the effective way to do it east to turn it into a public liability and

98
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.520
have shareholders and the discipline and the function that the public market

99
00:07:27.471 --> 00:07:31.940
imposes on here.
That's the entrepreneurs kind of like to do it.

100
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.990
And so it's,
uh,
so it's,
it's uh,

101
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:41.360
to try to institutionalize the company in that way without turning to the public

102
00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:45.650
market,
which is something that the who own us,
they own,

103
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.480
they own.
90% of the camp are many,

104
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:54.140
10% is owned by a few other senior managers

105
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.880
with a French camp.
Uh,
and uh,

106
00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:02.900
and so since they don't want to access the public market making

107
00:08:02.901 --> 00:08:04.450
institutionalizing company,

108
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:10.300
so such strong personalities involved not only in designing the goods,

109
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:15.080
but in the everyday,
the everyday life of the company is not easy.

110
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:20.500
So they saw that I could then I could be helpful.
So far we've done very much,

111
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:24.470
but
anyways,
a lot of fun.

112
00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:25.760
I have to tell you it's a lot of them,

113
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.970
<v 0>uh,
another uh,</v>

114
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:34.080
industrial sector that you had a very substantial experience with his cars with

115
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:40.330
a Ford Fiat,
Volvo and General Motors.
But I got that right.

116
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.793
Did I miss something?

117
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:49.650
<v 2>She wants to talk about taxes as well as it did to the sector that cracks and</v>

118
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.920
you are taxing there with least you we used to have tracks in a fan.
Sorry.

119
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:03.650
<v 0>Um,
I actually thought it thought your experience with um,</v>

120
00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:08.980
helping to bring general motors and Fiat together and then helping them to

121
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:14.090
separate themselves,
uh,
was very interesting.

122
00:09:14.091 --> 00:09:19.091
And your views about the sort of informal compact that seemed at that time to

123
00:09:21.051 --> 00:09:26.051
regulate the Detroit car companies and which probably wasn't a great influence

124
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.870
on the survivability of General Motors.

125
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.750
That seemed like a very interesting topic.

126
00:09:35.751 --> 00:09:37.170
If you could give us a few minutes on it.

127
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.050
<v 2>See
One of the,</v>

128
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:49.700
one of the peculiarities of all that on the car industry worldwide,

129
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.980
definitely the car industry in Europe is that he's one of the few in Scully and

130
00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:01.300
it hasn't been played by or capacity or at least at least the last 30 years

131
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.600
and one of the few industries in wage.

132
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:17.460
These overcapacity have never been taken out of the system.

133
00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:23.820
But in with the players have at least until last year until the easy or survive

134
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:30.900
and eat.
This is a very peculiar situation because if you look at most,

135
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:35.360
if you look at most private industries in which there is,

136
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:40.400
there is a larger degree of private ownership and uh,

137
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:46.460
more or less the rules of capitalism apply to at least to a large extent,

138
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.720
you are really seldom have such a high degree over,

139
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:55.220
over capacity and the survival of all the place,

140
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.100
not only,
but I'm not up to date,

141
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.850
but let's say that after five years ago,

142
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.920
six years ago when I was used to be up to day capacity and being not taken off

143
00:11:07.951 --> 00:11:12.390
the system but added
there is we will,

144
00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:17.391
we will have to search long and hard to find a situation where it's a productive

145
00:11:18.661 --> 00:11:23.040
facilities have been shot down.
And on the contrary,

146
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:28.100
we find a lot of instances in which new productive facilities had been built,

147
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:36.220
but none has been shot down.
So actually you could argue,

148
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.580
we'll have to look at the numbers,

149
00:11:37.581 --> 00:11:42.581
but you could argue that actually over at the actually the overcapacity has gone

150
00:11:42.841 --> 00:11:47.220
worse.
And uh,
players,

151
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.760
the players and being high,
I mean they are not stupid people.

152
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:55.300
They are conscious of the fact that they operate in an industry we cheese or

153
00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:59.830
which was like we should,
I think steelies plagued by over capacity.

154
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.863
And so,

155
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:07.470
except for drastic reduction in the capacity,

156
00:12:08.551 --> 00:12:08.860
sir,

157
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:13.860
closing down factors they have been trying to address the situation and every

158
00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:16.540
possible way.
One of the ways,

159
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:20.740
one of the most of the traditional way that there'd be news as being,

160
00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:22.150
uh,

161
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:27.150
different types of a joint venture and or mergers and acquisition.

162
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:29.990
One of the fair,

163
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:34.990
one of the actions that was supposed to change the face of the,

164
00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:39.940
uh,
the face of the industry was the acquisition,
uh,

165
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:42.400
of Chrysler by dumb events.

166
00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:48.070
But I think that,
uh,
the think that,
uh,
the,

167
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:51.100
the absorption a demon work,

168
00:12:51.101 --> 00:12:55.270
well Diamler lost a lot of money and afterward Chrysler was sold to a private

169
00:12:55.271 --> 00:12:56.104
equity firm.

170
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:03.330
The only case that I know of or reasonably loud of a reasonably large car

171
00:13:03.641 --> 00:13:08.620
company being shutdown,
the old British Leyland,

172
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.450
uh,
that,
uh,

173
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:16.210
that was sold for private equity firm and laughter and the brand,

174
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.350
the brand,
there was a,
the brand was sold to a Chinese

175
00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.780
European brand.

176
00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:28.030
<v 0>Okay.
And without getting down the details,
well,</v>

177
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:29.600
broad details,

178
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:34.750
the compact that seem to operate between management and uh,

179
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.400
and labor and management of one company in management of another.

180
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:44.150
The government and government stole that album.

181
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:49.900
<v 2>It was a,
it's different in different nations,</v>

182
00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:52.220
but let's say that that's be Jenna,

183
00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.740
which is my main passion and working for them was that,
uh,
uh,

184
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.990
was,
uh,

185
00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:03.410
they were a little incentive in vigorously addressing the situation.

186
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:07.880
We,
uh,
uh,

187
00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:11.800
with the kind of action that you will be that we will be.

188
00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:17.820
And that was because,
uh,
you know,
because let's take,
it takes a,

189
00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:22.460
an adversary view on the relationship in the workplace.

190
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:27.760
Let's suppose in the management would have lied to close down one five.

191
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:34.190
The degree of the degree of unionization,
the degree or,

192
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:35.340
uh,

193
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:40.640
in the whole camp and they degree or relationship in counter is different than

194
00:14:40.941 --> 00:14:42.880
the United States between the Union and

195
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.620
the degree of influence of the,
with unions on government.

196
00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.110
And in addition,
they degree,

197
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:56.200
which the life of the company itself depends on the Gulf and that you have seen,

198
00:14:58.761 --> 00:14:59.060
uh,

199
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:04.060
you have seen an example in the last credit crunch in wage and the purchase of

200
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:09.500
all new cars is the fact of subsidized by the government.

201
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:13.420
They just knew when to say it,
but it's not,
it's not new in Europe.
It's a,

202
00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:16.370
as far as I'm concerned is that he's a sad wine that I've seen in Europe.

203
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.970
There's another class.
So you have these,

204
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:24.280
you have these very strange situation in which a management,

205
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:30.310
the union and the government become to some extent dependent on each other.

206
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:36.820
And the last thing they want to be set to offset website and these violence is

207
00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:42.290
out.
No,
no extra capacity is taken off the system.
Right?

208
00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.860
Sure.
Right.
No.
See what saying fracturing is being done.

209
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.980
So the how it is now,

210
00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:52.910
it is now probably it was the use of chapter.
Yeah.

211
00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.680
Huge.
Was a huge financial crisis.
And the use of chapter 11,

212
00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.730
uh,
which has allowed,
I'm telling your personal story.

213
00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:06.980
Are you worried for a fee as a manager for about 15 years?

214
00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:11.250
And I worked for Goldman for about 15 years and,
uh,

215
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:17.430
in some 14 and recently in some either is one deal that I've tried to do three

216
00:16:18.171 --> 00:16:20.750
times as being fia to acquisition of Paris.

217
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.950
And I finished.
Sweet.
Aren't you lucky?
No,
I think,

218
00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:28.791
I think it's the,

219
00:16:28.791 --> 00:16:32.330
I think it was one of the deals that makes more sense in the industry and these

220
00:16:32.331 --> 00:16:36.690
sign pf management were successful.
But why for success,

221
00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.390
what's successful?
Because

222
00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.510
Chrysler was not sold by the owner back he had,

223
00:16:43.511 --> 00:16:46.900
he given to them by the federal government main thing in exchange for an

224
00:16:46.901 --> 00:16:50.290
industrial postdoc and practically debt free.

225
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.780
So it's a,
and so as you can see,

226
00:16:56.781 --> 00:16:59.870
the industry changing for the game is changing because one of them,

227
00:16:59.871 --> 00:17:04.871
because because of chapter 11 and because of the size of these financial crises

228
00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:10.560
there,
the compact between the three play as broke,
as broken down,
totally.

229
00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.370
Well,
same still as general

230
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:17.350
<v 0>and the car industry preserving these legacy firms,</v>

231
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:19.000
uh,

232
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.980
runs against the tide of creative destruction that you expect in capitalist

233
00:17:23.981 --> 00:17:28.120
industry it.
And,
uh,
uh,

234
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:33.150
is that highlighted by the fact that if you go back to the beginning of the 20th

235
00:17:33.641 --> 00:17:34.474
century,

236
00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:39.610
there were 1200 firms making automobiles in the United States and there

237
00:17:39.611 --> 00:17:44.440
obviously had to be a meltdown there because it's an industry with huge scale

238
00:17:44.441 --> 00:17:47.020
economies that encourages centralization.

239
00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.730
<v 2>Tell me who is a Columbia in the,</v>

240
00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:53.860
in the United States or in France has uh,

241
00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:58.950
I slapped her or change or change the landscape in kind of making your,

242
00:18:00.271 --> 00:18:04.410
the last 20 years with the exception of some Europeans or our Japanese

243
00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:08.990
[inaudible] Saturday productive of the Japanese and the Koreans are enforcing

244
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.560
some,
some changes I think.
Yeah,

245
00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:15.120
let's uh,

246
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:20.120
I'm going to get off stage and let Paolo talk about an extremely complex and

247
00:18:25.261 --> 00:18:28.170
interesting cross border transaction,

248
00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:33.450
which centers on Spain but it involves several European countries at once.

249
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.110
Shell,
I would like to,
I'll get the PowerPoint up

250
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:50.100
and write tenant.
Well I wish I knew

251
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:55.990
laptop.
There we go.

252
00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:20.850
Let me try to look at one case.
We cheese.
Actually

253
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:27.780
let's take it,
let's take it one step backward.
And,
uh,
there,

254
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:33.200
the case I would like to discuss is the attempt by the new management or a large

255
00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:40.220
utility company ain't m which is the only electrical but not only electrical

256
00:19:43.321 --> 00:19:46.350
utility company in Italy to change.

257
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:52.010
They slapped her and the characteristic of the company hotel Lee and the attempt

258
00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:59.361
by the management over a period of six or seven years to turn a major utility

259
00:20:02.941 --> 00:20:07.941
company depending mostly on one single nation into a different company that,

260
00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:12.990
uh,

261
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:17.990
will diminish the risk by being present into several nations.

262
00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:20.400
But at the same time,

263
00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:26.090
that will totally change the characteristic of that camp.

264
00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:30.780
And He tried to explain if you take a utility,

265
00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:34.080
usually utility as very little risk

266
00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:37.680
because it leaves in a regulated sector,

267
00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:45.180
it makes,
uh,
it has an agreement with a regulator that they,

268
00:20:45.181 --> 00:20:47.650
you lead the utility.
We may,

269
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:52.830
we make certain level of capital investment

270
00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:59.730
and in exchange we'll be able to impose on the customer some tariffs.

271
00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:07.270
So if you,
if you can,

272
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:12.340
if you can imagine a utility would be very,

273
00:21:12.341 --> 00:21:15.610
very safe investment for the small investors.

274
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:21.430
It will be similar to a bond
that you have to do.

275
00:21:21.431 --> 00:21:25.130
Capital investment,
capital investment,
every word,
our words.

276
00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:30.490
So [inaudible] system and if you invest in the companies like investing in a

277
00:21:30.491 --> 00:21:31.324
bond.

278
00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:36.540
So if you look at utility utilities have small capital appreciation and pay high

279
00:21:37.451 --> 00:21:38.284
dividends,

280
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:43.540
the new management Raynell when angel was sort of privatized,

281
00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:48.670
decided that they were trying to change that completely and tried to make the

282
00:21:48.671 --> 00:21:53.671
boring utility into a company that was knowing who offer more girls,

283
00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:57.220
more risk,

284
00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:02.350
less deep and more capital appreciation.

285
00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:09.540
When you try to do that too with the giant at the time in to decide what to do

286
00:22:10.481 --> 00:22:11.610
it,
I think the danger there was,

287
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:16.630
was about 40 billion to $60 billion at today's exchange rate.

288
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:22.670
It's,
it's a major task.
And uh,

289
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.180
the way the management,
uh,

290
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:30.300
decided to do it was changing the powder mix and getting into renewable energy,

291
00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:41.460
but also in trying to start the policy or aggressive diversification moving into

292
00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:47.643
other countries.

293
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:53.430
So first they need to into eastern Europe to some extent and Russia,

294
00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:59.730
but one once.
One thing that you learn,
uh,

295
00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:00.940
when,
uh,

296
00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:06.180
when you take the helm of a $60 billion corporation is that if you try to change

297
00:23:08.831 --> 00:23:13.831
the characteristic of the company by a set or small size acquisition,

298
00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.970
you are an out of time.
Because if you are,

299
00:23:21.971 --> 00:23:24.850
if our fashion or if you have a professional management team

300
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.230
executing as execute,

301
00:23:29.231 --> 00:23:34.231
making an executing a small deal takes as much time and effort and as executing

302
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:36.040
a huge one.

303
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
And so the what is different is the amount of breast and so the management of a

304
00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:48.180
Avenel start looking around at a one single move that would have changed the

305
00:23:52.191 --> 00:23:56.900
company completely.
One of the air,

306
00:23:56.901 --> 00:24:00.830
one of the areas in the nations where they looked at was pain.

307
00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.060
Why it was pain first.

308
00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:11.320
Spain has a first wave as generally as a first public elite.

309
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:19.520
It's usually,
I would say it's a,

310
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:23.900
it's a country where there are regulatory system,

311
00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.310
especially for utilities.
It's very good.

312
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:33.060
It's very stable,
it's well regulated.

313
00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:38.620
There is a centuries old slasher or uh,

314
00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:44.870
of tariff regulation,
intelligent behavior that is very good.

315
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:50.030
And these is created as you can see in the counter that is reasonable,

316
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:51.380
reasonably small,

317
00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:57.160
the presence of at least five or six utilities that are of a decent size.

318
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:04.580
And so there was,

319
00:25:04.581 --> 00:25:09.581
there is room for consolidation in a market that is very attractive from the

320
00:25:12.381 --> 00:25:13.910
economic point of view.

321
00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:20.050
So obviously the Spain was one of the first nations where the angel management

322
00:25:23.091 --> 00:25:27.800
looker.
Moreover,
as you can see,

323
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.740
it's through that at our cs six layers.

324
00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.860
But when you go to electricity,

325
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:40.400
you only have two players that are very important and days,
uh,
and he got robbed.

326
00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:46.660
So email the management of anal,

327
00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:52.720
a very close attention to the development in the Spanish market into

328
00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.630
opportunities opening clapped in the Spanish mark.

329
00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:05.670
What happened at one point was that uh,

330
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:10.670
I don't know how familiar you are with Spanish as a political economic system.

331
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.400
So let me step back one second,

332
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.720
a VUS and give you a few and you can ask question.

333
00:26:20.721 --> 00:26:21.111
By the way,

334
00:26:21.111 --> 00:26:24.410
you can interrupt me and ask question anytime you want because if not it gets

335
00:26:24.411 --> 00:26:29.150
very boring for you and very confusing possibly.
So

336
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:32.023
Spanish,

337
00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:37.250
the Spanish political economic system from the political point of view is it's a

338
00:26:39.321 --> 00:26:41.030
very stable democracy

339
00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:48.160
are you tend to have full liars parties that uh,

340
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.200
usually occupied the government for some,
for a reasonable amount,

341
00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:59.170
for a reasonable amount of time and a change orderly.

342
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:03.510
And these,
the division between the two parties,

343
00:27:03.511 --> 00:27:08.511
one is the conservative party is linked with to some extent linked with the old,

344
00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:16.200
the old Catholic heritage of stone and the Aza.

345
00:27:16.201 --> 00:27:20.700
He's a democratic socialist party,

346
00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:24.420
more or less linked with a socialist heritage of Spain,

347
00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.610
which is also significant.
I don't know how many of you,

348
00:27:27.611 --> 00:27:32.010
but I suppose most of you are familiar with the Spanish civil war of 1935,

349
00:27:32.011 --> 00:27:36.900
1937
and at the same time,

350
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.830
these two parties,
uh,

351
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:43.940
leave in a culture where a regional differences in regional cleavages are very

352
00:27:47.791 --> 00:27:51.630
important.
These are the main characteristic of his pain.

353
00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:56.160
Political political system will come to the economic system in a while.

354
00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:01.700
So two large groups strongly identified with the two main tradition in the

355
00:28:02.161 --> 00:28:05.390
country.
One is socialist and the other's Cassidy.

356
00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.270
And having a,

357
00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:14.690
also living in a situation in which you have a high degree of differentiation

358
00:28:16.291 --> 00:28:21.240
between different regions.
Everybody knows about the Basque areas,

359
00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:25.050
but at the same time you're also to consider the Catalonia,

360
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.440
the era where Barcelona is a beam,

361
00:28:28.441 --> 00:28:32.910
striving for autonomy if not in defendant's for a very long time.

362
00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.410
These are the characteristics of the political economic system as far as a model

363
00:28:37.411 --> 00:28:40.640
of development that Spain is the Kate spade has fallen,

364
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:46.220
especially in the last 2025 years is a model of development that is largely bias

365
00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:51.510
toward,
uh,
construction and real estate development.

366
00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:56.670
And so,
uh,
in very entrepreneurial,

367
00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:00.030
so you have,
you ever had,

368
00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:04.350
especially in the late nineties and in early 2000,

369
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:09.000
the creation of a lot of very entrepreneurial,

370
00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:14.730
very aggressive,
very wealthy companies.

371
00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:16.750
They that,
uh,

372
00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:20.820
which line of business where mostly construction and real estate,

373
00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.720
the entrepreneurs in these companies,
you have,
you say,

374
00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:29.520
what does it have to do with the utilities and what does it to do with the

375
00:29:29.521 --> 00:29:31.290
opportunities often to email,

376
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.960
to enter into the Spanish word that has to do that.

377
00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:37.320
As you can see,

378
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:43.190
one of the diversification policies used by these entrepreneurial companies that

379
00:29:45.911 --> 00:29:50.911
have made most of the money on real estate and construction was to by states

380
00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:56.740
into large utility companies.
Why

381
00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.430
it's a good diversification policies.

382
00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:06.910
It pays stable dividends and we saw at the beginning and plus you enter into an

383
00:30:09.221 --> 00:30:11.590
industrial sector that is fractionalized.

384
00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:17.050
And so assuming that there is consolidation and Monzo seven players,

385
00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:20.290
you are likely to be paid a premium for the shares that you have.

386
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:24.550
So what I tried to do that is very complex and so you have to,

387
00:30:24.551 --> 00:30:29.320
excuse me and you have to ask question is that they just different on it is

388
00:30:29.321 --> 00:30:33.030
different from the utility sector in any country that I,

389
00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:38.100
that I know you have large or you have large construction companies as minority

390
00:30:43.391 --> 00:30:48.391
but significant shoulders in many of the utilities company in Spain and they are

391
00:30:50.711 --> 00:30:51.550
there for tourism.

392
00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:57.940
Diversification over is because you are in a very stable,

393
00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:00.370
in a very stable business,

394
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:04.030
totally different from a construction and real estate.

395
00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:08.380
You'll get high division for the state that you are bought and so you get a good

396
00:31:08.381 --> 00:31:10.120
deal,
a good heel on your capital.

397
00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:15.850
So there is more like there's likely to be consolidation and so you are likely

398
00:31:15.851 --> 00:31:19.810
to be paid a premium for the share that we purchase.
So a very nice,

399
00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:24.040
very nice position to be in.
But look at this for a second.

400
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:30.070
A every company in which there is for the same reason that I tried to tell you

401
00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:36.240
every utility company where there is one of these construction companies,

402
00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:41.910
a show that does not have a very solid shareholder base because one of the main

403
00:31:43.601 --> 00:31:47.170
shoulders is there not,

404
00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:52.060
not because of a commitment to that particular industry or anything,

405
00:31:52.061 --> 00:31:54.460
but Jasper have been healed while it lasts.

406
00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:59.170
And for selling the shares at a premium when there is consolidation.

407
00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:03.280
So if you look from the point of view of someone who wants to enter the market,

408
00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:09.480
you have very attractive market because the regulatory regulatory regime is very

409
00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:14.761
good and you have a situation of not totally stable shareholder base in each of

410
00:32:18.041 --> 00:32:18.874
these companies.

411
00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:26.890
So
as everybody expected

412
00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:33.140
at the end of 2005,
the fact that uh,

413
00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:34.120
uh,

414
00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:39.120
the fact that the structure of the industry had two main players started

415
00:32:39.621 --> 00:32:44.621
changing and one of the company gas metro beside me launched and no style bead

416
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:53.110
on in Davidson County on Tuesdays counting on the fact that,

417
00:32:54.771 --> 00:32:55.604
uh,

418
00:32:55.950 --> 00:33:00.260
in in days or the [inaudible] being seller for the same reason that I gave you

419
00:33:00.261 --> 00:33:01.094
before.

420
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:06.520
And on the fact that they were a senior juice and the economies of scale and

421
00:33:07.371 --> 00:33:12.371
scope that could have been achieved or implemented by putting together gas

422
00:33:13.851 --> 00:33:18.330
natural out in the in days,
the launch your style bead,

423
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:24.080
but something that they didn't count on happening immediately,

424
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:28.800
which is that the reaction to that bid

425
00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:35.530
was not very friendly by two entities.

426
00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.020
The regulators,
as you can see,

427
00:33:39.021 --> 00:33:43.310
the CME and the Spanish government.

428
00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:48.970
Why was not the Spanish government,
uh,

429
00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:54.040
reaction favorable in first you have,

430
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:58.490
you'll have a deal that makes perfect sense from the economic and financial

431
00:33:58.491 --> 00:33:59.324
point of view,

432
00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:05.030
the shoulders of days are happy because they get paid a decent premium on the

433
00:34:05.031 --> 00:34:08.390
stock.
The company remained.
Spanish

434
00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:12.140
synergies are going to be extracted.

435
00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:16.880
There is not a lot of overlapping and so there are not going to be a lot of

436
00:34:16.881 --> 00:34:17.714
layoffs.

437
00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:22.070
The MCU in your company will be very strong.

438
00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:25.850
We're definitely in a national champion,
probably European champion.

439
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:27.980
So why doesn't gum and like it?

440
00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:34.900
It happens to be that
and days a,

441
00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.850
my Madrid based

442
00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:43.100
in Gas Natura is based in Barcelona.

443
00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:50.420
It also happens to be that at the same time there is a big fight in the

444
00:34:50.421 --> 00:34:54.500
political arena between the government party

445
00:34:56.330 --> 00:35:00.380
socialist
and the opposition party,

446
00:35:00.381 --> 00:35:05.381
the conservative and one of the issues that they are fighting on is

447
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:12.100
decentralization of power within different regions and it also happens that why

448
00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:21.560
are a large part of the power base of the Socialist Party is in Madrid.

449
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:27.310
A reasonably large base of the power of the Conservative Party is in Barcelona.

450
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:32.510
So oddly enough or naturally enough,

451
00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.570
they are owning their oding.

452
00:35:35.571 --> 00:35:40.571
Socialist Party sees the attempt by a pay gas company from Barcelona to try to

453
00:35:45.661 --> 00:35:50.010
buy the biggest or one of the second biggest,
it depends,

454
00:35:50.011 --> 00:35:55.011
I would count utility company based in Madrid as almost a political move instead

455
00:35:58.981 --> 00:36:03.450
of an industrial and they just don't like it.
And so they tried to stop it.

456
00:36:03.451 --> 00:36:07.950
As you can see from the statement,
they tried to stop it.
So making it difficult,

457
00:36:07.951 --> 00:36:12.951
so the regulatory agency and just tried to fight it with all the weapons of

458
00:36:13.221 --> 00:36:14.054
data.

459
00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:22.090
Email the Italian utility company as not being the only one,

460
00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:24.760
looking at the Spanish market.

461
00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:30.310
If the Spanish market is that attractive as I tried to describe it to you,

462
00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:33.980
that means I,
that means to someone else.

463
00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:38.530
A few other people have been looking for opportunities to enter the Spanish

464
00:36:38.531 --> 00:36:43.531
market and get hold of one of those Kaisers and one,

465
00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:48.610
one of the companies that you're looking for that he's a German,

466
00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.430
the German giant called Aeon.

467
00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:57.640
Johann is exceedingly sophisticated company exceeding,
they are sophisticated.

468
00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:00.820
They have been a leading utility for so many years.

469
00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:06.570
They know all the complexities of operating in a regulated sector where he

470
00:37:09.131 --> 00:37:13.090
depended on the investment you make in the towers.
So they are,

471
00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:17.800
they are very sophisticated and understanding the political environment in which

472
00:37:17.801 --> 00:37:22.801
you operate and which heavily influences your outcome and your choices.

473
00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.140
So they see an opening,
they say,
wait a second,

474
00:37:26.141 --> 00:37:29.260
the government doesn't like the government,
doesn't like the gas,

475
00:37:29.261 --> 00:37:33.100
natural gas,
not true.
It doesn't have a lot of cash.

476
00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:37.240
So it will be difficult for them to arrays.

477
00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:41.080
It will be difficult for them to raise the bid.
At the same time,

478
00:37:41.081 --> 00:37:45.850
they don't seem to have,
they don't seem to have a political support.

479
00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:51.600
So maybe here there is a space for a foreign bidder that we table for the

480
00:37:55.481 --> 00:38:00.250
shareholders it bead that is higher than the bead of gas,
natural alpha and days.

481
00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.900
Gutsy move.
Because if you look at our style bead,

482
00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:10.090
cross border in Europe in a regulated sector,

483
00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:11.920
I say this was the first one,

484
00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:19.530
very gutsy move,
very well structured,
very well done,

485
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:24.870
very well timed.
So you almost,

486
00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:28.320
and as you'll notice,

487
00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:32.270
the BV significantly higher than the previous one 27.

488
00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:33.770
We see the 21 year olds

489
00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:38.003
<v 1>and</v>

490
00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:41.180
<v 2>in a very,
in a very sophisticated way,
which is,</v>

491
00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:45.560
which is worse than the company that you own is uh,

492
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:49.820
they also start,

493
00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:53.720
is sophisticated labile with the European Commission

494
00:38:55.910 --> 00:39:00.910
because they believe that the main threat is not another leader.

495
00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:04.540
The main site is the Spanish government doesn't want,
I'm Joe,

496
00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:09.330
it doesn't belong to a German UTP own deleting,
championing.
By the way,

497
00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:13.420
there's no reason why if they didn't like if they didn't like the Barcelona who

498
00:39:13.421 --> 00:39:14.840
all need lighter,
the uh,

499
00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:19.270
why should they like I remember when you experience cause based in there or

500
00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:23.680
somewhere.
But I don't remember.
I think is Nia,
Nia,
Frankfurt.

501
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:28.100
I think he's near Frankfurt,
but awesome.
That's it goes,
you're right.

502
00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:35.290
So you want to start lobbying the European Commission and hopes to have an

503
00:39:35.421 --> 00:39:37.930
opening by the German regulators.

504
00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:44.030
They don't been in Greeley.
No big opposition comes,
but in our opinion,

505
00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:47.480
a really dazzle con and and the Spanish government,

506
00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:51.660
uh,
in their twenties,
Gavin lint spalls

507
00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:58.500
our IP soul II or Billy Luke said the ownership so active in days,

508
00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:03.650
it seems that it had a lot of sellers.
So it says,
okay,

509
00:40:03.651 --> 00:40:07.810
these are going to be a financial side.
It,
he just upped the ante.

510
00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:13.040
I raised,
my bid was 34,
34 euros per share.

511
00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:19.550
Significant significantly I,
yeah.
Then the offer by gas network

512
00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:25.340
and they think that they have,
and they seem to,
they have a winning hand,

513
00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:28.710
you know,
the show.
They have all the resources.
I think that that,

514
00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:33.860
I seem to remember that that time he on has cash on the balance sheet for about

515
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:39.230
a hundred billion of these peanuts crosswalk 40,
32.

516
00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:43.663
<v 1>Again,</v>

517
00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:47.080
<v 2>they don't,
they don't go anywhere and they get stolen</v>

518
00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:54.670
at that point.
Emails,

519
00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:58.130
it has been watching to see the way she sees an opportunity

520
00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:01.760
and he's a beaten by gas math where uh,

521
00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:07.540
and that that doesn't seem to go anywhere he calls or political position.

522
00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.420
And because it's cheap

523
00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:18.300
now he's a bead by the leading European champion or utility,

524
00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:20.540
but he's a lot richer in,

525
00:41:20.541 --> 00:41:25.541
can become a lot richer but doesn't go anywhere code.

526
00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:30.800
The Spanish government is a lactide who salad or to have wine are one of the

527
00:41:33.711 --> 00:41:35.050
utilities,
one of the,

528
00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:39.950
one of the national champions and up in German hands.

529
00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:45.640
So Emile sees an opening and a strategy based on three variables.

530
00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:50.473
One,

531
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:55.630
they say maybe we can pay as much as you know,

532
00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:02.170
we don't have the same cash on the balance sheet but we've not done so we can,

533
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:07.490
we can try to fight it on that.

534
00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:14.270
Second is we might be more acceptable.

535
00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.400
Who's the Spanish government?

536
00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.700
And that's true.
That's needs to be found out and discern news.

537
00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:25.880
And these is really,
in my opinion,

538
00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:30.660
the winning these really the winning exceptional [inaudible].
They say,

539
00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:35.720
why should we buy off those construction companies or the biggest construction

540
00:42:37.261 --> 00:42:38.610
company that are,

541
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:44.030
that are using the capital that can be our ally,

542
00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:47.250
you know,
locking the situation.

543
00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:51.600
So why would we try to buy them out?

544
00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:57.170
Why don't we simply go and talk to the interpreter?
This,

545
00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:00.750
this construction company is usually one entrepreneur for each camp.

546
00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:04.080
Why don't we go and talk to the interpreter and see what do you want?

547
00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:09.030
One calf will give it,
do you want a piece of the company?

548
00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:12.240
We would make a deal with you
what we want.

549
00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:18.570
So oddly,
not often,
naturally.
Now the interpreter says,
no,
no,
no.

550
00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.740
The reason why I'm here is because I want to diversify my risk.

551
00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:28.650
I want a significant opportunities to girls to grow.

552
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:31.890
And so what I really want is not cash,
but he's a piece of in days.

553
00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:39.510
And so in l says,
okay,
uh,

554
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:42.880
let's discuss
a

555
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:46.890
rational enough,
the interpreneur,

556
00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:49.840
which is actual owner stores.

557
00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:56.790
So ANUMs tried to force is in and that's something very unusual in a very,

558
00:43:58.201 --> 00:44:02.760
very unusual in a cross border take over.
That company goes into the market

559
00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:08.280
and buys and that on Mondays I in the mark,

560
00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:09.990
which according to Spanish,

561
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:14.130
which according to spending this regulation we can do and they anal is not

562
00:44:14.131 --> 00:44:17.430
launch a Bdm,
Huh.
It's someone coming out of the left field.

563
00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.950
So the going to the market and they buy 10%

564
00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:24.270
at 39 years per share,

565
00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:29.360
higher than higher than the beat or the beat by young.

566
00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:35.790
At that point they sit around the table with the entrepreneur and say see,

567
00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:37.770
we are very serious.

568
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:43.870
So we are either going either we are going to buy this company of or Ian is

569
00:44:44.071 --> 00:44:49.071
going to buy or we make a d in the together.

570
00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:54.630
We buy.
So long negotiation,

571
00:44:55.740 --> 00:45:00.450
long negotiations,
start with the,
with the interpreter and at the end,

572
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:06.530
uh,
indeed in this negotiation,
anal again the intrepreneur stores,

573
00:45:06.531 --> 00:45:11.531
the gang are tied to get more so anal again decide to be aggressive and that was

574
00:45:12.061 --> 00:45:13.760
an equity swap for four.

575
00:45:13.761 --> 00:45:18.761
No remain for remaining 14% or 1490 9% of the capital,

576
00:45:18.991 --> 00:45:23.991
which is the maximum permitted under Spanish regulation and it tells the

577
00:45:24.091 --> 00:45:26.910
entrepreneurs,
I see we are here to stay.

578
00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:31.290
We now own 25% of the company.
You won't get,
we own more than you do.

579
00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:35.910
You will not get worried about at the same time they show you on and they own

580
00:45:35.911 --> 00:45:40.050
25% and so that they are possibly in the position to block

581
00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:44.250
the takeoff.
So this is the back.

582
00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:47.820
This is a battle being fought or two from one.

583
00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:52.950
The only opportunity when in Al rightly decides is to make a deal with

584
00:45:53.371 --> 00:45:56.520
interpreter too.
At the same time,

585
00:45:56.521 --> 00:46:00.030
they have to fight the offer by Aeon,

586
00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:03.770
which as you can,
as you can see,
increases

587
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:09.330
his offer who forties 40 years for sure.

588
00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:16.300
At the same time,
email has been negotiating with interpreter.

589
00:46:17.350 --> 00:46:22.350
Angel has been negotiating with an entrepreneur and they signed a deal in which

590
00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:25.560
25% is going to be owned directly by anal,

591
00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:32.210
but 51% of the shares are going to be owned by a joint venture company made by

592
00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:39.330
[inaudible].
And the entrepreneur who is a Shona where the intrepreneurs 51%

593
00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:46.160
and the entrepreneur who is scared about being trapped into a situation there is

594
00:46:46.861 --> 00:46:47.694
not liquid.

595
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:53.150
Also ask also negotiate with Angela or I to put to put to anal his own shares

596
00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:57.740
for his own shares in uh,
in,

597
00:46:57.741 --> 00:47:01.940
in data for the same price that uh,
uh,

598
00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:07.160
it has been negotiating the 41 14 one years pressure as you have seen.

599
00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:08.730
Uh,
sorry,

600
00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:13.500
I moved to as you seeing a final,

601
00:47:13.501 --> 00:47:16.770
the final battle is long by is worn by amen.

602
00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:21.030
He made a deal with the on on the other side and when to your honor is going to

603
00:47:21.031 --> 00:47:24.550
be sold about $10 billion last of the 10 billion euros of acid.

604
00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:28.440
And so he also gets a foothold in the Spanish market,

605
00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:33.810
bought 10 days or stays more or less what it is and the situation is Aina.

606
00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:39.190
See on that we actually all know has a right of poops.

607
00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:42.820
Bueno for the shares that they own it.

608
00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:48.930
Am I going too fast?
No,
you're doing fine,
right?

609
00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:51.330
You've only got about three or four minutes left.

610
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:53.410
I the last day of the rest is just the endos.

611
00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:54.443
<v 1>No.</v>

612
00:47:56.710 --> 00:48:01.710
<v 2>So the situation is that they end days that he on Poles and then days,</v>

613
00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:08.510
uh,
is now owned by email and actually honor.

614
00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:13.660
Now in the meantime,
what happens in the,

615
00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:18.490
what happens in the world,
the world happens that uh,
there is a credit crunch,

616
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:24.160
which in the case of Spain overlaps.

617
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:30.030
We've a very severe downturn in construction and real estate.

618
00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:35.893
<v 1>You have,</v>

619
00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:41.680
<v 2>we need to differentiate here between defined between different characters.</v>

620
00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:47.550
You have to seem that their reliance on debt and Rli on some construction and

621
00:48:49.661 --> 00:48:54.661
real estate in the case of Spain was so high that

622
00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:01.940
why are in your house you have an unemployment rate is below 10% and in the

623
00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:09.850
state one that he's tend to assign in Spain you have an unemployment rate,

624
00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:14.280
which is 24%
white county.

625
00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:21.600
So they hold Modelo development of the Spanish economy is in doubt or he's in

626
00:49:25.241 --> 00:49:30.241
crisis because of the severe crisis in construction and real estate is easy.

627
00:49:31.241 --> 00:49:33.130
You have to add that.

628
00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:38.000
Most of the companies that I've been operating there,
including a show at Shauna,

629
00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:41.850
the [inaudible],
hey been buying shares.

630
00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:44.630
We use the loans by the Spanish banks.

631
00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:49.990
So not only you have the collapse in the prices of the real estate asset,

632
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:56.190
you will have also the travel in the refinancing the loan that,

633
00:49:56.210 --> 00:50:00.770
that'd be mine either that's being borrowed by the,

634
00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:04.990
uh,
my department,
my day of construction companies.
So for instance,

635
00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:09.540
a narrative arc now stop trying to legal financial traffic.

636
00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:14.980
It starts early legal,
financial troubles that are so big.

637
00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:20.110
I probably only security,
like he came there,

638
00:50:20.111 --> 00:50:25.111
he can give the bags or renewing the level that they have extended to is the

639
00:50:27.651 --> 00:50:32.651
fruits of the 25% or 10 days or that he owns or

640
00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:36.650
25 point something to Aina

641
00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:43.480
and that could by the way is at a price that is the price of the bid,

642
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:49.220
which was 41 at the same time.

643
00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:53.150
The price of that at the same time the price of the shares in the market have

644
00:50:53.151 --> 00:50:57.500
gone down to 24 25 I don't know,
between 2025 across mainland.

645
00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:00.370
So Emile seize the opportunity,

646
00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:04.360
glad to get control of all of the injuries are shares,

647
00:51:05.330 --> 00:51:10.330
approaches the interpreneur and says okay you have that ride put for 2011 why

648
00:51:12.081 --> 00:51:16.540
don't we negotiate a situation in which we will pay you less than for the one

649
00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:17.453
for sure

650
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:24.030
you will get some assets and we will get the 25% we were getting,

651
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:28.180
we were getting a 25% of the shelves,
so there is a,

652
00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:29.780
there is an extensive negotiation

653
00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:36.460
and anal and stop by the 25% of at Shauna dissolving the joint venture and

654
00:51:40.581 --> 00:51:42.880
getting control of 92% days.

655
00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:49.570
However you can see what this does playing the bead was largely based on that

656
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:54.080
the purchaser,

657
00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:58.910
we accelerated purchase of the shares as increased the debt.

658
00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.260
So now anal time itself selfless

659
00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:09.100
when he in $23 billion market cap equity market cap from $65 billion.

660
00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:16.600
So the change in the change that the management one team has occurred,

661
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:22.910
but what happened is that because of the way it has been managed and because of

662
00:52:22.911 --> 00:52:27.320
the circumstances,
there is a huge load of that.

663
00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:32.150
On the company and it is still that they wanted to have a more risky company

664
00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:35.120
with higher,
with the higher potential girls.

665
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:38.790
But the investors are not very happy about having about having invested in

666
00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:39.350
company,

667
00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:44.350
which the equity that way could be a ratio is three to one or 3.2 to one.

668
00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:47.520
So any other things that uh,
uh,

669
00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:52.550
capital in order to Nema dividend or reduction and the capital increase,

670
00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:58.580
what is the problem?
The problem is nothing that probably there is,

671
00:52:58.581 --> 00:52:59.990
there is enough room,
we advise them.

672
00:52:59.991 --> 00:53:04.340
There isn't often there's an appetite in the market to do a capital in
victories,

673
00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:10.240
but the problem is that the Italian government directly through the Trevor,

674
00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:14.060
he's pumps 32% Reyna.

675
00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:16.160
And as you know,

676
00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:21.820
these are not your European and American government these days are saddled with

677
00:53:23.031 --> 00:53:25.400
a large amount of that they will have to repay.

678
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:28.290
So at the level of the Italian government,

679
00:53:28.291 --> 00:53:31.830
there is very little appetite for subscribing the rights issue.

680
00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:34.021
The other hand,

681
00:53:34.021 --> 00:53:39.021
there is very little appetite for beans IUT and made a nail into a totally

682
00:53:40.801 --> 00:53:44.790
public company because when you own more than 70% according to Italian,

683
00:53:44.791 --> 00:53:48.390
a lot more or less dominate 100% of the board of 90% of the book.

684
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:54.330
So they used the final,
the final effort by the management.
He's a,

685
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:58.350
he's a negotiation this time,
not with the Spanish government,

686
00:53:58.380 --> 00:53:59.640
but we did tell you in government,

687
00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:04.560
in order to try to convince the government to let the capital please go forward

688
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:08.420
and either be di you do with those subscribers.
And uh,

689
00:54:08.570 --> 00:54:10.320
and this is not going to send it to the class,

690
00:54:10.321 --> 00:54:15.321
but the government eventually gave up and found a way in which they could

691
00:54:16.411 --> 00:54:21.150
subscribe to the capital increase without increasing the government deficits

692
00:54:21.151 --> 00:54:24.260
other country.
Thanks Paolo.
We look forward to having.
