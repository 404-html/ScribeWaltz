WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.333
Okay.

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.180
So here to fore in this course we have treated government as one of two things,

3
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.530
either as in Desoto,
his frame of reference,

4
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:20.350
a guarantor property rights,
uh,

5
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.520
or as just background background material as with Smith,

6
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.390
where the grab oven of wealth of nations and the invisible hand story is to

7
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:38.880
encourage governments to allow free markets and free trade.

8
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.320
But there's not much talk about governments and how they behave.

9
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.070
And today I wanted to correct that deficiency of level by talking about

10
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:54.600
government and in particular about the government in the United States.
Uh,

11
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.500
and then turning to the Vioxx,

12
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.700
the Merck Vioxx case,
uh,

13
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.770
and looking at a little bit of video of Mark Lanier who is the main trial lawyer

14
00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:13.060
litigant,
uh,
nationally in uh,

15
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.720
the MERC matter.
Now,

16
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.020
uh,
United States is a very unusual political system.

17
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.490
It is a so called presidential system,

18
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.700
often copied.
There are probably,
I haven't counted them.

19
00:01:33.701 --> 00:01:34.840
There are probably 20,

20
00:01:34.841 --> 00:01:39.841
perhaps 25 countries with regimes that look on the surface,

21
00:01:41.231 --> 00:01:42.400
like the American one.

22
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.900
And they have in common that almost every one of them has failed.

23
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.650
Almost every one of them.
He is wildly unstable.

24
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.790
And the organic growth of the very complex American constitutional order is,

25
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.800
uh,
is essentially unique.

26
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.200
And it begins with a,

27
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.900
what I think of as the genius of the founding fathers.

28
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.340
They expressed particularly in federalist 10,

29
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.390
federalist 51 where the object is to create a complex system and a system which

30
00:02:24.011 --> 00:02:29.011
makes it hard for people to put together winning coalitions in favor of new

31
00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:30.664
policies,

32
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.080
which gives enormous advantage to those defending existing policies and which by

33
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.700
the scale and complexity of so largest system.

34
00:02:42.701 --> 00:02:47.701
And they thought when they began of the 13 colonies as a huge republic and,

35
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.640
and it was a huge republic.
And what came after is,

36
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.070
is the largest complex republic.
Uh,

37
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.440
the world has known and probably,
uh,

38
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.610
it is as large as is feasible,
uh,

39
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.530
with a Republican form of government.

40
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.950
The combination of federalism.

41
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:16.951
So there are two major layers of government and the expected diversity of so

42
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.490
larger,

43
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.140
larger country make it hard to form majority coalitions.

44
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.520
And even when you formed majority coalitions,

45
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.120
the system of checks and balances in the constitution augmented by the leader,

46
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:39.190
he merchants of the committee system in the House and Senate at the federal

47
00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:41.200
level,
uh,

48
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.510
make putting together a winning majority,
very difficult.

49
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.750
Arguably the last presidential and congressional elections created a winning

50
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:58.420
coalition for some form of health care reform.

51
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.710
The one would have to admit that listening to the election there,

52
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.590
it wasn't much specificity about what that might be.

53
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.820
And if you watch what's happened since the powerful resistance to change,

54
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.340
which is built into the system,
has manifested itself.

55
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.940
Now from the point of view of capitalism,

56
00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:24.640
it is generally suppose that this is a plus.

57
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.900
That the stability of economic policy and the endurance of,

58
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.410
of laws relating to property patents,
uh,

59
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.320
uh,
commerce,

60
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.650
that the relative stability of all that owes something to the fact that no mere

61
00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:52.360
shortlived majority can transform the American political system and its
policies.

62
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.550
And I think that's broadly true.

63
00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.930
The only contingency in which one would fear for the American republic.

64
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.020
And there are people,
uh,
New York Times column is Frank Rich,

65
00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:10.870
for example.
Uh,
uh,

66
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.970
New York Times columnist David Brooks for another example.
Uh,

67
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.050
who fear that we've come to that to that difficult position.

68
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.200
And that position is this.

69
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.430
If the existing status quo is unsustainable,

70
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.340
as one might have thought the status quo on the regulation of banking and

71
00:05:33.341 --> 00:05:37.030
mortgages was a six months or a year ago.

72
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.420
And as some argue the healthcare system is now,

73
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.410
then all the checks and balances which make change difficult may make,

74
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.040
may make it impossible to escape from that very difficult status quo.

75
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.080
Now,
I am a,
uh,

76
00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.530
personally an optimist about the ingenuity and resilience of American,

77
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.710
the American political and economic order.

78
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.170
But it's important right now to begin what we're doing today.

79
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.150
Understanding that changing public policy is,

80
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.860
uh,
a heroic undertaking.
The change of public policy,

81
00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:26.861
which will be in the background in the Vioxx case is tort reform and a part and

82
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.230
which,
uh,
plays a huge role in the Vioxx case.

83
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.620
Tort Law does a,

84
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.630
and is in the background as a major factor in the health care reform story

85
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.600
because the risk to medical practitioners from surgeons to nurses,

86
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:51.350
uh,

87
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:56.350
that is presented by tort law is very great and we'll try to cover some of that.

88
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.620
Uh,
using Vioxx as our case.

89
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.870
When Vioxx was in the testing stage,

90
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.850
I went to my internist and tried to talk him into getting me into the trial

91
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.700
because I was still playing tennis then.

92
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.740
And violence allowed me to box blacks seemed like a miracle drug.

93
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.550
And,
uh,
the merit of it,

94
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:24.551
a Cox two inhibitor was that it seemed to reduce inflammation in your joints and

95
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:31.730
therefore reduce pain without creating inflammation,

96
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:33.560
any erosion in the intestine,

97
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.300
a aspirin and other similar drugs,
uh,

98
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.730
uh,
reduce inflammation in the joints,
but as a byproduct,

99
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:49.100
a tear at the,
at the intestine.
And,
uh,

100
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.440
he was wise enough to say,
you know,
not every,

101
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.940
not every innovation is what it appears to be.

102
00:07:55.941 --> 00:08:00.830
And I would urge you not to be in the trials and being a compliant fellow.

103
00:08:00.831 --> 00:08:04.990
I took his advice and I in retrospect,
I guess I'm glad

104
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.200
the American system,

105
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.440
and this is not part of the original design has built up and the enormous

106
00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:20.141
practice in lobbying and high powered lawyering at the federal level a and k

107
00:08:23.881 --> 00:08:25.340
street is to,

108
00:08:25.341 --> 00:08:29.210
is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance.

109
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:35.260
And the existence of trade associations for every imaginable thing is a leading

110
00:08:40.161 --> 00:08:42.440
factor in American politics.

111
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:48.130
And whomsoever would seek to control or create some new efficiency or new new

112
00:08:51.291 --> 00:08:56.000
form of justice in public policy has to fight her or his way through k street.

113
00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.360
The,
and I'm about to give you,
uh,

114
00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:05.910
a series of generalizations which are broadly true,

115
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.860
each admits of exceptions,

116
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.700
but they are about what are the advantages if we want to play the K street game.

117
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.180
One is concentrated interest where a particular class of individuals or

118
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:22.260
companies have a lot at stake is a huge advantage.

119
00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:23.700
And why is it a huge advantage?

120
00:09:23.701 --> 00:09:28.380
Because it will provoke them to spend money on lobbying and influence.

121
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.350
And they will have the money.

122
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:37.080
Whereas dispersed interests where there are perhaps tens of thousands or even

123
00:09:37.081 --> 00:09:41.310
millions of people who have some small stake in and outcome,
uh,

124
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:45.400
will not readily form a well financed,
uh,

125
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:50.630
interest association and will therefore be less strong than a concentrated a set

126
00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:57.630
of interests which form a well financed,
uh,
coalition.

127
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.800
Uh,
it goes with the second point is a truism,

128
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:07.970
a well financed causes Trump world financed ones and there are exceptions to

129
00:10:11.101 --> 00:10:15.810
that but not a lot and remember that it is,

130
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.720
it is a market society and money talks.

131
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:24.770
It is a market society in which the First Amendment gives money rights.

132
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.980
That is if I want to spend money putting,

133
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:34.130
putting forth a point of view and you want to regulate my right to do that,

134
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:36.570
uh,

135
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:41.570
my first recourse of defense for the right will be to go to the courts and say

136
00:10:43.381 --> 00:10:45.630
that you're infringing my right of self expression.

137
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:51.500
And the courts have often not unambiguously but often a ruled in favor of that

138
00:10:52.471 --> 00:10:57.240
view.
Defending the status quo is a hell of a lot easier than changing it.

139
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.550
The legislative process is full of veto points.

140
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:08.130
The commonest result for legislation introduced in the House of Representatives

141
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:13.020
is that it is assigned to a committee and nothing else happens.

142
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.090
It's assigned to a committee and nobody brings it to the floor for a vote.

143
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:23.460
The committee may not even hold hearings if the chair of the committee is

144
00:11:23.461 --> 00:11:27.810
hostile to it,
he prob hostile to it.
Any thinks it might have support,

145
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:33.380
he will refuse to hold hearings and the and in a way that is not really the

146
00:11:36.121 --> 00:11:37.380
subject to this course.

147
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:43.130
The succession of ways in which you can kill new legislation is a spectacular.

148
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.580
Another issue,

149
00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:52.581
the one up the one about agency agency capture is a big advantage and by this we

150
00:11:54.251 --> 00:11:59.251
mean that if you are in the airline business let us say and there is a civil

151
00:12:02.411 --> 00:12:07.411
aeronautics bureau which is assigned the task of regulating your industry.

152
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:15.330
If your industry can make an alliance with that agency itself can capture the

153
00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:17.164
agency,

154
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:22.890
that can be worth an enormous economic psalm because it will allow you to

155
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:30.630
structure public policy in a way which suits the combined interests of your

156
00:12:31.991 --> 00:12:32.824
industry.

157
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:38.670
And something of the same is said to be at play and almost certainly is at play

158
00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.840
in the relationship between the pharmaceutical interest and the FDA.

159
00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.990
I've just said that and that in at the same time

160
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:57.980
the ca be shipped similar knowledge bureau,
uh,

161
00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:03.220
rule the airline industry from its inception until the late seventies.

162
00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:09.440
And in the late seventies,
it was repeal the regime.

163
00:13:09.441 --> 00:13:13.490
It created assigned routes to particular companies.

164
00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:18.420
So you would apply to the government for the right to fly from Laguardia in

165
00:13:18.421 --> 00:13:21.350
Chicago,
two Midwest Laguardia,

166
00:13:21.351 --> 00:13:25.850
in New York to Midway in Chicago or from Midway in Chicago to lax.

167
00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:31.840
And the agency you would assign route to make sure that there was not undo price

168
00:13:33.981 --> 00:13:34.814
competition.

169
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.040
<v 1>Okay.</v>

170
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.590
<v 0>It would protect oligarchical pricing</v>

171
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.910
and that is to say highly profitable pricing.

172
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.960
It would work the Porter's five forces,
if you will,

173
00:13:46.961 --> 00:13:49.570
to the advantage of the incumbent airlines.

174
00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.080
A new entrance could be frozen out.

175
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:57.010
A price competition was minimal.

176
00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.650
Most of the competition had to do with amenities.

177
00:13:59.651 --> 00:14:02.270
Most famously with mmm

178
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:08.990
airline attendants averaging 25 years of age and all women and none married.

179
00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:17.630
Um,
the,
um,

180
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:23.380
air travel business was restricted and wildly inefficient.

181
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:29.760
And what killed this arrangement was the observation made by some law and

182
00:14:31.661 --> 00:14:36.370
economics people
that the airlines,

183
00:14:36.371 --> 00:14:37.930
which were not subject to it,

184
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.640
and the only airlines that weren't subject to this regulation were ones which

185
00:14:42.641 --> 00:14:44.290
flew entirely in one state.

186
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:50.220
And the most famous case was the flight between the San Francisco Oakland area

187
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.680
and the Lva,
San Diego area.

188
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.170
We're fares were low.

189
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:03.490
They were less than half comparable fares on interstate flight.

190
00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.110
Uh,
a similar story in,

191
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:11.170
in Texas from Love Field Dallas in a hub pattern around the state of Texas,

192
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:18.890
fairs were lower.
Safety was just as good.
Service wasn't quite as good,

193
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.670
but there was genuine price competition.

194
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:28.570
And this group came to the fore and created a national coalition to deregulate

195
00:15:29.091 --> 00:15:33.530
the airlines.
And the effect,
uh,
was,

196
00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.630
well,
let's take somebody at random
who's had,
how am I,

197
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:42.830
how many of you look forward to air travel?

198
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:52.790
Does somebody want to give us a 32nd essay on why it's hard to watch.

199
00:15:52.791 --> 00:15:57.791
Not a lot of fun to travel by Air Jay,

200
00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:00.610
I'll save us time.
Uh,

201
00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:06.950
it's because flights are by and large full and the transportation safety

202
00:16:07.711 --> 00:16:12.300
administration provides an initial indignity on each trip.

203
00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:18.120
Um,
and because service is totally minimal,

204
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:23.060
right?
You have to buy your own Graham crackers for lunch.
The,

205
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:28.140
the,
uh,
it's,

206
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:33.120
it's not a,
uh,
unless you five first class or business class,

207
00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:38.810
which Yale does not allow except for the very highest ranking officers,

208
00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:43.390
the university right now.
Um,
uh,

209
00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:47.250
and then he owed early on very long flight.
Uh,

210
00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:50.610
air travel isn't fun at all.
Uh,
but what it is,

211
00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:54.390
is efficient and it is in real terms,

212
00:16:54.391 --> 00:16:57.510
vastly cheaper than it was under the regulatory regime.

213
00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:03.350
And I bring it up just to point out the advantage of regulation under the old ca

214
00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:09.120
be regime from the point of view of the airlines and not from the point of view

215
00:17:09.121 --> 00:17:10.080
of the passengers.

216
00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:15.860
The effect of deregulation was a long series of bankrupt cheese in which the

217
00:17:16.381 --> 00:17:21.240
legacy carriers,
uh,
went broke.
And those were chimps survived.

218
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:25.980
They had gotten so fat under the old regime that they were wildly inefficient

219
00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:31.860
and most of them died off and those which survived had to go through convulsive

220
00:17:31.861 --> 00:17:36.861
change to get their operating costs low enough to compete with the new wave

221
00:17:37.801 --> 00:17:41.550
carriers such as southwest or jet blue.

222
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.610
Well,
the FDA is

223
00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:50.040
from a strategic of view,

224
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.090
broadly analogous to the CIB.

225
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:59.280
The FDA is a huge regulatory juggle,

226
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:05.480
which creates a powerful obstacles to new entrance and which requires drug

227
00:18:07.861 --> 00:18:12.861
companies to be extremely well financed in order to get new products,

228
00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:18.100
uh,
through the mill.
And the,
the,

229
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:23.240
the impact of that has been to create a relatively small number of gigantic

230
00:18:25.951 --> 00:18:30.300
pharmaceutical companies,
uh,
many of them very well run,

231
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.060
uh,
and to,

232
00:18:33.061 --> 00:18:38.061
and to induce those pharmaceutical companies to aim at blockbuster drugs.

233
00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:41.410
<v 1>Okay.</v>

234
00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:43.300
<v 0>A Merck is one of those companies.</v>

235
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:45.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

236
00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:46.533
<v 0>It's,</v>

237
00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:51.600
I've showed you this diagram about combining know how with capital and

238
00:18:52.601 --> 00:18:57.601
motivation to get something done and in a highly regulated environment,

239
00:18:58.931 --> 00:19:01.370
you've also got to worry about,
uh,

240
00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:05.110
the regulatory and legal apparatus in a big way.

241
00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.050
And these companies are really good at that.

242
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:13.470
They have adapted to the regime of the food and Drug Administration and are a

243
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.590
terrifically good at that.

244
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:22.330
And they are able to,

245
00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.153
uh,

246
00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.420
put up pretty high barriers to competition from new entrants.

247
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:33.520
And the typical outcome for somebody for a small firm,

248
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:39.390
which has a drug candidate is that they get to a certain stage in the

249
00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:46.440
preliminary phases of testing and then sell or license the drug to one of the

250
00:19:48.461 --> 00:19:49.900
major pharmaceuticals.

251
00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.123
<v 1>MMM.</v>

252
00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.020
<v 0>Post this slide.
It's the,</v>

253
00:19:56.021 --> 00:20:01.021
it's the history of Merck's Merck's interaction with government and governments

254
00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.130
road toward the FDA.

255
00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.450
The interesting thing it's in the case about Merck is that its property was

256
00:20:07.451 --> 00:20:08.860
seized during World War One.

257
00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:14.170
And for the American government to seize the property of a corporation is a very

258
00:20:14.171 --> 00:20:17.920
rare event.
But the problem was of course,
World War One,

259
00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.810
the Germans were the bad guys.

260
00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:25.060
They ended up having to buy their property back on loans from Wall Street.

261
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:29.320
And the reason they got the loans is that Merck was a great company,

262
00:20:29.321 --> 00:20:33.280
a great company with centuries of history,
um,

263
00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.470
uh,
to legislative acts,

264
00:20:38.471 --> 00:20:42.760
which are perhaps important to the background of this case or the prescription

265
00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:47.940
drug user fee act and of 92 and the FDA modernization of 97,

266
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:54.570
both of which gave put the drug companies in the position of funding the FDA's

267
00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:01.660
investigation of their proposals.

268
00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:08.890
Now,
in looking for a blockbuster drug,
uh,

269
00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:13.700
think of the Green Square as a space representing all the possible diseases the

270
00:21:13.701 --> 00:21:14.820
drugs can fix.

271
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:19.800
And they range on the vertical scale from acute at the bottom to chronic on the

272
00:21:19.801 --> 00:21:24.480
top from rare on the bottom to common on the right.

273
00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.320
I said chronic up here or I meant chronic up here.

274
00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:32.730
And is it obvious to you where the money is to be made in the pharmaceuticals

275
00:21:32.731 --> 00:21:37.370
business?
Yes.
Back Left,

276
00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:41.180
pardon?
Common and common and chronic.

277
00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.430
Because if acute,

278
00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:48.460
the customer may not stay alive long enough to be truly profitable and common

279
00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:54.560
is,
uh,
has its obvious benefit.

280
00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:58.520
So the idea of a Cox two inhibitor,

281
00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:03.820
the business plan behind the Cox two inhibitor was to advertise the hell out of

282
00:22:04.071 --> 00:22:07.700
it and to capture a huge,

283
00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:11.490
a generation of,
uh,

284
00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:16.070
people 40 and older,
uh,
with bad knees,

285
00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:19.910
tennis elbow,
all those stiff necks,

286
00:22:19.911 --> 00:22:23.530
all those things which go on for decades.
Uh,

287
00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:28.720
and during the 17 year patent to make billions upon billions of dollars and

288
00:22:30.531 --> 00:22:35.531
blockbuster drugs in fact do make billions upon billions of dollars.

289
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:40.070
And there is a market failure problem with this model,

290
00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.190
which has to do with less common,

291
00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:48.560
with less common and more acute diseases and many,

292
00:22:48.561 --> 00:22:53.561
many small small disease populations get disproportionately small investment in

293
00:22:56.901 --> 00:23:01.901
drug research because of the logic of blockbuster drugs.

294
00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:06.200
<v 1>Uh,
Merck,</v>

295
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:12.020
<v 0>Hans had two really famous CEOs in recent times.
This is Roy van.</v>

296
00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:15.540
I've had both these guys in my classroom to teach this case at one time or

297
00:23:15.541 --> 00:23:19.510
another.
Uh,
Roy Vagelos was a,
uh,

298
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:24.120
it is an MD and a brilliant MD at a,

299
00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:27.360
at an idealist.
He,
at one point,

300
00:23:27.361 --> 00:23:31.110
I don't know if this is the river blindness drug in this case.
Yeah.

301
00:23:31.111 --> 00:23:32.910
The river behind this drug is one where he,

302
00:23:32.911 --> 00:23:37.650
the government wouldn't pay to affect pay to distribute the drug,
uh,
in Africa,

303
00:23:37.651 --> 00:23:42.651
but he just had merch pay and thinks he got his money back in the motivation of

304
00:23:44.011 --> 00:23:49.011
his research staff and Ray Gil Martin who succeeded him and comes in for great

305
00:23:50.451 --> 00:23:54.240
abuse.
In the mark linear video,
we'll look at,
uh,

306
00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:58.240
Ray Gil Martin is an Mba,
uh,

307
00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:03.250
where she had a Harvard Mba and was a hell for leather marketer and he looked at

308
00:24:06.471 --> 00:24:11.200
the Cox two inhibitor market as the best single market,
uh,

309
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:16.350
available in the generation to mark and put a huge sales force out there and

310
00:24:19.161 --> 00:24:24.161
went a full stop and sometimes a little over the line with the ethics of

311
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:29.920
inducing doctors to prescribe the drug,
uh,

312
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:35.080
sometimes by a straight forward favor gaven given sometimes by,

313
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:40.040
uh,
invitation to so called research conferences,

314
00:24:40.041 --> 00:24:44.410
which were in actual fact a golfing holidays of the kind.

315
00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.200
Now what's wrong with the Golfing holiday aimed at mds?

316
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:52.010
If we remember Sharon Oster,
do we remember?

317
00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.690
Yes.
Yes we can we scroll on mic.

318
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:08.720
I remember correctly you said was that if the doctor was willing to go on a

319
00:25:08.721 --> 00:25:12.410
golfing holiday,
that means the opportunity costs is losing,
is not that high.

320
00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:16.850
So it's probably not a doctor that sees a lot.
Okay.

321
00:25:16.851 --> 00:25:19.940
So the doctors were the lowest opportunity costs.

322
00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:24.200
We're going to a why you go to a y and they're not the people you're trying to

323
00:25:24.201 --> 00:25:27.800
reach.
And that's certainly true of,

324
00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:31.130
of the heart technology.

325
00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:35.810
Maybe a little less true of Vioxx where a very low key practice where you're

326
00:25:35.811 --> 00:25:40.811
just just casually advise people to take this drug would be very valuable.

327
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.090
The common law tradition,
um,

328
00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.690
the English common law,
uh,

329
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:56.500
is derived not from legislation but from cases and builds up through precedent

330
00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:04.380
where each new case is analyzed by its analogy or lack thereof,

331
00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:11.310
a to earlier cases which raised the same legal issues.

332
00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:13.283
<v 1>And</v>

333
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:20.540
<v 0>this tradition goes back a thousand years or nearly a thousand years.</v>

334
00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:22.280
And,
uh,

335
00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:27.550
came to the United States with the immigrants who came to New England in the

336
00:26:28.221 --> 00:26:31.990
17th century and is,
uh,

337
00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.910
a dominant part of the American legal code,

338
00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:38.900
which is largely separable from Congress.

339
00:26:38.901 --> 00:26:43.901
And the legislative process and central to it is the idea that courts should

340
00:26:45.991 --> 00:26:50.580
make the victims of a careless,

341
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:55.640
reckless or fraudulent products a whole should make that should bring them back

342
00:26:58.981 --> 00:27:03.981
to a situation as good as they would have been been in if they had not received

343
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:09.800
the bad product and beyond that often punitive damages where if we say this

344
00:27:13.501 --> 00:27:18.240
person was harmed or the extent of $100,000 so we pay him $100,000 at the

345
00:27:18.241 --> 00:27:22.710
expense of the company,
but we then say this is a huge company.

346
00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:27.960
$100,000 means nothing to this company.
So let's say a hundred minutes

347
00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:33.270
and most of the hundred million is punitive damage,

348
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:38.970
which nonetheless goes to the victim but is meant to teach the company Elastin.

349
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:42.360
Well,
from the point of view of business,

350
00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:47.900
punitive damages are very scary and the American legal landscape is a

351
00:27:51.931 --> 00:27:56.931
particularly complex one for that reason because with federalism again versus

352
00:27:58.711 --> 00:27:58.981
rich,

353
00:27:58.981 --> 00:28:03.981
you remember it again versus rich is about tort law and about setting incentives

354
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:10.380
in a way that works well for society as a whole.

355
00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:15.920
And the problem with Merck Vioxx is similarly that I'll give you one more,

356
00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:21.120
um,
one more,
uh,
common law case to get the feel of this.

357
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:24.590
Uh,
at the close of World War II,

358
00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:30.740
the guy who owned this property near an airport suit the airport for the noise

359
00:28:32.641 --> 00:28:37.500
of planes going through his airspace.
He said,
I own the airspace.

360
00:28:37.501 --> 00:28:42.501
They can only come through if they have my permission or pay me rent on the use

361
00:28:43.501 --> 00:28:47.490
of my airspace.
And uh,

362
00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:52.380
the plaintiff had a very strong common law precedent.

363
00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:58.340
The common law theory of airspace was that you make a projection from the after

364
00:29:01.681 --> 00:29:06.600
people were sure the world was round.
It's a s it's a spherical projection,

365
00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:10.050
uh,
to the ends of the ends of the universe.

366
00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:15.060
You own everything that is in that spiritual projection over your land.

367
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:17.423
<v 1>Now</v>

368
00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:22.750
<v 0>you were,
you're a judge.
It's 1947.</v>

369
00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:28.450
The airline industry is just getting strong

370
00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:35.560
and you're presented with this case tall.
How would you decide it?
Can we do

371
00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:44.440
<v 1>thanks Nancy C as the airline industry</v>

372
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:47.710
is just,
it's just getting a strong,

373
00:29:47.711 --> 00:29:52.711
I might want to incentivize them to keep flying it and keep asking if she would

374
00:29:54.521 --> 00:29:57.010
obviously be very difficult if I let every single person,

375
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:04.450
<v 3>it would obviously be very difficult to let the airline industry form if I let</v>

376
00:30:04.451 --> 00:30:09.451
every single person who owns a property control the airspace over their property

377
00:30:09.671 --> 00:30:12.940
because then they'd have to trim the transaction costs would be huge to

378
00:30:12.941 --> 00:30:15.370
negotiate with each and every single person.

379
00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:19.760
<v 0>Absolutely.
That's,
that nails the question.
So a flight,</v>

380
00:30:19.761 --> 00:30:23.330
a little flight from Chicago to Milwaukee or for Milwaukee to Madison,

381
00:30:23.331 --> 00:30:24.530
Wisconsin or for Madison,

382
00:30:24.531 --> 00:30:29.531
Wisconsin and Minneapolis would involve thousands of transactions and license

383
00:30:29.811 --> 00:30:33.380
fees with the owners of all the land you're going to traverse.

384
00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:38.750
And the airline industry would be stillborn for that reason.

385
00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:43.790
So in the background of this case,

386
00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:49.120
just as in the background of Gan versus rich is creating incentives for those

387
00:30:50.871 --> 00:30:55.871
who are prepared to invest in the generation of value and ultimately of wealth

388
00:30:58.341 --> 00:30:59.930
for the society as a whole.

389
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:02.063
<v 1>And,</v>

390
00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:04.570
<v 0>and,
uh,</v>

391
00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:09.570
Mr. Justice Douglas in May of 1946 wrote the opinion in us versus Cosby,

392
00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.460
which,
uh,
decided the case,
uh,

393
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:18.070
in favor of the airlines and against the land owners.

394
00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:20.800
Now the plaintiffs bar,

395
00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:23.190
<v 1>okay.</v>

396
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:24.660
<v 0>Yeah.
Let's not do the summary settling.</v>

397
00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:28.170
Let's see what you remember how we're going to do this DVD stage

398
00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:33.493
<v 1>play.</v>

399
00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:36.550
<v 0>This is a set of interviews we sent.
It</v>

400
00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:41.660
<v 2>ultimately has to settle.
This is one your maybe not all of the cases,</v>

401
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:46.010
but Merck certainly needs to settle the good cases.
Uh,
what,

402
00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:51.040
what Merton needs to do is wait until the statute of limitations runs.

403
00:31:51.531 --> 00:31:56.150
What that means is that there's a time period after your damaged where you have

404
00:31:56.330 --> 00:32:00.830
to file your lawsuit.
And if you don't file within that time period,
your,

405
00:32:00.831 --> 00:32:01.940
your rights are gone.

406
00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:06.650
Martin needs to go ahead and wait and let that time period run so that,

407
00:32:06.651 --> 00:32:11.420
that there is a fixed a denominator.
How many cases are out there?

408
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:12.950
And then the numerator,

409
00:32:12.951 --> 00:32:16.610
how many of those is Mark gonna settle can be determined and I'm not sure that

410
00:32:16.611 --> 00:32:18.890
mark needs to settle every case out there.
Uh,

411
00:32:18.891 --> 00:32:22.810
these cases are expensive to fight and they're hard to fight.
And so,

412
00:32:22.811 --> 00:32:27.800
so Merck can satisfactorily settle the difficult,
uh,

413
00:32:27.801 --> 00:32:32.801
cases of serious injury where really I think all of us ultimately agree merch

414
00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:34.910
owes the money.

415
00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:39.980
And then Merck can take those cases of lesser liability and ultimately tell the

416
00:32:39.981 --> 00:32:44.810
lawyers,
you want us to come get us?
And that's where this has got to end up,

417
00:32:44.811 --> 00:32:45.644
I think.

418
00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:55.540
I think there probably about 25 to 30,000 cases that ultimately will be filed

419
00:32:55.541 --> 00:32:59.980
against Merck.
Out of those 25 to 30,000,
how many of them are good cases?

420
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:04.810
I would guess probably s you've got different degradations of good.

421
00:33:04.811 --> 00:33:07.870
It's like students,
you know,
there's a good and there's be good,

422
00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:12.650
then they're seeing not so good.
And then there's DNF really not good at all.
Um,

423
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:16.150
uh,
how many a B cases in that grouping?
Uh,

424
00:33:16.151 --> 00:33:19.330
over half of them I think are probably a B cases.

425
00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:24.270
How many of those are sees man?
Maybe a third.
How many of them are D and f?

426
00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:29.650
Eh,
maybe about 25%.
I don't know.
And I'm,
I'm percentages may not add up.
Uh,

427
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:33.480
but,
uh,
it's something in those ranges.
At least

428
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.500
my guest is 12 to $15 billion for liability for Merck.

429
00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:47.660
Um,
I think if Ken Frazier,
the general counsel for Merck came to me and said,

430
00:33:47.661 --> 00:33:51.800
linear,
here's 12 and a half billion dollars,
make my headache go away.

431
00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.250
I can come pretty close to two resolving all of his issues.

432
00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:01.850
There's a great deal of difficulty,
uh,
in,

433
00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:05.910
in trying to set up a jurisdiction for hearing these cases.
Uh,

434
00:34:05.911 --> 00:34:09.450
the way the law is set up philosophically,

435
00:34:09.451 --> 00:34:12.120
the plaintiff who has a burden of proof,

436
00:34:12.121 --> 00:34:15.990
the plaintiff has to prove their case at tie goes to the defendant,
if you will.

437
00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:20.760
The plaintiff with a burden of proof is supposed to get a pic of forum.

438
00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.820
By that it means if you've got to prove your case,

439
00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:27.570
you should be allowed to choose in which court you want to do it.

440
00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:31.380
Realistically and America,
all of our courts are supposed to be fair,

441
00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:36.830
but practically we recognize that some are more plaintiff friendly and some are

442
00:34:36.991 --> 00:34:39.510
more defense friendly.
And so,
uh,

443
00:34:39.511 --> 00:34:44.220
the plaintiff's naturally try to find those courts that are plaintiff friendly.

444
00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:48.060
The defendants want defense friendly courts.

445
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:50.430
We tried the first case in Texas.

446
00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:54.570
Texas has a reputation for being plaintiff friendly.
Realistically,

447
00:34:54.571 --> 00:34:57.600
I think at this point in time it's probably not.

448
00:34:57.601 --> 00:35:02.010
Our judge was appointed to the bench by George Bush when he was governor of

449
00:35:02.011 --> 00:35:03.360
Texas.
George Bush.

450
00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:08.340
President Bush is certainly a no friend to trial lawyers.
Um,

451
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:08.851
uh,

452
00:35:08.851 --> 00:35:13.410
we have an appellate court system in Texas that is entirely Republican.

453
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:18.000
Uh,
there will not be a democratic judge that we'll ever see.
The,
the Vioxx case.

454
00:35:18.001 --> 00:35:22.740
We have a,
we tried in Texas are the one's pending right now to my knowledge.

455
00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:26.430
Um,
in New Jersey you've got a different scenario.

456
00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:31.440
You've got a court system that's very friendly,
uh,
ideologically,

457
00:35:31.441 --> 00:35:35.870
at least with big Pharma.
Pharma has a home in New Jersey,

458
00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:38.070
has great tort in New Jersey.

459
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:43.110
And until we got the punitive damage finding against Merck had never been held

460
00:35:43.111 --> 00:35:45.540
responsible for punitive damages in New Jersey.

461
00:35:45.541 --> 00:35:46.860
Under the current state of the law.

462
00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:51.410
<v 0>If you Google a judicial Hellhole,</v>

463
00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:53.100
uh,

464
00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:58.100
you will find a map showing the most plaintive friendly jurisdictions in the

465
00:35:59.761 --> 00:36:04.761
country and the huge ideological battle and political battle,

466
00:36:05.251 --> 00:36:10.251
which is in progress about federalizing and capping a tort law awards,

467
00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:14.700
uh,
is out there.
Just,

468
00:36:14.701 --> 00:36:19.470
just go tort reform or judicial hell holes and you'll get the flavor of it.

469
00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:26.180
<v 2>So a New Jersey is somewhere that I think Merck would like.</v>

470
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.540
<v 0>I'm going to skip a good bed here.</v>

471
00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:42.083
<v 1>Sorry.</v>

472
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.823
<v 2>This is fairly,</v>

473
00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:51.990
the Harvard business school slide that I put a was not the first slide I showed,

474
00:36:51.991 --> 00:36:54.840
but it certainly was a,
in my opening statement.

475
00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:59.280
I wanted the jury to understand that when it,

476
00:36:59.281 --> 00:37:03.750
but before Ray Gilmartin came on board,
Merck,
which was 1994,

477
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:08.990
Merck was run basically by a CEO named Doctor Vagi Vagelos and doctor Vagelos,

478
00:37:11.281 --> 00:37:15.420
who's a world renowned doctor,
phenomenal doctor.

479
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:18.870
When Ray Gilmartin came on board,

480
00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:23.220
Merck didn't hire a world renowned doctor to run the company.

481
00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:29.190
Merck didn't hire world renowned chemist or even a nationally known chemist.

482
00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:32.130
I heck,
I didn't take gun a local chemist.

483
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:34.980
They didn't hire a pharmacist.

484
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:38.910
Someone who had experience with pills and medicines,
uh,
on,

485
00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:42.030
on even a local level,
much less than national level.

486
00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:46.650
What Merck did is they took a different direction.

487
00:37:46.651 --> 00:37:49.320
They change directions from the Vagelos days,

488
00:37:49.321 --> 00:37:52.950
Dr [inaudible] days and they hired an MBA,

489
00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:55.680
which I have a lot of respect for Mbas,

490
00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:00.240
but I think we need to put into context what it was speaking to it within the

491
00:38:00.241 --> 00:38:04.800
Merck culture.
It was saying no longer is science running our company.

492
00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:10.220
We're now going to run this company along economic terms is a business and ray

493
00:38:10.221 --> 00:38:10.411
go,

494
00:38:10.411 --> 00:38:15.411
Martin came in as a Harvard trained in Ba who had really no science background

495
00:38:17.191 --> 00:38:19.200
whatsoever and it was an,

496
00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:24.900
I put the Harvard business school slide up to to put a visual image to go with

497
00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:31.860
the intellectual concept that Merck was choosing to be a business first company.

498
00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:32.790
It's not a patient.

499
00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:41.060
When we tried the Erin's case,

500
00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:46.090
I was stunned at the opening that Merck gave understand Bob Burns died from

501
00:38:47.211 --> 00:38:49.490
what's called sudden cardiac death.

502
00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:54.970
Sudden Cardiac death means you are dead by the time you're in the hospital.

503
00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:59.240
And the cause is,
is not something they can easily trace,

504
00:38:59.241 --> 00:39:02.090
but it's clearly a heart problem.
A,

505
00:39:02.091 --> 00:39:05.600
the sudden cardiac death was attributed to an Arrhythmia,

506
00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:09.920
which is a ventricular fibrillation for him is his heart was quivering.

507
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:15.020
And the question ultimately becomes what caused that heart quivering Arrhythmia.

508
00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:19.940
Uh,
most typically,
according to the Merck manual,
it's caused by a heart attack.

509
00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:23.480
Uh,
but it can be caused by an electrocution.

510
00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:28.570
It can be caused by a inhaling a lot of salt water in a drowning and it can be

511
00:39:29.211 --> 00:39:33.950
caused by,
uh,
uh,
being exposed to too hyperthermia.

512
00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:38.150
Um,
clearly none of those is what had happened to Bob Burns.

513
00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.460
Bob Burns had had a heart attack.

514
00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:45.970
I was stunned in opening when the Merck lawyer stood up and told the jury

515
00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:51.880
disingenuously I believe that if the jury looked at the coroner's report,

516
00:39:52.101 --> 00:39:56.660
they would see that the coroner said,
uh,
Bob Barnes had not had a heart attack.

517
00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:01.850
Bob Burns had died from Arrhythmia secondary to atherosclerosis.

518
00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:07.010
Well,
those are both caused by a heart attack.
Uh,

519
00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:11.930
[inaudible],
you know,
someone may have died from a loss of blood.

520
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.890
Okay.

521
00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:17.510
But if someone was shot and it was the gunshot that caused the bleeding and the

522
00:40:17.511 --> 00:40:21.080
loss of blood,
it's disingenuous to stand up and tell the jury,
oh,

523
00:40:21.081 --> 00:40:24.320
they didn't die from the bullet.
They died from loss of blood.

524
00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:29.120
And so I was shocked by that because I thought it was a misrepresentation and I

525
00:40:29.121 --> 00:40:32.930
think mark did it thinking they could get away with it because no one had ever

526
00:40:32.931 --> 00:40:35.750
been able to find the coroner and ask her what she meant.

527
00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:40.670
And so I don't have any testimony to the contrary.
We just have a report.

528
00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:43.820
So I went back to my office and I said,
I want the coroner.
And they said,

529
00:40:43.821 --> 00:40:47.660
we can't find the corner.
I said,
we can find anybody except bin.

530
00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:51.740
Ladin find the corner.
We hired a couple of pis.

531
00:40:51.741 --> 00:40:56.741
We found the coroner doing pathology work in the United Arab Emirates Abu Dhabi.

532
00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:02.630
I shot her an email asking her if she would mind if I spoke with her.

533
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:06.020
She emailed back and said she'd be glad to speak with me.

534
00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.210
I called her on the phone and I said,

535
00:41:08.211 --> 00:41:12.770
here is what was said about this case and opening,
here's what your autopsy said.

536
00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:16.220
Tell me about it.
She said,
well he died,
you know,

537
00:41:16.221 --> 00:41:19.280
on during an autopsy I have to put the physical cause a physical,

538
00:41:19.281 --> 00:41:21.980
cause it was a sudden cardiac death with an Arrhythmia,

539
00:41:21.981 --> 00:41:26.000
secondary death row sclerosis as well.
How does that kill you?
And she said,
easy,

540
00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:29.750
you have a heart attack.
I said,
really?
She said,
of course,

541
00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:34.070
that's the only thing that causes atherosclerosis,
causes heart attack.

542
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:38.030
The heart attack causes an arrhythmia.
She said,
unless he was electrocuted.

543
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:42.380
And she said,
was he electrocuted?
And I said No.
She said,
okay.
I said,

544
00:41:42.381 --> 00:41:45.560
would you come over and explain that to the jury?
She said,
I'd be glad to.

545
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:51.010
So she came over while merch threw a fit because Merck says we never would have

546
00:41:51.051 --> 00:41:52.880
told the jury what we did,

547
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.550
if we'd known Lanier was going to be allowed to tell the truth about it.
So,
uh,

548
00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:58.473
uh

549
00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:03.720
<v 0>Oh,
that's what,
that film is almost an hour long.</v>

550
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:07.980
We had it made for the Mbas a couple of years ago.

551
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:14.500
Mary Pat,
uh,

552
00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.890
you're not the coroner.
Uh,

553
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:21.840
but if I asked you,
is there a,

554
00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:27.300
is there another set of relationships that involve Merck that were,

555
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:31.500
uh,
behind the scenes and all this and,
and what you know about him?

556
00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:32.993
Help me out.

557
00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:34.640
<v 4>Sure.
Um,
well,</v>

558
00:42:34.641 --> 00:42:39.320
in addition to all the plaintiffs who brought cases against Merck,

559
00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:44.410
mark also had taken out insurance policies for product liability and liability

560
00:42:45.441 --> 00:42:46.640
exposure insurance,

561
00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:51.200
and they took them from a bunch of companies like Munich reinsurance.

562
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:53.900
And at the same time that all of these cases were going on,

563
00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:57.410
mark was trying to collect on those policies.
Um,

564
00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:01.790
basically they wanted money because they had to pull Vioxx and all the exposure.

565
00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:06.080
Um,
they were losing a lot of money in profits that way.
But,
um,

566
00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.870
these insurance companies were saying,
well,

567
00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:13.760
you are exercising a breach of warranty because when you took out these
policies,

568
00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:18.500
you basically told us that,
you know,
this sort of a thing wouldn't happen,

569
00:43:18.501 --> 00:43:21.590
but we're saying that you knew something like this would happen.

570
00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:25.920
<v 0>Okay.
And,
uh,
did the company,</v>

571
00:43:25.921 --> 00:43:29.190
you're close relative represented end up paying or not?

572
00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:32.740
<v 4>Um,
they paid some of the damages but not all.</v>

573
00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:36.880
<v 0>So I'm sort of a negotiated settlement.
Yeah.
Let's see.</v>

574
00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:42.430
I'm not getting my images back and we'll do without them.
Uh,
let me finish this.

575
00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:44.740
Uh,
the uh,

576
00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:49.270
ultimate outcome was a negotiated settlement,

577
00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:50.970
uh,

578
00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:55.970
amounting not to 12 and a half billion dollars as a mark linear thought or

579
00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:01.690
claimed to think,
uh,
but,
uh,
4.8 5 billion.

580
00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:07.530
And what happens is the court system creates a class action suit and then

581
00:44:08.771 --> 00:44:09.141
subtle.

582
00:44:09.141 --> 00:44:14.141
So the class action suit in a way which creates a scoring system for the

583
00:44:15.221 --> 00:44:20.020
plaintiffs,
the tens of thousands of plaintiffs.
And you,

584
00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:24.910
uh,
the score you get depends on how long you've used the drug,

585
00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:25.990
uh,

586
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:30.990
and how severely you suffered and how the causal connection between what

587
00:44:33.601 --> 00:44:36.750
happened to you and the drug is.
For example,

588
00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:41.970
if you talk Vioxx for a short period of time,

589
00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:47.840
but we're a 280 pound diabetic with a major smoking problem and accorded day

590
00:44:51.421 --> 00:44:53.900
Bourbon problem.
Uh,

591
00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:57.270
the odds were that you weren't going to get a lot of money out of the
settlement.

592
00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.980
So it's a mechanical system,

593
00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:04.490
and I personally believe that when used within reasonable limits,

594
00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:11.510
common law is a way of protecting relatively small people against large

595
00:45:13.951 --> 00:45:18.240
companies.
And the adjudication of that boundary,

596
00:45:18.241 --> 00:45:21.210
which is now in progress,
is very important.

597
00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:26.810
The killer for large companies is the tr the transaction costs of saddling a so

598
00:45:28.891 --> 00:45:33.060
many cases,
uh,
can themselves be prohibitive.

599
00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:37.500
Okay.
Exam on Wednesday and,
uh,
back to work on Monday.
