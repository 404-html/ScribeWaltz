1
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.290
Okay.
Today

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.450
the coming of mass affluence,
uh,

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.180
to the advanced economies,
principally the economies of the west.

4
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.110
Uh,
Jennifer,
speaking of informal property rights,

5
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:20.730
I thought you owned a chair right up there.

6
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.990
That's just kidding.

7
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.190
I'm going to take it in three chunks.

8
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.490
We're going to look at big picture,

9
00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:40.491
causal explanations for the rise of mass affluence and for explanations first

10
00:00:43.091 --> 00:00:45.120
for its rise and second for its rise,

11
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.330
beginning in western Europe and North America.

12
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.340
A second I'm going to uh,

13
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.660
re re reintroduced the joint stock corporation into that conversation.

14
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.770
And finally we're going to look at the phenomenon of mass affluence and the

15
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:08.430
advertising culture,
uh,
mid 20th century America.

16
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.060
Then on Wednesday we're going to,

17
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.330
we're going to descend to details.

18
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.140
And the challenge for you in preparing for Wednesday is to imagine a country and

19
00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:27.861
imagine that you somehow have been granted a fund amounting to 5% of its gross

20
00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:32.040
domestic product.

21
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.140
And with that 5%,
uh,

22
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.990
you want to make whatever changes you can imagine will increase the overall

23
00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:49.110
wealth of that country,
uh,
as much as possible.

24
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.960
So it's a pragmatic question.
It has a,
it has a causal side to it,

25
00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.380
but ultimately it's pragmatic and it is not one size fits all.

26
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.993
That is,

27
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.360
you've got to know something about the country to know something about what

28
00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:07.290
needs doing.

29
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.280
5% of the GDP in Ghana will be spent,

30
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.300
will be wisely spent very differently than 5% of the GDP in Bolivia or Mexico or

31
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:24.090
Norway.
Okay.

32
00:02:24.091 --> 00:02:28.610
So the first of the three topics is capitalist takeoff.

33
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.550
Uh,

34
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.550
the portrait of this corpulent and obvious obviously effluent gent is Sir

35
00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:40.971
Richard Arkwright who was the creator of the most efficient early textile

36
00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:46.560
machinery and who,

37
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.620
unlike many others about whom Clark talks actually profited very handsomely from

38
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.020
that work,
uh,
by takeoff in the West.

39
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.380
And this goes back to the first day of class and by Wednesday we'll go back

40
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.160
again to um,

41
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.420
gapminder.org and look at the bubbles moving through space.

42
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.270
Uh,
this still photographs,
so to speak,
covers,
uh,

43
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.430
a longer time horizon,
a 500 year time horizon,

44
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.650
and it shows a,

45
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.160
an abrupt northward movement in GDP per capita in the u s uh,

46
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.420
lagging a bit in Japan,
a lagging further in China,

47
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.150
India and Indonesia.
Uh,

48
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.690
and if we just throw all the countries in the world in a pot,
uh,

49
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.460
we get a picture that looks something like this,
uh,
where,

50
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.910
uh,
gross GDP is in blue,

51
00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.400
a population in green and the one divided by the other end goal.

52
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.560
And
what we're interested in,

53
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.090
uh,

54
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.090
from here to the end of term really is in understanding what lies behind these

55
00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:17.350
curves.
And in thinking about,

56
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.430
uh,

57
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.870
from a given country's point of view or from a given class of people in a given

58
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:26.020
country's point of view,
uh,
how can we,

59
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.630
how can we increase the rate at which things get better?

60
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.420
Now,
before I go further,

61
00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:37.900
some of you are thinking green thoughts

62
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.121
at wave at me.

63
00:04:41.121 --> 00:04:44.720
If you're thinking green thoughts and wondering whether it's really a good idea

64
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.650
to have so many people with so much money in their pockets.

65
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.990
Some of you Sasha,
tell us we've got to,

66
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.920
we've got a mic here.

67
00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.923
Thanks Morgan.

68
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.700
<v 2>Um,</v>

69
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.390
I think basically the root of all environmental problems if you care about the

70
00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:10.460
natural environment is that there are too many people,

71
00:05:10.461 --> 00:05:13.250
so you have more people who can consume more.

72
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.140
The simple thing to think is that that's bad news for,
for the earth.

73
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.190
<v 0>Okay.
So you would like to kill off a portion of the world's population?
Yes.
Okay.</v>

74
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.360
That's very straight forward.
Good Clear Mba thinking.

75
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.410
It's so,

76
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.480
and given a constant world population,
if,

77
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.640
if we had a,

78
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.570
would you prefer that that population on average be a little less affluent than

79
00:05:42.571 --> 00:05:46.080
it than it is or then I seem that I seem to want it to be,

80
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.680
<v 2>um,
I'm not sure that it's that straightforward because if people,</v>

81
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.140
societies don't have the means to advanced technology,

82
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.920
even though consumption does go up,

83
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.950
<v 0>you have cleaner technologies that would be developed with,</v>

84
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:04.110
with greater economic prosperity.
So I'm,

85
00:06:04.111 --> 00:06:05.960
I'm not as clear on that one.

86
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.850
Not as clear that you would acknowledge that as hundreds of millions of people

87
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:19.260
living in places like China and India come into,
uh,

88
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.430
income enough to have a family car or even to that,

89
00:06:25.461 --> 00:06:28.910
there's a challenge there.
Certainly.
Yeah.
Okay.

90
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.970
So let's keep the natural environment in the background as we talk about this.

91
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.960
But let's for the moment focus on economics and let's start with a curve like

92
00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:44.180
this.
The rent,
the,

93
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.990
the curve shows low income to the left high and come to the right and the

94
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.160
frequency of each income straight him is indicated vertically.

95
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.860
And the red curve is a fairly typical market economy.

96
00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:05.861
Income distribution with a truncated tail on the left and an elongated tail on

97
00:07:07.551 --> 00:07:08.940
the right,
uh,

98
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.910
with the mean income being much higher than the median because it is pulled to

99
00:07:13.911 --> 00:07:17.540
the right by the very high incomes.
Uh,

100
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.790
if this chart were drawn to scale,

101
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:23.840
that right hand tail would probably be even more he long dated,

102
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.130
but wondrously thin,
uh,
out to the,
out to the right.

103
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:29.653
Well,

104
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.750
the phenomenon of takeoff is the upward shift in that distribution.

105
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.560
It may change shape a little,
but it's not mainly that it's changing shape.

106
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:47.300
It's that its mean is drifting upward and to the right.

107
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.680
<v 3>Okay.</v>

108
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.580
<v 0>And if we think about two distributions,</v>

109
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:59.290
a two or three generations removed from one another in a given society,

110
00:07:59.821 --> 00:08:04.410
let's say the United States,
1920 and the United States today,

111
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:05.760
uh,

112
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.760
it will often be the case that the difference is so dramatic that the material

113
00:08:12.481 --> 00:08:14.700
condition of people living in the top 10th,

114
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:19.170
then we'll be about like the top half today.

115
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.050
<v 3>And You</v>

116
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:28.280
<v 0>keep that up for 10 generations or so.</v>

117
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:34.300
And you have something like this where the top decile in,

118
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.450
uh,
let's say 1800,
uh,

119
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.740
is living in material conditions that would be equivalent to perhaps the ninth

120
00:08:44.841 --> 00:08:47.450
decile today,
not the very bottom,

121
00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:51.550
but people living relatively near the bottom.
Uh,

122
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.410
and this is particularly true if you take into account not just,

123
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.680
not just income,
uh,

124
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.080
but what it is that income can buy in the way of medical care.

125
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.150
Uh,
comfort,
comfort in lodging,

126
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.540
a quality of diet and so forth.

127
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.070
So there's an enormous explosive change in the background here.

128
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:18.930
And that change is our subject.
Now,

129
00:09:18.931 --> 00:09:23.931
how you feel about that change is more complicated and we often hear that money

130
00:09:25.981 --> 00:09:30.690
doesn't buy happiness.
Uh,
the people who say that,

131
00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.950
uh,
have evidence of a kind,
uh,

132
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:37.170
none of them volunteer to become poor

133
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:44.120
and there is something that money buys a that people want and we'll return to

134
00:09:47.641 --> 00:09:48.870
that from time to time.

135
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:53.340
But imagine now that there just think about an economy with two people in it.

136
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.640
Uh,
[inaudible] uh,

137
00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.750
income or wealth is measured vertically,
visa as measured horizontally.

138
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.220
And you're Mister H.
Uh,

139
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:09.630
which of these two outcomes would you prefer?

140
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:14.580
On
my one way of thinking,

141
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.610
if you're maximizing your own income,
you'd like to be there.

142
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.820
If on the other hand,
what you're doing is staying ahead of the Joneses,

143
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.770
uh,
you'd like to be there.
Uh,

144
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:34.010
more generally if you're just trying to maximize your own household income,

145
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.130
you will have indifference curves like these horizontal ones and just seek to

146
00:10:41.131 --> 00:10:46.131
climb as high as possible and you'll be perfectly content if others climate the

147
00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:50.940
same rate or even a higher rate.
On the other hand,

148
00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:55.941
you may be calculating the ratio of your household to other households that you

149
00:10:58.441 --> 00:10:59.940
choose to compare yourself with.

150
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:05.840
And the indifference curves will then become rays from the origin like that and

151
00:11:07.261 --> 00:11:11.300
you will be trying to swing your position,
uh,

152
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:13.740
from bottom right to upper left.

153
00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:20.100
So one function is just maximize one variable and the other is maximize the

154
00:11:20.101 --> 00:11:21.900
ratio of two variables.

155
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:28.000
And most people
are a,

156
00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:32.640
tend to mix these two things.
And the,

157
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.960
their contentment with their,
uh,

158
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:41.990
material position is Hartley relative and partly absolute absolute here,

159
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:48.470
relative there.
And if you,
if you,
uh,

160
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:52.900
think about,
uh,
uh,
the employees of affirm,

161
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:58.600
the way they're compensated,
uh,
is,

162
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.090
uh,
raises both concerns.

163
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:06.990
Suppose everybody in a law firm is making between 150 and $200,000.

164
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:15.340
And along comes Jim Alexander,

165
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.710
ace corporate lawyer,
never.

166
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.430
I know I'm abusing you.
Never.

167
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.960
And all right,
Leslie Huff,
a corporate lawyer,

168
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:34.030
and,
uh,
we really need her and we've got to pay or $800,000,

169
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:39.540
and we make the offer and she takes it.
Uh,

170
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.380
there will be a,
if this fact becomes public within the firm,

171
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.370
which is quite likely a,

172
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.860
everybody else will in some measure feel impoverished by it.

173
00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.610
She's making four times what I'm making.

174
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:59.920
Surely she's not four times better than me.
Right?

175
00:12:59.921 --> 00:13:04.900
And so the,
the relative and the absolute are always at play.
Now,

176
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:08.170
let's look through Clark's explanations.

177
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:13.860
And I spent almost all of yesterday reviewing Clark and he's kind of all over

178
00:13:17.651 --> 00:13:20.170
the place.
There's some of everything in this book,

179
00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:24.520
but let's pick out some of his,
uh,

180
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:29.700
main explanations for economic takeoff and for the fact that,

181
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:31.150
uh,

182
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:36.150
the takeoff occurred first and most dramatically in western countries.

183
00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:41.350
And,
uh,
among Western countries.
First in,
uh,

184
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.460
the United Kingdom and his,

185
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:49.360
there's a recurring theme.
It's in,
uh,
the beginning,
the middle,

186
00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:51.380
and the end of the book,
uh,

187
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:56.520
about his speculative interpretation of wills from,

188
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.480
uh,
England in,
uh,

189
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:06.430
late medieval and early modern and,
and,
and right into modern times.

190
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:12.180
And the phenomenon he found it finds is a fountain of well born children who

191
00:14:16.211 --> 00:14:19.690
cannot replicate their parents' place in society.

192
00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:25.140
And the empirics on this are pretty strong that,
uh,

193
00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.500
that well to do.

194
00:14:26.501 --> 00:14:31.330
Families by and large had more than two surviving children,

195
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:37.040
uh,
reach a more than two children reaching adults.
Uh,

196
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:41.620
and indeed the survival rate among to do children was,

197
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:47.080
uh,
quite a lot higher than the survival rate among other children.

198
00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.140
And if you read all the way to the end of the book,

199
00:14:50.141 --> 00:14:53.620
you discover that if you compare this with,
uh,

200
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.730
Asian societies such as Japan and China,
uh,

201
00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.100
the effect is stronger,
uh,
in England.

202
00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:04.430
<v 1>Okay.</v>

203
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.510
<v 0>And from this,
he had deuces,
um,</v>

204
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:12.790
several consequences of the most obvious of which is that many of these well

205
00:15:14.031 --> 00:15:16.250
born children will be downward mobiles.

206
00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.250
They will marry beneath their class,

207
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:23.180
they will take up occupations or roles,
uh,

208
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.990
beneath their parents class.
Uh,
and

209
00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:31.560
Clark Clark is,
um,

210
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.770
he's trying to say two things at once.

211
00:15:35.771 --> 00:15:38.740
One is that the culture,

212
00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:43.770
the universalization of culture from the top could in some measure be promoted

213
00:15:45.431 --> 00:15:50.090
by this downward mobility that,
uh,
children,
uh,

214
00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:54.610
raised with high expectations and,
uh,
uh,

215
00:15:54.611 --> 00:15:58.180
and,
uh,
upbringing,
uh,

216
00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:00.700
make be cultural carriers,

217
00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:06.390
which would infuse lower economic strata with a,

218
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:12.240
a more energetic,
more performance oriented,
uh,

219
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.000
outlook for that.
There's no evidence in the story.

220
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.460
It's just a speculation.
Uh,

221
00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:23.830
and the other speculation for which there is also no specific evidence,

222
00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:29.590
uh,
is a Darwinian genetics story,
uh,

223
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:34.270
in which,
and here Clark is,
uh,
you know,

224
00:16:34.271 --> 00:16:38.530
this is dangerous territory in the way of,
uh,
politics.

225
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:39.520
Uh,

226
00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:44.520
he seems to believe that the genes carried at the top of the,

227
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:47.680
of the income curve,
uh,

228
00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:51.580
may be better genes than those elsewhere in the income curve.

229
00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:54.610
And that the downward force,

230
00:16:54.611 --> 00:16:59.611
downward mobility of progeny from that top level gene pool,

231
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:04.240
uh,
might upgrade the whole society in a genetic sense.

232
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:06.913
<v 1>MMM.</v>

233
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:09.140
<v 0>Anybody want to comment on that thought?</v>

234
00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:13.523
<v 1>Yes.</v>

235
00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:23.490
<v 4>Genetically speaking,
it's just sort of silly because treats don't pass directly.</v>

236
00:17:23.491 --> 00:17:25.860
You weren't a clone of your parents or even just the 50,

237
00:17:25.861 --> 00:17:29.010
50 combo in terms of caring skills downward though.

238
00:17:29.011 --> 00:17:30.330
I mean that makes a lot of sense.

239
00:17:30.331 --> 00:17:31.950
If you're well educated and you bring that down,

240
00:17:31.951 --> 00:17:34.640
you might educate your children now values,
et cetera.

241
00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.460
<v 0>Okay.
That's my,
that's precisely my own view.</v>

242
00:17:38.461 --> 00:17:41.340
But does anybody want to defend Clark here?

243
00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:44.043
<v 1>Yup.</v>

244
00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.330
<v 4>It could</v>

245
00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:50.110
<v 0>more of a bell curve situation if you know,
if you know what I mean,
that</v>

246
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.500
<v 5>people,
uh,
uh,</v>

247
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:56.600
on the higher end of the e the income ladder have over time,

248
00:17:58.620 --> 00:17:59.140
um,

249
00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:04.140
been privy to better situations and better selection pressures leading to the

250
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:10.170
evolution of skills like,
I dunno,
analytical thinking,

251
00:18:10.171 --> 00:18:14.250
intelligence skills that are necessary for the professions that are

252
00:18:14.251 --> 00:18:15.530
characteristic of the hierarchy.

253
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.473
<v 1>MMM.</v>

254
00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.490
<v 0>What's that?
Let's have a vote here.</v>

255
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:27.940
How many people think it's likely that there is some validity to,

256
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:32.320
let's start with the cultural story and then go to the genetic story.

257
00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:37.030
How many people find the cultural story broadly plausible.

258
00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:39.010
<v 1>Okay.</v>

259
00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:43.860
<v 0>And,
and the opposite implausible.
Okay.</v>

260
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.160
And how many find the genetic story broadly?
Plausible.

261
00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:49.410
<v 1>Okay.</v>

262
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:52.320
<v 0>Fewer but a substantial number.</v>

263
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:54.840
And how many find it implausible.

264
00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:57.363
<v 1>Okay.</v>

265
00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:58.711
<v 0>I have no idea.</v>

266
00:18:58.711 --> 00:19:02.880
And Clark provides not one shred of evidence with which we could test this.

267
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:04.163
Um,

268
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:09.590
my own guests is that a few hundred years is a pretty short time for carrying

269
00:19:10.741 --> 00:19:15.110
out the law.
That kind of selection process he has in mind.
Uh,

270
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:19.590
it's also the case that the association between,

271
00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:21.683
<v 1>uh,</v>

272
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:27.440
<v 0>parental,
um,
uh,
let's call it Iq.</v>

273
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:33.190
The twin studies actually do confirm this that were identical twins are born to

274
00:19:34.581 --> 00:19:39.581
Ms Mr and Mrs. Smith and raised by Mr and Mrs. Jones in Iq and several other

275
00:19:41.121 --> 00:19:41.721
variables.

276
00:19:41.721 --> 00:19:46.721
The association between the identicals will be greater than between them and the

277
00:19:47.721 --> 00:19:50.030
siblings belonging to the new family.

278
00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:55.820
So genetics is not wholly out of the picture.

279
00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.420
Uh,
on the other hand,
from a pragmatic point of view,

280
00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.930
which is where we're going with all this,
uh,

281
00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.280
the idea of,
well,
what was eugenics?

282
00:20:07.281 --> 00:20:11.330
Does anybody have any of you in a history course?
Picked up eugenics?

283
00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:13.083
<v 1>Anyone</v>

284
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.530
<v 0>back back with a mic here?</v>

285
00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:24.580
<v 4>It's an idea that in some form has existed since ancient times,</v>

286
00:20:24.581 --> 00:20:26.740
but really picked up in the late 19th century.

287
00:20:26.741 --> 00:20:31.210
And then especially under the Third Reich where it was essentially believe that

288
00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.420
people at the top tended to have better genes or in the case of the Third Reich

289
00:20:34.421 --> 00:20:37.810
is specific racial group and therefore you want to maximize the number of people

290
00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.280
with certain desirable traits.

291
00:20:39.281 --> 00:20:42.490
Were we producing and minimize the ability of people undesirable traits to

292
00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:43.324
reproduce,

293
00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:48.100
resulting in a better or stronger or smarter in the case of the Nazis race?

294
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.660
<v 0>That's the jest of it.
Um,</v>

295
00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:56.110
I had had the though part of it,

296
00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.750
which was most influential had to do with,

297
00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:03.530
I'm trying to prevent,
um,
uh,

298
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.450
people who were mentally retarded from reproducing.

299
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:11.620
And uh,
and a lot of that happened,

300
00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:13.413
um,

301
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:18.850
the vulgar prejudices that lay behind much of it.

302
00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.170
It was much of,

303
00:21:20.171 --> 00:21:24.460
it was conducted by something called the Vineland Institute located near

304
00:21:24.461 --> 00:21:28.780
Princeton,
New Jersey.
No guilt by association there.

305
00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:30.323
Uh,

306
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:35.080
and the Vinyl and institute published data showing that all the immigrant groups

307
00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:39.190
streaming into the u s in the early 20th century,
uh,

308
00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.010
were inferior to wasps mentally.

309
00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:47.230
And they were very tough on the Jews.
The Jews are just not bright at all.

310
00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:52.180
And they did this by administering English language questionnaires to immigrants

311
00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:55.210
just after they got,
uh,

312
00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:01.980
the pragmatics of culture or something that's a lot easier to deal with and

313
00:22:02.351 --> 00:22:07.351
which fits more readily into the humanistic framework that we share,

314
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:14.230
uh,
after that,
after the,
the fountain,

315
00:22:14.231 --> 00:22:16.360
which really doesn't fit in any of his categories.

316
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.710
Clark has three broad categories.
One is exogenous growth theories,

317
00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:26.010
exogenous meaning economic growth caused by something that is,
um,

318
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:29.950
that has its origins outside the market economy.

319
00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.220
And,
uh,
one of these ideas,

320
00:22:33.221 --> 00:22:37.750
which I think he's right about a,
he doesn't run with it very far,

321
00:22:37.751 --> 00:22:41.710
but the emergence of the nation state system,
the rule of law,

322
00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.053
um,

323
00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:48.150
the existence of a well formalized property rights,

324
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:54.550
all that stuff,
uh,
is pretty powerful.
I,

325
00:22:54.551 --> 00:22:59.551
and the Western world was the initial focal point of a Westphalian nation state

326
00:23:02.771 --> 00:23:04.640
system.
Uh,

327
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:09.190
Clark is at pains to show that that by itself isn't enough of an explanation.

328
00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:10.870
And in general,

329
00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:15.930
no one should expect one story to explain the evolution of capitalist wealth.

330
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.410
This is way too complex.
A story way too complex,

331
00:23:20.411 --> 00:23:25.411
a phenomenon for a simple theories to carry the day.

332
00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:30.780
A special case of that would be wealth maximizing law as illustrated a,

333
00:23:30.781 --> 00:23:33.820
we could go in again versus rich,
uh,

334
00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:38.850
or in a US versus Cosby or any of hundreds of,

335
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:43.170
uh,
legal precedents.
Uh,

336
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:45.230
Clark also,
um,

337
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:51.250
briefly towards the end of the book takes up the work of a guy named Kenneth

338
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.070
Pomerantz and Pomerantz has a book called the great divergence,

339
00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:59.540
which asks the question,
why did the,

340
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:04.910
well,
he begins with a proposition that from a social and economic point of view,

341
00:24:04.911 --> 00:24:09.680
China and Japan both looked a lot like Europe,

342
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:15.590
uh,
in about 1800.
And there's lots to quibble within that generalization,

343
00:24:15.591 --> 00:24:19.550
but it's not crazy.
And that he says,
well,
you're takes off,

344
00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:24.920
uh,
well over a century ahead of those Asian countries.

345
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:28.400
And,
uh,
he wants to know why.

346
00:24:28.401 --> 00:24:32.990
And His thesis is,
it has to do with natural resources.

347
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:38.470
And in particular that large population centers like the cities of England,

348
00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:45.160
we're located close to large energy resources such as the coal mining areas of

349
00:24:47.391 --> 00:24:51.890
the Midlands in the United Kingdom.
Uh,
and also,

350
00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:56.390
uh,
have almost equal importance for Pomerantz,
uh,

351
00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:59.900
access to vast agricultural land

352
00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:02.960
in the form of North America.

353
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:08.800
And that about 1800 was the time when the exploitation of the largely empty

354
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:14.830
continent in the United States,
uh,

355
00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.960
was feeding resources into Western Europe.

356
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.840
And there's some plausibility in those ideas.

357
00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:23.260
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

358
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:23.590
<v 0>Uh,</v>

359
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:28.590
then Clark talks about multiple equilibrium theories and the idea here is think

360
00:25:31.421 --> 00:25:36.421
of time passing that way and standard of living or productivity going this way.

361
00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.040
And the idea is that,
uh,

362
00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:45.390
a country could climb this small hill and get stuck here and then there'd be

363
00:25:46.541 --> 00:25:48.310
some exogenous shock,

364
00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:52.450
some huge event outside the economic system,

365
00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:58.020
which would allow it to pass from that equilibrium to a new equilibrium on top

366
00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.350
of the Taller Hill.

367
00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.353
<v 3>And</v>

368
00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:10.130
<v 0>the world's demographic transition</v>

369
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:15.290
is such a story and not a crazy story at all.

370
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:20.390
The notion that the falling death rate,
uh,

371
00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.670
created by better public health,

372
00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:26.120
probably more than any single factor by clean water,

373
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:30.290
uh,
an elementary vaccinations,

374
00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:34.380
but clean water probably above all else.
Um,

375
00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:40.390
and the eventual adjustment of the birth rate to that so that you go from high

376
00:26:41.961 --> 00:26:43.560
birth rate,
high death rate,

377
00:26:43.561 --> 00:26:47.370
short lives to low birth rate,

378
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:51.050
low death rate,
long lives.
Uh,

379
00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.690
that by itself is a,

380
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:58.860
is I think without question,
a powerful element

381
00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:05.390
in the story wherever a nation state society,
uh,

382
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:10.400
has got gone from poor to rich [inaudible]

383
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:17.580
then the endogenous growth theories.
And these are,

384
00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:18.571
I this,

385
00:27:18.571 --> 00:27:23.571
the idea here is that something happens inside the economy that creates a

386
00:27:25.321 --> 00:27:29.310
dynamic change and that dynamic change,

387
00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:33.780
uh,
lead,
uh,
to,
uh,

388
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:37.920
mass affluence.
And I think there's a lot in this idea,

389
00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.890
um,
which of course is not.

390
00:27:40.891 --> 00:27:45.660
Clarke's Clark is merely cataloguing other people's ideas.
And,
uh,

391
00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:50.130
does anybody recognize either of these two handsome gentlemen?

392
00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:52.250
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

393
00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:53.900
<v 0>I'd prefer the haircut on the left.</v>

394
00:27:56.070 --> 00:28:00.960
Uh,
this is Joseph Schumpeter.
Uh,

395
00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:05.420
and this is Faa Hayak and each of them

396
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:10.220
had an idea about market societies.

397
00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:15.290
That has to be central to our thinking.

398
00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:20.030
Uh,
in Schumpeter's case,
it was creative destruction.

399
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:25.010
And I'm told by the teaching fellows that most of you knew that quite well on

400
00:28:25.011 --> 00:28:29.000
the midterm.
Um,
and creative destruction,

401
00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.160
uh,
is,

402
00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:36.760
is a way of reshuffling the deck economically at short intervals.

403
00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:41.600
So that looking back

404
00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.360
at this story,

405
00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:49.430
so that sitting still on this hill is difficult for a,

406
00:28:49.431 --> 00:28:51.110
for any given from,

407
00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:57.040
and arguably impossible for society at large once you're into a capitalist

408
00:28:58.311 --> 00:29:00.560
market economy.
Uh,

409
00:29:00.561 --> 00:29:05.030
one way to diagram that is

410
00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.341
this diagram,

411
00:29:07.341 --> 00:29:12.341
we have the capital invested in a given kind of product or production,

412
00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.860
uh,
rising from left to right,

413
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:21.190
and the productivity of that capital rising from a bottom to top and each of

414
00:29:25.371 --> 00:29:29.340
these curves is a,
is a production function,
uh,

415
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:34.630
representing a technology and a way of organizing people and handling

416
00:29:35.601 --> 00:29:36.470
information.

417
00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:42.520
And the idea would be that change occurs in the sequence one,

418
00:29:42.671 --> 00:29:43.510
two,
three,
four,
five,

419
00:29:43.511 --> 00:29:48.511
six here where there's a process of climbing to the right as we go to more

420
00:29:49.841 --> 00:29:54.070
capital intensive production,
more capital per worker.

421
00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:59.320
Uh,
and then while a tall is doing that,

422
00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:05.230
uh,
Jennifer is saying,
well,
no,

423
00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:10.090
we should reorganize this entirely.
We should use a different technology,

424
00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.780
a different method of attracting investments,

425
00:30:13.781 --> 00:30:18.670
a different method of compensating employees and she shifts

426
00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:22.420
to the lower end of three.

427
00:30:22.421 --> 00:30:27.160
And then that gets carried to here and then a similar shift,
uh,

428
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:30.130
to the blue production function and an up that.

429
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:35.310
And so it kind of Zig Zag story of change where uh,

430
00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:40.560
people compete not within one production function but between production

431
00:30:42.041 --> 00:30:47.041
functions and a chaotic pattern of creative destruction occurs.

432
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:55.420
What makes it creative is that it is ultimately an upward movement in

433
00:30:55.421 --> 00:30:56.254
productivity.

434
00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:02.590
And a version of that story is in Clark.
Uh,

435
00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:07.550
but he doesn't really think,
uh,
in the dynamic way that champagne,

436
00:31:07.551 --> 00:31:10.120
her and Hayak and others do.

437
00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:15.390
High Act story is the one about the creative possible potential of a free

438
00:31:15.461 --> 00:31:19.300
society,
which I think you had a memo to write about.

439
00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:24.960
And the notion there is that social learning will accrue that the society at

440
00:31:28.241 --> 00:31:31.900
large will have a higher learning rate than any individual within it.

441
00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:37.630
And that as each of us goes about her or his,

442
00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:41.770
uh,
work,
we are spewing off,

443
00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.920
uh,
insights for others,

444
00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:49.420
both when we succeed and when we fail,
when we succeed,

445
00:31:49.421 --> 00:31:52.570
people will copy our ideas.
When we fail,

446
00:31:52.571 --> 00:31:54.970
people will know an idea not to try.

447
00:31:56.140 --> 00:32:01.140
And that over time a society actually smart up.

448
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:07.270
And if you look at the first chapter in the assignment for today in Clark,

449
00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:09.510
he has,
uh,

450
00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:14.530
all the factors of growth as he conceives them in a very simplified model.

451
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.050
And the residual,

452
00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:22.700
the residual which accounts for about half the variance,
uh,

453
00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:26.260
it's most natural interpretation is it is social learning.

454
00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:32.100
It isn't the specific capital embodied in a given workers education or in the

455
00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:39.900
factory plant and equipment with which that worker is supplied by an employer.

456
00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:41.550
Uh,

457
00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:46.490
but in the less tangible forms of social knowledge,

458
00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:52.150
which the society is generating and high acts idea then is that over time social

459
00:32:53.151 --> 00:32:57.470
learning,
uh,
makes the whole system smarter,

460
00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:02.920
taken as a whole and that learning to navigate unfamiliar information,

461
00:33:03.921 --> 00:33:08.840
which arguably would be something you're all doing right now,

462
00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:09.681
uh,

463
00:33:09.681 --> 00:33:14.681
becomes not only an advantage to the individual but to the society at large.

464
00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.313
Well,

465
00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:23.620
the most glaring omission in Clark in talking about the surge of wealth in the

466
00:33:26.811 --> 00:33:29.120
West is the joint stock corporation

467
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:35.000
and the joint stock corporation goes back of course,
many centuries.

468
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:40.310
Uh,
but the kind of jaw joint stock corporation,

469
00:33:40.311 --> 00:33:45.200
which has become a dominant in the world,
uh,

470
00:33:45.201 --> 00:33:48.680
goes back only to about the middle of the 18 hundreds.

471
00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:50.523
Um,

472
00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:54.920
in the UK it's dated to the corporation act of 1862,

473
00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:59.840
uh,
in the u s I think you'd probably say somewhere in the 1840 [inaudible] it

474
00:33:59.841 --> 00:34:00.770
becomes important.

475
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:05.840
You can find legal traces of it much earlier and in both cases,

476
00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:11.210
but it gets to be a big deal in the middle years of the 19th century.

477
00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:15.170
And as we saw with the reading from Bob,

478
00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:17.450
<v 1>okay.</v>

479
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:20.490
<v 0>Uh,
Alfred,
Alfred Chandler,
uh,</v>

480
00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:25.520
the rise of the large scale a railroad in the u s provoked the creation of the

481
00:34:29.101 --> 00:34:33.450
equity and bond markets in New York,
uh,
and the,

482
00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.033
uh,

483
00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:40.160
feverish development of joint stock corporations in virtually every field of

484
00:34:40.981 --> 00:34:43.560
endeavor.
Uh,
thereafter,

485
00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:47.440
uh,
these slides,

486
00:34:47.441 --> 00:34:52.441
I'm going to show a series of proprietary slide constructed by Ibbotson

487
00:34:55.181 --> 00:34:55.960
associates.

488
00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:00.960
Ibbotson associates is named for Roger Ibbotson at the School of management

489
00:35:01.241 --> 00:35:03.550
here.
Uh,
Ibbotson

490
00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:04.850
<v 1>yeah.</v>

491
00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:09.850
<v 0>Became a filthy rich by,</v>

492
00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:14.710
uh,
being the first one to systematically,
uh,

493
00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:16.190
compile,
analyze,

494
00:35:16.191 --> 00:35:21.191
and sell long trend data about stocks and bonds.

495
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:23.440
<v 1>Okay.</v>

496
00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:27.910
<v 0>And it's only because he likes to teach that he bothers to continue.</v>

497
00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:33.580
Uh,
the timescale here is 1925.
Two more of us,

498
00:35:33.581 --> 00:35:38.070
the president,
uh,
and the,
uh,

499
00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.450
uh,

500
00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:44.450
earnings of various classes of assets are a trace tier,

501
00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:46.261
uh,

502
00:35:46.261 --> 00:35:51.261
beginning in this case with treasury bills issued by the government and as safe

503
00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:55.800
as the government,
uh,
is,
uh,

504
00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:57.640
then municipal bonds,

505
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:04.340
government bonds of other kinds of corporate bonds.

506
00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:10.160
So a that this would be debt taken on by a corporation and it might be,

507
00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:18.560
they might be junk bonds if the corporation is a little risky and they might be

508
00:36:18.871 --> 00:36:23.550
blue chip bonds if not,
and then uh,

509
00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:28.110
this is the blue curve is an amalgam of stock returns.

510
00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:33.920
And in every case we start with $1 in 1925 and keep investing the money.

511
00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:39.830
The,
the way these charts are are generated is um,

512
00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:44.580
we assume that every dollar of dividend is plowed back,

513
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.450
uh,
and that we don't pay any taxes.

514
00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:54.680
So this would sort of be Yale that were charting you and I wouldn't quite have

515
00:36:55.891 --> 00:36:58.410
the same tax privilege Gail has.

516
00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:01.560
And the most striking thing there is,

517
00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.910
what's the most striking thing about that chart?

518
00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:10.440
First of all,
there is some magic in compound interest,
right?

519
00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:16.230
You can just leave your money to grow.
It really does eventually do that.

520
00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:19.080
But how about the blue curve versus the others?

521
00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:25.510
Pretty startling.
We've got to get somebody else to yes.
Tall

522
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:35.870
<v 4>there.
There seems to be rather large equity premium.
Okay.
When,</v>

523
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:38.290
what I mean by that is that there seems to be,
uh,

524
00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:42.340
excess returns if you put your money in stocks versus any of the other

525
00:37:42.341 --> 00:37:45.230
categories,
treasuries,
corporate bonds.
Okay.
Um,

526
00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.910
I mean you're obviously taking on more risk,
right?

527
00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:52.300
The stocks versus the other categories,
certainly more than treasury bills.
But,

528
00:37:52.301 --> 00:37:55.970
um,
you could possibly argue that the difference in risk,
uh,

529
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.930
it doesn't seem as great as a difference in returns over the long run.

530
00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:01.180
<v 0>Okay.
And,
uh,</v>

531
00:38:01.181 --> 00:38:05.740
what's the stat that the equity premium is the punchline here while shed?

532
00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:10.570
And what's the standard way one might manage the risk of a portfolio?

533
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:13.060
You could diversify.
Okay.

534
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:18.270
So we wouldn't put all our money in mining stocks or in even in Apple,

535
00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:23.693
um,

536
00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:27.960
which is right now one of the most expensive stocks in the universe.

537
00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:33.020
But the equity premium is huge.
And look here,
what happens,

538
00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:38.080
this was 1925.
The depression is here,
the great crash is here.

539
00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:42.250
Uh,
these people got jolted,
right?

540
00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:47.280
And of course the temptation when that happens to you is to imagine that it's

541
00:38:48.491 --> 00:38:53.491
going to go right to the middle of the earth and therefore to sell at this

542
00:38:55.121 --> 00:38:59.170
point,
which lots and lots of people did.

543
00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:05.020
And of course the effect was,
uh,
to ruin their wealth.

544
00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:09.160
Let's take another set of these.
Uh,
we've,

545
00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:13.210
we let inflation go unnoticed in that one.

546
00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:18.820
And here we'll show inflation by the red curve.
And then

547
00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:24.100
the t bills,
government bonds,

548
00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:28.420
large company stocks,
small company stocks,

549
00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:33.730
and you get a huge premium there.
Now the,

550
00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:36.940
the back to the question of,

551
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:40.840
of the accumulation of mass affluence,

552
00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:47.400
the power of large enterprise to generate a enormous wealth over long periods,

553
00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:58.810
right?
This is a,
a 75,
80,
85 year period.

554
00:39:58.811 --> 00:40:01.090
We're looking at,
uh,

555
00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.970
but patient money,

556
00:40:03.971 --> 00:40:08.170
patiently invested in joint stock corporations,
uh,

557
00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.720
is a solid strategy,
uh,

558
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.890
for the accumulation of wealth within a given household,
uh,

559
00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:22.440
or,
uh,
institutional portfolio.
Uh,

560
00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:27.190
it's not anywhere near the sexiest or the fastest way,

561
00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:32.620
uh,
but it is,
uh,
one of the most solid ways.

562
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:38.190
And the only conclusion I want to get out of this is that in talking about

563
00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:46.380
economic takeoff and the sustained growth in mass affluence,

564
00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.750
uh,
companies,

565
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:54.400
joint stock companies with limited liability are a big part of that.

566
00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:00.100
Third and last,
uh,
with,

567
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:05.550
remember the variable here is gross domestic product per capita and part of

568
00:41:06.281 --> 00:41:08.290
that,
uh,

569
00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.620
has to do with a propensity to consume.

570
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:17.910
And in the Posner book about what went wrong with the mortgage markets,

571
00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:19.690
uh,
canes,

572
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:25.510
Lord Lord chains is mentioned and Keynesian economics,

573
00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:28.390
which are,
uh,

574
00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:33.420
which are directed to the question of stabilizing mass demand for product,

575
00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:39.990
uh,
so that the economy keeps going around and around,
uh,

576
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:41.980
is an important element.
Well,

577
00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:47.000
the joint stock corporation was a,
from its birth,

578
00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:51.530
really good at selling and the move,

579
00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:53.990
which would be called forward integration.

580
00:41:53.991 --> 00:41:57.620
We're not just going to make cigarettes,
we're going to sell cigarettes.

581
00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:00.680
We're not just going to make soap.
We're going to sell soap.

582
00:42:00.681 --> 00:42:01.850
We're not just going to make cars.

583
00:42:01.851 --> 00:42:05.120
We're going to sell them a that forward integration.

584
00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:07.130
I'm going to without comment now,

585
00:42:07.131 --> 00:42:12.131
just show you a 20 slides from the middle decades of the 20th century and then

586
00:42:14.061 --> 00:42:17.240
we'll stop briefly and segue to next.
Our next meeting.

587
00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:23.040
Some of these are a little pernicious.
This one is not.

588
00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.110
Uh,
the,

589
00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:44.530
a repeated trope is using products to solve marital problems and the large glove

590
00:42:47.691 --> 00:42:50.820
compartment on this mercury,
uh,

591
00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:55.580
will solve the marital problem between these two.

592
00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:56.903
Okay.

593
00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:04.190
When my grandfather died and I was 17,

594
00:43:04.741 --> 00:43:06.600
I inherited a mercury from him.

595
00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:09.940
It lasted one year before I crashed it.

596
00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:14.113
<v 1>Okay.</v>

597
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:17.150
<v 0>Quiet substance.</v>

598
00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:39.883
<v 1>Okay.</v>

599
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:47.660
<v 0>There's a series of pall mall labs here.</v>

600
00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.840
They all have to do with men and women.

601
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.230
Women are the sales target.
There's Palmolive soap exist still.

602
00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:00.770
Does anybody use it?

603
00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:09.993
Ah,

604
00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:32.430
<v 1>that's pretty nasty</v>

605
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:33.263
<v 0>stuff,
right?</v>

606
00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.350
This is rouge,
not soap now.

607
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:09.743
<v 1>Okay,</v>

608
00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:26.940
<v 0>well you get the jest of it.
Um,</v>

609
00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:35.450
so in the consumer culture that's embodied in these and which is a powerful,

610
00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:40.540
powerfully represented all around us,
right?

611
00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:44.550
We live in a very consumption oriented culture.

612
00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:47.820
Uh,
is,

613
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:53.750
is arguably a misleading misleadingly favorable aspect of wealth.

614
00:45:56.250 --> 00:46:00.510
That is an awful lot of,
if you think about those ads and how silly

615
00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:07.100
it seems with 70 years hindsight that using Palmolive soap will save your

616
00:46:08.821 --> 00:46:13.680
marriage went off and gasses that it didn't save a single marriage.

617
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:15.703
Um,

618
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:21.770
that whole angle of kind of the huckster ish aspect of a capitalist society.

619
00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:25.890
I can give one pause.
No,

620
00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:32.650
I'd like you to come to class Wednesday having thought a little about a country

621
00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:37.830
and what 5% of its GDP would amount to in dollars and if need to look that up.

622
00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:46.300
You know,
you can Google it the easiest.
Google is a CIA fact book.

623
00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:47.680
Uh,

624
00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:52.680
but the World Bank will give you the data to the World Bank or um,

625
00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:57.760
uh,
the WTO.
They're all kinds of organizations that produce these data.

626
00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:03.390
Pick a country and think about 5% and think about how you would deploy the 5%,

627
00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:05.020
uh,

628
00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:10.020
if you wanted to maximize the expected wealth of that society over about say,

629
00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:15.250
a 20 year future.
Uh,

630
00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:20.340
the reading is the more policy oriented part of desoto and it should in some

631
00:47:21.341 --> 00:47:24.520
ways guidance,
support.
Uh,
you're thinking,

632
00:47:24.521 --> 00:47:28.360
although you surely want to think well beyond a discharges framework,

633
00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:29.680
so I'll see you on Wednesday.
