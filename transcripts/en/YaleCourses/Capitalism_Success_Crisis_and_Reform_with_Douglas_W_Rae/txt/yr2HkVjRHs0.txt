Speaker 1:          00:01          Uh, what I'd like to do this morning is spend eight or 10 minutes with a few slides that are framing and background of the case. And then, um, I'm going to ask Nancy Height to impersonate, impersonate, share an Oscar with the flying chalk on the board. And I'm going to come around and talk to all of you about the case and we'll work it through B school style.

Speaker 1:          00:32          When you look at the institutions involved in the mortgage system, I don't assume that they were designed brilliantly or that they were thought out from beginning to end. The concept of Kluge is that in your vocabulary, it's Tim, is that Kluge? Is that our curt hands up in [inaudible] not going to get anywhere with that idea. A kluge means things that are complex and badly designed. And there's a wonderful book by a guy named Gary Marcus called Kluge, which is about badly designed stuff, uh, from, uh, economic institutions to human memory, to, uh, the human spine, which is a highly error prone structure. And it is as it is, not because evolution said what's the very best support call I can make for a pipette bipedal creature. But what's the best I can do by evolving from a four if I get to a to like a great trip.

Speaker 1:          01:56          And the spine shows all kinds of design imperfections that are attributable to the fact that it evolved in a horizontal plane and then was readapted in a vertical point and the institutions at play in what Posner calls the Depression of Oh eight and what most of us called the recession. Oh boy. Oh nine. So it is perhaps the mother of all recessions. It has not actually attain thought depth of unemployment and under utilization of a plant and equipment that would match up with the one in the 1930 [inaudible] of course we could still get there. Uh, it is possible. That is now 1931 and another dip is out there. I don't think that, but there are I including wheel gach when we saw a few days ago who speculate that it might be. So.

Speaker 2:          03:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:10          Uh, this is a cast of characters for subprime lending, a left to right, uh, the home buyer, the broker, the appraiser, that mortgage lender, the air, the investment banker and the investors in the bonds created by the investment banks. And in the, the, uh, the row I'm touching are the principal incentives that make the whole system go. And the critical thing is that three and arguably four of the main steps in the process are fee driven. So that the alignment between the decision maker and the master or between the decision maker and the potential home buyer, uh, may be muted by the decision maker thinking fees. If I'm saying it, let's suppose, let's suppose I were a college admissions officer and I was paid by the wives students still ever to the school, I might become very generous in my views. I might find creativity in unexpected places.

Speaker 1:          04:37          I might imagine analytic fire power where none existed. And so in all these steps, the bias toward yes, the bias toward completing a transaction a is a very powerful, powerful piece of the story. The risks are chartered here. Uh, what we're going to do well when we do the case, among other things, just to fill in the bottom bro, what are the ways in which we would expect people in each of these roles roles to be tempted to get out of line, out of line, ethically, uh, and quite possibly out of why legally as in the case there is a broker, right, who gets way beyond both ethical and legal bounds. Home ownership in the United States, 1900 to 2000, uh, looks like this. And notice it's a truncated scale. The bottom of the steel is 40%. Uh, the big story is a huge normative emphasis on home ownership. Uh, the belief, uh, going back to Jefferson really, that when people own property, they become, uh, bought in citizens, citizens who identify with the Commonwealth and who can be counted on to act in public spirited ways. And there's a great run up in home ownership between World War Two, uh, and the 1980s. And it is fueled by a very profitable mass development of suburban housing.

Speaker 1:          06:32          It is financed by, uh, uh, Fha and related, uh, government entities. And it is rewarded by the internal revenue service tax code, which gives a strong incentive for people to take out mortgages on a principle residence. Now, homeownership, I assume, if any, do any of you own a home?

Speaker 3:          07:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:09          Oh, I should say that. Jaan [inaudible] who wrote the cases with us, welcome. Yawn. You own a house. Sometimes I envy that homeownership has all kinds of hazards, right? I just learned that my slate roof, a hundred year old slate roof is at the end of its lifetime and that's, that's comparable to buy a, it's about the same price as the highest end. BMW replace a slate roof. That's a hazard. Uh, suppose, uh, that uh, you get laid off now your mortgage payments continue. Suppose that there is a catastrophic illness. The mortgage payments continue the local property taxes continue. The unanticipated maintenance issues continued and there is quite a lot to be said for relative caution about undertaking a debt amounting to several years income in purchasing a house. Now there's also a political dimension to this, which is that the old fashioned local banking method of writing mortgages was extremely cautious and was first explosively and then later implicitly racist and gender rest.

Speaker 1:          08:46          It was all about well employed white men and the, that there is an any illogical strand that is not Jeffersonian, but it's more recent that has to do with the equality of opportunity to own houses, which has pushed a policy toward a more permissive attitude. Uh, finally there is of course the pro market view, which became dominant in this country in the Ronald Reagan era, uh, which says let people cut the deals. They want to cut, get the government out of the transaction, deregulate. And in many cases, deregulation was a spectacular success. For example, the airline industry, uh, the trucking industry, uh, but deregulation of finance is a slipper you're on, you're taking a history of home values here. Uh, what's emphasis an index chart that has 1890 index to a hundred. And the gist of the argument in this chart, did I take this from the case or not? Uh, the, the gist of the argument in this chart is that by the time we're done with the current meltdown, a home values adjusted for inflation will be back about where they were in 1890.

Speaker 3:          10:25          MMM.

Speaker 1:          10:26          This a map of Philadelphia and it's historically interesting map. I couldn't find a comparable one for Cleveland though I'm sure. What exists. In 1937, uh, mortgages were collapsing all over the country and the Roosevelt administration pushed through Congress a piece of legislation called the home owners' Loan Corporation, h o l LLC, home owners' Loan Corporation. And the home owners' Loan Corporation was charged with finding out how to know in advance if a mortgage would likely fail. And the technique was not to look at credit scores, but to look at housing locations and to look at the condition of housing in a neighborhood and at the demographics of who lived there. And it was crudely racist and uh, uh, biased in many, many ways. Uh, it was explicitly racist about blacks. It was explicitly racist about Jews. It was explicitly racist about Italians, most of all southern Italians.

Speaker 1:          11:46          And it was a four point scale. The worst category. Level D was Red and the term redlining comes from this. And the idea was to tell the banking world not to lend money in those zones. Uh, yellow was a little better, uh, uh, then, then, uh, blue, then green. And the idea was to put mortgage money into the safest wealthiest neighborhoods with the most homogeneous populations. And from the point of view, uh, managing the mortgage crisis, it was not a terrible policy from the point of view of managing cities and communities. It was catastrophic because what it did was to accelerate the creation of slumped in areas where mortgage money was unavailable for the sale or purchase of housing or for that matter, for the large scale repair of housing. Uh, they did it to a 200. They did the process to 200 American cities in a single year, including new haven across chapel street is class date. Um, this is the case shore home prices story and what's laid out here from the year 2000, uh, to uh, uh, 2000 Shabba.

Speaker 3:          13:23          And

Speaker 1:          13:25          this is when Gatesman talked about case Schiller being a reassuring data series. You look at it between here and here, if you look at a, uh, a five year period or even a six year period, it looks like a process of continued appreciation in home prices. And there was nothing in the data that would have given conventional econometric models, would have triggered the suspicion that the end was nigh. Uh, the chart is also interesting because Cleveland is this line. Yeah. So that Cleveland is, uh, a less extreme story in price appreciation then, but the cases everybody talks about, which, uh, were, uh, Miami and Las Vegas and Los Angeles, uh, this is the same story shown in year on year percentage change.

Speaker 3:          14:39          And, uh,

Speaker 1:          14:43          it actually doesn't add much to our knowledge. Hasn't got it. Skip it.

Speaker 3:          14:47          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          14:49          Uh, this is Cleveland, uh, uh, uh, price appreciation, uh, from 2000 into 2007 compared with the country at large. And the gist is that Cleveland was, uh, not a hot, not a hot city. And it was, it is in that respect. I've got, I've missed a charter. There's a huge story about northeastern industrial cities. Uh, they, uh, by which I mean, uh, virtually all the cities from Saint Louis on the left side to Boston on the right side, uh, they all had their takeoff in the middle of the 19th century. They were all going almost vertical, uh, in the years, 1850 to 1900, 1910, uh, by 1920, they're growth rates slowed down almost to almost to zero. Uh, and we're, uh, fluctuated wildly during the depression years recovered briefly in World War II and then which sharply south from 1950 on a new haven's case, the strength of the inner city economy forums and almost perfect arc with the starting point in 1840, the peak in 1950 and the bottom in about 1990 and there's actually been a little bit of recovery since, but Cleveland is a classic industrial city. It is the place where standard oil set up its first large refining plants. It was an at vantage point in transportation because it was an intersection between very high quality east, west freight rail and Great Lakes shipping. And it when rail became subordinated to trucking, uh, and when suburban development became dominant over the reuse of industrial urban neighborhoods, Cleveland suffered mightily.

Speaker 1:          17:19          This income map of Cleveland where median incomes under 22,700 are shown in the darkest a rust tone, uh, is where the case takes place. The green.is approximately the location of Slavic village. I wouldn't swear to it or argue with yon if he said move it three or four degrees of the compass north or east or south or, but it's right about there. And it is on the edge of a large post industrial working class, uh, neighborhood or more mega neighborhood in a declining industrial city.

Speaker 3:          18:07          Well, there's the great art

Speaker 1:          18:12          and the concentration of subprime lending in Cleveland, shown in the darkest tones here, includes the neighborhood we're talking about. And then there's Posner on page two 84. I hope all of you have memorized page two 84. It's worries apportioning blame, but all, although the financiers grabbed the primary responsibility for the depression, that's his name for the recession. I do not think they can be blamed. I tell it a blame for it. Implying moral center. Any more than one can blame a lion for eating a zebra. Capitalism is Darwinism. Pretty dark interpretation.

Speaker 3:          19:06          Uh, and Nancy, can we, how do we go? Here we go. Room controls were from you. You'd Mod. Okay. That's good to screen to go away. Yeah. Jennifer. Yes.

Speaker 1:          19:49          So travel with letting me learn your name. You get cold called. Um, there's a story in this where a local broker, um, ends up being sentenced to prison. Do you remember that part of it or not? Okay. Mark, can you give us a little recap on mark?

Speaker 4:          20:09          Uh, Mark Kellogg, uh, submitted fraudulent data for about 70 homes and are somehow ended up, I'm not sure the process of flipping a house exactly, but he did it to about 70 homes and they all ended up defaulting on the loans

Speaker 1:          20:28          people. So, um, Mark Shin would be, would it be what? Let's try somebody else. What's mark? Well, if mark were a, a relative of yours and you had to have Thanksgiving dinner with him while he was on furlough from Ohio state penitentiary, what topic would you want it to reflect on?

Speaker 3:          21:01          Ethical topic.

Speaker 1:          21:04          I'm gonna take a shot at this.

Speaker 3:          21:08          MMM.

Speaker 5:          21:09          Perhaps just kind of as, as you can get it though, as he just kind of mentioned with the topic of, uh, kind of preying on zebras, um, perhaps something like that. And that kind of using a position to kind of benefit from people at a, at a much kind of like position in you and kind of did their detriment into your game.

Speaker 1:          21:33          Okay. So the buyers on your telling are zebras. Uh, okay. Uh, I, that's, that's a plausible possession. If the buyers are zebras, are the zebras in any way blame of bubble in this story?

Speaker 3:          21:55          What do you think?

Speaker 4:          21:57          Um, it's possible that they're blaming bull if they were given good information. But in this situation it seems like they were given completely wrongful information, led to believe that it was true. Okay. Like a plausible person believe that.

Speaker 1:          22:13          Okay. Uh, can you, can we tell a story where the home buyer where it's plausible that blaming the buyers?

Speaker 4:          22:19          Yes. Okay. Where are they should have known that they, if they don't have the income to pay the okay on it and they weren't there, they were going to default. And so therefore they should have not bought the home.

Speaker 1:          22:33          Thank you. And uh, are there instances where people are encouraged to lie about their incomes?

Speaker 5:          22:44          So I think there's a big problem with a lot of these jumbos sub prime mortgages they call them where people were buying really big houses or second houses with subprime mortgages. And in that case it is their fault because they were just being greedy. Right. Okay. Trying to take, yeah. Trying to either falsify documents or go for the type of loans that would allow them to get the second properties without really having enough to back it up.

Speaker 1:          23:08          Okay. So, uh, that's the Shin of Shinar pride or gluttony? Not really glad, but it's bricks and mortar. Got me.

Speaker 3:          23:20          Yes.

Speaker 5:          23:22          Um, well there were also a Ninja loans, which I think is a very appropriate acronym because of the sneakiness, but it was an acronym for no income, no job and no assets.

Speaker 1:          23:33          Okay. Ninja, no income, no job, no assets. Why would anyone, anyone encourage another human being to shake an Angelo?

Speaker 3:          23:48          It's an obvious yes.

Speaker 4:          23:52          Well, if you're one of the three steps that profits off the fee of making, of like having that long go through, then you don't even, it doesn't really matter to you if it or it doesn't matter to you if it default as much as it matters to the buyer or to the bank.

Speaker 1:          24:06          Okay. So long as you can successfully pass it along to the next step, you collect the fee and your home dry no matter what happened.

Speaker 3:          24:17          That's great. And you're wrapping up.

Speaker 1:          24:27          Sure. Okay. Now let's stop and see what we got for a diagram here. Sharon,

Speaker 4:          24:33          unpack, unpack your dining room. Okay, so I guess I knew you'd be good at diagram our game of Pictionary. So I'm trying to out what exactly went wrong. And I would start with a home and I'm the Slavic community and then I would end maybe here with like bank of Scotland and um, between quote unquote Joe six pack, um, purchasing a home with $22,000 yearly income, which was the average I saw that was misrepresented as being worth about 80,000, um, from the broker who works with her

Speaker 3:          25:15          that

Speaker 4:          25:16          I figured we could have everyone fill in the parts for me. Like how, how do we get from the home to the, um, international crisis.

Speaker 1:          25:26          Okay. And so who's, who's the, we have another mic or not.

Speaker 3:          25:30          Yeah. Um,

Speaker 1:          25:33          what's the next step in the chain to the, to the right of broker here?

Speaker 3:          25:43          Oh,

Speaker 5:          25:43          probably someone will give a rating for this mortgage so that the broker will be able to package it with other mortgages and sell it to an investment banker.

Speaker 1:          25:53          Okay. So there's a credit rating story, but there's also another story that's closer to ground level

Speaker 3:          26:03          concerns. The house itself,

Speaker 5:          26:08          we need a evaluation of the house, like what the house value of these.

Speaker 1:          26:13          Okay. And there's, thank you. There's a saying in real estate, uh, praise as an instructor and uh, that and, and it's, and it's not altogether false that whoever hires, think about the incentives. You're an appraiser and a tall here hires you to do an appraisal and you're going to get a fee of 1100 for doing it. And Paul lets it be known that he thinks this house really ought to be worth something north of $200,000 and you go out in the field, do the copper bowls and the number comes up at 140.

Speaker 3:          27:01          What

Speaker 1:          27:02          Tim, what thought might cross your mind if you were, I understand in your case of course wouldn't, but uh, in my case, uh, Mike, Cross your mind to trust tall and just go with a $200,000 prediction. Okay. And the, and the second step in the reasoning is, um, no one will ever know no one let her know. And next time tall goes to the yellow pages for an appraisal to you, you'll come to you or he's more likely to, he said, damn site, less likely to if you under cut steel.

Speaker 3:          27:37          Uh,

Speaker 1:          27:40          I'll tell you a Yale story about appraisal. Uh, when I was in city government, we leased high street and Wall Street to Yale for 99 years. We were broke, we needed money.

Speaker 3:          27:51          And uh,

Speaker 1:          27:54          the mayor sat down with Benno Schmidt and Petros said, well, the university will handle the appraisal for you.

Speaker 3:          28:03          Yeah, they did.

Speaker 1:          28:05          Uh, the two streets together leased for $1 million for 99 years. It should have been a lot more than that. Uh, and there were those in city government who thought I was the guy who got the number that low. I was actually pulling hard on making that, making the number at least one zero or a year and a half higher. I had allowed the law school to build that gorgeous underground library cause the ground rights went with the street.

Speaker 3:          28:38          Um, yeah.

Speaker 1:          28:40          So appraise has instructed, this is a, uh, an important component in the store. Um, we got the appraiser there. So who else was involved and what are their incentives?

Speaker 3:          29:02          What are, what's the tall

Speaker 6:          29:11          well, you, you've got the local bank that's actually doing the lending. Okay. Um, and uh, they probably look at a fee for the loan that they take and then if they can package it and sell it off to someone else. Okay. They don't end up with a loan on their books, so they could probably care less how it performs over the long run.

Speaker 1:          29:31          Okay. So the terrific. So the lender, the lender is, uh, also feed driven and is, uh, is inclined to think that she or he can escape accountability. Uh, when the property defaults, it defaults. And why would that be? What are the what, what do we turn these loans into it? The next stage?

Speaker 5:          30:02          That's what I do have to talk to you. I don't think we know you've talked once. Go ahead. Um, usually it's sold off to a big investment bank or basically a financial powerhouse when they pulled off mortgages into these giant collateralized, that obligations.

Speaker 1:          30:18          Okay. She d o s famous acronym. You want to add anything to that? Okay. Uh, so you've got the banks creating these huge bundles and the bundles. How, what story could you, could you tell just say that bundling these mortgages from all across the country might be a good thing from the economist point of view? Is there anything you could say

Speaker 5:          30:57          vibe to it? Diversifies the risk for it, diversifies the risk? Say a little more? Um, well presumably the people who are packaging them can take out a bunch of, you know, do a lot of, uh, financial analysis and determined that the risk of the number of defaults, um, would be lower than the benefit of the people actually paying their loans back. So the people who take out the, uh, the package would have a favorable risk return. Okay. Uh, and part, where you about to say something? Um, I think it also increases the market of potential buyers because now rather than owning a mortgage and having to deal with an investor one on one, uh, you have, uh, a pooling and servicing agreement that has a company as a servicer handles all the collection of payments and just reaching up money into different investments.

Speaker 1:          31:45          Okay. So you've got, you've got an institutional mechanism that makes this work relatively smoothly. Um, and

Speaker 3:          31:57          yeah,

Speaker 1:          31:57          you're interested when you create these bundles in having the risks on relatively have relatively low correlation with one another. You what, what would be a bad bundle is one where we can know that some of the mortgages are you faulting and infer from that, that lots of others are likely to fall. And a bundle that was geographically concentrated on Slavic village for example, would have that second characteristic and that would be a bad thing. So there is a story about

Speaker 5:          32:36          risk management that

Speaker 1:          32:40          makes that work. Now are the agencies like Moody's, these outfits that Judge Credit worthiness of companies and other and other financial intermediaries, are they in this story anywhere? I don't know if they yawn. Does Moody's get into your case? I don't know.

Speaker 3:          33:00          I think I found it.

Speaker 1:          33:07          Okay. So, uh, everybody know what Moody's and and its rivals. Do anybody want to help us with that?

Speaker 3:          33:20          Barback here it comes. I'm slow. Pray.

Speaker 5:          33:36          Moody's and its rivals are essentially collect a fee from anyone who wants to spin off and asset or debt obligation to actually rate the soundness of the security for what it's supposed to be beside a rating like AAA or single. Okay.

Speaker 1:          33:51          And if I'm Yale, is it a trip? What was triplet? And I think we're now AA. Um, what's a triple ae? What's the advantage of a AAA rating?

Speaker 5:          34:01          Uh, if you have a higher rating, then that means you can get a lower cost of capital. So if you actually want to raise some money, right, you can raise it for a lot less.

Speaker 1:          34:10          So reduces the cost of capital and it therefore has great value to you. Now, if you could bribe movies, you know, if you were completely a moral and you could bribe Moody's to make something a trip away when it was really being, uh, it would be worth paying a lot, right? The, the actual economic value of those ratings is Hume what keeps Moody's honest?

Speaker 3:          34:52          Okay.

Speaker 5:          34:54          Oh, the reputation, the fact that they are years kind of made sure that the ratings that they're given actually safe investments.

Speaker 1:          35:03          Okay. Well, and, and in general, people on the buy side are going to want the rating agencies to tell the truth and people on the sell side will be ambivalent about that. So they're right there, there are cross pressures there. And there is a patent evidence of grade inflation in the ratings that these firms produce.

Speaker 3:          35:35          Uh,

Speaker 1:          35:36          does that you

Speaker 3:          35:40          tall?

Speaker 1:          35:41          Not really. No. Because they get paid by the sell side, not by the buy side. Absolutely. So they are doing, they are in a sense appraising as instructor. And that's a pretty scary part of this whole thing. The, uh,

Speaker 1:          36:03          let's reach all the way back to Adam Smith for a minute and Smith's story, not just of the invisible hand, but of the general, generally benign working in markets in everything Smith says is embedded at basic norm of truth. That I'm not selling you a false mirage of a loaf of bread. I'm selling you an actual loaf of bread. I am not selling you a coffee or assumptions. Looks like coffee. I'm Sonia coffee and the basic accountability in bilateral trade where you're buying something from me or I'm buying something from you. We keep each other honest, right? Where it's two parties and there's no information asymmetry, right? Where there are two parties with symmetrical information. The most foundational aspect of a market system is that buyer and seller are equipped to keep each other honest. And where there is a huge information asymmetry, we invent things like Moody's or appraisal of real estate as a substitute, a way of creating or simulating information symmetry. But if a third party agencies act like sellers to the side that pays them, the information asymmetry is actually made worse, right? And the case, the, the strongest piece for increased government regulation of, uh, the finance industry generally actually is the difficulty of policing the police of tracking the integrity of estimates put out there by people who are in the business of correcting information asymmetries.

Speaker 3:          38:24          MMM.

Speaker 1:          38:30          Uh, young. Um, are there aspects of the that you would urge

Speaker 7:          38:36          us to pay greater attention to? Okay.

Speaker 8:          38:41          Well, first of all on the, uh, on the kind of AAA story, and this may not be in the case per se, uh, but it's certainly part of the thing. Not only is there a nice little boots, coffee capital if you get rated AAA, but there are certain funds in certain buyers like money market funds and other funds that only dive AAA Bob, right? So once you've crossed that threshold, you were just counting the number of people, uh, and, and possible purchasers of your funds. Because if you put money in a mark and money market fund, do you want to reasonably liquid investment? You want to reasonably assured return, uh, things are not supposed to be risky investments and therefore money market funds, all kinds of other funds are limited to AAA bonds. So getting to that AAA level, what was really important, uh, to say something, even though I'm not a big fan of their performance in this case, but in terms of Moody's and Fitch and everything, the collusion doesn't, there doesn't have to be explicit collusion in the sense that if I give you this bond to rate, I will never raise your vibe again unless you give the a AAA rating.

Speaker 8:          39:57          What happened in this case is the Moody's and Fitch and others without fairly explicit guidelines on what they consider it to be turned away. So you're the bond package or the IPA and you're bringing all of the together, all these mortgages and you say, I have to reach a kind of 15% threshold level where it's 15% over collateralize or I have to buy cds, which are um, uh, the default swaps in order to ensure this investment and getting over that AAA. Huh? You do exactly what you need to do to get that AAA rating. And what happened when the crisis hit was we had all of these people who are just over the AAA rating and they, uh, I mean with, with them just over, you don't have a spread and you don't have to kind of a usual probability distribution. All of these guys who are creating these CDOs knew exactly the kind of where the finish line was and when, just a step over that to make sure that they were good at the AAA ratings. So, uh, the fact that they were not very well understood that kind of the historic data went back three years and they felt very confident in doing stuff with three years of data. Uh, I think that's kind of an interesting way because when you're looking for active collusion, the expect that I didn't see bars, you know, uh, trading kind of information and, and, and dollars in Brown paper envelopes. And sometimes it's, it's, it's not that explicit. There are ways that gaming the system without having anyone do anything that even resembles something that sketchy.

Speaker 1:          41:41          So it may be that legitimate cheating, cheating in a good blue suit is more dangerous than cheating shady or setting with sr or,

Speaker 8:          41:59          or, or, you know, cornea love that's really untested by a heck of a lot of data. Also a bad idea. And, and, and I to go on, I, I'm actually kind of surprised given that we're at an elite university with lots of people with connections to Wall Street in some way or another that everyone thought the Zebra was the people buying the houses. Uh, if you look at the data and you have mark Kellogg's kind of purchase lists there, if you look at the data, you begin to notice not only is there a pattern in who the appraiser is, but there are patterns as to who the buyer is. We have this one buyer here and I'm just looking at it in a 40 year period, bought five houses, six houses, all with the same broker, all with the same appraiser. Uh, we'd go down and there are others at seven or eight times, just look at the names and they repeat them, the samples.

Speaker 8:          42:59          So I would put the question back here. Who, who's the, uh, who's the lion and who's the Zebra in this case? Was it the I dance? I mean, they were relying on these boats in Cleveland should do a reasonable job in a phrasing in, in putting out the, uh, thing. And in the end, that's what Lynn, in each of those formulas that I was talking about, the fact that, okay, you have houses that are phrased at this much and historically they fall, but let's say a 10% rate, but they didn't take into account the fact that you have people who are just figuring the system. I mean, going in a six month period of buying a house at 25,000 and selling it at 85,000 with no evidence of any remodel, uh, and it just goes on and you can go through this data sell sheet is actually kind of fascinating.

Speaker 8:          43:54          If you want to have a plate, kind of junior detective, if you want to look to see how these kinds of patterns in the data, and you can look at the data adult, you know, this can't be right, this really happy, right, in terms of who's selling and how much you're selling to things for. And especially when you look at the story of Cleveland and wasn't in a hot market. And you can't come up with a story of like you might for Miami or Las Vegas and say, well, you know, a lot of old people are going to move here and, and that's a good reason. Land values are going up. I'm up with a story like that for Cleveland. Uh, I mean, it's a wonderful town. Don't get me wrong, but, uh, there isn't

Speaker 1:          44:32          worse yet. They've got the Indians and the Brown.

Speaker 8:          44:34          Yes. Uh, it's fish and they had the rock and roll hall of fame, but there's really, you know, it's hard to come up with a story. So why aren't we getting into this kind of a occurrence and so on. So, you know, that's a point. I,

Speaker 5:          44:53          so, so one thing that I saw was I felt like the Zebra would really represents, um, potential profits and economic profit more than an individual in itself. So if you look from each of the actors point of views, the zebra is really what they're, the profits that they're going after under the system that's set up. Uh, so rationally each player is acting in their own best interests, but in the end, in the big picture ends up where it hurts the system as a whole. Um, and so I think that like, it's very easy to want to put blame on a specific party or a specific group, but it's just very difficult to do because everybody's working under the incentives that has been created for that party.

Speaker 8:          45:34          And, and they offer another potential. The drugs are considered when she is, uh, the boats. Let's say you're buy one of these houses and is a house next to you, has been bought for 25,000, sold for 85,000 with no visible improvements. You bought your home for 30,000. You put another 40,000 names, you have a legitimately $70,000 house. How are you going to deal with in that house next to you is boarded up, it goes into foreclosure because someone has been playing the appraisal. Cancun. So there is an externality here to consider to of the overall community.

Speaker 1:          46:13          So who's got an idea about how to fix all this? Would it be drumming? Truth telling him to three year olds.

Speaker 8:          46:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          46:28          Would it be yes.

Speaker 8:          46:32          Okay.

Speaker 5:          46:34          I think there's a huge gap and government oversight, um, particularly with regard to the ratings, uh, that, I mean when, when Moody's is, although they all, they have the cross pressures that you talked about, but when Moody's is being paid by one side and not the other, and even if even if we assume that they're all inflate it and therefore it was down to road with them to be sort of suspect without, without some third party that's completely disinterested at like the government coming in and telling you how to rate it, you're not going to get, you're not going to get truthful writings in there for the whole system falls apart from the top.

Speaker 1:          47:07          Yup. That sounds right at mine. One of my own inclinations would be to compel the initial lenders to hold a given percentage equity in each, each loan, um, so that they can't utterly ignore a probability of default.

Speaker 3:          47:31          Um, on Monday I'm going to, uh,

Speaker 1:          47:44          Monday is a wildcard in the syllabus and I had planned to use, use it to do the Maurice. Um, the more he's business plan. Uh, but it turns out that there are people who think it would be a terrible idea if the Morrie's business plan and got the Yale Daily News. And while we're 110 really good friends, I think I'd be nuts to use that at this stage. We'll do that at the end of the semester when it won't be, when it will not cause bloodshed somewhere in the system. Um, and we'll do a, uh, I, I'd like to do two things with Monday. One is a poster case on Vioxx the drug, which was a Cox two inhibitor and did a lot of good for people like me with knee trouble, but it killed a few of them and there were hard feelings and a vast avalanche of lawsuits. And we'll look at that. I'm also going to post federalist paper number 10. Can I hands up if you've read federalist 10 k no American, nobody who's going to do business in this country should fail to get the idea of the fundamental design of the American political system, which is spelled out in only a few thousand words there. See, on Monday.
