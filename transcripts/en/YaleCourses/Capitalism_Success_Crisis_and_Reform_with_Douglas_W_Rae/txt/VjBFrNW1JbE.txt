Speaker 1:          00:01          Well, this is what a well worn copy of white tiger looks like. The style of it is pretty striking. Anybody want to take a shot at other novels that reminds you of yes content and not to cover. Okay. Well it reminds me of, it reminds me of someone. Rashid has been nice children. Okay. That's, that's one interesting suggestion. Sophie Quinten. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:45          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:46          What do you think?

Speaker 3:          00:48          Um, what do I think of the book or is this related to the warm call email and you send it the morning? Yeah. Well, um, in the back of white tiger they sort of a reading group discussion with the author and one of the things the author says that it's kind of interesting is that, um, his inspiration for Ballarat was, um, it, it, he sort of a compensate the character that came out of the author's experience just hanging out in slums and train stations and in servant's quarters and listening to what basically the underclass of India are saying and how they are thinking. Um, and it sort of, it's interesting that ballroom who's such an angry character is the embodiment of something very real. That Attica Adiga I guess, um, felt talking to people on the street.

Speaker 1:          01:35          Right. Okay. That's good. Um, in the, he also mentions three American novelists in the, in the back. Did you notice them? No, I did not. Okay. Um, well it's interesting. The um, are the influences on white tiger or three black American writers of the Post World War II era, Ralph Ellison, James Baldwin and Richard. Right. So, um, it has, um, are many ways to look at it. It is written in a very straightforward style that is, each paragraph is pretty straight forward. The sub text about how it's being told is a little more complicated. And one of the other things she says in the, in the back, which, and this goes to the point Sophie made, uh, is that while, uh, none of the characters or incidents are copied out of journalism, which is the authors business. Uh, all of them are meant to be representative of something real in Indian wife. So that the book is literally fiction, but has a purpose, like many of the best works of fiction as a purpose of describing something, uh, that is very real. Are there ways in which fiction can do a better job than social science of telling the truth about a country?

Speaker 1:          03:18          Anybody got a thought about that?

Speaker 2:          03:20          Yes.

Speaker 4:          03:23          Well, it's an art form and something like social science can't really say, well this makes me feel this or this is like the nuance of that. And that's where art plays in. And I mean, I'm also, I mean, it's mass media too and a lot of ways so you can reach a lot more people through this and have it easily understood,

Speaker 1:          03:39          okay, it's mass media, but it actually does something that most nonfiction written by academics can't do. Right? Economists, political scientists, people like that by and large, a little wooden than religion, a little category bound, a little obsessed with methodology. And this book covers a huge swath of a very complicated aspects of a society, which, uh, as far as I can tell his top half dozen in the way of complexity in the world. Right. I mean the structure of the historical structure of India and the incredible rate of economic and Sociological Change, uh, have very few, uh, equals elsewhere. Um, Divia if I got that name right. Yeah, yeah. Um, again, and again, the concept of out of the darkness comes up in the book, help us try to understand that.

Speaker 4:          04:52          Yeah. So I think it's sort of literally and figuratively the darkness of India, the parts of India that has sort of been left behind and all the development and globalization, um, where there's no electricity. So like literally it's dark when the sun goes down. Um, and where there's also a lack of like basic necessities like sanitation, like proper food. Um, and I think also the darkness of sort of corruption and bribery and like theoretically there being resources, but those getting funneled into the hands of like, for example, um, like the great socialists who is, you know, campaign to sort of lift the darkness out of the darkness, but ended up just getting sort of sucked into the bribery of people in the upper caste and the town. And, um, continuing to take advantage of like the lower caste. Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:37          From the point of view of a village India deepen the darkness. Uh, is it clear one way or the other, whether the economic miracle and maybe too strong a word, but the incredible progress overall development that's been made since about 1990 is a good thing or a bad thing?

Speaker 4:          06:04          I think like, I think it's, it's kind of goes both ways and I think he talks about it and that, um, I guess he sort of talks about it as the difference between the north and the south or what like his, the two cities he was in. Um, it, when development gets kind of entrenched in corruption, that ends up being a bad thing and ends up taking advantage of people at the bottom. But I think to me it seemed a little optimistic that it can be a good thing in places where it's been done properly.

Speaker 1:          06:38          Okay. And do you have it in the back of your mind an idea or two about what doing capitalism properly mean?

Speaker 4:          06:45          Well, not really. I guess I'll Betcha. Do you know not corruption? Not Bribing policemen.

Speaker 1:          06:54          Okay. Not Corruption, not bribery.

Speaker 5:          06:57          I mean, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          07:01          There are, I guess a lot of things, but, okay. Let's go on and we'll find of,

Speaker 5:          07:06          okay.

Speaker 1:          07:12          Uh, Sudhir yeah, there's a passage in, I think it's the first night in the book.

Speaker 5:          07:21          How about, uh,

Speaker 1:          07:23          I think it's for animals, my right, who represent people. Can you help us with?

Speaker 6:          07:30          Sure. I think the first point is that a, do you guys making a statement about a, and quite unabashedly landowners is animals, uh, who in this case quite literally feed off Lakshman guards, physical and human resources. Um, the other obvious point is that the animals that do you get chooses to represent the landlords aren't particularly glamorous. I think he has a view of land and is tocky cross lazy. Um, and it's clear that, you know, one of the few reasons or main reasons that they hold a position of power in society is they've probably descended from families of landowners who have a long history of exploiting and extorting from the war.

Speaker 1:          08:10          Okay. Now here's an interesting parallel. If you think about the, about Clark farewell to alms. Uh, one of the big lessons there is that land is the primary basis of, uh, economic return in premodern societies and loses its relative standing with development. So if a degas is right, are the stork, the Raven, the wild boar, and who else? Oh, and the Buffalo, uh, are they basically fossils of a previous era grasping for the last straws of a power base? It will go, or given the nature of rural India will lay persist in that position. Generation after generation, you think,

Speaker 6:          09:08          you know, it's hard for me to kind of identify that trajectory of India's development. She says, I don't know how much of, I guess, I mean really and yet is large, makes a large chunk of the, uh, the country and the economy for what it's worth. So I think there are probably, um, in the foreseeable future, there's probably a very good chance that characters like these four will still retain a good deal of influence in those spheres. I mean, obviously, um, you know, corporations are making their way into these, uh, into rural areas and setting up innovation camps and, um, large offices. But to the extent that India has, um,

Speaker 7:          09:51          uh,

Speaker 6:          09:51          the rural base is strong, I think these people will thrive.

Speaker 1:          09:55          Okay. And if, uh, if capitalism seeks economies of scale as it's wanting to do a small landholding, uh, will be, uh, eventually, uh, undermined by large scale land holding and agricultural development, uh, on a vast scale or that's, that would be the textbook hypothesis. Uh, if you look at what's happening in Brazil, for example, a development on the scale of farms, uh, 25 or 35 miles square, 25 by 25, say, uh, is commonplace. And maybe India is different. And the reason it may be different is that the indigenous, the density of indigenous rural population is much higher. And, uh, the, the process by which land would be aggregated, it may happen quite a lot slower. Maximillian uh, where the title of the Book Come From and how do you understand

Speaker 7:          11:17          he calls it the white tiger because, um, by Ron stands out of all of the other servants, like why Tiger stands out. Oh, by tiger stand out of there. I don't know other animals who are not albinos because they're so rare. And, um, there's one incident leading up to becoming the white tiger that is, I guess where they are on the wait with the two sons of his masters to bribe the minister. And, um, I run, reaches out to, um, to a beggar intuitively to help him. And he gives him some money and the sons of his master get really angry with them. Um, I'm giving him the money, um, and they start to complain about, um, how Texas they have to pay you and that they're already helping the poor. And um, yeah, that's how he realizes that the entrenched, entrenched inequalities in Indian society will perhaps persist despite India's new prosperity.

Speaker 1:          12:21          Okay. Go ahead. And do you remember the part about the school house early on where there's a surprise inspection? Does anybody remember this?

Speaker 5:          12:34          I drawing a blank here over there?

Speaker 6:          12:40          Yeah. Um, in the beginning I believe in, there's a surprise inspection and he's, uh, uh, the inspector comes in and asks the students a bunch of different questions and really nobody is able to give any, uh, any good answer except for a ballroom. And a, he then asked him, I guess he asks him about a certain question. I bill, I forget exactly what the question is, but the answer was that it's a white tiger. It's a think that is the most unique. Okay. So he gets named white tiger for being uniquely talented in a situation where talent is not being developed. Right. And how does the school school room operate? Do you remember that?

Speaker 4:          13:22          Well, it's interesting that ball armed and actually blame the teacher because I guess the teacher would steal the uniforms and all the resources that came. But I think at one point farm even says like, well, I mean, no one really blames him because his payment also gets taken by someone else. Um, so the teacher, there's just like a chain of corruption that ends in the teacher basically stealing the resources that were meant for the kids and just sleeping all day or, um, and while the kids do whatever. Okay.

Speaker 1:          13:55          No, quite often there's a mention of the fact that the teacher was snoring. Well, right. The students were supposed to be learning somehow from one another. Uh, and you're right in that the, I think the narrator says something like, um, those who live in a dung heap can't be expected to smell well. Right? And so there's a kind of environmental explanation, um, social and social environmental explanation. And W why do we think is this, is this, uh, uh, man bites dog story or is corruption of a fairly major issue in Indian society? Who's got an opinion

Speaker 5:          14:41          back?

Speaker 4:          14:45          I, yeah, I think it's a fairly major issue because even when you make the transition into like the lightness in the book, you still get severe corruption of course with, um, you know, the ballrooms boss going to give the big bags of money to the government. Um, so I think it's corruption that pervades every level and kind of the light is a little bit of a deceptive name for what ballroom moves into because even at the height of his success, the only way he can succeed is by killing someone then by paying off the policeman.

Speaker 1:          15:16          Okay. Now that's, that's elegantly put, but it's evidence from fiction about fiction. So what the judgment I'm looking for is, is his claim that the book represents Broglie truthful patterns in the society or not you buy it or not?

Speaker 4:          15:36          Well, I mean having, um, India myself several times and having many friends from there, I definitely heard, you know, considerable, um, stories of corruption. I mean, I, I'm not in a position to judge the society as a whole, but it seems like it would have an element of truth to it.

Speaker 1:          15:52          Okay. Has anybody glanced at one of the world rankings from say, Transparency International or other organizations which have VAT evaluate levels of corruption? Okay. The Socratic method stops here. Uh, India is near the top of the world table in a corruption as a per an issue perceived by people in business as problematic. Anybody with substantial experience, one of contradict or elaborate on this point? Oh yes, we need a mic in the middle

Speaker 8:          16:42          for lots of people staying in India, especially doing the sister corruptions almost become a VA light. So they see, they'd rather call the system, flexible them calling it corrupt. So if you want to get a government sanction, which was only take three months, you can get it done in three bay, three days if you pay an additional amount and that's the premium that's a pregnant, that's not corruption. So for a lot part of the society, it's a flexible system rather than a corrupt system.

Speaker 1:          17:11          Okay. And a good American economists would call it

Speaker 8:          17:16          the inefficiencies in the market. So you just exploiting them. Yep.

Speaker 1:          17:18          Inefficiencies due to rent seeking, right. Rent seeking. I love that concept.

Speaker 5:          17:26          MMM.

Speaker 1:          17:30          Danielle. Right on the w are you hear Danielle? Hi, I'm Dr Ram. Pondi is it Pindi something like that. Something like that. Tell us about that incident in the book and give us something about what you think it means.

Speaker 4:          17:46          Okay, so I'm on page 41 of the book, the theirs when they're all sitting, um, in, and the white tiger has taken his father to the hospital and they're sitting in the waiting room waiting for a doctor who won't come. And an old Muslim man start songs story. Um, excuse me about this fictitious doctor, doctor ran panty and talks about how the great socialists sells off plots of like, um, like districts to doctors and the doctors, bodies, districts almost like a feudal system. And then the doctors in those districts will, he'll take part of the salaries from these doctors and then tell them, oh, well now you can just go off and work for a private hospital. You don't have to worry about these people. I'll write it down in my ledger that you've been there. So basically the government is on a totally different strata and all the money or benefits just get written down or written away and these people are left dying or with wounded legs like the Muslim man. And he's just sort of laughing about it. So there's this sense like, um, with the Muslim man and all the people in the waiting room, this sort of laughing about their, their problems or grinding about them because I mean his father dies in the end. Um, ballrooms father dies in the end because this doctor never comes. So the, the corruption and the resources are just

Speaker 5:          19:02          like

Speaker 4:          19:03          strewn about and

Speaker 1:          19:08          that passenger is actually quite polemic all the way it's written, right. It probably overstates right. There were probably a hell of a lot of places where you actually can see the doctor and the doctor does pay attention to people who were supposed to pay attention to. But the general pattern described there. What's wrong with corruption?

Speaker 5:          19:31          Corruption.

Speaker 1:          19:34          I mean there, there are various is people who think corruption is not altogether a bad thing. For example.

Speaker 5:          19:43          MMM.

Speaker 1:          19:45          There are people who write about American cities and say, if you have to choose between corruption and civil service bureaucrats who do everything to the letter of the law, take corruption.

Speaker 5:          19:57          MMM.

Speaker 1:          19:58          An example is a historical example was the Fulton fish market in New York, which was run by the mafia for a long time and read pretty efficiently. I mean, there was some rent seeking, uh, and some violence, but it worked. And then Rudy Giuliani took it over and put in clean bureaucrats to run it. And people thought, well, it may not actually run as well this way now, but there is, there's counterpoint to that. There's a, there's a big themes about why corruption is from the point of view of growth and development and human welfare. Probably not on average a great thing. Did you have a comment? Well, you know, we can always go back to Adam Smith and disregard, but, but not what he's

Speaker 9:          20:48          most famous for. But he, he's, he, he, he kind of gives us a self interest, but it's not this naked isolated form of self interest. You know, he said capitalism only functions upon a foundation of ethical participants and if not, it's brutally, grossly inefficient because you can't get the right information around at the right time.

Speaker 1:          21:10          Terrific. Right. And this is, I mean, this was a huge point in understanding. Smith Smith is a moron, right? Smiths in his own time, his famous book wasn't this, it was a theory of moral sentiments. And Smith is saying articulate shelf interest, frankly pursued within a framework of honest communication within a framework of honest communication and with a government in the background that enforces contract and prohibits fraud within that framework. Self interest creates an upward draft on an economy. But if you take away that framework, the ethical aspects of, of people's beliefs and the proper functioning of the government in enforcing contract and related things and you take all that away, uh, the, the invisible hand story works if anything in reverse and we're inclined to just assume that, um, to, to just march too quickly by, uh, the issue of that fuck, that foundational issue and the eye. If I asked you this, how many of you've done Ben pollocks course on Game Theory?

Speaker 1:          22:40          That's really, I recommend it to all of you. Um, but think, think this or think about this problem. Suppose you are operating in a system where everybody else is willing to lie in order to profit. And at each one of those other people assumes that about all the people she and she or he is dealing with, how do you form a strategy to make a business run? And the answer is that it is virtually impossible because you cannot anticipate the way people, people respond to straightforward incentives and it's a big deal. And getting out of that, out of that dilemma, right. [inaudible] another way to put it is there's a famous uh, philosophical example, one version of which is a sentence, you know, written inside a box which says this sentence is a lie or the sentence in this box is a lie.

Speaker 5:          23:49          Okay.

Speaker 1:          23:49          How do you interpret that? True or false? False. True. True. If false can't get anywhere with that. Very hard to live that way.

Speaker 5:          24:02          Mid back

Speaker 1:          24:07          caste is a really complex cultural structure, which I've read a little about and talked to Indians widdle about and it's obviously important.

Speaker 5:          24:22          Help

Speaker 1:          24:24          help the uninitiated here. I'm a little bit

Speaker 10:         24:26          sure. Um, I did some research last night, but I think I got my most, my most profound revelation. I talked to one of my best friends from Indiana and he gave me an incredible perspective on cast and most of the donors and Dell, but I didn't know about. And so I'm going to go a little bit into the history of cas because it's, it's honestly fascinating. Um, cast actually started out as a really advanced complex system that we see in today's capitalist worlds. It started off as division of Labor started off as promoting specialization. Cast a cast wasn't a bad thing when it first started. It just means that people were specialized in certain traits. For example, we have blacksmiths and we had traders and we had, uh, people in different sectors of the economy here. Similarly, we had castes in India and they weren't, they weren't silent constraining.

Speaker 10:         25:18          They were just indicating what you are best at its division of Labor. So cast actually started degrading or unfortunately, and it's actually, it's actually gone through some evolution. Uh, and this catalyst when the British came, when the British came, they didn't grasp cast as. And the advanced system of division of labor and special relations, they grasp the cast as as as more feudal system. And so they started perpetuating this, this thought that once you're born mcast you're stuck in a cast forever. And that's what started bringing negative connotations towards cast. That's what started making casts constraining. And I guess the best way to put this out, but the, after the British came, it basically started destroying whole people started being born in casts and they started thinking, believing they were relegated to these cast. If you look at the book, um, ball around ended up ended a passenger with the quote that they're only two destinies eat or get eaten up. And that just shows the cast evolved from being an advanced concept of division of labor, of specialization to something that you're constrained to. And I think that today the only thing that separates cast from an advanced capitalist structure is mobility in the casts. And there's not mobility because you're born into a system and you're stuck with it forever. And an American system, for example, if you at least have the hope and the ability to move from cast from, from to trade, from cast

Speaker 4:          26:44          to cast. And I think that's a trend.

Speaker 1:          26:46          Well at the foundation of India as a democracy in 1947, there was a huge emphasis on the downbeat, the untouchables and on making sure that they had opportunities and more to other people. Anybody know anything about that effort?

Speaker 5:          27:06          Yes,

Speaker 4:          27:10          they're the [inaudible] commission, um, started this program where it kind of like afraid of affirmative action here, but much more restricted in the sense of there are numerical quotas. Um, so there are quotas for three types of people. Obcs other backward classes, which is not necessarily as much caster Javi, but more of a economic economic. So a Brahmin, which is the highest caste or also be part of this task. I'm part of the sudden relic designation. If they do not earn as much as they're supposed to, like 10 rupees a month or something like that, then you have all bosies was just scheduled tribes system. And then you also have a schedule caste system, which goes back to the original cast. Now what's really interesting about the caste system, as you know, it was just mentioned that there is no, um, mobility, but in essence there's still differences going on in India right now. So people do move around, can move around, for example, they can go in and out of the OTC category. Um, so that still exist. And then these designations happen in government positions. So in IIT, which is, as you know, Hyundai was from Iot and all these other institutions that are government institutions, like the proportion of the population that is in any of these designations have to have those seats in those institutions.

Speaker 5:          28:18          Go ahead admirably, Duh. Um, uh, Jasmine,

Speaker 1:          28:32          uh, I, I asked Jasmine to think about the passage, which begins with chopping onions unusually early in the morning, and then the discovery switch followed that and what it might tell us about the role of religion. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          28:47          Speech 90 in the white tiger. Um, it talks about like a discount rate of firearm, uh, about the number one driver, uh, Ron per side. And, um, basically he just, uh, he found out that, um, rappers that was, um, a Muslim because he was observing Ramadan and he's not eating, he's chopping up onions in the, yeah. In the dark because he has to fast during today. And so by Ron was able to use this fact as an advantage to him. And, um, basically because the landlord is a Hindu and there is a kind of a, like a religious tension between the Hindu majority and the Muslims and traditional parts of India. So, um, uh, when he, he, uh, he talked to another servant about this and he able to make his way to Dell ages because he was using this fat.

Speaker 1:          29:45          Okay. So historically this, this cleavage between Muslim and Hindu has been a huge factor in the history of South Asia. Yes. Um,

Speaker 3:          29:56          basically I guess a lot of Hindus, I thought that Muslims with like an invader culture and also in, um, like the 1947, uh, when they had, uh, well basically India was subdivided into Pakistan, a Muslim, uh, subcontinent and a Muslim country and the like now modern India. So

Speaker 1:          30:22          go ahead. And the, the other layer is captured in the line in the book. There is no hatred like that of the number two servant for the number one server. Right. And that close conflict, uh, we, we recognize you see that everywhere around here. You're seeing even on the faculty, um, um, Susie park. Yeah, that's the question I was going to ask you about, about um, serving sure about hospital need to servant and so on.

Speaker 4:          31:06          Well, I guess, um, um, well basically it's kinda similar to serve in hostility to masters I think. Cause like when you look at like the person to person, like you're not actually hating the person themselves, but more like, because, um, you're, um, like he has this kind of like bitterness at the system itself. But then like in some part of the book it said like they don't, they're really like blamed up bigger government like the nation itself, but they're more about like play me like the local like smaller like level and like the landlords. Um, so it's Kinda like, um, they're like the white tiger was more into like hitting the number one driver rather than like the system itself.

Speaker 1:          31:58          Right. And so the idea is the displacement of hostility to the huge system on to the little system within the household that fas, um, the, there's a, I think one of the great lines in the book is the one about the coupe, the coupe, the chicken coop is garnered from where them, what's all that? I mean, the way I interpreted it was it's more like of a social construct where, I mean if you just look at the back of the book, it says Blah Blah. Malawi is a complicated man, servant, philosopher, etc. But when you're inside the coop, you're only thinking of how can I be a better servant? That's a social construct whereby, I mean we can even relate it to the hatred of 71 72 to serve a one is because the servant, you're not thinking of becoming a master, what you're, what you're aspiring to a certain one. And it just scares you to get out of that social construct. And the only way to get out of it as soon as it was resolved or something extreme like killing your master. Okay. So that often the victims of a huge, hugely oppressive situation, uh, are hostile mortar mortar people who are their peers or near peers then to people who are their vast superiors. And that's a pretty good generalization actually. Um, Sebastian,

Speaker 2:          33:27          there we are.

Speaker 1:          33:32          Tell us about the car accident.

Speaker 6:          33:36          All right. So, uh, in page one 37, there's a Pinky, madam decides that she wants to drive. Um, it tells the driver to get out, then she comes back. She was very drunk at this point, comes back, gets in the car, tells the driver to get back in the car and then drives off. And he hits, uh, something. At first we don't know what it is. We are quickly discovered it's a child. Um, and everyone's kind of in shock. Uh, and I think, I don't know if you want me to say more of the details of the accident, but the biggest implication is that then by Rahm is asked to take the blame for this, for this accident that, that his master's wife, uh, committed. Um, and instead of thinking, uh, of how he can not take the blame, he kind of starts automatically assuming, how am I going to survive in jail? What am I going to do survive? Um, and I think it goes back to that thing that you were just talking about in the rooster coop where it's just absolute perpetual servitude. Uh, it's kind of very much intrinsic and mark.

Speaker 1:          34:42          Okay. Go ahead now. And, and what the, what this is a straight forward, straight forward criminal corruption, right. And this criminal act that the, uh, the cosh Koppel are commanding and the, the white tiger basically basically just lives with it, right. And later in the book. And where are you later in the book? And, um, the concept of rage gets to be center stage. I think on page one 96 does it help us with that and what's going on with that? Well, I think to a certain extent, he realized that he realizes that the only way for him to escape kind

Speaker 4:          35:38          of from the rooster goop is to do something extreme. And one thing that he talks about when he describes the roost whole rooster analogy is that like he mentioned family as part of that explanation. He says that family is like the thing, little cool, sorry. The family is the thing that keeps you in the group. And so I think like, he needs a really powerful emotion to counteract the family ties in order to break free.

Speaker 1:          36:02          Okay. So he's in two different coercive networks wanting to do with his own family at another to do with, uh, the, the family, which employs him. Um, uh, Drake right here. Yeah. Um, the most dramatic passage in the book has to do with the, you the ulterior uses of a whiskey bar,

Speaker 11:         36:33          but at ballroom and uses the bottle to kill the son of his employer and do use, he does this to steal the money that, uh, a shock was going to use to bribe officials and he sort of goes off it, takes it and starts his own life.

Speaker 1:          36:51          Okay. And how do you interpret what he does?

Speaker 11:         36:55          Uh, I saw it as sort of emblematic of the, the new India sort of

Speaker 5:          37:01          Oh,

Speaker 11:         37:04          uh, taking over instead of replacing the old India that a shotgun and his family are sort of representative of, um, he sees the son of a land donor. Uh, he, he's wealthy and he's, he's using his money to try to keep himself in power by bribing these officials. Um, and a shot takes that money or borrow and takes the money and he goes and uses it to sort of start his own business and get himself up to the top.

Speaker 1:          37:28          I think it says an act of entrepreneurship. Right. I know there were huge amount of parody in this.

Speaker 5:          37:37          MMM.

Speaker 1:          37:42          You, how do you judge him for this?

Speaker 11:         37:45          I mean, I, I would say that it was, I wouldn't condone it, but I can, I can sort of understand it. Um,

Speaker 1:          37:54          what'd you go so far as to say justifiable homicide?

Speaker 11:         37:59          No, not justifiable. Right. In the sense that, you know, he, the man that he, he murdered deserved it. But, you know, for him it was the only way to, to break out of the life that he'd been living. And it's, to me, it just sort of, it really captured, um, just how traumatic for our society, a change like monitorization can be. You know, everyone's scrambling to get themselves ahead and in the process, you know, people get stepped on.

Speaker 1:          38:28          Okay. So you see it as a rational act, not an act of range.

Speaker 11:         38:33          Yeah, I think it was definitely a rational act. Um,

Speaker 1:          38:37          but I don't know if that justifies it. Okay. Well, I don't think it justifies it. I, I'm not much on justifiable homicide as a, that's a cultural trope. Um, but it makes it easy to understand, doesn't it? Uh, Amy Chu or in the law school has a book about that begins with a story from her own family in the Philippines and um, in it, her grandmother is murdered by the family show for her and the, um, the police record where motive is recorded as just one word, revenge. And the relationship between people who are completely dependent, servants of arbitrary, uh, families who behave arbitrarily and cruelty. This is a, an ancient story and it's one that's easy to understand. Now let's get back to bigger picture.

Speaker 1:          39:49          Why is ballroom so weak? There's, I had another question. I asked somebody about English language. Who did I ask? Okay, I'll ask myself. Uh, English plays a huge part in the class structure of a society like India and the, let's just list ballrooms, weaknesses economically. One is English is not his first language. His family and the debt to the stork wasn't, yeah, the debt which gets him jerked out of school and which is a constant burden to the family. That's another weakness. He drops out of school because his uncle rips him out of school actually forcefully. Other weaknesses cast. He is not from an advantage task sweet makers. I don't quite understand why that's that disadvantage, but uh, uh, what about the world demographic transition? So world demographic transition bearing down on this young man at all? Yes, because the huge surge of population in the darkness of India creates a devastatingly plentiful supply of unskilled labor so that the market equilibrium price of unskilled labor is very, very low.

Speaker 1:          41:32          And the standards you have to use in treating employees in unskilled or semi semi skilled jobs in order to keep them with you are near zero. Right? Rick Shaw Por Rickshaw pullers have essentially no market power and it has everything to do with demography. It also of course has to do with educational opportunity command of the Lingua Franca of the country, all those things. But when we talk about the demographic transition, it's this, it's this ultimately benign story about going from short, short lives and many babies to long lives and fewer babies over a period of time. But there's a huge coercive aspect of the way it works out during the transition for people who don't have demographic luck. And luck of a luck. Big Time. Luck. Historical luck is a pretty big thing. I'll give you another example. A new haven.

Speaker 1:          42:49          New Haven had very few black citizens before World War II and at the time of World War II when southern agriculture was pushing, uh, labor off the land, most of the black families who ever came to new haven came here in about a 15 year period and they came in search of a industrial employment exactly a decade before that industrial employment collapsed and went, guess where south industrial employment went south seeking lower energy costs and cheaper labor so that the economic, it's of course a much more complex story, but the timing couldn't have been worse and ball roms, timing in demographic history couldn't have been much worse. Now Wednesday's case about Selco, let's hope I can get this to run with sound.

Speaker 2:          44:09          Okay.

Speaker 12:         44:13          Despite rapid economic growth, India has the largest population of poor in the world. It's a mix between the old developed and underdeveloped country and as a 650 million people still on the party line of 650 million people not having access to a proper energy services. And then at two o'clock in the morning at traffic lights you have built begging six year old, 10 year old girls begging with flowers go to Bombay, tough exam and Andrea talking of 8% growth isn't that we're creating a divide. We are dividing that actually going to be a much father social unrest, social unsustainability for the country and for the rest of the developing world.

Speaker 3:          44:58          Frustrated by the disparity between rich and poor. Can we, Shandy has made it his life's work to create sustainable solutions to bridge this gap in 1995 who each founded Soko to bring customized solar solutions to India's poor.

Speaker 12:         45:17          The mission of the company would be that we would do interventions that would have a direct impact on the quality of life and in a very sustainable way. I spent quite some time in rural parts of India and then looked at rural electrification.

Speaker 2:          45:35          Okay.

Speaker 3:          45:36          Hamish handy saw firsthand how the rural poor struggles with daily power cuts. Well, many more had no access to electricity. He knew that by getting them affordable solar lighting, he could help improve their lives overall with the right customize solutions. Garment makers could, so, no, sorry.

Speaker 12:         46:01          No. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          46:03          that's triple vendors could sell products after dusk. Children can study longer.

Speaker 2:          46:14          Hello.

Speaker 3:          46:16          And midwives could deliver babies underlined.

Speaker 2:          46:20          Okay.

Speaker 12:         46:21          When you look at an individual household or community or a village or a state, the political dynamics, the social dynamics, the relationship between neighbors was as important as looking at what the product was. You cannot paint everybody with the same brush, don't speak a lot in remote areas. And having centralized solar parks is not going to help them.

Speaker 3:          46:46          Can we just realized that in order to succeed Selco miss develop decentralized energy solutions as one of the first companies to do so in India, Selco entered unchartered territory.

Speaker 12:         47:00          There are no more rules to follow. So the bad years where were not very known, what actually jumped into the realm.

Speaker 2:          47:12          Okay. MMM.

Speaker 1:          47:16          A couple of announcements. In closing the case, the case is in two parts a and B. Both are posted on classes be too. For Wednesday's class on Monday, I will be here only by video. Um, I'm in Washington Monday and I'm going to speak the lecture to a lens and a play it in my own absence. But otherwise, everything would be normal. The, um, uh, and the exams, we'll come back on Wednesday. Uh, my impression is that the grades are outrageously high.
