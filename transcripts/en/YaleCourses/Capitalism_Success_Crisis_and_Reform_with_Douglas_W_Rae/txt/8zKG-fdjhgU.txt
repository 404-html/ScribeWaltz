Speaker 1:          00:02          Okay, let's get started in your current movie over the break that Goldman Sachs get some bad press. Is there, is that, has anybody read the beach in rolling stone? Okay. Okay. We're good at the end mark.

Speaker 2:          00:39          Yeah. I'm Matt [inaudible] Goldman Sachs a, um, and I did this go wrong. It's something along the lines of a grade. Bam. Higher Squid were, that was the jammy. It's anything that smells like money.

Speaker 1:          00:53          I think that's an exact quote. Yeah, we should try that out on power. It also reminds me of a passage in Richard Posner, Xbox, uh, to the effect that we can no more blame the financiers or the record of the credit markets, then we could blame a lion freaking a zebra. And there's an odd, this continuity here. When you look at Goldman Sachs internally, uh, through the eyes of one of its very senior partner, uh, the ethical component is big. There's a huge component about, uh, integrity and meeting one's obligations and delivering the highest quality product on the market. Uh, and at the same time, Goldman is vulnerable to the view that if tour in order to advantage of the tax payers in a recent debacle, now how would they defend themselves? They would say one thing they would say is we didn't want to pick the money. Hey Paulson and told us we had to take the money. But because the stigma which would otherwise fall on the bank, which you talked to, the money would cause further disruption and meltdown. That's one thing they would say. Um, another thing, well, if you noticed what they're doing, the in the way of charitable activities, just lightly, everybody notice, uh, announcement $500 million. It helped to 10,000 small businesses.

Speaker 1:          03:08          Uh, does that strike you as a big gesture or a little desk tell? What do you call or anything?

Speaker 2:          03:23          Oh, has it, what percent of their revenues, profits or even just at an APM bonuses every year? I would say that's very little

Speaker 1:          03:32          gesture. The very little gesture. I agree. From a public relations point of view, if they multiplied it by 10, so it's 5 billion, would it do the more good them? Not the world, not the country down

Speaker 2:          03:53          where zero's probably make, I've made a difference in how the Canadian, um, but I don't know if it would believing up for a cost consciousness.

Speaker 1:          04:06          Okay. So my own intuition is that it wouldn't do them a lot of good that the public doesn't think quantitative way. Some opinion leaders do, but most people, 500 million sounds like an awful lot of money and 5 billion doesn't sound like 10 times as much. Uh, so there are probably, they're probably not far off in the number they chose if the [inaudible] is public probation's, which I think it is. Uh, how many are there people here who think that the government ought to compel them to give back a bigger chunk of capital to put it out there in some charitable way or give it back to the tax payers? Maybe anybody have that view and, okay, so, so you're unanimous, which is rare birth this size. Uh, does that mean that you think there's no ought to it or does it mean, so that the process by which the government would do that strikes you as not a good one? Who's got to rescue me here guys, I'm drowning.

Speaker 2:          05:30          There's a big difference between what we should do. They can make you, I don't think that there's any of using virtual patients should be forced, you know, each charity unless it's like a ad hoc tasks are, and then we applied to them and that seems like a little teenager.

Speaker 1:          05:47          Okay. So if, if probably would violate the constitution if we created the Goldman Sachs recognition act. Um, I agree with that. So we're coming to the end of the course and what I want to do is today to add one more case, one which allows us to look at the interface between capital, the environment and government in the Txu, EDF, a case which you've all looked at and which is structured so that you could invest a whole week if you were willing to trace outs, temporary strand in the, in the, uh, a web page. And then on Wednesday I'm going to do a read a recap of the course as if on a motorcycle, uh, and finish with a shell. Cool case. Quick will form the basis for your final exam as shy and sensitive to account for 70% of the final. I'm sure we'll have a hundred percent attendance during the last 20 minutes of class. And, uh, I'll, I'll get, I'll give you the, give me the, the reading assignment and advantage. It is the, uh, leasing the rain. It's the, the, the reading is the William Finnegan piece from the New Yorker about the privatization of the water supply of Cochabamba Bolivia, a by an American corporation known as Bechtel. Uh, and the essay question, all the formula at the end of class Wednesday asks you to work through that story and as somebody who has learned something about capitalism in this course.

Speaker 2:          07:57          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:58          Okay. So now marrying the devil. And the well, difficulty with this case is that it's full, full backgrounds and I, these are the most important or most immediately important of the acronyms. And, um, can anybody here quickly recite the full lane of every one of these? Who wants to be a show off? I'm sure there are 50 people who can do it in this room. Okay. I'll,

Speaker 1:          08:44          let's put them into three bins. Um, this is the most obscure Texas climate initiative. Uh, and Jim Marsden, who is a video star of the case, is president of that. Uh, and he is the regional head of EDF, the Environmental Defense Fund for Texas a and the natural resources defense council is a, is parallel to the EDF, a little harder edge, uh, and important, oops. Can't, yeah. Here we go. Then in the gray box in the middle, we have the target firms in the private equity takeover. Uh, it's just one for a really, it's Txu. Uh, but the focus strategically is on Txu plus it is on the expanded, uh, generation capacity that Txu has announced. And that expanded generation capacity is on the lower edge. From an environmental point of view. It relies on conventional technology, which no one thing, no one thought at the time was the best available technology for coal fire generation of electric current.

Speaker 1:          10:29          Uh, and while we're at it, the parts of a, an electric utility company are three generation transmission and sales or distribution. Transmission is the long lines and distribution is the last mile of lines and the financial connection, the contractual connection with the customer. I then on the right, we've got KKR and TPG and these are both large, uh, and uh, very aggressive. Uh, private equity firms. KKR is most famous or the, uh, the Reynolds' Nabisco, Rjr Nabisco, uh, uh, takeover, which is characterized at length in our variants of the gate and Texas Pacific. Uh, is actually the more interesting of the two from the point of view of this case or any, anybody snap to a, an obvious conclusion about the difference between the two. Okay. We'll draw it out in a few minutes. The TXU expansion, uh, 8,600 megawatts added. That's a just under 50% incremental to the firm's total generating capacity.

Speaker 3:          12:13          Uh,

Speaker 1:          12:15          10 or $11 billion in cost. Uh, somewhere between half 1,000,000,002 billion of that are budgeted to controls of pollution. And it's pretty murky in the case and pretty murky in fact just how much it would cost. How much of the capital can be construed as pollution control. Uh, they promised a 20% cut any missions. What do they mean by that? Who thought that one through 20% cut of emotions, we're going to add 47% of our total generating capacity and we're going to cut emissions by 20%. What exactly is the claim? Does it meet? Yes.

Speaker 4:          13:12          I'm not sure what TXU problems exactly, but there are two ways you can do that. You can artificially Nicu my carbon credits or reduce your emissions intensity on paper. You can also retrofit some coal plants and see, um, so that emissions are kind of sequestered from the ground. Like there are certain technologies allow you to do that. So that's some ways you can cut it.

Speaker 1:          13:34          Okay. Um, those are both valid points, but I'm still a little unclear about how much salt is going to come out the end of the pipe. Yes,

Speaker 5:          13:49          I use, I guess a of potential difference is whether the 20% caught to Sam's little missions or are generated. So it was pretty unique generated there would still be a larger percentage of mission slowed would be less per unit.

Speaker 1:          14:08          Yeah. I think it has to be a norm to in that way it has to be a unit rate of emission so that these planets are on average quite a lot better than the old plants. Uh, those still not state of the art. And the claim is that we're going to drive the anger, good emission rate per mega watt, uh, down by 20%. Uh, they're using old sites. They plan to use the old sites where they've already got a plan. Anybody figure out why they would say a thing like that?

Speaker 3:          14:45          Well,

Speaker 1:          14:48          yes Tom, if you're building a new site, it requires a lot more regulatory approval. Greenfield, Greenfield site, and you've got a whole round of permitting. Uh, and there are a couple of other advantages. One is that the up nimby politics, not in my backyard, politics are over in those areas. You've already been through it. And if you can come back to people and say, this is a less disruptive plant than the old one, uh, that's a pretty good start. A, and even if people aren't much taken by that, if you've been, if the management has been intelligent, they will have built a network of local relationships, which they would have to build a new on a Greenfield site. Finally, there's an infrastructure reason that the transmission lines required to transport the current produced a will already be in place and that's both an economic and a political plus a.

Speaker 1:          16:00          And then at the end of this they throw in a 10% discount to their customers and that discount is a nonsequitor in the environmental discussion. Uh, but it's not a non sequitur in the actual case because Txu is in trouble on to political fronts at once. It is a monopoly, a seller of current, and it has, it is, it has wired the state of Texas politically and there is a populous revolt against that. And the populist revolt takes the form of criticizing the ultimate pricing, uh, at the household level. Now, if we look at the case from Austin, Texas, we've got all these small things upper right that our federal government, uh, and we've got all these big things locally that are state politics and government. I, you've got Texas state government where, how, how CXU doing with Governor Perry during all this. Is Perry a populous to wants to beat up on them?

Speaker 1:          17:19          Now they own parent, I've may overstate alone, but they pretty much own governor Perry. Uh, the Texas business for clean air is a not altogether surprising alliance of business groups, uh, which, uh, are opposed to Txu on this, on environmental grounds, sometimes for self-serving business reasons. And other times I think because it's what senior management thinks is right. Uh, you've got Texans for public. Josh does, and they're, they're not so much about the environment as about the rate. Uh, you've got a state senator named Troy Frazier who is, uh, making a name for himself statewide by attacking Txu on mostly on the rate side, but he's also willing to take up the environmental side. Uh, you've got the Texas climate initiative and EDF, which are closely or twine. And the personality of Jim Marsden. Uh, what do you think of Martha? You, if you went all the way through the case, you hurt him, I don't know, five or seven times in video seem like enable guy a thumbs up if you think that bounce down if you're going to pay it back. Hmm. We've got 95 abstentions. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          19:01          MMM.

Speaker 1:          19:06          Usually label guy. He's a very able guy.

Speaker 3:          19:10          Uh,

Speaker 1:          19:12          but he is, he is a, uh, he has a very soft style of argument. Right. And he never seemed to be a jump ahead of you. And the argument is always in a very laid back way asking your opinion, uh, as if he hadn't really figured out where you wanted to go. And that may be partly for our benefit because he was working for the school of management in preparing for the case. But it's also probably part of his natural style puct public utility commission of Texas and Texas Commission on environmental quality. I almost missed that one myself. These are the two principal regulatory bodies and the case and the Association of electric companies of Texas. You can imagine who they are. And what [inaudible] role is, it's a classic, uh, Interest Association. And then you've got popular.

Speaker 3:          20:30          Cool.

Speaker 6:          20:30          We're out here today as part of a national day of action. Target and Merrill Lynch for backing TX shoes, dirty coal plants,

Speaker 3:          20:39          poor profits, Morocco, Asma, global warming. Oh,

Speaker 6:          20:56          in cities like New York, Boston, San Francisco, Washington, DC, Los Angeles. And of course Houston. Yeah, we want Tia cue to stop this wrong headed plan to build 11 new coal fire power plants in Texas. We want the banks, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Citibank to scuttle the deal.

Speaker 3:          22:00          Deliver this letter or I'm in the barrels is a letter to Merrill Lynch knows best dirty coal, but they don't seem to say we'll take the house but I have an appointment. Thirdly, rehabbing appointment, we have an appointment. Cheryl, you and our relationship with Merrill Lynch is quite tight. Yep.

Speaker 1:          22:50          Okay. So did you guys ever done in protest of that type and you just don't look like street theater times? Do you think that's a factor? You're shaking your head. Okay. And I think there are two sides to the question. Let's start in the negative here.

Speaker 4:          23:17          I mean, I just feel as though it's not in. So we get the companies to change their positions generally. So I mean, yes, it might serve a little public disapproval for a couple of days with this machine.

Speaker 1:          23:30          Okay. So as a direct strategy for changing the Bader of companies goes nowhere. We agree. Is there any other way in which it might be of service to the cause these are pursuing here and then

Speaker 5:          23:51          did you can get coverage on it. It tends to have a more dramatic effect on politics and yet I was working on a political campaign where you sell something that was smart enough pay shine in the Washington Post. Um, and so I know this from personal experience that that uh, it does have the potential, probably not to effect the direct response to the people are falling out, but that they're a Margaret Ish.

Speaker 1:          24:23          Okay. So the clear the media are the, are the target and then who would we most likely influenced with this sort of thing. Anybody want to elaborate further? Yes, Sasha.

Speaker 4:          24:43          What companies really worry about, his other clients are going to be sensitive to the native grass and changed companies.

Speaker 1:          24:50          Absolutely. That's okay. Txu customer voter base is a part of this and both of those nouns are important in it. They are both voters and customers and they may not have many places to go as customers, but as voters, the perception within regulatory and legislative groups in Boston, would it be, uh, an important consideration? I personally don't think that this kind of demonstration is hugely effective, but it does kind of raise the temperature of the issue and make it salient to decision makers in government. Now, in all the, if we switched from Austin to Washington, uh, the, the actors get deaf get, get to be different. And the EPA and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, uh, and the key people in Congress slide Henry Waxman or, uh, Senator Bingaman and boxer, uh, become big players and the EDF and the, uh, and our, uh, RBF, um, national resource defense funds become a well staffed. They would each have 50 or so staff people in Washington and become a major presence. And the question in front of a Kkr and Texas Pacific, a hindrance on why do, why do they, why are they messing around with all these environmental groups, which sounded like from a purely economic point of view, to be a waste of time. And yes, from a, from an entirely rational economic point of view, it isn't a waste of time.

Speaker 3:          26:59          Why not?

Speaker 1:          27:05          Well, let's look. Let's go to Wall Street. The private equity business. In 2007, there were 794 a large private equity transactions during that year, uh, adding up to about 800 billion. So they average about a billion of peace, uh, explosive growth. They're up about a 400 and 450, 500% from 2000 to 2007. Uh, and it's a period when capital is abundant and cheap. So the, the, it is in every sense, boom. Time for private equity.

Speaker 3:          27:50          The, um, you've got

Speaker 1:          27:56          three sets of players as seen from Wall Street. You've got the private equity firms, the target firms, uh, and the business services organizations, mainly investment banks, which catalyzed a transactions of this kind. And the takeover of Txu is a mega deal. It is the biggest transaction of its kind, so it gets a lot of attention and offers to be very profitable.

Speaker 3:          28:37          The

Speaker 1:          28:39          institutional investors showing up or left in the blue box are limited partners in the funds created by organizations like Kkr and Texas Pacific. And from their point of view, this is one of the highest yielding, uh, asset classes in their portfolio. Uh, and David Swensen for example of Yale. Uh, one of the things he did with the Yale portfolio which made it grow so much faster after he came then and had grown at anytime in the university's history was to shift a great deal of capital away from publicly traded securities into private Equity Funds, which uh, which differ, they defer the biggest difference between, um, how well best companies do, would it stocks and bonds on the one side and private equity on the other is the difference between the smart money and average money in the stock market. The difference between very smart money and fairly dumb money is a few percentage points.

Speaker 1:          30:02          The difference in private equity between the smartest money and fairly dumb bunny is enormous. And so if, uh, if a, a, an institutional investor by Gail Harvard, uh, or the big pension funds can get into private equity with smart money, hire smart management, uh, invest with people like Texas Pacific and Kkr, the opportunity to, uh, beat the market in a big way, uh, is a very right one. And that's the heart of this deal. Now, from a sociological point of view, uh, the people who run these, these companies are pretty far away from the green world, uh, which centers in major metropolitan areas, uh, and it's populated by Welton do activists, uh, and they're five o one c, three corporation of which, uh, uh, the, the ones in play today are examples. Now, the Pacific group is a little different from KKR in its relationship to those groups because it has one key player in William Riley who had been the head of the EPA before and who is agreeing?

Speaker 1:          31:47          And he gave, he gives Texas specific a relationship to a, to this world of which KKR pretty much doesn't have that. Ain't David Bonderman, who is, uh, one of the founders of Texas Pacific is a Harvard educated and kind of part of this world. If you begin tracking personalities in these funds, uh, Francis Vita King, uh, she of a Yale fame, uh, is the head of a natural resources defense. Fine. I don't know why would seasons instead of F's on the end of this other slide. Uh, she, she's the head of that and a terrifically potent a leader. And the reason the privileged access to do this case came to the Yale School of Management has something to do with that particular connection. Uh, and there is a cultural divide here. It is, uh, uh, it is, these are quite different views of the world and if we compare a five zero one c three corporations with regular public or not publicly publicly traded or not publicly traded corporations, we get some sharp contrasts.

Speaker 1:          33:20          The business corporations are pursuing profit. A, the five o one c three s are pursuing a cost. The attitude to risk is far more aggressive among the businesses. Uh, the boards are accountable to mainly to major investors on the business side, uh, and uh, to donors on the final one C3 side, except that in the really big old five [inaudible] they're accountable to no one because the donor is dead. The Carnegie Corporation, for example, where my wife is a chief investment officer, Andrew Carnegie hasn't paid any attention to their lenders in some time and it actually creates an enormous amount of, of, uh, uh, free play at top management and board level. Uh, the management culture on the business side is far more aggressive than on among the nonprofits and top management compensation in it, particularly in private equity is high and variable. And Jim would, Jim pointed out to me that Jim Alexander pointed up to me this morning that when I say high and variable, the variability may or may not be well tied to actual performance.

Speaker 1:          34:52          You can get a lot of compensation for just sitting in the right chair during a bull market. And many people have. Um, and on the nonprofit side, if the compensation is relatively modest and uh, more or less in variant with performance, uh, take Francis by Nikki, there was a to do a in the same year because somebody published their top salaries are always public and her salary of $252,000 was published and there was a populous outcry. Now by private equity standards that sound a lot of money, uh, even by not people on the investment side and organizations like this make three or four or 10 times that. But the general norm in nonprofits is how many are there people here who planned the become nonprofit tiers?

Speaker 2:          35:53          Maybe?

Speaker 1:          35:56          Okay. Well the one thing you have to do is take a zero off. Uh, when you think about compensation, uh, more or less, it's, it's, that's about the ratio and it's considerable. Uh, so these are two very different classes of organizations. All right. Here we have Fred crop of the natural resources and Henry Kravitz. And I'll bet not one of you is in doubt about witches switch, but the pictures are then you get the point across. Um, and why on earth would people on this side be so interested in participation from people on this side, Sasha, again,

Speaker 4:          36:59          um, to do something with the business that makes them more money ultimately then it's a good deal.

Speaker 1:          37:05          You nailed it. And not, not one iota of direct concern for the environment is required to back that up. Right? So what's the biggest problem about Tia Queue? Why is it, what if you're going to get to sit down and calculate the risks from Kkr and a specific point of view of taking over this firm, what would the main risk speed they would be? Would they be that the technology will fail? Would they be that consumer demand for electric tower will suddenly go away? Would they be that a new entrant will come in, a large new amber will come in and begin to compete with lower prices? None of those things or arc imaginable. None of those are imaginable. So why isn't this Josh a license to print money? And the answer to that is that a regulatory risk is substantial at both the federal and state levels, much more substantial at the federal level. And that the, the process by which the, the groups would in effect bless or kosher the transaction is a way of limiting political risk. Oh, the eat the EDF is all about the cause of the environment. Um, and their claim is that a lobby work they've done in the years from 2001 to 2008 will, uh, diminish, uh, diesel pollution by nearly 90% by 2030. And that's their business. Their business is to get the government to compel companies to pollute less,

Speaker 1:          39:32          uh, Fred crop at Davos in the year of the case. This is not in the case. The smartest companies can see over the horizon, anticipate consumer demands. That's why the EDF has been able to team with a team up with Alcoa, dupont, Caterpillar, GE, Duke, the Duke Energy, BP America and others on a plan that could cut greenhouse gas emissions by 68% by 2050. The plan is a job, Twitter as well as an environmental winter. So the, so organizations like these are brokers. Yeah. Which they cut deals with businesses and the businesses they cut the deals with our one switch have a higher than average capacity to withstand pilar regulation. For example, Ge with ECO imagination, you've all heard of that. If you watch television for any period of as as long as an hour, you have been saturated with that message. And why can he do that? Well why does it have to do it?

Speaker 1:          40:40          What street is long term reputation for environmental pollution? It is that they filled the Hudson River with PCPs 50 years ago and it's important for them to get us off that topic and to think of them in an in a different way. Second, if they compete in Europe for the manufacturer of electrically powered equipment and the regs in Europe are much tighter than they are here from an environmental point of view. So they have developed a technology to meet Mike higher standards. They've got it already in the kit. And so from their point of view, it is actually a corporate strategy play to encourage the feds to raise the bar cap and trade. I'm running out of time here. Cap and trade diagram. Uh, the interesting side fact that cap and trade in the EU, uh, basically fizzle and it fizzled because the caps that were put on the countries were not low enough to make people go out and buy credits. They were sat in a very gentle political way and the market for cap and trade depends on people having to break the caps and buy credits to make up for that. And the caps were set so high that it didn't produce the desired effect.

Speaker 1:          42:21          I don't know why that slide is there.

Speaker 3:          42:25          No.

Speaker 1:          42:27          Um, let's think about outcomes. Uh, we've got on the vertical dimension Greenwald and on the horizontal dimension, Green Paper and uh, four big quadrants. The four quadrants of this space, uh, define, uh, points we could think about in looking at what the risks are, the possibilities of this are for these two classes of, of organizations down here, emissions are high end profits are low, is a catastrophe. On both dementia. And the likelihood of both of those things happening is very small. A story where you have both high emissions and high profit. This is the most worrying category from the point of view of the EDF. This would, this would constitute greenwashing, which has become a really important epithet in the politics of the environment. Where are their blessing something which is a retention benefit to the environment. And here is the disaster from the point of view of Kkr and Texas Pacific where you have both low emissions and low profits.

Speaker 1:          44:01          And do you think KKR and Texas Pacific enter into this relationship fearing the risk that EDF and the natural, the natural resources defense fund will, will encourage the imposition of standards so direct Konijn that they can't make a living? Well, no, they wouldn't have EDF as the lead agency. If EDF we're of the same temperament. Ash let's freak theater. We saw in the video they chose EDF quit cause they think they can cut a plausible and constructive bargain with them, which liege not upper left upper right in the diagram or emissions decrease in a substantial degree. And uh, and profits remain hot.

Speaker 1:          45:10          This slide is in the is from the case and it's the full inventory of exactions that Jim March then and EDF people consider in looking at the case and it, if they call it the blue sky concessions because it's perfectly clear they're not going to get all of these, but they want, some of them are and they get some of them and they also get quite a lot of symbolic by him. So let, by the current year 2009 Kkr is offering an investment portfolio, wicked calls the green portfolio. And this consists not of companies that are going to devote themselves to producing environmental products, but random grid companies which produce other products, for example in bio mat, uh, produce magical devices. But we're, they sign on to the proposition that they will make their production process far greener than it was before. So that I as an investor can buy into the Green Fund and expect market rates of return and think that on the side I'm doing a little bit of good for the environment.

Speaker 3:          46:34          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          46:35          Big changes are on the horizon for Texas power customers. Welcome to the new TXU. We've listened to Texans on prices and we're taking a new approach to prove it. Most residential customers will get a double digit price cut. We've listened to Texans on the environment, so we'll cut, propose to new coal units from 11 to three and look for new ways to ensure reliable, affordable power, doing what's right for customers, doing what's right for Texas. Welcome to the future. Welcome. Txu.

Speaker 1:          47:05          Okay. So, uh, and they all went to the beach and had a swell afternoon.

Speaker 3:          47:11          Um, the,

Speaker 1:          47:19          okay, so that's the last case we're going to do except the one for your final. And what I hope you'll do for Wednesday is, uh, read Finnegan piece with some care. He's a British writer. I got to know him personally when he came to write about a violent kids in new haven 20 years ago. Um, and it's a beautifully written piece and it's a compelling story. And also begin reviewing your notes for the big picture level of the course.
