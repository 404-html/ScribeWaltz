Speaker 1:          00:01          Uh, today's case, a shell co Seawall, uh, is, uh, a wonderful transition, uh, to, uh, Colliers, bottom billion. And A, I want to start with some frameworks and I'm, I'm going to do these briefly. I'll post them this evening shoe could look back at them. I want to introduce, these are very standard Mba ish, a shorthand frameworks for thinking about cases. And you heard, I think most of this, but I, I should rub it in a bit. Uh, one is called Swat, s, w o, o t. And this one has really no analytic content to it. It's just a, a way of organizing your thoughts on a topic, a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threat, uh, in the temporal dimension. Typically the strengths and weaknesses are things which are immediately present in your situation. And the opportunities and threats are things you might have happened to you or might cause, uh, cause, uh, to occur.

Speaker 1:          01:22          And, um, a lot of back of the envelope thinking about business cases is organized in a, this shorthand. Uh, so you might make yourself a grid like this and let the column headings be Swat. And then, uh, let the row headings be whatever you choose. Uh, but one candidate a is the porter forcer, uh, which we've seen before. Uh, how fierce is the direct competition in your business from other people doing more of us exactly what you do and trying to do it better than you? Uh, what's the threat that others not now doing it will enter the business and increased competition. Uh, how likely is it that people will find substitutes for your whole industry that, uh, your industry will be undermined by an adjacent industry? Mine

Speaker 2:          02:26          is that

Speaker 1:          02:28          I could tell I was able to determine which letter it was. Can you hold that up and tell us what it's about?

Speaker 2:          02:36          Yeah. Really quickly

Speaker 1:          02:39          hold it up. So the video guy,

Speaker 2:          02:44          the Congo, the kinds of sexual crimes of sexual violence that are common communes to the billions as well resolve the mineral conflict, uh, such as copper and coal, uh,

Speaker 1:          02:59          which are frequently found in our own devices such as iPads, cell phones and cameras. So just trying to draw attention to the crisis. Terrific. It's certainly an eye catching a accessory as you walk in. Um, threat of substitution, then the power of your suppliers in the shell case. Think about where you're buying the basic components of these, uh, generation and lighting systems. Uh, if, if there's only a limited number of sources or perhaps even just one store, then they're in a position to squeeze you on price. And that's an important strategic consideration. And buyers, if buyers have a lot of leverage or as in the Selco case, not a lot of money, then buyers become a central point of strategic focus. So you could, if you wanted, and I often do this, you could combine swat across the top with supply, with, with a porter in the rows so that, uh, if you take a potential entrance threat of entry, uh, your strength might be that there's no money to be made in this field.

Speaker 1:          04:24          So not many people are going to want to do it. Or it might be that there are huge switching costs so that once people have bought your equipment, it is very difficult for them to switch to other people's equipment. Uh, the weakness might be that you're making money and that the Financial Times just ran a large article about how lucrative your business is, which is likely to attract the attention of others, uh, opportunities. Uh, perhaps, uh, well how is, how is barriers to entry and opportunity? Uh, perhaps you can build pricing advantages. If you increase the scale of your operation, uh, your unit costs may get low enough that whenever a new entrant comes, you can crush him with low prices. Um, uh, and threat similarly, somebody else may jump in and get to a higher scale of production, much lower unit costs and crush you. So you can, you could walk all the way through, uh, the 20 cells there. Uh, but it, it, frameworks like this are meant to be useful. And when they're useful, they are there, you use them. And if there's a particular cell here that doesn't make any sense, you just put an x through it and go on.

Speaker 2:          05:58          Uh,

Speaker 1:          05:59          another concept that we've used briefly and it, and it gets to be important in cases like Selco is vertical integration, which I've drawn horizontally as almost everyone else does. And the rough idea here is that on the left is the supply of raw materials. Uh, and then, uh, then making of the product. It's the assembly, it's distribution and sale all the way out here, the sale and is called the forward part of integration. So forward integration, uh, raw materials and intermediate products is called backward integration. And so defying all logic backward plus forward makes vertical, don't ask me how that came about.

Speaker 2:          06:46          MMM.

Speaker 1:          06:49          Behind that process, which we think of in very physical terms is a, an intellectual and managerial layer, which starts not with raw materials, but with a business plan, a and a product design and the assembly of a management team and the creation of channels for distributing the product. Again, left to right. And if you think about the sell coke case,

Speaker 2:          07:17          uh,

Speaker 1:          07:19          where's the, where's their main focus on this Arrow at Selco? What do they mostly paying attention to?

Speaker 1:          07:32          Back left, you got to shout. If you don't have a bike, they, most of their staff is focused on distribution and sales. But then India, okay. This absolutely. So the forward integration of Selco is it's most obvious, uh, obviously unusual feature. They're reaching into very difficult markets to do the sales and very awkward places to do the service which has to go with the sales. And if you look now at another way of looking at the backward to forward a story, it's, I, I've reproduced what was already there, but then I've added service out here. It turns out that taking responsibility for durable goods that you sell,

Speaker 1:          08:29          right? There's not much longterm responsibility for toothbrushes or toothpicks. Uh, but there is a lot of service responsibility for any form of machinery, especially when people are going to organize our lives around the machinery. Uh, the classic insight on a classic example on this is, uh, a McCormick, a farm machinery in the 18 hundreds. The brilliant thing they did, which none of their competitors did, was to manufacture a only during the winter season and use the same people that were running the manufacturing plant to be servicing agents for the farmers during the growing season. So that the advantage of buying their stuff, I had everything to do with service. Now think about the laptop in front of you. Take Yours. Uh, is service an issue? Well, does it just run, run forever and keep you happy? Okay. And what do you do? Okay. Or you call him up and talk to talk to it. So called genius. What a thought, right? The genius bar and Max Competitive Advantage. It's partly the elegance of the, of the equipment, but a lot of it is that they're servicing is way better than anybody else's who's got a kind of computer that services hard to find for.

Speaker 1:          10:11          You're all perfectly happy with the support you get for your computers. Well that's wonderful. It's, it's improbable but wonderful. Um, okay, so you get a, with Selco, a huge emphasis on the service end of the business.

Speaker 1:          10:37          Okay. Now let's turn to the case itself. There's an a part and a B part. The B part is really kind of a more like a teaching note than an actual case. And the focus is on a rural, the a certain rural part of India and on, uh, sales to people who are either in business on a very small scale, entrepreneurs of some kind or householders in an area that is off the electric grid. And it's an interesting fact about India that the electric grid is highly problematic and incomplete. And uh, first, uh, mass development of wind turbines was actually begun in India by a textiles manufacturer who, uh, got tired of all the downtime in his reliance on grid electric power and started developing turbines for his own use. And then had the, had the insight that turbines where a profitable business than textiles for him and switched all together. It's now headquartered in Denmark and it's a huge company.

Speaker 2:          12:05          MMM.

Speaker 1:          12:07          So the alternatives to what these guys are doing, the ones mentioned in the case are the grid Pico, hydro. And it's very hard for me to envision how you do distributed generation with water. I got, well anybody got a thought about this? You live next to a running stream and you build a little water wheel and it's got to be something a little glitzy or than that, uh, and wind turbine on a micro scale

Speaker 2:          12:37          now, um,

Speaker 1:          12:43          what are the inherent disadvantages of the distributed generation strategy that Selco is engaged in? If you were looking at it from a business point of view, what would be factors that would, would strike you as a

Speaker 2:          13:03          scary? Uh, yes.

Speaker 3:          13:12          Every time they entered a new market they had to convince the finance institution to finance their products to the market that they were catering to. So it was almost a barrier of entry for them because the kind of people they wanted to sell the products to did not have the services. And it was also a new concept that they were introducing because financing was never done with respect to energy before.

Speaker 1:          13:34          Okay. So one, one problem that is inherit in the market segment they choose to serve is that you've got a twin, a door to door finance at the micro level with door to door sale. Uh, of the, of the equipment, the generating equipment and the lighting equipment. So that's one difficulty. Are there any others? Maybe I'll just make carry that around. Any others?

Speaker 2:          14:02          Yup.

Speaker 3:          14:07          Um, some days there's no sun and then obviously, yes,

Speaker 1:          14:10          solar system isn't going to work. There are, and there are some seasons in which that happens repeatedly though in the part of India they're doing, it's a pretty sunny place. Uh, but okay. So that's, that's uh, that's a genuine drawback. Other other thoughts?

Speaker 2:          14:36          Oh, there you are.

Speaker 3:          14:40          Essentially they're competing with the government. If the government chose to expand the grid in the region, they're doing business that would put there, that would put their business plan and they decided decision.

Speaker 1:          14:51          Okay.

Speaker 2:          14:52          So, uh, there's a lot said there all, all in one elegant sentence. Uh, and the, uh, the biggest piece of it, as I heard it was the threat that the grid might expand into a given area. And why would people, once the grid came, switched from Shell Cosa equipment to grid equipment,

Speaker 1:          15:22          we took your mic probably cost, it's more efficient to generate electricity, um, in a, in a power plant. Then in your own house. Okay. And in n is there a general concept here? Economies of scale, economies of scale, right? The whole point of centralized generation, uh, is huge economies of scale, right? So that, uh, if you, if, if, if the grid is run reasonably efficiently, efficiently, it will time after time Trump distributed generation. And so why would we do this business? What's the point? Is this something that uh, a brilliant young reptile from the Harvard business school is going to jump into to make his fortune? Sasha, what do you think? No, no. And why not?

Speaker 4:          16:29          I think there are too many risks,

Speaker 1:          16:31          too many risks. And how big an upside is, sir.

Speaker 4:          16:36          Um, I, I'm not sure how you would clarify the upside, but I'm not convinced that it's huge enough to take advantage.

Speaker 1:          16:42          Okay. Uh, does anybody remember the financing story for this work comes what, what subsidies are required? Okay, let's watch a little bit of filming yet further along with the actual story. We got the sound. This found cord up here, guys. I hear it yesterday.

Speaker 2:          17:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:45          I had a chance to go to Dominican Republic way back in 91

Speaker 5:          17:51          and there I saw actually some villagers using solar power and paying for it. That triggered a lot of changes in my own thought process. When I came up in the back,

Speaker 6:          18:03          hi was one of the first to realize that there was potential for selling solar home systems to individual users. At the time the only lighting systems in rural India where community installations funded by the government.

Speaker 5:          18:18          What we did basically what start off the operations and and see uh, solid. Okay, let's, let's tackle the barriers as they come rather than studying it and then seeing what the solutions were. So we were a three member team, Harish, no one Mr Pie and I, the three of us together were the ones who are the so called management of the company at that point in time. And between the three of us, we delighted the jobs that were dead in the organization with the taking care of most of the day to day running of the organization. Those days, Mr, by taking care of the operational side of it and me taking care of the marketing, we started basically with $30 in the pocket for three years and we would buy a for lighting system from a, from a manufacturer and then sell it and whatever money we would get in by another

Speaker 6:          19:07          Hareesh slowly realized that the one size fits all for light system was not always the most appropriate or affordable solution for the rural poor

Speaker 5:          19:17          [inaudible] actually dumping technology down people's throat. Even not giving them a choice. Say that we have for light, so you need to take four lights and four lights for what? See the corridor light was different too about from light a bathroom light was very different to our kitchen light. Why do you need 11 more light in the bathroom? You need light for the sake of having light in the bathroom. So you can come up with a very small light of one water or two words. So we need to give them a choice of people would say, are you in the kitchen and in the dining room at the same time. So you'd give you four points with two lights. So when you're done with the cooking you shift the light to the dining room and it effectively acts like a full light system. Typical example when uh, when a farmer came to us and said, we want it, I want a three light system.

Speaker 5:          20:05          And when we designed a three light system for the farmer, the farmer Rhino, it said it's too expensive, but the technician went to his house when on top of the house broke a part of it and put one light. He wanted light in three rooms. He did not need three lights and certainly solo became affordable because of the different segmentation of people, especially the poor. There's no standardized income generating activities. Our neighbor might be a midwife. This side neighbor might be a street render, the other side neighbor would be a potato vendor and everybody needs the different sorts of energy services. Especially the difference here being that it's between a need and a warrant. You definitely can standardize. I want you cannot standardize a need because once you look at basic needs and everybody's needs are very, very different. I need to ask off lighting.

Speaker 5:          21:00          Somebody needs for us of lighting, somebody needs one off lighting from milking the cow as Selco focus on creating individual solutions. Business took off. However, it was not always a smooth ride. Since your success came pressure to expand, we got ed wise from well known management gurus that the way you guys are doing it is not correct and you need to not own your own centers. Why you need to create a lot of other dealers. We went to that and created half the company to create those dealer models. What happened with that was completely the mission went for a toss in a sense that dealer started looking at upper middle class and high middle class, so the poor, well any left behind and because of that we nearly got killed because the market was not so maturely developed for the, even for the middle class and upper middle class, the margin levels for what the dealer's expected were not as high, so they started tapering down in the business and we had lots of inventory that we had bought because of these dealers.

Speaker 5:          22:15          We nearly nearly collapsed. The mission was going for a toss. The company was going for a toss. The what we had actually started with was going into fourth toss. We feel that the middle class and upper middle class, anybody else, we'll reach them. They have a choice, they have a choice to go after things, but that's no fun. The Fun for us is at this segmentation and the fun, frankly speaking is the barriers that we come across. No amount of Google search can help us all that and that is what keeps us frankly glowing. Even if it takes a lot of capital, it takes a lot of investment, a lot of time. That's the mission of the company and that's what we want to achieve.

Speaker 2:          22:55          Great.

Speaker 1:          23:00          Okay. Um,

Speaker 2:          23:07          yeah,

Speaker 1:          23:10          you had to summarize what was just said there in 20 words or less, what would it be?

Speaker 2:          23:19          Okay. Sasha, well, bottom line

Speaker 4:          23:25          company that their mission is not purely thing.

Speaker 1:          23:28          Okay. And now help people who don't talk bottom line counts to understand what you just said.

Speaker 4:          23:34          Um, so some of you talk about a double or triple bottom line and then you have people who are looking at social returns and environmental returns in addition to purely financial returns.

Speaker 1:          23:43          Okay. So to rip, that's terrific. So heretofore four, we have talked as if companies had one bottom line and their net results were correctly reflected in a profit and loss statement. And what Sasha is suggesting is that a firm like Selco a or a bank like seawall, uh, thinks about more than one bottom line. And they want to say that some net losses in the financial bottom line, uh, may be balanced and over compensated by gains in environmental territory or in social services. So this is capitalized capitalism hybridized with a nonprofit service sector institutions and Selco and seawater are neither of them institutions which would have been designed if you thought about just one bottom line, right? The merit in them, uh, has to be captured in social and to some extent environmental terms. Now, um, what the what, what's the market's message, uh, to village India about the availability of light and electric current for purposes like running a running small machinery or heating water? What's the market say? Yes. This is a case where there's exactly as economists say, an equilibrium outcome. What's somebody's got a hand up over there are there we are,

Speaker 1:          25:58          I mean for the darkness area there's simply insufficient demand to justify expanding the infrastructure of drastically. Okay. Across much of rural India. All right, so that's, go ahead. Adam Smith distinguishes between total demand and when he called effective demand. Total demand is how many people put up your hand, put up their hands. If you say, would you like electricity? Uh, effective demand is people who would do that and back it up with money and effect. Effective demand is very low. Now,

Speaker 1:          26:36          not only is it low, but overcoming it with a grid structure is inherently difficult because while there are some customers capable of paying market rate for grid electricity, the vast majority of customers in many of these regions are below that income level and could not afford any of the above. In addition to that, there poverty is reinforced by the absence of energy supplies, right? If you don't have the energy supplies to do small scale production or to eliminate a market, uh, during, uh, evening hours or any of a hundred other such things, the low level of commerce is kept low by the absence of, uh, of efficient energy supplies. So the justification for an enterprise like this has everything to do with finding a way around the market equilibrium at zero, uh, which prevails in some of these places. No, there was another feature in the film clip. Uh, what's the attitude toward customers? How does their attitude compare with, well, let's establish the, the high end of the scale. How does Gail do at providing a choice of courses for you to take ridiculously well, right? A third of Yale courses have fewer than 10 students

Speaker 1:          28:28          think that, oh, imagine that you brought a cost accountant in here to look at your college. 20% of my brothers and sisters on the faculty, we'd be looking for a job. And the enormous wealth of the institution is what makes this possible. And it's a wonderful thing. Now, if you were now, now go, go back to what's your least favorite company that you deal with routinely? Most of you have an unfavorite company. I see a good nod right back in the six row. Third seat in

Speaker 4:          29:15          my least favorite company ever is Connecticut Limo.

Speaker 1:          29:19          Okay. Connecticut Limo Wa there. I ask,

Speaker 4:          29:29          they don't give customers what they promise. They're always late. They're too expensive and they're mean

Speaker 1:          29:37          me. Okay. Anybody else got an over here?

Speaker 2:          29:45          Mcdonald's.

Speaker 1:          29:50          What's your grudge against them?

Speaker 7:          29:52          Uh, many, uh, first how they market to children and uh, how unhealthy their food is in general.

Speaker 1:          30:01          Okay. Uh, how many of you have eaten at Mcdonald's sometime in the last two weeks? That's a really interesting data. We're at about 3%.

Speaker 2:          30:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          30:16          I'll bet you are the lowest Mcdonald's demographic in the country. Um, okay. But your objection to Mcdonald's, is it, is it that they don't offer a wide enough range of, of customizations?

Speaker 2:          30:33          Partly.

Speaker 1:          30:35          Okay. I mean, if I were them, I'd say to you, come on, what's the beef we offer you? What is it? 2020 sandwiches. Five breakfast. Uh, is it one flavor or more or two of ice cream too? To have ice cream? It's quite a lot. Your beef is of another nature, isn't it?

Speaker 7:          30:59          That they, that they popular as unhealthy food.

Speaker 1:          31:02          Okay. So you,

Speaker 1:          31:06          uh, and if you were king, would you put them out of business? Yeah. Okay. Uh, I have a good friend and prominent faculty colleague named Kelly Brownell. Kelly Brownell visible to all of you. Some of you round now is the leading advocate of the fat tax. He himself is a big guy actually, but he wants to tach restaurant fat so that there would be an excise tax on the big Mac of three or four bucks because it is just one huge blob of cholesterol. Um, but we're off topic here. Uh, the least favorite, my least favorites are several airlines, uh, and providers of Internet service and providers of a television signal and it's because they're rigid. Their business strategy strategy involves a rigid interface with customers and the Delta shuttle between here and Washington, brutal, just brutal the way they do it and that, and there's a reason for that.

Speaker 1:          32:27          It's not just because they're bad people or not even bad people. It's because there are huge economies in not listening to the details of what people want. Do want a ticket on the shuttle or do you not want a ticket on the shuttle? It will leave at age 70, full stop end of conversation. And it isn't even actually a conversation. It is an interplay with a website and the website is often Kludgy, uninformative and so on. But in a cost benefit ratio from their point of view, it works really well. So when, when you look at Selco the first, my first impulse would be to say simplify, don't customize. Get one product that you can generate at much lower costs and stay with it.

Speaker 2:          33:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          33:24          Uh, remember, remember how in the dialogue in the film clip and in the case he talks about one size fits all, doesn't work. And what he means is that people who can barely afford this equipment are inclined to take it only if you match it very well with their preferences.

Speaker 2:          33:49          Now

Speaker 1:          33:50          is that is somebody defense? Selco please. They're highly defendable.

Speaker 3:          33:58          I mean, I guess this goes back to the bottom line we talked about and where cell phones cys not just a for profit bottom line. They really want to help people in. That comes up along the case where in the end they talked that about what the name of them manager Silka is that he really wanted to help these people and unless he tries to at least to some extent customize as products, you won't be able to help as many people as you'd like.

Speaker 1:          34:20          Okay. That's good. And hand the mic on here,

Speaker 8:          34:25          it's also sort of about growing the market, right? Because if you provide a customized solution, just say, um, you know, uh, uh, a street vendor and that vendor is able to, you know, like this storefront, make more money and maybe in the future when he's adding another side to his store for it to come back to you and you know, by the full package.

Speaker 1:          34:45          Okay. So there is a, there's a sort of multiplier effect when in the, on the commercial side of this, you've customized it correctly. Now, um, the major issue in the background here is what's the size of this market worldwide ballpark, somewhere around a billion. So they're a hell of a lot of customers out there.

Speaker 2:          35:16          And

Speaker 1:          35:19          the, and if that's so scalability as it's called becomes, uh, a pressing question for a firm like Selco

Speaker 2:          35:30          and

Speaker 1:          35:32          scalability would mean that you could drive your costs low enough and, uh, develop your distribution system strongly enough that you can reach vastly more. You know, there they are. When the case is written, they're still well under 10,000 households and at well under 10,000 households. This is an experiment, a noble experiment, but merely that it is a demonstration project. Now, um, a background fact about them, which isn't in the case is this, I had lunch today with a Yale college alum, uh, who worked last year for an Indian company that manufacturers equipment like this GWP and GWP assigned her the task of finding a sales relationship with cell cub. So she spent a year working with Selco trying to sell them a high, high quality but completely standardized system.

Speaker 2:          36:54          Okay.

Speaker 1:          36:55          That wa that was designed to achieve scale economies.

Speaker 2:          37:01          And

Speaker 1:          37:03          her experience was entirely frustrating because Selco ultimately, ultimately wasn't interested in achieving scale. They were interested in serving the immediate customer base in front of them. Okay. What does that mean? I think it means that Selco is a service company, uh, and is destined to remain a very small one.

Speaker 2:          37:36          Now,

Speaker 1:          37:38          in the case there's, in, in the B case, there's some discussion about they're a not for profit financing. They may remember the amount of financing they have no, no reason. You should $462,000, which isn't an is it a monumental? Some, uh, but it's, it's a pretty hefty sum if you're talking about a few thousand customers and the rhetoric in the bks is no, no, we're going to get to 300,000 customers and the unit costs will be a dollar and change per customer serve. The subsidy will be that small. Well, I actually don't think they're going to get there. I don't think it can be done with this level of customization. Okay. So now the task is each of you as a management consultant. No. And you're brought in by the board of the funder for Selco.

Speaker 2:          38:49          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:49          And you've got to figure out how to take the, take the baby out of the bath water, get rid of the bath water and come up with something scalable. How would you go about that? Anybody got a thought? Where did we fire management or not? Oh, over at uh, yes.

Speaker 4:          39:17          First I would try to get them to stop being dependent on one geographic area. It seems like they really concentrated between Bangalore and I think it was, um, Dubai. Yes. And like clearly there are a lot of poor regions in India and once they get out of those, that specific region, I'm pretty sure there'll be forced to look at it a bit differently.

Speaker 1:          39:37          Okay. So let me, let me see if I understood that. Uh, do you want them to move into higher income groups?

Speaker 4:          39:44          No. Okay. I want them to go to another poor region.

Speaker 1:          39:47          Okay. You want them to go to another poor neighborhood and do what?

Speaker 4:          39:51          And clearly by seeing that there are like, since there are so many different cultures within India and so many different needs, if they continue this model of customization, they will see, they will ultimately fail and they need to start moving into something else.

Speaker 1:          40:04          Okay. Um, I'm going to pretend to be another person, a person on the board lot. We've already figured out these guys are running straight into a dead end. I'm impatient. You're all you're going to do is demonstrate failure again. Find me a better solution

Speaker 2:          40:24          now.

Speaker 1:          40:26          Anybody think, think they've got one? Yes, it's far back.

Speaker 4:          40:35          Uh, yeah. I just figured out, um, a couple of cell coast products, a couple of their best products that numerically meet the needs of the most number of people. And then I would expand by pushing those products. And of course in the process you'd lose out on customization and individual solutions. But if your goal is to provide illumination to the maximum number of people, just kind of focus on what you're good at it,

Speaker 1:          40:59          it's focused on a few product. Sounds like a good idea. Now, what about people who are, you remember there's talk in the case about a pyramid, there's even a picture of a pyramid and we're talking about serving people near the bottom of the pyramid economically. Is there a way that you might think about serving people at the bottom of the pyramid by all sort of serving people a, a layer or two above them in the pyramid?

Speaker 2:          41:30          Yes.

Speaker 1:          41:36          If you can charge the people a little bit higher up on the pyramid more

Speaker 3:          41:40          well the systems they can subsidize. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          41:42          Okay. So if you can take off, take a, you probably have to have the product differentiated a little bit. If you produce a higher margin product, uh, which is, uh, very similar to your, your straight product and build a distribution channel in so that the same distributors can cover the higher margin product and also the low margin product for the people at the bottom of the pyramid and achieved some scale economies so that you begin to make the pump run on its own.

Speaker 2:          42:26          MMM.

Speaker 1:          42:27          And there and in the, the video clip we just watched, they talk about how, uh, when they let distributors do what they want it, the distributors ended up drifting into higher income straight up. Right. And that's not very surprising because the margins can be much higher right in the bottom, the bottom channel, unless you get the thing very standardized, uh, the margins have to be negative because people just can't afford her. So high customization at the very bottom, it looks like a highly problematic, uh, strategy inspiring as it may be.

Speaker 2:          43:06          MMM.

Speaker 1:          43:12          Is there, are there other lines of production unrelated to electricity that strikes you as interestingly analogous to this? For example, let's say the nub of this idea is distributed production instead of centralized grid production, we're doing distributed, electric, productive production of electricity. Just as we have distributed computing on all these laptops. Are there other, uh, highly distributed strategies that might be of service in bottom billion countries?

Speaker 2:          43:56          Okay.

Speaker 1:          43:58          Okay. Um, talk, say more. Uh,

Speaker 3:          44:03          you could distribute mobile phones instead of, you know, building a, a land line. Okay. It,

Speaker 1:          44:10          has anybody thought of that yet? I'm sure. Yeah. Well big time, right? I mean, and the, the story here is landlines become completely saturate the market and then cell phones are a layer on top of that in all the countries we'll be talking about with the bottom billion, uh, cell phones just over landlines, right? Yeah. And are technologically superior to land lines for all from almost every point of view and a very low income settings. So that's a, that's a good suggestion. Any other occurred? Anyone? Okay. Jennifer? Water purification. Okay. Water purification. And the technology there is, well how do you do it?

Speaker 4:          44:57          Well, instead of running pipes to transport clean water to remote places, you could just build their own filters or dig their own wells.

Speaker 1:          45:07          Okay. You could build your own filters, dig your own wells, might or might not work depending on the water table's depth and quality. Um, but yes, it's a very good point, right at the end of the semester we'll see occasion, Bolivia, Cochabamba Bolivia where um, we try to fix a water supply system using straight capitalist technique and get into a lot of trouble. And we get into a lot of trouble for it before the, basically because the pricing model for the capitalist to make money leads to too high a price for people who are right at the bottom of Bolivia. Bolivia is pyramid, which is not very different from India's pyramid except it's got a lot less growth in it. Thank you. Anybody else got one?

Speaker 4:          46:03          Um, fighting malaria for example, you could focus on like big projects, you alter the landscape like draining swamps versus just giving people like mosquito nets in their own homes.

Speaker 1:          46:14          Okay. And the gates was agree with you,

Speaker 1:          46:18          right? Uh, and are throwing Belgians pattern. And uh, in general there was this whole family of models for multiple bottom line businesses and some natural not so multiple bottom lines. So straight out for profit businesses were having decentralized production. Sure. As in shellcodes equipment is a terrifically valuable, uh, asset, no for Monday, uh, the main metric that is used in the world for progress and what defines the bottom billion as bottom billion is GDP per capita. And in my part of Monday's class, which I'm about to record, I'm going to pick APP. I'm going to start with the proposition, maximize GDP per capita, and make our country better. And Paul Cod, you're more or less advocates that in the bottom Belgium. And I'm, I'm sympathetic to that view, but I'll set up sub critical screens to pass it through and explain those. Uh, and you'll, you'll see that video at the beginning of class on Monday. And then after my little video, there is a Ted talk by Paul Collier explaining what he thinks his book has to offer.
