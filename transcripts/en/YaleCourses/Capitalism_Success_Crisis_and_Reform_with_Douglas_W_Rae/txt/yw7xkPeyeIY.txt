Speaker 1:          00:02          Think back to this was meeting six. It's about the rise of the Joint Stock Corporation and the Joint Stock Corporation is without doubt the most important institution in the world economy today. It's only rival might be states or governments, but it is just a massively important thing. And the question of how it got here and why it takes the form it does is our topic today. Let's begin with Adam Smith. Oh, we've got projection. I'm going to just talk for a while anyway. Uh, begin with which somebody would one of you guys go up there and get that on slide one slide show and I'll rejoin it when we get there. Um, Adam Smith in talking about the invisible hand is also at lengths to say that the productive use of the division of Labor kicks in only when you get big markets only where market scale justifies and elaborate division of labor and a large investment of capital. Do you get the benefits of capitalism really in tiny markets where you're making a, for example, clothing for others in a village of a thousand, the possibility of a sophisticated manufacturing scheme, which,

Speaker 2:          01:47          okay, we're almost there. Here we go.

Speaker 1:          01:58          It's really embarrassing to be a clutch in front of this night.

Speaker 2:          02:00          Paypal,

Speaker 1:          02:05          somebody who knows his stuff, please do this navigator.

Speaker 2:          02:13          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:14          Yeah. Get it into navigator. And then on the slide one and play slide show and we're set. Um, so Smith talks about scaled markets and the great limitation on scaled markets, uh, until the early 18 hundreds was the poor quality of land transportation. Uh, ocean transportation had by that time gotten pretty good. Uh, sailing ships had gotten better and better in the three or 400 years before 1800 and steam ships. Thank you so much. Uh, and steam ships, uh, had improved that,

Speaker 2:          02:59          but

Speaker 1:          03:01          I'm going to skip some slides. Uh, but the great interior of all the continents, uh, still relied on transportation systems, none of which were superior to a horse. The cheapest form of transportation was canal shipping, uh, where the motor power was essentially a horse on a draw path next to the next to the canal. And then beginning in the 1820s and accelerating decade after decade, uh, into the 1860s, the railroad took over for the first time ever. One could move freight vastly faster than a horse and vastly cheaper than any previous, uh, means of transportation. The cities grew up initially at the intersection of ocean shipping, coast-wide shipping and canals, and they grew up because there was always an economic advantage to being at the junction point between the main systems of transportation. Rail took this and raised it by many powers. The American rail network. This is a simplified map. Rand McNally from 1944 and it's about passenger rail, but the, and the, the real density of the u s rail network is about five times what this suggests. But that density created exactly what Adam Smith contemplated, a gigantic market where the division of labor could be refined to a much higher level than ever before.

Speaker 2:          05:07          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:07          One result of that. This is a contemporary map of greater New York and the coloring is dollars of earned income per square mile and the densest places right around in here, uh, reached past 10 billion, such dollars per square mile. And the great cities of the world are invariably once today, which enjoy powerful rail transportation, generally sub supplemented by water transportation, but rail and New New York's extraordinary extraordinary advantage as an a gateway to the interior of the United States by water, first up through the Hudson and then across the Erie canal to the Great Lakes. And then beginning with the 1840 [inaudible], uh, a fabulous deep water harbor for shipments to the rest of the world connected by rail, uh, to the entire continent.

Speaker 1:          06:13          The double challenge faced by railroads. Two things. One, they were very expensive to build. So finance, finance, capital, raising large amounts of money in order to construct railways was one challenge. And in some senses, and even greater challenge was actually running a railroad. It turns out that railroads get an inordinately complicated after they get big, when they are one section of about 40 or 50 miles. Railroads are actually not very complicated things to run, but when they get to be hundreds or even thousands of miles, the logistics of management get extremely challenging. So you have two challenges. One is finance, the other is operations. And let's start with operations. Uh, in the 19th century, train collisions occurred at, at, at rates varying from about 400 to a thousand a year in the u s uh, and they were often ugly and they reflected the challenge of management. Uh, this is a simple one section rail that operated, uh, in the 1840s and fifties between Boston and Worcester, Massachusetts.

Speaker 1:          07:37          Almost all the railroads built just one track. And the question was, how do you run trains back and forth between these two cities, uh, without collisions? And the solution it's in Chandler that these people had was to instruct the, the engineers of the trains beginning at the two end cities to proceed to Framingham and one turns and each take a right turn, so to speak. Uh, and sit there until the other train is in view after the other train is in view and stopped, proceed to the neck, proceed to the, the end of your journey. Pretty simple management. And that railroad had only about 50 employees. It was, you know, four trips a day. And a very simple thing, but characteristic of capitalism is that people are not content with small success and they therefore try to string together many short railroads on the theory that average cost will decline as scale of operation increases.

Speaker 1:          08:48          The New York central system, which was the glitziest of all the railways at its peak, it's peak coming, uh, roughly from the period of world war one to the end of World War Two. Uh, this railroad was created by splicing together, uh, dozens of little railroads. The Mohawk and Hudson ran between Schenectady and Albany and it was the kernel from which this was formed. Uh, the, it's one, one, uh, aggregation after another and the construction of that marvelous terminal in Midtown Manhattan, which we're all familiar with. And ultimately after the thing, uh, reaches the end of its end of its competitive lifecycle. And The New York central railroad was essentially at the end of its competitive lifecycle by the 1950s and it was there because what, what, what was hard on railroads? What was hard on passenger railroads? Long haul passenger railroads. This is a soft pitch guys.

Speaker 1:          10:03          Yes. Highway system and on and on freight. What was the big competitor? Uh, overland. Okay. So the interstate highway system with tracking and ultimately deregulated tracking, which was much more efficient. Uh, the competitive position of railroads seemed, uh, to be terminal and the Pennsylvania railroad and the New York central were combined in a bankruptcy proceeding in 1968 to form the Penn central system, uh, which, uh, soon went bankrupt and it went bankrupt because the two managements hated each other and each did as little as possible to help the other succeed. The, and this idea of a mortal life cycle of the, of the corporation is a one which comes up again and again. A week from today we'll do the Polaroid corporation, which begins as a brilliant, innovative firm and ends up playing defense against other, more brilliant, more innovative firms. Uh, only, uh, uh, uh, a generation and a half after it began.

Speaker 1:          11:18          So what really happens with railroads when you, if you don't know how to run up and the early railroads, nobody knew how to run, was that as the railroad scope or scale got larger, average costs actually went up. And the reason they went up was that you had to build a mammoth bureaucracy to run the thing. Uh, the Pennsylvania railroad got to 50,000 employees fast. And the challenge of how to organize that large workforce, uh, became severe. The first cut was spatial, the without the kind of surveillance and, uh, information technology we have today. They had the telegraph fairly early on and that's all they had. And the, the control over a massive network. This is the New York central system, uh, meant that they cut the system into sections and created a set of authorities within each such section. The ones I've drawn here in red [inaudible] illustrative.

Speaker 2:          12:32          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:32          Uh, then there was a division of function. There were people who worried about railroad cars. There were people who worried about track. There were people who dealt with passengers, others with freight, finance, cost accounting, human resources and so on. So you have all these functional stripes. All this is Chandler. I'm just simplifying what he says. Uh, these functional stripes. And then you've got the geographic sections and the question becomes, what do you do with the intersections? And the chief? My, no, my comments didn't survive. I had amusing comments in which I thought there were amusing in which known personalities, creative problems. And the, the fundamental administrative question was, do you let the functional groups, Boston geographic groups around or do you let the geographic groups boss the functional groups around? And what ended up happening was, okay,

Speaker 2:          13:46          okay,

Speaker 1:          13:47          this pattern, which ultimately gives priority to the geographic groups, it creates enormous power at the top in general management and the top people in an American railroad. We're very well compensated, uh, often, uh, took on ownership stakes. Uh, and we're true big shots. The functional people operated as staff to them. The people who did accounting, the people who did finance, the people who did construction maintenance, rolling stock and so on. And then there were a several tiers of specific managers, superintendent with responsibility for geographic areas. And they too had functionally divided staff people to worry about the rolling stock, the track, the construction, et cetera. And the pivotal, pivotal decision makers were always the people with a geographic focus. They were the ones who had to take all the factors, all the functions together and make the thing work. They became the first general managers of the modern description that Mbas are training for. Jeez. Essentially the origin of the managerial managerially operated joint stock corporation. The Europeans used a different, um, a different pattern, which gave priority to the functions. And by and large, uh, the American system worked better. Now, why are European trains so much better than American trains today? Anybody know what's here? Socialist. Okay. Yeah. Socialism is part of it. Uh, w please elaborate too. Let's get from one word to Tim. We've got Mike.

Speaker 3:          15:54          Uh, people seem to be more comfortable, good bourbon a project.

Speaker 1:          16:08          Okay. And this is particularly true of Cottonelle Europe, I think, uh, where the trains have become, uh, in many, not quite all cases, uh, publicly operated, uh, systems. There's another reason. There's a historical reason. The gasoline price of gasoline, that's another point. I hadn't actually connected the dots. Gasoline there is roughly two or three times what it is here. So passenger train for short and middle sized runs makes a lot of sense. Big historical event. Yes.

Speaker 3:          16:46          The Internet

Speaker 1:          16:49          say again, like they didn't have highways. Okay. I think, well, some of them did. I mean the German Autobahn was pretty impressive. Um, even if the Nazis built it, it was pretty good highway. The, um, what I'm fishing for here is World War II. World War II destroyed the European rail system and because it was destroyed and because of the u s Marshall Fund, which paid for an awful lot of reconstruction, uh, they started more or less from scratch and made the thing work. And we had this higgledy piggledy remnant of a previous period and never really made the investment by socialism or capitalism. The challenge of finance was, uh, equally important. Perhaps more important historically, a project that involved a high capital investment. We're funded locally, people made investments within small circles within one city, uh, within the people who live next to it. The zone where people living next to a canal or a segment of a canal would in effect buy bonds and finance the thing. Railroads were catastrophic, really expensive. They sucked up vast amounts of capital. And so a device as in the, this bridge, the EADS bridge in St Louis, over the Mississippi, there were hundreds, even thousands of terrifically expensive construction projects to be financed. And the mechanism chosen was the joint stock corporation.

Speaker 1:          18:39          And the forms of, uh, of funding took were of two main kinds. I'm going to get to some detail in a minute. One were railroad bonds where people in effect loaned money to the railroads and achieved a, a predictable income, relatively predictable income from that investment in debt. The other was the joint stock queer you bought into the equity of the company and became a partial owner. So world railroad grid. And I'd like you to just in passing notice the very uneven density of it. And the fairly strong correlation between the density, the railroad grid and the wealth of the place. The railroads were both cause and effect of capitalist development where the railroads, there was capitalist development where capitalist development, railroads and colonialism had artifact Africa's railway system got developed, not so much to create internal markets as to get goods quickly and efficiently out for shipment to uh, the uh, metropolitan power, which uh, which controlled the colonization. Okay. No, a chart, the dreaded chart. And here we've, we have on the vertical dimension three major forms of ownership. Indeed, these are the three most important forms of ownership. Proprietorship means outright ownership. You just own it. End of story.

Speaker 1:          20:39          Partnership means what it says and interestingly, and for reasons you'll probably figure out by the end of the hour if you don't know it already, partnerships tend to be used in a certain kind of company. And it's a company where the value of the firm consists largely in the talent of its employees. So that the big consulting firms, the big investment banks, uh, the big law firms all take the form of partnerships and that they are, and that actually changes at one of the HBS cases you're getting is the one where Goldman Sachs ceases to be a partnership and becomes a company. Uh, and of course third, the joint stock corporation. Then we look at each of these, uh, with the five, uh, considerations across the top in mind. One is how, what's the accountability chain here? How do we keep people doing their job? How do we see the difference between a job well done in a job poorly done?

Speaker 1:          21:47          Uh, the second is the role of ownership and uh, the third is liability. Every one of these is a huge factor in understanding this. Uh, the fourth is liquidity. If I own something or a part of something, how easy is it for me to sell out? Uh, and finally, scalability, to what extent can we start with something small and grow something enormous? And the three forms, very importantly in each of these five dimensions and I, I'm afraid I'm going to walk you through them. The chain of a chain of accountability and a proprietorship is pretty simple. I own it, I run it. I'm the boss. I hire and fire the employees. I make the business decisions. I don't submit plans to anyone else. I just do it. And in a very small enterprise that has its advantages in a partnership, things are more complicated. The trouble with a partnership is this, every partner has a right to participate in management and I can't, I can't admit a new partner without the consent of the other partners. Now the workaround for this is the, the hybrid form, which creates a general partner who runs it and then a bunch of limited investment partners who participate passively and lots and lots of things take that, that hybrid form. But the pure partnership is very awkward. You've got to talk to everybody all the time. It's like being married to a room full of people at once. What a nightmare.

Speaker 1:          23:41          Uh, the corporation, the chain of accountability is very different. And it looks like this. You've got investors over here, you've got capital markets with brokerages, a stock exchanges and such. Like, uh, then you've got a board of directors, then top management, then layers of other management, and then layer upon layer of regular employees. And the chain of accountability is the white line. And I've made this one a little crooked because it is a little crooked. Have you, how many of you own stock in a specific company? Not. Okay. Can, can we get a mic down to this gentleman here with the olive colored shirt please? Uh, is it a publicly traded company? Name it please.

Speaker 2:          24:45          Pardon?

Speaker 1:          24:48          Okay. And, uh, you take an active role in running the company. Uh, do you like everything that management does?

Speaker 2:          24:57          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          24:59          Uh, why don't you fix it then? Okay. And, and if you called up the CEO and said, I don't like what you're doing, how do you imagine the conversation would run? We'd be short. And what would his suggestion? He is not in decent suggestion.

Speaker 2:          25:26          Pardon?

Speaker 1:          25:28          Okay. Pound sand or sell the damn stock. You don't like it, get out right and the characteristically week control that investors have here puts enormous important on the exit option. Indeed, the exit option becomes dominant and in day trading for example, what people are doing is owning companies for very short periods, owning tiny slices of companies for very short periods and exercising. No influence or accountability, but just I don't like it. I'm gone or the, I believe the price is going to fall. I'll short the stock and get out so that what you've created here is a brilliant device for scooping up small amounts of investment from a large amount of people, a large number of people. So that with the joint stock corporation you can have thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of investors. They don't know each other. They don't talk to each other.

Speaker 1:          26:41          By and large, only the large institutional investors track the company's behavior with any care. The specific fundamentals of the company and the the distancing. Think about proprietorship where the, where the boss is in the shop and partnership, where the owners are the partners who actually do it. We've come a long way from that with the joint stock corporation and it's an extremely efficient device for raising money in that way. The internal operation on the other hand is complex and you've got market mechanisms of exchange outside the firm, but inside the firm you've got to manage people, you've got to incent them, motivate them to do what needs doing for the firm and the board of directors plays a symbolically central role in all this because they pick top management and top management is accountable to them, at least in theory. And if you think about the recent crisis in American capitalism, a lot of it has to do with the fact that boards have failed sometimes catastrophic Lee to exercise any real accountability on top management.

Speaker 1:          28:12          The characteristic problem, which I've mentioned to you a couple of times about the firm is so called principal agency. I hire you to do something and you go off and do it or not. For example, let's suppose I run something as simple as a bar and I hire you. I'm not there in the evening and I hired you to run the bar and I give you an an an hourly wage and I let you keep your tips, uh, what might occur to you as a way to maximize your income at my expense free. Who set it? Free drinks or the very deep poor, right? You order a scotch, I pour you a double. You Save the five bucks and give me two of them. Uh, and the characteristic of the situation is that you have, what's your advantage over me in scamming me this way? You keep the tips, but how do you manage to get away with it?

Speaker 1:          29:23          If you, if you called me up and said I'm going to do this, I'd say you're fired. Right? But you get away with it. Why I'm not there. You have the eyes and ears on the scene and I don't. So you're the agent, you have a, this is so called asymmetry, you know a lot more than I do about what you're doing. And so the characteristic problem for four people trying to manage inside the box inside the firm is to keep others for whom they are for whose achievements or malfeasance. They're accountable to keep them motivated and honest. The role of ownership, the sole proprietor runs the thing simple as that partnership. They are all there except if you have the general partner. But in general the partners say in a law firm they are all involved. They will typically create an an an executive committee and maybe a managing partner, but pushed to Shovin and disagreement about the firm. They are all part of management and you make them that because they are your assets. In a good law firm, the real assets are the lawyers.

Speaker 2:          30:43          Okay?

Speaker 1:          30:44          In the corporation, the ownership role is, as we saw a few minutes ago, strongly attenuated. Now in actual, in actual fact, there are cases where a stockholder's rise up against management and uh, throw managed, throw the board out and with a new board, throw the management out. It does happen. It's just rare. And it's rare because the transaction costs, just the time and effort required to organize the shareholders is quite extreme stocks. This is a, uh, 1998 tabulation of the percentage of us households by income strata, uh, high, higher in yellow and lowest in green, uh, who directly or indirectly own among our own companies. And the, the just is just what you would think it would be. You have a majority of people with six figure incomes and you've got to inflate a little bit here from 1998 to now. Um, people with relatively high incomes, uh, are predominantly, uh, owners of companies and the rate of ownership, uh, scales down with income, which makes quite a lot of intuitive sense, but most of the stock is held in very small parcels. And the putting together of, uh, forget a majority putting together enough to be noticed, which begins at about five, 5%, uh, is a major task

Speaker 1:          32:40          liability with a proprietorship. If you do a harm to someone else, a tort, as lawyers say, if you sell someone a contaminated bottle of, of drinking water, uh, they can sue you without limit. If you're proprietorship is worth $100,000 and you've also got a home where $300,000 and savings worth another hundred thousand dollars to make half a million dollars, they can go after all of that. There is no protection against lawsuits in the proprietorship form with partnerships. Things are as bad or worse. Let's suppose Tim here and I are partners and Tim,

Speaker 2:          33:34          uh,

Speaker 1:          33:36          for reasons known only to himself creates a catastrophic train wreck on the line between new haven and New York one day and does it in the name of our proprietorship. Maybe we're in the business of something for trains and I'm on vacation in Europe and Tim calls me up and says, we've killed 110 people. Uh, things are really only the bleak my problem. Then of course, I'm sorry for Tim, I'm sorry that Tim will suffer from this, but I'm even sorry or about me because the principle of joint and several liability applies to partnerships so that the litigant can choose among the partners and go after all the deepest pockets. And that is a, that is a really major, a flaw in the ownership structure design from the individual point of view. The most striking single thing about the joint stock corporation is that it has limited liability

Speaker 2:          34:49          and the

Speaker 1:          34:51          by limited liability we mean if you own a hundred shares and they have a value of $7 a piece, there's $700 worth of capital. The most you can lose is that $700 no matter what the firm does, the firm could blow up the Atlantic coast and your liability would be limited to the $700 which would be in effect. You can lose all of your investment, but you can't do worse. Now that's a hell of a deal. That's an enormously attractive deal and if you think about the purpose of the joint stock corporation, it's easy to understand. It's easy to understand because we want people to make investments over something they can't control and can't really see inside very clearly. Now we will, I'll ask you before the terms over to have a look at a quarterly filing by a company. So you get to see about what investors can see.

Speaker 1:          35:53          But if you can't control it and have no, no very powerful surveillance over its behavior, you wouldn't want to invest in it unless you are granted relief from liability. And that's exactly the design. And there was a hundred years ago, a race to the bottom among the American states in how generously they treat corporations under the law. And the reigning champion among American States for corporate law is Delaware, Delaware corporations abound everywhere and in particular in places that aren't Delaware or even close, because these provisions are tightest from the corporate point of view, uh, liquidity proprietorships are hard to sell. Um, in fact, often it's impossible to really get the value out of them when you sell them outside the family. Um, and often in fact with say retailing, the value of the firm is substantially the goodwill toward the owner that customers have. And when the owner sells it to somebody else, uh, the value may go to zero.

Speaker 1:          37:15          Although I was just, uh, I had a boat in a marina on Lake Champlain for a long time and I've got tireder and Tireder of the management of the Marina, lazy grasping, unreliable. And I was talking to somebody on the phone yesterday and they said, you know, there are new owners up there and I thought his Ah, I may take my boat back. The, the proprietorship is a very delicate creature. The partnership is worse. Let's suppose that all of us are the partners of Wiggin and Dana Law firm in new haven where all partners, uh, except Morgan here. And Morgan is a brilliant student just finishing the Yale law school. And I'm his advocate. So I say, Morgan, I'm going to make you a partner. What do I have to do to make that happen? In theory, there are ways to shortcut this, but in theory I have to get the consent of all of you. And so the, and then suppose I say I'm tired and old and I want out. I'm going to sell Jim Alexander my partnership and Jim Alexander is generous enough to offer me a large sum of money for that partnership.

Speaker 2:          38:48          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:48          Can I just send all of you a memo about Jim now being a partner? No, you've all got to a proven and the illiquidity of the partnership as a result is notorious. The corporation is designed for liquidity. You don't even ever have to see the physical stock certificates. They are just electronic bit. The time it takes to sell, uh, to shell securities is that, and the transaction costs are extremely low compared to the other two. Now, scalability, can we make this thing big or not? And the answer here is in data. Uh, these are, can you read this from the back?

Speaker 1:          39:49          Um, there are about 18 million proprietorships in the country, a million and a third partnerships, 5 million corporations. And their average gross revenue per year are these numbers. So the standard story of a proprietorship is the dry cleaner on the corner. Who makes $1,000 a week and feels good about it. These are actually gross revenues, not net. So what that means is that the actual take home may be pretty small. Uh, and the ratios are suggestive of scalability. The joint stock corporation is made to get big and there are several subtypes of corporation, but probably the most profound threshold for corporations is the public offering, the initial public offering. When you take a firm from private to public, that is when you, for example, an s corporation is a very private kind. You can only have 75 shareholders. You get some tax breaks, but you can't market your shares to a wide public. Uh, and when you go public, um, Jim, you've been through that going public with a company, is that right? Yeah. Is there a mic for Jim? What's the process? This is a spinnaker exploration by hers is they call up,

Speaker 3:          41:34          uh, you, uh, you eventually choose a group of people that you feel comfortable with and you convert. Our analysts think that you have good prospects draw up a prospectus, which is a legal document describing sensibly ascribing to the investors the principal risks and the potential returns of the investment. You make sure that you have a, what's viewed as a lawyer, uh, uh, helping you with that reputation. You are making sure that you have a audited financials by a firm reputation. And then eventually when the time is writing, you go around the country for several weeks talking to perspective institutional investors, retail investors in most retail firms won't buy the smart money, which is deemed to be institutional, is not fine.
