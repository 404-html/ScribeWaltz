Speaker 1:          00:01          Today, what I'd like to do is focus first on desoto. Uh, and then on the larger question, you have your informal property back, Jennifer. Uh, and then on the larger question of what's the point of all this, what is the merit of capitalism? And we know a lot of things that capitalism isn't really great app. Uh, and we know that it has, if you let it run its own course, it is inclined toward instability and it is inclined toward stupendous disruption of the planet. Uh, and yet I, for one, am a, uh, guarded enthusiasm for capitalism. So the underlying point of it, a must have something to do with helping people to have a fuller capacity to lead their lives. You might call it a practical freedom and the, the subject for today and for next Monday, uh, bring that out. That is, uh, today with Desoto and I'm going to call and several of you to think about how you would use 5% of the GDP of a country to do as much good as possible.

Speaker 1:          01:34          Um, and then on Monday, uh, the white tiger, uh, which, uh, illustrates quite powerfully that increasing the average, uh, average income or wealth in a country, uh, can be a wonderful thing, but seen from the very bottom cannot be so great. Uh, and a protagonist in white tiger is a brilliant articulator, if you will, of of that problem. Okay. So, uh, the photograph in front of you is meant to call forth desotos idea of Brow Dell's Bell Jar, uh, and the foreground, uh, a vast favela, uh, is all informal property and because it's informal property, it is dead capitol. And the background, uh, is not only live capitol and formal property, but extremely dense piling up of live capital. It is an expression of intense economic, uh, activity and presumably for the most part of great economic success, desoto on page pages one 61 61 has, first of all, he has some type type face there that is a small enough that I can't read it and my guess is many of you will struggle to read it.

Speaker 1:          03:25          But at the top of the page, he has a bridge, uh, showing, uh, his prescription for the path from dead capital on the left to live capitol on the right across the top. The roadway, if you will, is the commercial strategy, the creation of businesses, uh, the taking of debt in order to create new enterprises. And then the process by which a desoto and his disciples first map out the problem, uh, and then engage in a political and legal strategy to create the framework for formalized property all the way to the bottom of society. And then the operational strategies whereby that has implemented a neighborhood at a time of Avella at a time.

Speaker 2:          04:25          MMM.

Speaker 1:          04:27          Desoto is a deadly serious about this, and it's a practical enterprise. Uh, I'm going to Peru, uh, at the end of term to, uh, sit in on a, an attempt by a desoto and his fellows to formalize a set of neighborhoods around the city. And I hope to write a business case that will be used in this course a year from now on that trip.

Speaker 2:          04:57          Now, uh, if you

Speaker 1:          05:02          take the totality of, of desotos book, uh, the only thing worse than leaving informal property informal from his point of view is force fitting a formalized system invented in a university, uh, onto an existing system of informal property. And I'd like to, uh, talk about that with you for a few minutes and give you a case, uh, from my own experience in an American setting.

Speaker 1:          05:39          Well, informal property, these are boundaries in an imaginary informal property system, uh, which correspond to the ingrained habits and customs of the people who own this property. And the, their inclination will be always to defend it against a change imposed arbitrarily from outside. And if you ask a smart professors at the Yale School of Management, uh, what's the most efficient way to lay out the boundaries of property? They'll give you something like the red grid here with right angles and straight lines and right angles and straight lines have a brilliant history in American property law. Uh, President Jefferson a laid out a grid like this on all but the northeast corner of the u s of longitude and latitude lines defining, uh, sections of 640 acres. And the whole development of the American West is actually on, with the exception of the mountainous areas. For example, the Sierra Nevadas would that exception, the whole country looks like, uh, this rectangle rectilinear grid. And as you fly from coast to coast, you can see the grid laid out, uh, in a perfectly symmetrical way with center pivot irrigation, interrupting the grid from time to time and an occasional river.

Speaker 1:          07:19          Uh, the better way according to de Soto is to adapt a formal systems to fit informal systems. So to incrementally add the perimeter, a metes and bounds shown here and ultimately to can convert the old boundaries to new boundaries. Uh, the old boundaries being recognized only by people living within this little area. Dot. New Boundaries being recognized all the way up to the nation state level and in theory, all the way up to the world level. If people from another country are engaged in a property transaction. For example, if the owner of this land, uh, seeks to take debt from a bank in New York and the property is in Peru, uh, the whole world's system is involved in the formalization and the obligation of the Peruvian government to honor a contract with an American bank would come into play. And so even the, even at the very lowest level, the ultimate chain of connections to the top level of government on a world scale, uh, is important.

Speaker 1:          08:47          Um, nearly 20 years ago, um, a fellow named Kurt Schmoke, a Yale class of about 1970, uh, and sometimes senior fellow of the Yale Corporation, uh, was mayor of Baltimore. And I didn't actually have him as a student here, but I was working then on, uh, cities that had too much housing and which I called under a crowded cities. If you read all the city planning books from that period, it's all about how do we handle all this new population that has to be housed. And of course, the real story for a city like Baltimore was a vast housing surplus. Uh, anybody come from Baltimore Wa or, all right, I'll settle for Washington or Philadelphia or Wilmington. What have we got in the back there? What, what city? Okay. Can you, and we've got a mic for him.

Speaker 1:          09:58          Can you give us a, a, a feel for what an neighborhood constructed of row houses looks like? How it's organized? Well, I can tell you about Baltimore's. I see it on the train. It looks just like that all the houses are boarded up, all their backyards or trashed and there's a lot of vacancy and just desolate wasteland. Okay. It's still a mess, right? Which means I was not very effective. Um, and Mayor Schmoke was not very effective. The, um, the difficulty with row houses or what the economists call an inferior good, the standard Baltimore row houses nine feet wide, the widest are 16 feet wide. So it's like living in a railroad car, uh, or in, if it's a tall one, two or three real railroad cars stacked on top of each other. And by and large, people prefer ranch houses, which are more more, which more nearly approximate a square layout.

Speaker 1:          10:59          And people also don't like, uh, living around visible signs of decay like the ones just describe. And when I came on the scene, and this is a very abstract representation, but the green dots represent the, the squares represent property units and the green dots represent occupied units. The yellow dots represent units that are still standing but condemned. And the blank units represent areas where the house has been torn down. And there, there's no, this, there's no precision in what I'm doing here, but it'll show you the difficulty of trying to change something for the better, uh, in a, in it, I didn't even know desotos work at this time. I was acting on the same general intuitions, uh, that he has,

Speaker 1:          12:04          that we're at the edge of the bell jar, the slides just in the wrong place. But the red line is the edge of the bell jar. Well, one solution to missing properties is to install waterfalls. This was done as a joke by a student at Johns Hopkins. Uh, it didn't involve in the actual water or construction. It's just a photographic joke. Um, but another approach and the one that I advocated is to triage neighborhoods and to take a neighborhood like this where you have very few occupied units, most of what's there standing is condemned and lots of vacant lots. And to say, let's find a way to use the wealth of people living here to improve conditions in a more promising adjacent neighborhood. So the first thought, uh, is that you take down the, uh, condemned houses in the unworkable area. Uh, and at the same time you offer a swaps where you buy for what it's worth, which is not a lot. You buy houses in the unworkable area from people and part of their payment is clear title to a similar space in a more promising and nearby neighborhood. So there is a, uh, you were creating a market here that has a barter element in it for land and a small cash payment and a, uh, uh, an effort to admit it to facilitate the financing of replacement housing.

Speaker 3:          14:29          Okay.

Speaker 1:          14:31          Uh, actually has a slide deck. And so after the people make those moves, this is theory. You get a much denser occupancy grid in the top and you get some benefit from that one. One is that crime generally goes down. A neighborhood which is mostly vacant lots is an invitation to criminal activity and the statistics on this area in Baltimore, and it had hundreds of areas like this one, the crime statistics are brutal. Uh, another fact is that the administration of public services is wildly inefficient, where only a few houses in a neighborhood, uh, have trash to take away a where streets need to be plowed and cleaned, uh, even when very few people use them. Uh, and where police services are stretched extremely thin. So the idea is to densify one area at the expense of another, uh, and then to demolish, uh, to demolish and replace the condemned houses in the stronger neighborhood. And you've made some progress. Well, the first thing, the first thing that, what's the first objection that comes to mind?

Speaker 3:          16:09          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          16:10          What do you do with this? This is now vacant area.

Speaker 1:          16:17          What do you do with it? Anybody got a suggestion? Sasha? Make it a park. That's good. Uh, and it could be a park with a huge lake in it. Likes are much easier to administer them. You don't have to mow lakes. And a crime is relatively scarce on aquatic crime is so far as I know, rare. Um, or in some points that you make it a golf course. Uh, there was a place in Miami where they've created a zone where they've just, uh, it just grows wild. It's largely bamboo and there's a 12 foot fence around it. And the thought is that 50 years from now somebody will figure out what to do with it. Um, the, so that's one problem, but there's another set of problems that are even tougher.

Speaker 1:          17:21          And that is that all of these neighborhoods have leaders and leaders are not really very generous about having you take their followers away, right? People who are say, Alderman or people who are head of a neighborhood development board or of a neighborhood crime watch, they all come forward and they say, this is madness. These people live in perfectly good houses where they are. And the ultimate effect is to drive the transaction costs through the ceiling. The costs of getting the deals made is, uh, astronomically high. I mean, it's a, it's, it's a perfect illustration of why the Coase theorem is serious because if the transaction costs are high enough, even obviously beneficial to all sides swaps, uh, just don't happen. And De Soto is dealing with environments in which transaction costs are extremely high in which the difficulty of getting things like this done, uh, are, uh, is just very, very great so that it's fine for you and I to read this elegant little book, but that's very different from actually accomplishing things on the street so that this triangular relationship between imagine an imaginary leaders, uh, would become a dominant obstacle to completion of the task back to coast.

Speaker 1:          19:14          Uh, the thesis, as you will remember, is that where there are clear cut entitlements, a high degree of transparency and symmetrical transparency and low transaction costs, efficient swaps are feasible. And on the surface, uh, Desoto is all about clear entitlements, but he's perfectly aware that without, uh, being able to execute economic transactions, for example, borrowing against a clear entitlement, uh, very little has been accomplished. And that if a corruption, for example, interdicts transparency, those transactions won't happen. Or if they do, they will be the wrong transactions. So one way to think about about how to use desoto practically is to take the three conditions from, uh, this simplified version of the coasts theorem and put them in a table with relatively practical, uh, categories that you can, you can deal with and then look for ways in which, for example, uh, education,

Speaker 2:          20:52          my impact, uh, transparency and so on.

Speaker 1:          20:57          I'm going to, I mean, uh, what I want to do is proceed much less formally than this. The charters, it's kind of, it's a very rigid framework. It's not a bad framework, but it's a rigid one. Now have some of you thought about how you'd spend 5% of the GDP of a country wave if you have, I've got one too.

Speaker 2:          21:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:24          More w one, two, no one in this section three. No one's fessing up in the front row here. Over here. Okay. We're going to, oh, there we are on the back. All right, so we're going to do some winging here, I'm afraid.

Speaker 2:          21:45          That's okay.

Speaker 1:          21:55          And lastly, will you trade me places?

Speaker 2:          21:59          Um, Yup. There's some truck

Speaker 1:          22:07          now what the exercises to figure out if we can create large increments in useful wealth by spending money.

Speaker 2:          22:19          Was it Tom? Is it, what have we got?

Speaker 4:          22:25          So I think it's education. It's sort of the key to everything else.

Speaker 1:          22:28          Okay. You would put education ahead of any of all of other things, all other things. Okay. Uh, help us understand why,

Speaker 4:          22:36          uh, because I think having human capital can increase your investment and everything else, but without that you're not going at it. The people that you need to build roads or expand property rights or all these other things.

Speaker 1:          22:49          Okay. So education a relatively well educated populace is a necessary condition, is that what you're saying? Absolutely. Okay. Are there any necessary conditions to a well educated population?

Speaker 4:          23:04          Uh, well educated teachers.

Speaker 1:          23:06          Okay. So we have to have a well educated teachers. Do we, are there any other things we probably need?

Speaker 2:          23:12          Yes.

Speaker 1:          23:16          Food running, clean water, electricity, all the infrastructure. You buy that Tom Sister. Okay. So education was expensive to begin with and now it's looking more expensive. So we're probably gonna need more than 5% of GDP to get very far with that. But that's a good thing.

Speaker 2:          23:37          Tall.

Speaker 1:          23:41          The other problem with education is, is

Speaker 4:          23:43          that unless the costs

Speaker 5:          23:46          of the education for those workers are, are not extremely high, they're not, they're not going to go to school. The kids will end up trying to make as little, as much money as they can to support their families. Okay, perfect. I ended up actually educate, absolutely

Speaker 1:          24:00          spot on. And then there's an incident in white tiger, which is exactly about that, where the uncle comes and drags the, our protagonist away from school because his Labor has been exchanged in a family deal. Yes. Back. Let's just put a little lag in the conversation. So the, the mix get there.

Speaker 6:          24:27          There's also a cultural problem, like certain societies don't want females to go to school, so there's something deeper than just, you know, opportunity costs at work there that must be dealt with in other ways.

Speaker 1:          24:37          Okay. Uh, I, I'm sure you're right. She, can you give a specific example?

Speaker 6:          24:45          Um, well I was watching a movie, it was about, um, it was about like an Indian societies in which like women are not allowed to go to school and helped. Um, that figure in the movie to leading hero was actually based on a real life figure who went into the village and convinced all these different families to let their children go to school. Um, because it would be better for them in the long run but like not based on opportunity costs but basically tried to change their cultural kind of closed.

Speaker 1:          25:19          Okay. And what, what's behind this prohibition on educating women? Do Spouse?

Speaker 6:          25:25          Um, I think it's partly to do with the meals,

Speaker 1:          25:28          so nice to, so I'll put that on the APP.

Speaker 6:          25:32          I know that in certain families as well, like the female cannot be more educated than a male in America.

Speaker 1:          25:40          I certainly believe in.

Speaker 6:          25:41          Yeah. So I'm, sometimes a family believes that if they are females are too educated, then they won't be able to marry them off or something like that.

Speaker 1:          25:51          Okay. That's terrific. Right? Yeah. Yes.

Speaker 6:          25:57          You also need infrastructure in place and laws in an economy place for like what they're gonna do after they go to school. So like in Cuba they have fantastic education but no opportunities for anyone like after that's finished. So for education to be effective, like you also have to invest in sort of like the next step.

Speaker 1:          26:19          Okay. So for education to be effective we have to have a next step. Is the Cuban example when you know well,

Speaker 6:          26:28          uh, I wouldn't say I know. Well that scares me. I don't want you to ask me that question. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          26:34          Well, can you, I mean I've got a couple of, I've been to Cuba a couple of times and I have a couple of Cuba stories that good fill in the blank. But how about you was drying first?

Speaker 6:          26:44          Um, I tried to go to Cuba last year. I didn't get a visa, so I don't know it as well as I would.

Speaker 3:          26:50          Um, they have,

Speaker 6:          26:53          well it has a lot. I mean it has a lot to do with the like communist socialist model. There's just no, there just aren't any jobs, aren't any. So like if you're educated as a lawyer, you just end up being like a taxi driver no matter what. So

Speaker 1:          27:09          good Thursday, I have a friend who might met in Havana who was sort of top five among the fishery scientist in Cuba, phd in biology. And he was, he kept giving the wrong advice after the Russians pulled out in the so called special period. Uh, the government wanted to double and double and double the harvest of shrimp and there are limits on the ecosystem and he kept saying you can't do it. And finally they declared him unemployable and the effect of that was that he became a taxi driver and troubled his income. It was still a very low income, but it was trouble when he was making as a scientist. Hands over here. Yes. Have we got a second mic working here? Anywhere?

Speaker 6:          28:06          Okay. One of the downsides of education is brain drain. You put all your resources into educating people, but there are better opportunities in other countries for them to go work, make money and stay there. So if you are going to put education as your main emphasis to need to have some sort of incentive within your own country to have people remain okay. Tom, do you want to answer that?

Speaker 3:          28:27          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          28:30          So I, I agree that that's a problem, but I think it's maybe less of a problem than it first appears because of remittances where even in cases of brain drain where people get well educated, go to be doctors in America rather than in India, there's still going to send some percentage of that money home in the form of remittances, which can do a lot in itself to prop up and they copy great toward the back.

Speaker 7:          28:55          So I won't take all the credit for this. Richard has been convinced me by degrees as this goes on. Uh, I think that, I mean, I think you'd rather have 100% of that income in your country and the wait to get that would be, uh, through, for instance, great. Creating pools of capital in your country through direct foreign investment and in the way you would get that is through investments in infrastructure and security.

Speaker 1:          29:14          Okay. So now we're, we're, we have veered a long way from education when we talk about direct foreign investment. Um, would you put that as a high priority?

Speaker 7:          29:27          Yeah. Higher than education because I think that that comes, but I think you need to, I need to be able to give people jobs and, and a livelihood before you can think about educating them. Okay. What do you think Tom?

Speaker 4:          29:43          So I think you're sort of endorsing the idea of offering your country up is to be colonialized won't last. Right. In saying that, well, the best thing that we can do to spur economic growth is to offer herself as an extractive nation and we'll build the roads for people to come in and take out what they need it. And I don't, I don't know if that's the solution for long term economic with it. That's how I would read that, uh, interpretation.

Speaker 3:          30:07          Richard,

Speaker 8:          30:12          I think in the long run, in order to build sustainable growth in your country, if you're starting off where you don't have any of this infrastructure, educational facilities in place, you have to find some sort of competitive advantage. And that the initial standpoint that's going to be your labor, that's going to be your resources. Anything you can offer up that's going to attract investment to build out the rest of these different, um, you know, pillars of what you need in society. You can't just start off with here's the school and we're going to educate people and they're going to keep all the value within society. They're going to capitalize on it. There's not an incentive based to really do that. So until you can actually move up the ladder of competitive advantage and development of your markets and education and quality of life, it's sort of putting the cart before the horse in my opinion.

Speaker 1:          30:54          Okay. Now, um, what's fairly obvious in this conversation is that you've got to try to do more than one thing at once, right? We just say education full, full stop. Or if we say foreign direct investment, full stop, we're not going to get it done. And there has to be a complex spiral of these things. And this is why the book by Clark that we read is one persuasive on this point because it takes one thing at a time and then says, well that won't do it. And it's the spiraling of several things at once. A show shot effect.

Speaker 9:          31:40          I think the problem goes back to the question at hand because of the 5% of the GDP, you really can't talk a little louder. I think the problem goes back to the question at hand because you can't really do much with 5% of your GDP. So people are more likely to create this false dichotomy of options just because they have limited resources.

Speaker 1:          31:56          Okay. So, but if, if this were a real exercise and you had control over 5% of the GDP of Cuba or Peru or Nigeria, um, you, what would you do? You've got the 5%, what's the first thing you better figure out?

Speaker 9:          32:19          I think you have to focus on getting basic resources and developing a basic structure. So you may have to forfeit your emphasis on education immediately.

Speaker 1:          32:29          Okay. So, but the, what I'm driving at is that you would want to look at what's already happening in the right way. Right? You would want it, you'd want to, there are, if there are 12 conditions we're worried about, you'd want to survey and figure out that there were three or four where you could ride somebody else's dollar so to speak, and then you would figure out some crucial Shep of others that you would have to pay your attention to. Does that sound right? I think that's fair.

Speaker 9:          33:01          I think the problem lies in, and I'm, I was focusing on central Asian countries when you gave us this mini assignment and the problem comes when you devote everything to foreign direct investment. When do you stop? Like when do you transition back to meeting off those other criteria that you laid out in the beginning?

Speaker 8:          33:17          Okay, so, so it sounds like, it sounds like this a pretty complicated subject, Richard, I apologize. Wanted to clarify what we were, our point was, which is by attracting foreign investment, the idea is that it's not mutually exclusive. So instead of taking eliminated 5% of GDP and allocating towards one aspect of society, if you can signal to the broader market said, yeah, you're an attractive investment place. You've now grown that pool of capital such that it can be invested through all the different aspects of what you need to build society as opposed to cherry picking one over another. That's the goal of a tragic multiple investors. So, so one of,

Speaker 3:          33:57          okay,

Speaker 1:          33:58          so the one thing we're at least clear about is that there is no secret sauce, right? There's no one secret sauce that is going to get this job done. It's vastly more complex. Now, who did you have your hand up a moment ago? I did, but I think it's, um, it's been a cover. Sure. Okay. Uh, who's, who will give us a fresh start all over again. I was going to say that what desoto keeps emphasizing is the importance of political leadership. Somebody forgets, is that in many of these developing countries, the political leadership itself is very corrupt and as long as it's within the leadership's best interest to move the society forward. So I thought that empowering education will give us better leaders that would follow desotos ideas of transforming debt capital last show you and Tom are playing the same tune more or less? Yeah, same tune. It's slightly different rationale. Yeah. Okay, good.

Speaker 9:          35:02          I was just about to add to that with an example actually of a Kosovo case that I had experienced the summer. Um, when I was in close, they had a hard time attracting leaders because most of them had like fled as refugees and the 99 more, um, so the USA ID program had invested in instead of like this foreign direct investment project. I mean like there their projects in that as well. But it professional studies course that educates leaders, particularly in finance and investments in these sorts of things. So it's bringing the brain drain back, whoa. Like back into the country and investing in leaders instead of, and so then once they have an efficient,

Speaker 6:          35:38          like leadership base, they can go out and like do these things themselves.

Speaker 1:          35:41          Did I just hear you say that MBA education is the most important thing in the world?

Speaker 6:          35:46          Would that be nice?

Speaker 1:          35:49          But, uh, who would are there? Why am I doing that? Who would start us with an entirely different starting point? Yes. Wait for the mic. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          36:12          I don't know how you'd do this with 5% of the GDP, but I think if there were a secret sauce, it would be efficiency and low transaction costs. Is this coming from like my experience in Latin America, which like I've worked there and I've traveled there and I don't even understand how they do business there ever because it's so inefficient. Um, like down to little things like I know when when on Saturdays they don't have enough coins, but you can only pay with coins to ride the bus. But like there's a shortage of coins. And so sometimes you just can't like get on the bus because you like have cash but you don't have coins. Um, so like little things like that, I don't know how you would like, where you would even begin to invest to make those things more efficient. But I think the like foreign directed investment and the competitive advantage all flow from that. Like you're not going to be a good candidate unless you have like low transaction costs within that country.

Speaker 1:          37:10          Okay. So what of what I think I hear you saying is that you've got to get the coast there. I'm working

Speaker 6:          37:18          right and that has something to do with corruption or a lot to do with corruption of the government. Yup. Um, and like the legal system.

Speaker 1:          37:25          Okay, go ahead. Yes.

Speaker 10:         37:33          A couple of things I do here, so if you're getting 5% of the GDP, one thing that we should keep in mind is that we can assume that the economy will go on forever. So I have not spent 5% of the GDP in that way given ERL divided over a number of years. The second is that the money that I'd be getting and not leave a penny in the hands of the comment, I would give it to the private sector, Al Yamaka thousand villages and as the private sector to use that money in those thousand villages the next year based on their performances. The second allotment that I would get out of that 5% of the GDP would be again given to the private companies who have performed well, now I'll leave it up to them. How do they want to develop the villages? That can be a holistic development. It can be a incomplete development, it can be corrupt development. But the second year three sources would be only going on the basis of the quality of the development.

Speaker 1:          38:26          Okay. So what you want to do is put as much rocket fuel as you can in the rockets that are already moving.

Speaker 10:         38:33          Exactly. But it makes sure that the rockets,

Speaker 5:          38:36          the next day, the rockets move based on the performance of the rockets.

Speaker 1:          38:40          And if you were a public official, would, would there be some problem about that? You imagine a lot of problems, right? Because I mean, the natural tendency is to redistribute from the functioning rackets to the nonfunctioning rockets. Right? And the action we saw at 20 times earlier in term about how a defining characteristic of capitalism is that failing enterprise with spam. Right? And that's one of the ways capitalism becomes a learning machine.

Speaker 2:          39:15          So, um,

Speaker 1:          39:18          you are a cruel, a cruel but wise man.

Speaker 2:          39:24          Yes.

Speaker 5:          39:27          In many ways. This is,

Speaker 7:          39:28          I guess the sort of the opposite of the last comment, but you could also see some validity to the point of using that money to try to, um, improve government and capacity and their sounds because as we've been discussing, the government is really a strong point for creating the stability needed for investment in other, in other parts of the economy. So if there was some way to say like, use, use the money to increase the reach of the government into more rural regions of the country or to create secure borders, things like that. Um, that I think that that could have a potentially positive effect and it's a sort of a more direct, um, direct and centralized use of it. So it might be a little bit easier. Obviously you run into problems with corruption in government and that's minor, but

Speaker 1:          40:21          so that's a very plausible thought, right? Where you have a weak state, which doesn't have the ability, ability to actually enforce the law,

Speaker 2:          40:32          uh,

Speaker 1:          40:33          or to carry out policy and an effective way, say in rural areas, think of western China or large chunks of Afghanistan or nearly all of Somalia, uh, strengthening the state. If you've got the right incentives for the people who benefit directly from the increment of power, you've got to have the right people there with the right incentives. And if you have the wrong people with the wrong incentive, you're actually gonna make things worse.

Speaker 2:          41:02          Okay. Tall.

Speaker 5:          41:10          I sort of have two different, very different ideas. One that's sort of bottom up and when that sort of top down from two different parts of the world, the first one that sort of bottom up, uh, would build on the work of sort of micro finance. Um, especially in India and countries like that where we've seen that if you give entrepreneurs, even at the village, some basic capital, they can even based on their input that they're dead capital sort of, they can turn it into live capitol, um, themselves, um, especially women. Um, and if you focus on that you can maybe build up sort of a local economy that's sustainable in its own right and not just, um, sort of at the whim of FDI at the same time. Um, to use a part of the world that I'm a little more familiar with. Um, Israel, my parents are from Israel and spent a good deal of time.

Speaker 5:          42:03          There used to be, it was built up. I'm going to keep boot system of socialist system, um, and had many of the same problems of the former communist nations almost at first and then transitioned into a much more capitalist, a market oriented economy, one that is arguably quite strong. And part of the way that was accomplished was as much as it pains me to say through state sponsored enterprise as much in the way that China, um, accomplished it. Um, and in the sort of building up of basic utilities and infrastructure and the companies that serve the people's needs for those and then sort of spread outwards, eventually turning that informal sort of communal property into individual property and live capital.

Speaker 1:          42:52          Okay, let's stop and take stock here for a minute, right? We've heard, um, a dozen or 15 points of view, uh, every single one of them intelligent, oh and no single one of them. Any major fraction of an answer.

Speaker 1:          43:15          So there is some pattern of webbing together, different strategies and of costume fitting, uh, those strategies to the circumstance of actual countries and actual cultures and actual governmental systems and actual infrastructure systems. We've said very little so far today about infrastructure and arguably, uh, trains. Planes harbored all lap a should be at important, at least late stage and very possibly middle stage element in our strategy. Uh, next time, uh, where our text is the white tiger and I would like to be able to call on you to bring forth the anecdotes from white tiger because we're going to use it as follows. The circumstances described in this brilliant novel are almost invariably circumstances that are destructive of wealth formation.

Speaker 1:          44:26          And so think about the search, the events, which happened the book, and then in class we're going to flip them on their heads, so to speak, and talk about what might be beneficial. Uh, to the protagonist and more generally to a village in India and a village Indian Indians who come in the language of the book, out of the darkness into the cities. Uh, and I'll show you a short film clip of a company called Selco, which is in the business of making off grid electric lighting for village in India. Uh, and then before the end of term, you'll see a full business case about this company. It's a for profit company, uh, and it depends on micro finance to sell, uh, lighting. There are many parts of India where there just isn't any artificial light. And, uh, uh, it's, uh, quite, quite inspiring and interesting case. So I'll see you on Monday. And if you haven't yet read every last page of white tiger, do it over the weekend.
