00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.510
Today we will examine a leading case on the parol evidence rule Alaska northern

2
00:00:06.541 --> 00:00:10.500
development versus Alyeska pipeline services.

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.660
Suppose you sign a written contract but at the time of signing you'd agreed to

4
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:20.661
additional terms orally are the additional oral law or agreement terms and

5
00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:26.021
forcible the parole evidence rule determines when parties to a written contract

6
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.150
can present extrinsic evidence to clarify or add to terms in the written

7
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:33.354
contract.

8
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.670
The parole evidence rule is related to our earlier discussion of the statute of

9
00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:39.504
frauds.

10
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.160
The statute of frauds determines when non four corners evidence.

11
00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:49.161
Extrinsic evidence can establish the existence of a contract while the parole

12
00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:54.651
evidence rule determines when non four corners evidence can establish the terms

13
00:00:55.861 --> 00:00:56.850
of a contract.

14
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.900
Both rules can be seen as attempts at deterring parties from falsely alleging

15
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.070
that a duty is owed.

16
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:10.380
The statute of frauds makes it harder for someone to falsely claim that she had

17
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:13.990
an oral agreement with someone else.
The parole evidence rule,

18
00:01:13.991 --> 00:01:18.300
it makes it harder for someone to falsely claim that an actual agreement

19
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.300
includes additional terms that were never agreed to,

20
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.140
but both rules can perversely increase the amount of fraud by making it easier

21
00:01:27.631 --> 00:01:31.920
for someone to falsely deny the existence of actual promises.

22
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.230
Here the parole evidence rule can make it easier for someone who actually agreed

23
00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:42.231
in an ancillary oral agreement to take on additional responsibilities to falsely

24
00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:45.690
deny that she ever promised to do so.

25
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.750
The parole evidence rule is a substantive rule in contract cases.

26
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.560
The word parole literally means word and parole.

27
00:01:55.561 --> 00:02:00.270
Evidence refers to evidence outside the four corners of the written agreement.

28
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.110
The parole evidence rule is a common law rule that is also codified in the UCC

29
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:10.890
section two Dash Two oh two broadly speaking,

30
00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:15.891
the rule states that where the parties to a contract intended for their written

31
00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:20.250
agreement to be the full and final expression of their bargain,

32
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.700
other written or oral agreements that were made prior to or a simultaneous with

33
00:02:26.131 --> 00:02:31.110
the writing are inadmissible for the purpose of changing the terms of the

34
00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:34.710
written agreement.
To take a clear example.

35
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.920
If Roger Agrees in writing to sell a widget to Julie for $2,000 Julie cannot

36
00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:46.071
argue that Roger Orally told her she would only need to pay $1,000.

37
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.290
The parole evidence rule would prevent Julie from bringing evidence of the oral

38
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:55.800
agreement that contradicts the written agreement.

39
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.290
But it does allow,
uh,

40
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.350
the terms to be explained or supplemented unquote if the conditions of

41
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:07.390
subsection a and B are met.

42
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.720
There is a complicated,
this is a,
uh,

43
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.730
this section of the UCC is incredibly complicated and among other things,

44
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:20.170
it's important to keep in mind whether the extrinsic evidence is being offered

45
00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:25.171
to explain an ambiguous term or whether it's being offered as a supplemental

46
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.913
term.

47
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.070
The UCC always has the potential to allow extrinsic evidence,

48
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:37.081
including course of dealing or usage of trade or course or performance evidence

49
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.720
to be offered to help interpret or explain an ambiguous term,

50
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.240
but it's sometimes precludes extrinsic evidence to supplement contracts.

51
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.620
The key reasons for excluding extrinsic evidence for the purpose of

52
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:57.490
supplementing is when the agreement is integrated.

53
00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:58.721
The restatement.

54
00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:03.721
Second of contracts defines integrated agreements as writings that constitute

55
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.820
quote,

56
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.410
a final expression of one or more terms of the agreement unquote.

57
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.040
There are two types of integrations and integrated agreement is either partially

58
00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:19.060
or completely integrated.

59
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.690
Completely integrated agreement is a final expression of all of the terms as to

60
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:28.240
which the parties agreed or as the restatement puts it,

61
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.450
an agreement adopted quote by the parties as a complete an exclusive statement

62
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.450
of the terms of the agreement unquote.
Nowadays,

63
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.050
parties may choose to include a merger or integration clause,

64
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:46.051
which simply states that the written contract is a complete Lee integrated one.

65
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.570
The name merger clause is a bit misleading.

66
00:04:49.571 --> 00:04:54.520
It might suggest that any ancillary oral agreements are merged into and become

67
00:04:54.521 --> 00:04:55.840
part of the written agreement,

68
00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.440
but it means just the opposite that any ancillary oral agreements are not merged

69
00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:05.830
into the,
uh,
into the enforceable part of the written agreement.

70
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.470
A partially integrated agreement is just any integrated agreement.

71
00:05:11.471 --> 00:05:15.760
That's not the complete and exclusive statement of all the agreed terms.

72
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.670
It contains some,
but not all of the final terms of the,
uh,

73
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.300
that the parties have agreed to.

74
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.790
The difference between a complete and partially integrated contract is an

75
00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:32.020
important part of the controversy in the Alyeska.
A case

76
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.750
plaintiff appellant buyer,
uh,

77
00:05:37.751 --> 00:05:42.751
Alaska northern development a and d submitted a letter of intent to the

78
00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:48.301
defendant appellee seller Alyeska proposing to purchase defendants inventory of

79
00:05:49.841 --> 00:05:51.580
Caterpillar machinery parts.

80
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.530
Defendant responded with this similar letter condition condition,

81
00:05:56.531 --> 00:06:00.980
though upon quote,
final approval of the owner committee unquote.

82
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.550
Neither letter specified the price for the proposed sale at a subsequent meeting

83
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:08.870
between representatives of the two firms,

84
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:13.070
the price was agreed upon and added to the defendant's letter.

85
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.610
Defendant's representative Ricketts Alyeska is manager of contracts and material

86
00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:23.480
management signed this modified letter.
Uh,

87
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.710
the defendant's owner's committee,
however,
refuse to sell on any grounds,

88
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:30.170
not just because they disagreed on price.

89
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.990
The trial court granted summary Judgment for the defendant and the instant court

90
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.853
affirmed.

91
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.420
Before we move on to the holdings in this case,

92
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.550
let's make sure we understand the facts.

93
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.270
What type of parole evidence does uh,
and,

94
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.130
and the buyer in this case want to introduce?
Well,

95
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.140
Andy wants to introduce extrinsic evidence that the parties agreed that final

96
00:06:57.141 --> 00:07:02.000
approval that this final approval clause was meant to limit owner the owner's

97
00:07:02.001 --> 00:07:07.001
committee to consideration of whether the price was fair and reasonable and that

98
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.170
and that was the only basis on which they could turn down the uh,
contract.

99
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.980
If the owner committee rejects the contract for other reasons,

100
00:07:15.981 --> 00:07:20.981
it would be a breach in other word and wants to introduce extrinsic evidence to

101
00:07:21.111 --> 00:07:25.400
argue that Alyeska his conduct was a breach of the contract.

102
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.860
The issue in this case is whether plaintiff's parole evidence this extrinsic

103
00:07:30.861 --> 00:07:34.370
evidence was correctly excluded at top.
At trial,

104
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.470
the court held that yes,
the exclusion of parole evidence was proper.

105
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.640
There was a partial integration of the writing and given this,

106
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:49.060
the alleged oral agreement to limit approval to price is not a consistent

107
00:07:49.491 --> 00:07:53.840
additional term because it was not in reasonable harmony with the integrated

108
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:58.841
writing before we take on the courts multistep tests to determine whether the

109
00:08:01.401 --> 00:08:04.520
extrinsic evidence can be used to supplement the agreement.

110
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:08.300
Let's look at how the court responded to the plaintiff's argument that the

111
00:08:08.301 --> 00:08:12.990
extrinsic evidence should be admitted to explain.
And a,

112
00:08:12.991 --> 00:08:17.991
and then big ewas term courts will only allow extrinsic evidence to be

113
00:08:18.981 --> 00:08:21.200
introduced to explain a written provision.

114
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:26.470
If that written provision is ambiguous and the extrinsic evidence is offered in

115
00:08:27.021 --> 00:08:32.021
support of an interpretation to which the writing is reasonably reasonably

116
00:08:33.411 --> 00:08:34.250
susceptible.

117
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:40.090
Reasonable susceptibility is the crucial concept in this diagram.

118
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:45.820
Each point inside the blue oval represents a different possible interpretation

119
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.360
to which the writing is reasonably susceptible.

120
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.410
Courts apply section t applying section two,

121
00:08:54.411 --> 00:08:59.411
two oh two would admit extrinsic evidence to help support and interpretation

122
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.230
inside the oval,

123
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.560
but not an interpretation that lies outside the set of interpretations to which

124
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:08.790
the writing is reasonably susceptible.

125
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:14.390
So the court would allow admitting explit extrinsic evidence to support an

126
00:09:15.211 --> 00:09:19.920
interpretation.
Let's say here,
but not to support an interpretation.

127
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.710
Let's say out here.
So for example,

128
00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:26.160
imagine a written contract with a covenant not to compete,

129
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.340
which has a smudged duration number,

130
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:34.550
which might have originally been written as either a to as either two or three

131
00:09:35.221 --> 00:09:36.510
years.
Uh,

132
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:41.480
a court would not allow extrinsic evidence to explain to,
uh,

133
00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:44.940
uh,
to explain this ambiguity if,
uh,

134
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:49.650
if the evidence was it was to be admitted to suggest that the parties had agreed

135
00:09:49.651 --> 00:09:53.730
to a four year duration because the writing is,

136
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.840
is ambiguous,

137
00:09:54.841 --> 00:09:59.160
but does not reasonably susceptible to that four year interpretation.

138
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:00.940
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

139
00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:05.940
<v 0>The Alyeska court similarly found that the December 11th letter was not</v>

140
00:10:05.981 --> 00:10:10.981
reasonably susceptible to the interpretation advanced by a and D,

141
00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:16.060
and that therefore there was no merit to a and ds contention that it was

142
00:10:16.061 --> 00:10:20.200
entitled to a jury trial on this interpretation issue.

143
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.560
In the next video,

144
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:30.740
we'll take on the difficult multipart test governing whether extrinsic evidence

145
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.930
should be admitted to supplement the agreement.
