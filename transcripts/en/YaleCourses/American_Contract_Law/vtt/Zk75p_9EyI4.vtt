1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.540
Most of the contracts we have seen in this course are the product of verbal,

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.380
either oral or written agreements between the parties.

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.620
Today we're going to consider contracts that might exist without an explicit

4
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:16.854
agreement.

5
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.040
The 1969 case of Bailey versus west is often one of the first cases taught in a

6
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:28.410
contracts course because it touches on important principles of contract

7
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:32.730
formation.
We will use the case to introduce several important concepts,

8
00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:37.731
including implied in fact contracts and cuase I contracts or contracts implied

9
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:43.290
in law.
These terms might sound like fancy legal ease for now,

10
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:45.390
but they will make sense very soon.

11
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.290
The defendant appellee in this case,

12
00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:54.291
Richard West purchased a horse named Baskins folly from Doctor Strauss.

13
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.580
The defendant's trainers subsequently discovered that the horse was lame.

14
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.450
The trainer tried to send the horse back to Strauss,

15
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:07.320
but Strauss refused to accept it.
The horse,
uh,

16
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.350
deliver who's referred to in the opinion as one Kelly then under instruction

17
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:18.480
from the defendant's trainer that he should do whatever he wanted to do with the

18
00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:19.314
horse,

19
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.470
but that he wouldn't be on any farm at defendant's expense delivered the horse

20
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.150
to plaintiff.
Appellant Bailey,

21
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.880
a plaintiff accepted the horse understanding that its ownership was disputed and

22
00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:38.121
sent bills to both defendant and to Strauss before selling the horse.

23
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.890
After caring for it for four years,

24
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.380
defendant returned the bills unpaid with notations that he did not own the

25
00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:47.214
horse.

26
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.010
There's something ironic in the plaintiff's name.
In Property Law,

27
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.070
a bailment is illegal relationship will wear a bay lore in trusts,

28
00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:02.060
physical possession of personal property,
uh,

29
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.600
to another person who was called the Bailey.
So,
uh,

30
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.520
in this case,

31
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.550
Howard Bailey is a Bailey who was entrusted with the horse

32
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.590
and in this case,

33
00:02:16.591 --> 00:02:21.591
the plaintiff sued to recover their reasonable value for services rendered in

34
00:02:22.411 --> 00:02:23.580
caring for the horse.

35
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.030
The trial court awarded awarded plaintiff's costs for the first five months of

36
00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:33.830
care as well as certain expenses for trimming the horses hooves.
Uh,

37
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.550
the trial court,
uh,

38
00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:39.810
reason that because the supreme court in a separate disputed found that West

39
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.100
owned the Horse and oh doctor Strauss,
the purchase price,

40
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.400
that there was a contractual employee contract implied in fact to care for the

41
00:02:49.831 --> 00:02:52.890
horse until West notified Bailey.
Otherwise,

42
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.430
the instant court in this case,
however,

43
00:02:56.431 --> 00:03:01.060
reversed the trial court's finding of liability and instead found for the

44
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:05.170
defendant west.
Before we go on,

45
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.090
take a look at this question.

46
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.730
Why does the PA opinion use the phrase clearly erroneous when discussing the

47
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:17.110
[inaudible] contract claim?
Well,

48
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.970
this is a standard of review for factual issues.
Uh,

49
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.460
the clearly erroneous standard of review,

50
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.140
which is in contrast and distinct from the denovo standard for reviewing

51
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:30.220
questions of law.

52
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.680
And the appellate court should only set aside a factual finding of a trial court

53
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.060
if that finding is clearly erroneous.
Well,

54
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:43.660
so in this case there are two major issues.
First,

55
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.310
was there an implied in fact contract between the plaintiff and the defendant?

56
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.563
And second,

57
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.750
was there a quiz I contract or a contract implied in law between the plaintiff

58
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.943
and defendant?

59
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.210
Let's first take a look at whether an implied in fact contract exists and

60
00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:04.690
implied.
In fact,

61
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:08.890
contract is a contract where the party's agreement is inferred from their

62
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:12.310
conduct rather than by explicit words.

63
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.110
If you go in a restaurant and the server asks you what will you have and you

64
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:21.670
respond,
give me a Pastrami on Rye.
Uh,
please.

65
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.270
Uh,
do you have an explicit contract?
Well,
no.

66
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.090
Nobody promised anybody anything.

67
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.890
You never explicitly promise the waitress that you would pay.
You said,

68
00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:36.100
give me something.
But as you already know,

69
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:39.970
the lack of an explicit agreement is not really relevant.

70
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.650
You're going to be on the hook to pay for the food that you ordered.
An eight,

71
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.100
because of the conduct of the overall circumstances by sitting down at a table

72
00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:55.240
in a restaurant and ordering food off the menu that made you contractually

73
00:04:55.241 --> 00:04:59.440
liable for an implied in fact contract.

74
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.650
It's implied by the facts of your conduct or the surrounding circumstances and

75
00:05:05.561 --> 00:05:10.090
implied in fact,
contract has the same legal effect as an express contract,

76
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.650
express contracts or the contracts we've been studying.
In other cases,

77
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.760
the main difference is that the people use words and an express contract.

78
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.150
While an implied in fact contract people manifest their mutual assent by their

79
00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:28.380
actions and their words,
uh,

80
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.870
for an implied in fact contract to exist.

81
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.120
Two conditions must be satisfied.

82
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.310
There must be one mutual agreement and two,
there must be an intent to promise.

83
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.660
In this case the court found these elements to be lacking and held.

84
00:05:43.661 --> 00:05:46.540
There was no implied in fact contract.

85
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:52.230
The plaintiff's knew that the ownership of the horse was in dispute and sent

86
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.380
multiple bills,
uh,
to different people,
uh,

87
00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.790
not knowing who was going to be responsible.

88
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.890
And therefore the plaintiff should have known that neither west North Strauss

89
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.350
had agreed to the transaction.

90
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.290
It's socially valuable to probe,
to promote mutual assent.

91
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.450
If we have mutual assent,
we have a revealed preference,
uh,
argument,

92
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:22.310
an inference that the contract is increasing the welfare of each of the parties

93
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.690
without mutual assent.
It's unclear whether value is created.

94
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.280
People will be forced into contracts that they did not want to enter.

95
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.130
The,
the difference here is if we can,

96
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.240
if we're confidence that both sides had agreed to the transaction,

97
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.670
we can infer by their conduct,

98
00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:43.940
by their revealed preference for assenting to the contract that they,

99
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.970
that they're,
each of them are better off by entering.

100
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.290
But in a case like this where their conduct is not clear,

101
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.530
we can't make this revealed preference inference that value has been created

102
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.450
allowing for implied.
In fact,
contract seems to make a lot of sense.

103
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:05.060
Life would be a lot more inconvenient if,

104
00:07:05.061 --> 00:07:09.530
say you had to sign a contract every time you went into a restaurant.
However,

105
00:07:09.531 --> 00:07:13.790
you might wonder if the lack of explicit agreements presents other problems.

106
00:07:13.791 --> 00:07:17.510
For instance,
does a party subjective intent matter?

107
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.460
Suppose you sit down at the restaurant but secretly harbored no intent to pay.

108
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.380
Does that let you out of the contract?
Well,
the answer is no.
Of course.

109
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.680
Generally when a settling disputes about contract formation rather than

110
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.990
subjective intent,

111
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:41.260
the law looks to the reasonableness of the other person's inferences if it's

112
00:07:41.631 --> 00:07:46.631
reasonable for the waitress to infer that you implicitly promised to pay when

113
00:07:46.941 --> 00:07:51.020
you ordered the sandwich.
The same applies to express contracts,

114
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:55.520
which refers to the verbal or written agreements that we've been studying in

115
00:07:55.521 --> 00:07:58.010
these other cases.
Thus,
if I say,

116
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.100
I'll sell you my watch for $400 and you say,

117
00:08:01.101 --> 00:08:03.320
I accept your honest,

118
00:08:03.321 --> 00:08:07.970
but uncommunicated belief that there is no contract until a writing assigned

119
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.290
will be irrelevant.

120
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.520
The fact that you manifested and intent to contract,

121
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:17.390
it's reasonable for me to hear what you said as entering into contract.

122
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:22.070
That's going to be enough for courts.
Here's a quiz for you in Bailey,

123
00:08:22.071 --> 00:08:22.904
the West.

124
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:28.180
If the court had used the reasonableness of the listeners expectation standard,

125
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.940
should the plaintiff have prevailed?
No,

126
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:37.490
it wasn't reasonable for Bailey to think that he had an agreement to board the

127
00:08:37.491 --> 00:08:42.440
horse.
Bailey didn't even know with whom he was contracting and he again,

128
00:08:42.441 --> 00:08:44.780
he sent bills to both west and Strauss.

129
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.280
There's nothing that Bailey heard that would've made it reasonable for him to

130
00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:53.840
think that he had entered into a contract is assumption that he was to take care

131
00:08:53.841 --> 00:08:58.841
of this horse was the plaintiff had reason to know that there was no mutual

132
00:08:59.521 --> 00:09:00.354
assent.

133
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:05.160
The defendant neither said nor did anything to create reasonable expectations or

134
00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:08.100
from which a promise to pay might be implied.

135
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.360
So even if the plaintiff cannot prevail on his first claim that there was an

136
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:16.620
implied in fact contract,

137
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.920
he still has another argument that there was a quiz I contract or a contract

138
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:27.501
implied in law cuase I contracts are not true contracts.

139
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.200
They are obligations imposed by the law in in cases where a contract should have

140
00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:39.981
existed where promises should have been made but no actual or implied promises

141
00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:43.550
actually happened.
Uh,

142
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:48.620
the main goal of Quasar by contract as a separate cause of action is to remedy

143
00:09:49.081 --> 00:09:51.720
the possibility of unjust enrichment,

144
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:57.230
namely one party getting a significant benefit without having to pay for it,

145
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.880
which leads to an inequitable result.

146
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.140
Quayside contracts or also known as implied in law contracts,

147
00:10:04.141 --> 00:10:05.790
constructive contracts,

148
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:10.750
sometimes referred to as unjust enrichment causes of actions.
Uh,

149
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.790
so don't be confused if you hear these different terms.

150
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.940
They all mean something close to the same thing.

151
00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.060
They are all equitable causes of action,

152
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.780
which like many things in equity are less rule like,

153
00:10:24.781 --> 00:10:29.781
and have fuzzier elements and probabilistic legal outcomes for a quasar contract

154
00:10:32.641 --> 00:10:36.180
to exist.
The court states that,
uh,

155
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.870
that there are three conditions which must be satisfied.
First,

156
00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:44.100
there must be a benefit conferred upon the defendant.
Second,

157
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.910
the defendant must appreciate the benefit.
In other words,

158
00:10:47.911 --> 00:10:50.850
the defendant must feel the benefit.
Uh,

159
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.660
and finally it would be an equitable for the defendant to retain the benefit

160
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.050
without making a payment to the plant to the plaintiff.

161
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.270
In this case,
the court found that know cuase I contract existed.

162
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:07.470
The defendant never accepted the benefit conferred by the plaintiff,

163
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.160
mainly the this raising or caring for the horse.

164
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:16.650
The court especially emphasize the importance of respecting individual autonomy

165
00:11:16.651 --> 00:11:18.960
in contracts.
Saying,
quote,

166
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:24.090
a person is not required to deal with another unless he desires to and

167
00:11:24.091 --> 00:11:28.680
ordinarily a person should not be required to become an obliger unless he so

168
00:11:28.681 --> 00:11:29.520
desires.

169
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.110
Another way to think about the issue is that the plaintiff was acting as a

170
00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:35.040
volunteer.

171
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:40.550
You are officiously conferring a benefit if you do it expecting payment without

172
00:11:41.881 --> 00:11:44.160
giving the pay or the chance to decline.

173
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.040
This affects the third factor,

174
00:11:47.041 --> 00:11:50.190
acceptance and retention of the benefit by the defendant.

175
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:55.730
The court found that the plaintiff was a mirror volunteer and hence unreasonable

176
00:11:55.871 --> 00:12:00.580
and conferring the benefit which the defendant clearly did not want or at least

177
00:12:00.581 --> 00:12:01.990
did not clearly want.

178
00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:08.000
All alternative conditions have also been proposed for thinking about what is it

179
00:12:08.001 --> 00:12:09.700
cuase I contract.
For instance,

180
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.300
I hear by propose the would have,

181
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:18.450
couldn't have standard to explain quayside contract liability to my mind cuase I

182
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:25.050
contract liability is more likely to lie if the plaintiff can show that the

183
00:12:25.181 --> 00:12:29.980
defendant would have been willing to contract to pay for the benefit that the

184
00:12:29.981 --> 00:12:31.120
defendant,
uh,

185
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:36.150
that was conferred on the defendant but that the defendant couldn't enter into

186
00:12:36.461 --> 00:12:40.540
an express or implied in fact contract.

187
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:46.380
The classic example of Xy contract liability can turn concerns the pedestrian

188
00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.330
who was hit by a car and his line unconscious in the street.

189
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:55.510
A pastor by provides medical assistance,

190
00:12:56.110 --> 00:13:01.110
saves the pedestrians life and then sues for quite shy contractual damages.

191
00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:06.280
The would have,
couldn't have elements are clearly present.

192
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:11.410
The pedestrian would have been willing to contract to pay for his life being

193
00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:12.244
saved.

194
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:17.050
But the passer by has a pretty good excuse for not securing an explicit

195
00:13:17.051 --> 00:13:21.630
agreement since the pedestrian was passed out at the time,
uh,

196
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.500
that this benefit was conferred.

197
00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:29.580
Bailey and contrast doesn't have any good excuse for not securing a more

198
00:13:29.651 --> 00:13:32.970
explicit agreement.
Uh,

199
00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:37.780
we have just been exposed to a lot of new and important legal terms.

200
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.730
Let's take some time to review them.

201
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:46.000
Number one and express contract is a contract that was created with the party's

202
00:13:46.001 --> 00:13:49.750
verbal agreement on the promises and performances.

203
00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:55.260
These are contracts where the agreement was explicitly stated on paper or

204
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.990
orally.
And then number two,

205
00:13:58.991 --> 00:14:03.991
an implied in fact contract is a contract in which the agreement is inferred by

206
00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:09.811
the party's conduct ordering food at a restaurant or going for a doctor's

207
00:14:09.911 --> 00:14:13.900
appointment or often examples of implied in fact contracts.

208
00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:16.420
And then finally,
uh,

209
00:14:16.421 --> 00:14:21.421
cuase I contract or a contract implied in law is not a true contract.

210
00:14:22.781 --> 00:14:27.781
It's not one where people made explicit or implicit exchange of promises.

211
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.133
Instead,

212
00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:34.260
it's an obligation imposed by the law to prevent unjust enrichment.

213
00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:35.980
It's also called,

214
00:14:35.981 --> 00:14:40.981
this has an implied in law contract or a constructive contract.

215
00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:45.670
There doesn't have to be mutual agreement for cuase I contract.

216
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.830
Now that we've reviewed these terms,
you're ready for an important.

217
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:55.300
So what's the difference between an implied in fact contract and equate cy

218
00:14:55.301 --> 00:14:58.520
contract?
Well implied in fact,

219
00:14:58.521 --> 00:15:02.540
contracts like express contracts involved chosen obligations,

220
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:07.730
their obligations that the people opted into by their actions or words.

221
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.440
In contrast,

222
00:15:09.441 --> 00:15:14.000
cuase I contracts involve obligations that are not mutually chosen.

223
00:15:14.001 --> 00:15:16.520
They're not mutually assented to there.

224
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:21.550
Instead implied in law chosen by the courts to emulate the deals that the

225
00:15:21.651 --> 00:15:24.860
parties would have agreed to if they had had the chance.

226
00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.390
Here are some interesting parting thoughts and questions.

227
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.371
Number one,

228
00:15:31.371 --> 00:15:36.371
suppose west personally delivered basket folly to Bailey's farm,

229
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:42.670
but nothing was specifically said about Bailey caring for the horse or West's

230
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:47.750
paying for that care.
Would West be liable then?
Well,

231
00:15:47.751 --> 00:15:52.310
the answer is that West would probably be liable on the finding that they had an

232
00:15:52.311 --> 00:15:55.820
implied in fact contract.
As we discussed earlier,

233
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:57.980
this pattern of conduct,

234
00:15:57.981 --> 00:16:02.981
this behavior seems to suggest mutual assent and an intent from both parties to

235
00:16:03.381 --> 00:16:08.180
be contractually bound for the care of the horse.
Number two.

236
00:16:08.181 --> 00:16:12.680
What if Bailey found Baskins folly collapsed alongside the highway,

237
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:17.800
took the horse in and cared for the horse and thereafter sought out west for a

238
00:16:17.851 --> 00:16:22.851
payment with west be responsible for Bailey for the care given to the horse?

239
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:26.450
And if so,
on what theory?
Well,

240
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:31.100
the answer there is Westwood probably be liable on a quiz I contractual claim or

241
00:16:31.101 --> 00:16:33.890
at least it would be arguable.
In that case,

242
00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:39.010
Bailey conferred a measure of a measurable benefit on West who was the owner of

243
00:16:39.171 --> 00:16:43.610
the horse and Bailey would have a good excuse for not obtaining explicit

244
00:16:43.611 --> 00:16:47.990
agreement in advance because the horse was in immediate need of care.

245
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:53.120
And finally,
if West gets to keep the horse afterwards,

246
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:57.290
then there's a good argument that there is unjust in re Richmond West

247
00:16:57.291 --> 00:17:01.070
essentially got free medical treatment for the horse without having to pay for

248
00:17:01.071 --> 00:17:02.990
it.
And,

249
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:07.100
and what should we think about what happened to the proceeds of the horses sale?

250
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:10.040
They seem to have been retained by the plaintiff.

251
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:12.650
So even under the plaintiff's theory of the case,

252
00:17:12.651 --> 00:17:17.090
these some should have offset the amount owed by the defendant.

253
00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.960
This case might've turned out differently if Bailey had returned the horse to

254
00:17:20.961 --> 00:17:24.380
west after caring for it and West had sold the horse.

255
00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:30.110
Today we have examined the case that introduced us to the difference between

256
00:17:30.111 --> 00:17:33.170
three major types of contracts,
explicit contracts,

257
00:17:33.171 --> 00:17:35.630
which are formed by express agreement,

258
00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:40.900
implied in fact contracts which are formed by inference of the party's con duct.

259
00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:46.210
And finally cuase I contracts where there is no mutual assent and uh,

260
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:48.500
exchange of promises,

261
00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:52.890
but benefit is conferred by one party on another party.

262
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:58.190
And that receiving party is liable as a matter of law to pay the,

263
00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:03.570
uh,
for that benefit.
And we've also learned that implied in fact,

264
00:18:03.571 --> 00:18:08.460
contracts require a mutual agreement and intend to promise cuase ag contracts do

265
00:18:08.461 --> 00:18:10.710
not require a mutual agreement.
Instead,

266
00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:15.980
there must be a benefit that is non officiously conferred on another party and

267
00:18:16.381 --> 00:18:19.680
that party must appreciate the benefit and retain it.
