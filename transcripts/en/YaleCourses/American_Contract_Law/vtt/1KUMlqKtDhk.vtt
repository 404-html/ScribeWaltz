00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.860
Today we're going to look at two cases,
mill's view,

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.600
Wyman and web,

3
00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:11.601
the mcgalin to introduce the concept of moral obligation and the possibility of

4
00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:15.120
moral consideration.
First,

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.480
let's look at the case of Mills v Wyman,

6
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.750
which was decided by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in 1825 while

7
00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:26.670
traveling abroad,

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.700
the Wymans adult son became ill and without Wyman's request or consent,

9
00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:37.020
the plaintiff mills cared for Wyman son afterward,

10
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.530
Wyman promise to pay mills for his expenses,

11
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.410
but later recanted and refuse to pay.

12
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.920
Mills sued for enforcement of Wyman's promise.

13
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.380
The trial court granted defendant a nonsuit and the instant court affirmed.

14
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.630
So the issue is,

15
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.970
was the defendant's moral obligation arising from the plaintiff's care for the

16
00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:04.770
sun,
sufficient consideration to bind his promise to pay?

17
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.480
And the answer is at least in 1825 no,

18
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.410
the court held that it was not according to the court,

19
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.110
a mere moral obligation,

20
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.700
a combined with a promise is not sufficient to enforce the promise even when

21
00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:25.290
refusal to perform such a promise may be disgraceful.

22
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.330
The court acknowledged that moral obligation and a promise or sometimes

23
00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:32.940
sufficient to qualify as consideration.

24
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.540
But only if there was a preexisting legal obligation at some time in the past.

25
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:42.300
For example,
if a debt was once owed,

26
00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:47.301
but now has become unenforceable because the statute of limitations has run out,

27
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.230
uh,
to bring suit,

28
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.540
but the debtor then subsequently promises to repay the credit or any way the

29
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:59.541
debtors moral obligation of owing money in the past binds him because it stems

30
00:02:00.241 --> 00:02:04.920
from this preexisting legal obligation combined with the subsequent promise

31
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.510
absence of preexisting legal obligation oil.
However,

32
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.650
the law leaves moral obligations to the conscience of the promissory note.

33
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.440
In the words of the court quote,

34
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.740
the law of society has left most of such obligations to the inferior forum as

35
00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:26.850
the tribunal of conscience has been aptly called.

36
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.990
So remember,
timing is important.

37
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.290
Assume that Wyman learns that mills is caring for his adult son and promises

38
00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:39.690
then to reimburse mills for his expenses.

39
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.630
If mills continues the care for his son.

40
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.200
And then mills continues to care for Wyman son,

41
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.590
but why I'm in later refuses to pay and mill Sue's Wyman for expenses incurred

42
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.490
after the promise was made.
Is there consideration?

43
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.030
Well,
of course in this alternative scenario,

44
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.560
Wyman promises to reimburse mills in exchange for continued care.

45
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.600
Wyman's promise comes before meals continued care not after,

46
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:15.601
as in the actual facts of the case mill's loses in this case because as a matter

47
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:18.460
of traditional contract law,

48
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.060
past consideration is no consideration.

49
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.560
Marxists can have a field day with this decision.

50
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.840
Past consideration is no consideration when you care for the sick,
ah,

51
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:33.400
la,
the Good Samaritan.

52
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.380
But it's sufficient when a capitalist lender might lose the right to collect on

53
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:41.260
a past debt.
Do now,

54
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.470
let's see how the court of Appeals in Alabama handled of similar promise 110

55
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:52.370
years later in the 1935 case of Web,

56
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.010
Cvi mcgalin web was an employee of McGowan's mill.

57
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.370
One day web was badly injured when he saved McGowan's life by diverting the path

58
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.030
of a 75 pound pine block that was falling from the upper stories of the mill

59
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.040
after the incident in return for saving his life,
uh,

60
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.110
McGowan promised to pay web $15 every two weeks or $390 per year for the rest of

61
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:23.980
webs life.

62
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.380
And these payments were made but after McGowan's death is executive refused to

63
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:33.280
continue making the payments.
Web sued for the,

64
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.290
for the continuation of the payments and the trial court found for the defendant

65
00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:43.291
on the basis of the defendant's dimmer that there was no consideration but the

66
00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:48.541
instant court reversed and remanded for a new trial and the issue in this case

67
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:54.691
was also is the defendant's moral obligation sufficient consideration to bind

68
00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:58.360
him contractually?
Well,
in this case,

69
00:04:58.361 --> 00:05:03.040
the court held it was the court articulates an exception to the past.

70
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.040
Consideration is no consideration rule and holds that a moral obligation is a

71
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:13.300
sufficient consideration to support a subsequent promise to pay where the

72
00:05:13.301 --> 00:05:15.820
promise is received a material benefit,

73
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.180
although there was no original duty or a liability resting on the promise or in

74
00:05:21.851 --> 00:05:22.684
other words,

75
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.990
material benefit plus moral consideration plus subsequent promise equals

76
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.700
sufficient consideration.

77
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.270
The holding in Mills v Wyman,

78
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.130
that moral obligation without a preexisting legal obligation is not sufficient

79
00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:43.360
to support consideration is often considered the traditional rule.

80
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.220
While the holding in Web [inaudible] gallon by contrast is often called the

81
00:05:48.221 --> 00:05:49.054
modern rule.

82
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.180
Can the decision in web be reconciled with mills?

83
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.640
Now perhaps one thing,
the court in Web,

84
00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.570
the in the gallon states that the promise or must have received a material

85
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:06.320
benefit,
uh,
that spurred his promise to repay.

86
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.670
Mr Macallan certainly received a material benefit when his life was saved.

87
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.240
But did Wyman receiving material benefit when mills cared for Wyman son?

88
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.340
Well,
arguably not his son certainly did,

89
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.710
but Wyman's benefit with psychic and it wasn't and his son was already an adult

90
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:29.540
age and navy.
That's not sufficiently material.
Second,

91
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.370
it's worth noting that,
uh,
why am in himself recanted the promise?

92
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.020
While I'm like the gallon did not McGowan's promise was made in writing and

93
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:41.300
actually performed until his death.

94
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.890
It wasn't until I after MCGOWAN's death that his executor repudiated the

95
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:48.920
promise.
In other words,
the court in Web,

96
00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:52.820
the Miguel and may have simply been trying to divide up into state according to

97
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:57.200
the testators apparent,
uh,
wishes.
As usual,

98
00:06:57.201 --> 00:07:00.350
the restatement has something to say about moral obligation,

99
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.500
which is fairly consistent with the holding in web.

100
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.980
Section 86 of the restatement reads a promise made in recognition of a benefit.

101
00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:14.501
Previously received by the promise or from the primacy is binding to the extent

102
00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:19.790
necessary to prevent injustice and a promise is not binding under the first

103
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.633
subsection.

104
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.100
If the promise he conferred the benefit as a gift or for other reason the

105
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:30.101
promise or has not been unjustly enriched or to the extent that its value is

106
00:07:30.591 --> 00:07:35.591
disproportionate to the benefit note how the elements of section 86 parallel

107
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:41.561
those of contracts implied in law that we studied in Bailey versus west,

108
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.240
especially the conferral of a benefit that wasn't confirmed as a gift.

109
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:52.550
In some ways the modern rule can be seen as allowing recovery,

110
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.660
uh,

111
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:58.660
when there is moral past consideration when the beneficiary has gone further and

112
00:07:59.451 --> 00:08:04.220
given the court with his or her promises specific price at which to value the

113
00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:05.054
benefit.

114
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:10.330
It's as if moral consideration is cuase I contract plus an explicit promise.

115
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:18.730
So would the Mills v Wyman case be decided differently under section 86 of the

116
00:08:20.391 --> 00:08:23.840
restatement?
Well,
maybe not.
First,

117
00:08:23.841 --> 00:08:28.250
the defendant can argue that since the benefit was conferred on an emancipated

118
00:08:28.251 --> 00:08:32.480
son,
there is no need to enforce the promise to prevent injustice.

119
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.590
And second,
the Good Samaritan conferred the benefit as a gift.

120
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.870
There was no intention to charge.
Thus,

121
00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:43.871
the result is arguably the same today as it was in 1825 well,

122
00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:49.080
let's recap a promise given in return for pass.

123
00:08:49.081 --> 00:08:52.400
Good deed creates a moral obligation for the promise,

124
00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:57.401
or today we considered whether it is sufficient consideration to also create a

125
00:08:58.171 --> 00:08:59.250
legal obligation.

126
00:08:59.251 --> 00:09:03.720
If there's a subsequent promise under the traditional rule articulated,

127
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.920
it's not sufficient consideration unless there was some preexisting legal

128
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:12.060
obligations such as a past due debt that's no longer enforceable.

129
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.630
But under the modern rule,
it is sufficient consideration.

130
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.200
At least when the promises passed,
good deed is created.

131
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:22.650
A created a material benefit for the promise,

132
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:27.360
or the restatement is thus consistent with the modern rule.
