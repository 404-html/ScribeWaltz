00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.340
The case of Hill v Jones deals with the question of when parties have an

2
00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:10.341
affirmative duty to disclose information during contract negotiations,

3
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.220
the hills had purchased the Jones's house when it turned out to be infested with

4
00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:20.310
termites.
They sued to rescind the contract for sale.

5
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.600
Let's consider what happened in the case in chronological order in 1963 under

6
00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:29.640
earlier owners,

7
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:34.641
the house received its first treatment for termites from truly Nolan.

8
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.460
Nolan then gave the owner's termite guarantees which entitled them to semi

9
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.640
annual inspection.
There's an annual termite booster treatments.

10
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.150
When the Joneses subsequently bought the house in 1974 they renewed these

11
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:53.250
guarantees and continued pain,

12
00:00:53.251 --> 00:00:58.251
Nolan annual fees for inspection and treatment as well as diagrams as where in

13
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:04.830
the house there had been termite damage during their ownership.

14
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.040
There was additional evidence of infestation including streamers in the wood

15
00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:15.771
tile floor near the entryway and truly Nolan came back and treated the house and

16
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:17.784
fence.

17
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.710
Fast forward to 1982 and the Joneses or selling the house,

18
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.270
the hills are attracted to it because of the parquet floors,

19
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.520
but they notice a ripple in the wood.

20
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.780
When Mr. Hill asks whether the ripple is termite damage,

21
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.320
Mrs. Jones says that it is water damage.

22
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.000
They enter into an agreement for the hills to buy the house dependent on the

23
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:45.840
results of the termite inspection.
The Joneses,
however,

24
00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:50.460
do not give the termite inspector the information they have about the past

25
00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:54.780
termite damage.
And so he does not notice that the house is infested,

26
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.970
is infested.
In part,

27
00:01:56.971 --> 00:02:01.971
this may be because of strategically placed boxes and plants that hide all

28
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.420
evidence of the past.

29
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.450
Termite treatments holes in the patio and the like after the they move in the

30
00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:14.040
hills discovered a serious infestation in the house,

31
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.280
which would cost them $5,000 to repair.

32
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.880
And keep in mind that at the time the whole house costs $72,000 the hill sued

33
00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:27.120
the Joneses for rescission of the contract,

34
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:31.000
arguing that the termite report was fraudulent because of the Jones,

35
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:32.640
his misrepresentations.

36
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.960
We're reading the case on appeal at the court of Appeals of Arizona.

37
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.860
The trial court ruled for the defendants sellers on a summary Judgment motion.

38
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.190
So keep in mind that the key question here is was there a genuine question of

39
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:54.000
fact that should have gone before a jury?
There are two key questions.

40
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:54.834
First,

41
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.960
does the integration clause in the contract prevent the court from the Jones is

42
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:02.410
silence and second,

43
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.880
did the defendant have a duty to disclose the possibility of termite

44
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:07.750
infestation?

45
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.820
Judge Meyerson disposes of the first question very briefly.

46
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.620
He writes that quote where a misrepresentation is fraudulent or where a

47
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:20.980
negligent misrepresentation is one of material fact.

48
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.490
The policy of finality rightly gives way to the policy of promoting honest

49
00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:31.801
dealings between the parties will be studying more about integration or

50
00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:36.190
sometimes they're called merger clauses later in the course when we study the

51
00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:41.191
parole evidence rule integration clauses sometimes stop courts from looking

52
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:44.080
beyond the four corners of a written contract,

53
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.910
but for now it's enough to know that because this case can turns the possibility

54
00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:51.490
of intentional fraud.
The integration,

55
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.380
the integration clause does not prevent the court from looking into the parties

56
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:57.214
dealings.

57
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.430
It would be unjust to strictly enforce the policy favoring finality.

58
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.600
Judge Meyerson spends more time discussing the context in which silence on the

59
00:04:09.641 --> 00:04:12.700
part of a seller is not acceptable.

60
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.190
Section one 61 of the second restatement of contracts lists the four main

61
00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:23.191
exceptions to the general common law rule that parties do not have an obligation

62
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:25.300
to speak during negotiations.

63
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.810
The first exception is when disclosure is necessary to prevent a previous

64
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:36.121
assertion from being a misrepresentation or from being fraudulent or material.

65
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:37.750
In particular,

66
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:42.751
the judge is worried about situations when one conveys a false impression by the

67
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:46.570
disclosure of some facts and the concealment of others.

68
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.420
This can constitute false representation.

69
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.360
This could conceivably be the case here.

70
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.570
When Mrs. Jones is said that what looked like termite damage was in fact water

71
00:04:57.821 --> 00:04:58.654
damage,

72
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.130
the hills might reasonably take that statement to mean that there had not been

73
00:05:03.131 --> 00:05:05.170
any termite damage to the house,

74
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.700
even though the statement is not literally falls in and of itself.

75
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.880
It might carry with it a false implication if that were in fact the case,

76
00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:19.180
the Jones is would be obligated to conceal to correct that inference.

77
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.250
You should be able to see the similarity between this case and Laidlaw.

78
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.570
In both cases,

79
00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:30.040
the asking of a question may have triggered duties of disclosure.

80
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.420
The second exception is the broadest and the most commonly invoked.

81
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.400
It requires disclosure when one party knows that the others agreement to a

82
00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:46.960
contract is based on a mistake and where nondisclosure would not be in

83
00:05:46.961 --> 00:05:51.910
accordance with principles of good faith and fair dealing as with the doctrines

84
00:05:51.911 --> 00:05:56.650
of mutual and unilateral mistake being mistaken as to a basic assumption

85
00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.050
triggers additional contract scrutiny.

86
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.600
Judge Meyerson discusses how different courts have fleshed out this requirement

87
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:09.830
in different ways and ends up adopting the Florida Supreme Court's language.

88
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:14.831
That quote where the seller of a home knows of facts materially affecting the

89
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:19.430
value of the property which are not readily observable and are known to the

90
00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:22.610
buyer and and are not known to the buyer.

91
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.330
The seller is under a duty to disclose them to the buyer.

92
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.150
This could certainly be found to apply in cases like this one where those facts

93
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:34.940
concern past termite infestations.

94
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.670
Another way to think about this issue is in terms of implicit default

95
00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:41.840
representations,

96
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.550
a jury might find that when sellers don't mention termite infestations,

97
00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:51.551
they are by default representing that house has no termite infestations.

98
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:57.190
The buyer could then reasonably rely on that implied representation and the

99
00:06:57.471 --> 00:07:02.360
seller would have a duty to disclose termite infestations to contract around the

100
00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:03.194
default.

101
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.700
Based on these first two categorical exceptions,

102
00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:12.260
Judge Myers and found that there was enough evidence that the trial court should

103
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:17.261
let a jury decide whether the information about past infestations was material,

104
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:22.340
whether the Joneses had misrepresented it and whether the hills had relied on
it.

105
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:28.660
The third exception deals with mistakes as to the contents of writings,

106
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.290
I.
E.
The actual written contract as opposed to facts about the world.

107
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.910
If one party knows that the other is mistaken about what is actually written in

108
00:07:37.911 --> 00:07:38.744
the contract,

109
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.900
that party must correct the other party's mistake and the final exception deals

110
00:07:44.361 --> 00:07:49.361
with relationships of trust and confidence where one party has a duty to act and

111
00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:54.380
the other's best interest or not to use certain information that that party has

112
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:59.090
disclosed to them.
That party hat has to disclose material information.

113
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:04.070
Academics have come up with a number of theories to count for what types of

114
00:08:04.071 --> 00:08:07.790
information parties ought to be obligated to disclose.

115
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:12.280
We'll discuss two of the most prominent ones in discussing Laidlaw.

116
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.400
We've already mentioned Anthony Kronman distinction between deliberately

117
00:08:16.401 --> 00:08:19.820
acquired information and casually acquired information.

118
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.720
Kronman was concerned about the ex ante effects of disclosure rules on party's

119
00:08:26.271 --> 00:08:28.310
willingness to gather information.

120
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:33.170
We should be reluctant to mandate disclosure of deliberately acquired

121
00:08:33.171 --> 00:08:37.820
information because then parties may be unwilling to go to the expense of

122
00:08:37.821 --> 00:08:42.440
gathering it knowing that they must then disclose it.
On the other hand,

123
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:47.470
mandated disclosure will have no impact on casually acquired information which

124
00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:51.950
disclosing parties will continue to come to know regardless of whether they have

125
00:08:51.951 --> 00:08:52.790
to disclose it.

126
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:58.420
I've suggested that car dealerships should be forced to disclose their markups

127
00:08:58.801 --> 00:09:03.060
on new cars because they casually acquire this information.

128
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.830
The difference between the proposed selling price and what the dealer paid for

129
00:09:07.831 --> 00:09:08.664
the car.

130
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.370
One way that the law responds to the Kronman concerned about deliberately

131
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:19.371
acquired information is to require that a party disclose what she knew or should

132
00:09:19.931 --> 00:09:20.764
have known.

133
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:26.180
Forcing disclosure of what you should have known can stop you from remaining

134
00:09:26.281 --> 00:09:29.070
willfully ignorant.
For example,

135
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:34.100
it might be a good idea to have the sellers of used cars take their cars to a

136
00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:40.161
mechanic before selling them to learn about mechanical problems and to hold

137
00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:47.181
sellers to any problems that they knew or should have known from such a

138
00:09:48.001 --> 00:09:52.140
mechanics visit.
But as shown in this slide,

139
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:57.290
the legal choices about disclosure are not simply to mandate disclosure or to

140
00:09:58.471 --> 00:10:02.940
adopt a laissez faire regime where disclosure is merely optional.

141
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:06.180
Sometimes the law even prohibits,

142
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:11.270
prohibits disclosure or countenances misrepresentations by Ho by holding that

143
00:10:12.811 --> 00:10:17.811
certain types of facts are as a matter of law in material and thus not subject

144
00:10:18.691 --> 00:10:20.760
to liability for misrepresentation.

145
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:27.390
Robert cooter and Tom Mulan emphasize a different informational dimension.

146
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:32.730
They distinguished between productive facts and redistributive facts,

147
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:37.800
productive facts or new information that has the potential to actually create

148
00:10:37.801 --> 00:10:42.150
value in contracting Ri redistributive facts.

149
00:10:42.151 --> 00:10:46.530
On the other hand,
only shift gains of trade between the parties.

150
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.520
A buyer learning that a cow is pregnant may be productive because some buyers

151
00:10:53.191 --> 00:10:56.400
might be better equipped to deal with a pregnant cow.

152
00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.320
But a buyer learning that the seller has terminal cancer and is especially

153
00:11:01.321 --> 00:11:05.070
motivated to sell is more of a redistributive fact.

154
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:08.220
It might help the buyer to negotiate a lower price,

155
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.220
but it doesn't enhance the mutual gains of trade.

156
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:16.470
Since only productive facts create value for society,

157
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.320
we only reward their acquisition and,

158
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:24.540
and shouldn't really reward the acquisition of redistributive facts.

159
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:26.131
In fact,

160
00:11:26.131 --> 00:11:30.060
we might want to discourage deliberate acquisition of redistributive facts

161
00:11:30.061 --> 00:11:33.540
because the cost to acquire these facts are socially wasteful.

162
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.630
So let's look at this quiz.

163
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:39.990
What would each of these theories say about the Jones,

164
00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:44.670
his obligation to disclose in this case an a?

165
00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:48.360
Would both theories say that the Joneses are obligated to disclose the

166
00:11:48.361 --> 00:11:53.361
information or would Kronman say that they would be obligated but cooter and

167
00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:57.460
Newland wouldn't or would cooter and Ulan say they're obligated but krodman

168
00:11:57.461 --> 00:12:01.270
wouldn't?
Well,
the answer is a,

169
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:06.430
the Joneses must disclose under both theories their knowledge to the earlier

170
00:12:06.431 --> 00:12:09.460
termite infestation was casually acquired.

171
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.890
The previous owners simply handed it to them.

172
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.770
They did not pay or work for it in any way,

173
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.580
and the information is also redistributive rather than productive.

174
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:23.620
If they had disclosed it to the hills,
that would have lowered the price,

175
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:27.730
but every dollar that the Jones loss the hills would have gained.

176
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.770
In general,
as we have discussed earlier,

177
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:38.010
courts use the legal notions of misrepresentation and of good faith and fair

178
00:12:38.411 --> 00:12:40.570
dealing to see does this side.

179
00:12:40.571 --> 00:12:45.571
Cases Like Hill v Jones parties must speak so as to avoid misrepresentation due

180
00:12:46.781 --> 00:12:50.980
to their silence or their fault or the false impressions created by their

181
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.320
literally true representations.

182
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:58.360
Good faith and fair dealing may also require them to speak where they know that

183
00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:02.890
the other party is only willing to enter into the contract based on a mistake of

184
00:13:02.891 --> 00:13:07.330
material fact.
We've also learned about two useful distinctions,

185
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.980
the deliberately casually acquired distinction and the productive

186
00:13:11.981 --> 00:13:14.140
redistributive,
uh,

187
00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:18.520
informational distinction that can help us think more rigorously about the

188
00:13:18.521 --> 00:13:22.570
impact of mandated disclosure in specific contexts.
