1
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.620
What can one party to a contract do when they learned that the other is planning

2
00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:08.370
to breach the contract.

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.910
The next case Hotchner versus de la tour deals with exactly such a situation.

4
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.990
Edgar de la tour planned a three month grand tour of the European continent for

5
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:27.531
the summer of 1852 he decided to hire a courier to accompany him on his travels

6
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.580
and so in April he hired Albert Hotchner to serve as his career on the trip,

7
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.280
which was to begin on June 1st but de la tour soon changed his mind.

8
00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:45.381
On May 11th he wrote that he no longer required Hotchner services and that

9
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:49.050
hoster would receive no compensation.

10
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.650
On May 22nd Hotchner sued de la tour for breach of contract and then sometime

11
00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:59.730
between then and June 1st he managed to find another job.

12
00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:04.731
I'm just as good terms but not beginning until July 4th this case comes from

13
00:01:08.041 --> 00:01:13.020
England and we are reading the decision from the court of Queen's bench on

14
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:15.540
appeal.
After Hotchner won at trial,

15
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.350
there were two legal questions for the appeals court to answer.

16
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.060
The first was whether Hotchner was obligated even after receiving de la tour,

17
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.070
his letter to be ready to company him on a three month tour of Europe beginning

18
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:34.191
on June 1st note that this would have prevented him from accepting the

19
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:39.300
alternative employment beginning on July 4th the second question was whether

20
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:44.301
hoster could sue de la before June 1st given that de Latour had not yet failed

21
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:50.001
to meet any of his contractual obligations on both of these questions.

22
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.310
Chief Justice Lord Campbell ruled for Hotchner.

23
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.980
The court answers these questions together with two main arguments,

24
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.160
a doctrinal argument and an economic argument.

25
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.640
Lord Campbell finds no universal rule that whereby agreement and act as to be

26
00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:09.480
done on a future day.

27
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.660
No action can be brought for a breach of the agreement till the day for doing

28
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:16.500
the act as arrived.

29
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.060
He runs through a number of examples where courts have allowed such suits,

30
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.620
contracts of marriage,

31
00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:27.540
where one party marry someone else in contracts to lease a particular property

32
00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:32.340
where the less or leases it to someone else for the same time period and in

33
00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:36.750
contracts for purchase of goods where the seller sells them to someone else.

34
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.070
In this case,

35
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.100
he suggests that if de la tour had set sail for Australia before June 1st

36
00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:47.670
arrived,
Hotchner could have sued for breach under the same precedence.

37
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.860
The court finds that when parties enter into these sorts of contracts,
quote,

38
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.100
there is the relation constituted between the parties in the meantime by the

39
00:02:58.201 --> 00:03:02.560
contract and that they impliedly promise that in the meantime,

40
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.540
neither will do anything to the prejudice of the other inconsistent with that

41
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:08.374
relation.

42
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.100
When someone marries someone other than his or her fiance or as in this case,

43
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:19.261
a party renounces a commitment that person has breached quote an implied

44
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:23.800
contract if either of them renounces the engagement unquote.

45
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.810
What this means is that de Latour has already breached the contract when he

46
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:31.630
sends the letter to decline or services,

47
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.900
and so hotjar is freed from his obligation obligations and free to sue these

48
00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:39.304
two.

49
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.510
These two forms of repudiation are still recognized in contract law.

50
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.020
Section two 50 of the second restatement describes two methods by which a party

51
00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:53.760
can repudiate a contract.
The first is subsection a it.

52
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.390
It's a explicit repudiation of the sort de la tour gave to hoster,

53
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.140
not just any statement counts as a repudiation.

54
00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:06.250
Though courts have made clear that there must be a definite and final

55
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:11.251
communication of the intention to forego performance before the anticipated

56
00:04:11.711 --> 00:04:14.230
breach may be the subject of legal action.

57
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.980
The second type of repudiation is in subsection B and it includes actions that

58
00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:24.000
are inconsistent with the promise or his ability to complete his or her PR

59
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.963
promise.

60
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.770
The past precedents sided by Lord Campbell fall into this category.

61
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.800
A fiance who marries someone else has rendered herself quote,

62
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.160
apparently unable to perform quote.

63
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.420
The general rule from this case is also been incorporated into scattered

64
00:04:40.421 --> 00:04:44.380
sections of the a UCC dealing with repudiation,

65
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.870
including repudiation by conduct.

66
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.310
Lord Campbell also makes an argument based on considerations of economics and

67
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:58.981
public policy for why hoster should be free to find a new client by allowing him

68
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:01.060
to do so quote,

69
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.230
instead of remaining idle and laying out money and preparations,

70
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:06.700
which must be useless,

71
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.990
he is at liberty to seek services under another employer,

72
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.450
unquote.
This arrangement.
