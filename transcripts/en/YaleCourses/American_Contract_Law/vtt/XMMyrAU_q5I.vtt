00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.500
Today we will discuss the concepts of disclosure and misrepresentation by

2
00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:10.050
examining one of my favorite contract cases.

3
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.820
You might have noticed that most of the cases we've been learning about are

4
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:16.470
decided by state courts.

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.030
Since contracts are usually governed by state law laid law.

6
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.060
The Oregon which was decided by the United States supreme court in 1817 is an

7
00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:27.924
exception.

8
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.320
The case has been recognized by legal scholars as a foundational case in the

9
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:38.721
history of us contract law and it's been cited numerous times and law review

10
00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:42.000
articles,
appellate briefs and other cases.

11
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.420
Before we review the case itself,

12
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.680
you might have noticed that the case reading was slightly unusual.

13
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.040
The first few paragraphs are actually summaries of the lawyers arguments and the

14
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:59.280
court's opinion appeared only at the very end.

15
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.760
Ingersoll was the lawyer for Laidlaw key was the lawyer for the defendant,

16
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.833
Oregon.

17
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.620
The decision at the end of the case was written by none other than chief justice

18
00:01:12.661 --> 00:01:17.280
John Marshall who delivered it on behalf of unanimous court.

19
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.830
If you've taken constitutional law,

20
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.810
you'll remember chief justice Marshall as the author of Marbury versus Madison.

21
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.770
Another unusual aside.
Hector,

22
00:01:28.771 --> 00:01:33.240
Oregon's lawyer at the Supreme Court was Francis Scott Key,

23
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.370
if that name sounds familiar,

24
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.460
it's because Francis Scott Key composed our national anthem in the painting you

25
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:46.521
see on the side key beholds the American flag is still flying over Fort Mchenry

26
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.960
at dawn on September 14th,

27
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.960
1814 the events which inspired him to write the Star spangled banner events

28
00:01:57.781 --> 00:02:02.781
surrounding the war of 1812 Mr Madison's war not only inspired key to pin oh,

29
00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:05.191
say,

30
00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:10.191
can you see it gave rise to one of the greatest cases in contract law.

31
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.190
The plaintiff appellee and buyer Oregon entered into a deal to buy 111 hogs.

32
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.570
Heads of tobacco from the defendant appellant seller laid law for $7,545.

33
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.160
This was a large purchase.

34
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.370
111 hogsheads is about 111,000 pounds of tobacco.

35
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.570
The purchase was made around the time that news broke of the peace treaty of

36
00:02:41.971 --> 00:02:46.590
Ghent,
which ended the war of 1812.
During the war.

37
00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:51.591
The price of tobacco was very low because of the British naval embargo around,

38
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.350
uh,
the city of New Orleans.
Because of the war,

39
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.440
literally tons of tobacco.
We're going unsold,

40
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.260
warehoused on the docks of New Orleans.

41
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.130
Once the war was over and the embargo lifted,

42
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.700
this tobacco would be worth a lot more money.

43
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.390
Defendant laid law initially delivered tobacco to the plaintiff,

44
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.480
but later retook the hogs heads by force.

45
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.260
The defendant alleged plaintiff had heard from the British fleet the news about

46
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:33.250
the signing of the peace treaty before this news was made public and was

47
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:38.251
consequently able to buy at an artificially depressed embargo price.

48
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.520
When the defendant asked if there was any news which was calculated to enhance

49
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:48.820
the price or value of the article about to be purchase,

50
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.390
the plaintiff apparently remained silent when the signing of the treaty was

51
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:55.810
announced to the public.

52
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.860
The value of tobacco increased from 30 to 50%.

53
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.230
The plaintiff,
the buyer,

54
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:07.231
Oregon filed suit for breach of contract to regain the tobacco or to be awarded

55
00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:12.400
damages.
The lower court found for the plaintiff,

56
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.780
the instant court,
the US Supreme Court reversed and remanded.

57
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.980
The main issue in this case was whether plaintiff's non responsiveness to the

58
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:28.060
defendant's question constitutes fraud.
In this case,

59
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.860
the plaintiff concealed information about the signing of the peace treaty of

60
00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:37.861
Ghent that affected the price of tobacco at which they would have contracted

61
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.470
justice.
Marshall held that no.

62
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.700
The suppression of information in this case did not constitute fraud.

63
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.970
There's no duty in arm's lengths transactions to disclose information.

64
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.110
However,
Justice Marshall also held quote,

65
00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:01.290
each party must take care not to say or do anything tending to impose upon the

66
00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:04.054
other.

67
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.440
So what was the holding of laid lobby Oregon?

68
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.900
Which party won this case?

69
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.650
There's actually a complicated answer.

70
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.110
On the one hand,

71
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.440
Marshall clearly states the rule that the buyer quote was not bound to

72
00:05:24.441 --> 00:05:27.950
communicate unquote the news that the war had ended.

73
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.230
On the other hand,
Marshall also holds that quote,

74
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.320
whether any imposition was practiced by the vendee upon the Venn door ought to

75
00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:40.850
have been submitted to the jury.

76
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.320
He remands the case on that basis.
If the,

77
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.210
if the buyer was under no duty to disclose what other imposition might there

78
00:05:50.211 --> 00:05:51.044
have been?

79
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.300
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

80
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.070
<v 0>well the fact that the seller asked a question and got no answer played</v>

81
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.220
important role in the decision.
If the question was asked,

82
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.520
do you know of any news and and the buyer answers?

83
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.620
No.
That would clearly be fraud.

84
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.430
The buyer silence in this situation might be though interpreted as a yes.

85
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.840
If you were a seller and ask that question and the buyer was silent or

86
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:22.820
responded,
how about those mets?

87
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.870
You might worry that the buyer had something to hide,

88
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.410
but sometimes non-responsiveness throws the questioner off track.

89
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.950
That's why politicians are nonresponsive to so many questions.

90
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.850
The court said that the buyer's silence in some cases might tend to impose upon

91
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.740
other people.
This is probably why the case was remanded,

92
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.750
so there are two main holdings of the case.
First,

93
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.550
there is no duty to disclose information in arms length transactions,

94
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.910
but second and implicit misrepresentation by silence in the face of a question

95
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.700
is possibly actionable.

96
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.530
Let's talk for a moment about the duty of disclosure.

97
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.230
The first holding in Laidlaw that the buyer did not have a general duty to

98
00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:23.231
disclose that the war had ended was quite influential in the development of US

99
00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:24.260
law.

100
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.260
It was not until the second half of the 20th century that US courts began

101
00:07:29.451 --> 00:07:34.451
recognizing a duty to disclose in our blanks transactions often on the heels of

102
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.050
legislative disclosure requirements.
Thus,

103
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:44.170
the ninth circuit could write as late as 1967 quote businessmen dealing at arm's

104
00:07:46.011 --> 00:07:50.840
length or rarely under a duty to speak.
Then quote today,

105
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.340
courts are more willing to recognize a duty to disclose and arm length

106
00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:56.450
transactions.

107
00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:01.780
Section one 61 of the restatement states the conditions where a person's

108
00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:08.291
nondisclosure of a fact can be treated as the fact not existing at all.

109
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:14.960
One of the conditions is where disclosure of the fact would correct a mistake of

110
00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:18.920
the other party as to a basic assumption of the contract.

111
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.870
This clearly has implications for the Laidlaw case.
However,

112
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:28.160
even under Laidlaw,
it's possible to create a duty of disclosure.

113
00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.270
Laidlaw teaches that by asking the question,

114
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:37.540
one party can create for the other party a duty to disclose.

115
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:43.240
Alternatively a party might demand and explicit representation from the other

116
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:48.860
that she has no material nonpublic information concerning the contract.

117
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.760
Section one 61 B of the restatement also suggests that a party can created of

118
00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:59.790
disclosure by making a representation herself.

119
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.290
For example,
imagine that the seller had said,

120
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:09.650
I represent to you buyer that I laid law have no reason to think that the price

121
00:09:10.771 --> 00:09:15.771
of tobacco is about to rise and my belief is a basic assumption under which I am

122
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.030
entering into this contract.

123
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:23.990
Under section one 61 the buyer might have a duty to disclose to correct the

124
00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:28.170
buyer's mistake as to this basic assumption

125
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.440
in a later class,

126
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:36.500
we will learn more about how the duty of disclosure is treated by a modern court

127
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.330
in Hill v Jones.

128
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.840
If courts can hear implicit representations in response to a question or in

129
00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:52.220
response to representations,

130
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:57.670
why couldn't courts go further and here are default or implicit representations

131
00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.410
as a part of all promising?

132
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:06.040
Imagine the law created a default representation by every contractor which said,

133
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:08.623
quote,

134
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:13.100
I have no private information suggesting that you shouldn't want to contract

135
00:10:13.101 --> 00:10:13.401
with me.

136
00:10:13.401 --> 00:10:18.401
Under these terms unquote this default implicit representation,

137
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:24.800
it would merely be a default and it could be avoided by a contractor revealing

138
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:30.220
that they had undisclosed information or disclosing the private information

139
00:10:30.471 --> 00:10:34.670
itself.
Wouldn't that make our contracting world better?

140
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:40.570
Why make a worried sellers ask questions or make their own representations?

141
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:42.950
Well,

142
00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:47.950
one reason we might not want that kind of a default disclosure requirement is

143
00:10:49.131 --> 00:10:53.960
because we don't want to discourage people like Oregon from going out and

144
00:10:53.961 --> 00:10:56.300
discovering the value of things.

145
00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:01.850
Anthony Kronman pointed out that the law should distinguish between casually

146
00:11:01.851 --> 00:11:06.851
acquired information and information that is deliberately acquired through the

147
00:11:07.461 --> 00:11:10.010
active effort of an individual.

148
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:15.230
If the law requires contractors to reveal private information,

149
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.840
especially about the value of goods,

150
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:23.440
the disclosure duty might very well blunt the incentive for individuals to go

151
00:11:24.201 --> 00:11:26.510
out and find the value of things.

152
00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:31.310
Value Discovery effort provides benefits for society.

153
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:36.550
Stock market prices might be a lot less accurate under such a disclosure

154
00:11:37.101 --> 00:11:37.934
default.

155
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:42.470
So it might make sense to require the other side to do something more,

156
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.760
uh,
in effect,
uh,
to,
uh,

157
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.780
bargain for this private information.

158
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.100
To summarize,

159
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:59.350
laid law introduced the idea that there's no duty to disclose in arm lengths

160
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:00.970
negotiations.

161
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.770
This idea was incredibly influential in American contract legal history.

162
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:11.310
It was only until recently that courts have imposed a duty of disclosure in

163
00:12:11.711 --> 00:12:13.960
certain circumstances.
In addition,

164
00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:18.961
laid law also introduced the idea that silence in the face of a question could

165
00:12:19.691 --> 00:12:24.250
constitute an actual actionable implicit misrepresentation.

166
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.840
Finally,

167
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:30.840
we've learned that by making a representation you might be able to create a

168
00:12:30.971 --> 00:12:34.810
disclosure duty on the other side to correct your mistake.

169
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.810
We will later on examined the duty of disclosure and the concept of

170
00:12:40.811 --> 00:12:45.370
misrepresentation in much greater detail in the next few lessons.
