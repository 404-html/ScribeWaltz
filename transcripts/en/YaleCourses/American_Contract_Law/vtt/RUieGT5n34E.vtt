00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:01.531
Today,

2
00:00:01.531 --> 00:00:06.531
we're going to learn about the three types of contractual damage remedies

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.080
through the case of Sullivan versus O'Connor,

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.500
which was decided by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in 1973 Alice

5
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.450
Sullivan was a professional entertainer and she had a problem.

6
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:25.230
Her nose was excessively long and prominent.

7
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.100
She found a plastic surgeon,
Dr. James O'Connor,

8
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.140
who promised to quote,
enhance her beauty and improve her appearance.

9
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.880
Legend has it.

10
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:40.881
He promised her and knows just like the movie star Hetty Lamar Sullivan was

11
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.330
supposed to undergo two surgeries in order to achieve this effect for a fee of

12
00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:51.960
$622.
Instead,
however,

13
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:54.790
solve and underwent three surgeries,
uh,

14
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.810
that went badly and ended up with an uglier knows than the one she had started

15
00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:01.740
with.
It was bulbous,

16
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.950
flattened and broadened in the middle and the tip had lost symmetry.

17
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.890
Sullivan sued Dr. O'Connor for both breach of contract and for medical

18
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:14.070
malpractice.

19
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.120
The jury ruled for the doctor on the medical malpractice claim.

20
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.110
That is it found that he had exercise the care and judgment that could be

21
00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:24.330
expected from a professional like him,

22
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.840
but awarded the plaintiff $13,500 of damages for breach of contract.

23
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.250
The opinion we've read is the decision of the highest court of the state of

24
00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:40.200
Massachusetts on appeal.

25
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.890
The justices cannot evaluate questions of fact,

26
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.960
but instead are looking at whether the judge instructed the jury correctly on

27
00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:52.230
how to calculate damages.
Uh,

28
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.290
the judge had instructed them that Solvan could re could recover out of pocket

29
00:01:57.931 --> 00:01:58.764
expenses,

30
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.430
directed direct damages from the disfigurement of her nose and pain and

31
00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:06.990
suffering from the third operation,

32
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.080
the extra one that she was not supposed to undergo the defendant,

33
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.700
a Dr. O'Connor took exception to the judge's instructions saying they were

34
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:18.301
flawed,

35
00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:23.301
that that Solvan should at most be able to recover just her out of pocket

36
00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:27.540
expenses.
The court must decide whether a,

37
00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:31.290
that argument is correct,
if it decides in favor of the defendant,

38
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:36.291
Solvan can receive at most $622 in direct costs and not anything else that the

39
00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:42.900
jury awarded her.
The central issue then is Kana.

40
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.640
Patient received damages based on anything other than the direct expenses,

41
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.090
the fees she paid in particular,
uh,

42
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.810
for pain and suffering and for the failure to achieve the promised result.

43
00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.370
Originally Sullivan also took exception to the instructions.

44
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.200
The judge had suggested that she could receive damages based on the difference

45
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:07.420
between the nose,
uh,

46
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.630
with which he began and the nose she ended up with.

47
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.880
But she thought she should be able to receive the difference between Hedley

48
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.360
Lamarr,
his nose,
the nose she was promised,
and the no she ended up with.

49
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.270
However,
by the time this opinion was written,

50
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:25.150
she had waved this objection.

51
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.370
And so justice Kaplan had no ability to change the award in her favor.

52
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.230
She might have been able to get a larger award if she had preserved her

53
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:36.400
objection on appeal.

54
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.350
So Justice Kaplan first asks whether the enforcement of the physicians,

55
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.320
uh,
promise is against public policy.

56
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.810
Courts had been skeptical for a couple reason about enforcing such promises.

57
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.080
First,
doctors can sell them in good faith,

58
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.930
promise specific results,
the court said.

59
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.120
And so they typically do not make such promises of courts do not want to turn

60
00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:08.170
every enthusiastic remark about a procedure into a guarantee that's,

61
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.820
uh,
uh,
that will lead to litigation.
Second,

62
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.890
courts have been suspicious that Pa,
uh,

63
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.530
patients bring contract claims are merely line to get around the statute of

64
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:23.230
limitations for medical malpractice claims,

65
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:28.150
which are more appropriate in such a matters.

66
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.870
Uh,

67
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.870
but Justice Kaplan also recognizes that some doctors may on occasion a guarantee

68
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:39.541
results and he thinks that the jury could find that to be the case for Doctor

69
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.160
uh,
O'Connor.

70
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.110
He therefore concludes that contractual remedies are not forbidden.

71
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.460
Uh,
uh,
for all medical cases,
uh,

72
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.670
this position makes sense because at least some of the time physicians may be

73
00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.600
the least cost.

74
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.600
Avoiders other providers of goods and services sometimes give guarantees that

75
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:08.260
their products will work consistently,
even if they do occasionally fail.

76
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.970
And we think that it's a good policy since the manufacturers,
uh,

77
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.343
uh,

78
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.610
or service providers are often in the best position to control,

79
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.580
uh,
uh,
the risks of failure.

80
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.280
So for some medical operations.

81
00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:26.980
This may also be the case with regard to physicians.

82
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.410
In this case,

83
00:05:29.411 --> 00:05:34.240
Justice Kaplan considered different purposes of contract remedies in order to

84
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:37.390
determine what damages solving is entitled to receive.

85
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.990
Section three 44 of the restatement summarizes the three main interest that

86
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:48.361
contract damages protect judicial remedies under the rules stated in the

87
00:05:50.021 --> 00:05:54.350
restatement serve to protect one or more of the following interests,
uh,

88
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.520
of a promise.
See a his expectation interest,

89
00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:03.080
which is his or her interest in having the benefit of the bargain by being put

90
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:07.850
in as good a position as he or she would have been in had the contract been

91
00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:11.270
performed be the reliance interest,

92
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.300
which is his or her interest in being reimbursed for the loss caused by relying

93
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.800
on the contract.

94
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.860
And you do this by being put in as good a position as he or she would have been

95
00:06:23.871 --> 00:06:27.200
in had the contract not been made.
And finally,

96
00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:29.450
there's something called the restitution and trust,

97
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:33.860
which is a plaintiff's interest in having restored to him any benefit that he

98
00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:35.960
converted on the defendant.

99
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.460
Let's look at each of these damage interests.
In turn.

100
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.170
First,

101
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:47.170
the expectation interest is the one that is most commonly awarded as damages in

102
00:06:47.451 --> 00:06:50.960
contract law.
When a court awards a plaintiff,

103
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.240
a expectation damages,

104
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.650
it tries to put the plaintiff in as good a position as she would have been in

105
00:06:57.651 --> 00:06:59.960
had the defendant perform the contract.

106
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:04.100
As promised to assess expectation damages,

107
00:07:04.101 --> 00:07:08.000
we have to compare the position of the plaintiff that the plaintiff would have

108
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:12.320
been in if the defendant had perfectly performed,
uh,
his promise.

109
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.750
With the position we find the plaintiff.

110
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:19.430
And now the idea is that when one party breaches the contract,

111
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.450
he has no right to worse in the other party's relative to position to what it

112
00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:27.440
would have been if the contract had been performed in law and economics.

113
00:07:27.441 --> 00:07:30.620
This principle is connected to the idea of the efficient breach.

114
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:35.630
A party should breach a contract only when he receives benefits from doing so

115
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:40.610
that are enough to compensate the other party for her losses from the breach.

116
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.500
We can consider what expectation damages would look like in this case.

117
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.980
In the world promised by the contract.

118
00:07:48.981 --> 00:07:53.981
Solvan would have paid $622 experienced pain and suffering from to operations

119
00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:00.830
and wound up with a nose like Hedy Lamarr's.
Instead,

120
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:06.100
she paid the fee experienced pain and suffering from three operations and wound

121
00:08:06.501 --> 00:08:11.501
up with the defiguration knows the difference between these two positions which

122
00:08:12.381 --> 00:08:17.381
he would recover under the expectation damage measure is the pain and suffering

123
00:08:18.321 --> 00:08:23.080
from the third operation and the difference between a beautiful nose and it

124
00:08:23.081 --> 00:08:23.960
disfigured.
One.

125
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:29.500
Justice Kaplan describes the general unenthusiastic or skepticism of courts

126
00:08:30.921 --> 00:08:34.640
about applying expectation damages in medical cases.

127
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:40.010
The judges think that doctors promises of cures are just statements of opinions

128
00:08:40.011 --> 00:08:44.870
with some optimistic coloring and that enforcing the expectation interest could

129
00:08:44.871 --> 00:08:48.110
leave doctors to practice defensive medicine.

130
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:54.040
It's also very difficult to calculate the value of a purely hypothetical end

131
00:08:54.231 --> 00:08:55.064
result,

132
00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:00.320
but Kaplan also cites the famous case of Hawkins vs Mcgee from New Hampshire in

133
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:05.901
1929 in which a man did recover expectation damages from a physician.

134
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:11.930
The doctor had promised to give him a good or perfect tanned and so his damages

135
00:09:12.751 --> 00:09:17.751
were based on the difference in value between such a hand and the mangled and

136
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:20.070
Harry one that he ended up in.

137
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.560
So just as Kaplan cannot rule out the expectation,

138
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:26.220
uh,

139
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:31.220
interest as a possible damage measure when a warring reliance damages.

140
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.450
In contrast,

141
00:09:33.451 --> 00:09:38.451
the goal is to put the plaintiff back in the position she occupied just before

142
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:40.980
the parties entered into upon the agreement.

143
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.740
So to assess reliance damages,

144
00:09:43.741 --> 00:09:48.150
we have to compare the plaintiff's position just before entering the contract

145
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.110
with the position we find her in.
Now in this case,

146
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.670
Ms. Sullivan would never have paid $622.

147
00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.930
She would never have experienced pain and suffering from any of the operations

148
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.240
and she would still have our old nose.

149
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:08.630
She would be entitled to the value of all of three of these in damages under our

150
00:10:10.011 --> 00:10:11.970
reliance measure of damages.

151
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:17.070
Just as Kaplan points out that New York courts have begun to apply this type of

152
00:10:17.071 --> 00:10:22.071
damages in patient physician contract cases and he seems to favor this because

153
00:10:22.171 --> 00:10:27.171
of the reasons he gave for being skeptical about large expectation awards and

154
00:10:27.541 --> 00:10:28.590
medical cases.

155
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:33.480
He also cites contemporary research by fuller in Purdue who argued that

156
00:10:33.481 --> 00:10:37.200
expectation damages make the most sense in commercial context,

157
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:42.510
but that reliance damages should be the default form of damages in other

158
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:43.344
context.

159
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:48.720
While that view has never fully caught on justice Kaplan found it persuasive,

160
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:53.430
it's worth noticing that in some situations the difference between expectation

161
00:10:53.431 --> 00:10:55.920
and reliance damages vanishes.

162
00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:01.050
Suppose for example that there had been a second doctor who would have made a

163
00:11:01.051 --> 00:11:06.051
similar promise and would have succeeded in giving Sullivan a heady Lamarr like

164
00:11:06.091 --> 00:11:06.924
nose.

165
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.740
Then the plaintiff could argue that in reliance on doctor Connors promise,

166
00:11:11.741 --> 00:11:16.500
she turned down the alternative offer from the other physician.
Her position,

167
00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:21.210
if you had not entered into the contract with Dr. O'Connor is that she would

168
00:11:21.211 --> 00:11:24.270
have entered into a successful contract with the other doctor.

169
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.720
So the alternative situation that forms the basis for calculating damages looks

170
00:11:30.001 --> 00:11:33.390
the same for both reliance and expectation.

171
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.560
We compare Sullivan is disfigured,
knows to the perfect nose.

172
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:43.190
That is the reliance damage damages end up incorporating Selvans opportunity

173
00:11:43.501 --> 00:11:47.550
costs in selecting Dr. O'Connor over the competing physician,

174
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.020
the restitution interest.

175
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:55.930
The third measure of damages is discussed less frequently and is concerned with

176
00:11:55.931 --> 00:12:00.910
ensuring that the party that has breached a contract doesn't get to keep the

177
00:12:00.911 --> 00:12:04.090
benefits he or she received from the uh,

178
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.670
contract in this case.

179
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:11.700
That would mean that doctor Connor would have to pay back the $622 fee he

180
00:12:11.861 --> 00:12:13.180
received from Sullivan.

181
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.970
While this is the sort of damages that Dr. O'Connor argues for Justice Kaplan

182
00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:23.830
never seriously contemplates this as an option as it would be plainly to meager

183
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:29.610
while expectation and reliance focus on the plaintiffs positions.

184
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.940
Uh,
restitution focuses on the defendant's positions.

185
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:39.100
The more standard type of restitution attempts to put the defendant in the

186
00:12:39.101 --> 00:12:44.101
position he or she would have been in a had the contract not been bade.

187
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:49.870
It does compare as the position we find the defendant in with the position the

188
00:12:49.871 --> 00:12:52.960
doctor was in just before making the contract.

189
00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:57.630
We find the doctor and the position of having received fees and having expanded

190
00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:02.290
effort in three operations to put the doctor and the ex ante position,

191
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:07.060
we would need to force the doctor disgorge the fees paid less,

192
00:13:07.061 --> 00:13:09.340
some discount for the physicians effort,

193
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:14.760
but restitution often for simplicity might just force the disgorgement of the

194
00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:19.740
fees paid.
By the way,
if uh,

195
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.490
you should be able to create a two by two chart,
uh,

196
00:13:24.491 --> 00:13:29.491
with expectation reliance and restitution in three of the four boxes and realize

197
00:13:30.521 --> 00:13:35.170
that there is a fourth measure of damages which that would strive to put the

198
00:13:35.171 --> 00:13:40.171
doctor in the ex post position that is in the position as if the contract had

199
00:13:40.961 --> 00:13:42.250
been fully performed.

200
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:48.130
I discussed just that possibility in my two by two lecture and the law students

201
00:13:48.131 --> 00:13:49.270
toolkit course.

202
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.040
This table provides a summary of the conclusions with uh,

203
00:13:56.170 --> 00:14:00.730
come to over the past few slides along with the judge's instruction to the jury.

204
00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.320
As you can see,

205
00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:07.410
his instructions don't quite match either reliance damages or expectation

206
00:14:07.991 --> 00:14:11.680
damages.
Let's go through a few of the categories.

207
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.790
First of all,
with regard to the doctor's fees,

208
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:20.560
the doctor's fees are available as damages under the reliance measure since

209
00:14:20.561 --> 00:14:25.561
Sullivan wouldn't have paid them if not for the existence of the contract.

210
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:30.550
If not for her reliance on the contract,
she cannot recover them.

211
00:14:30.551 --> 00:14:31.240
However,

212
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:36.240
under the expectation measure because she would have paid them if the operation

213
00:14:36.311 --> 00:14:41.311
had been successful here the trial judge's instructions match the reliance

214
00:14:41.861 --> 00:14:46.861
measure now with regard to out of pocket fees and the pain and suffering they

215
00:14:47.081 --> 00:14:50.270
both work in the same way.
Under the reliance measure,

216
00:14:50.271 --> 00:14:55.271
the plaintiff can recover for all three operations since none of the operations

217
00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:59.930
would have happened without contract existing without her reliance on the

218
00:14:59.931 --> 00:15:03.680
contract.
However,
under the expectation measure,

219
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:08.540
the plaintiff can only recover damages for the third operation because she would

220
00:15:08.541 --> 00:15:12.770
have paid the fees and experienced the pain and suffering of the first two

221
00:15:12.771 --> 00:15:17.720
operations even if the operations had been successful.
Note,

222
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:18.583
however,

223
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:23.150
that the trial judge's instructions match the reliance measure for out of pocket

224
00:15:23.151 --> 00:15:23.984
fees,

225
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:28.370
but the less gender generous expectancy measure for pain and suffering.

226
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.710
This may reflect the judges greater comfort in breach of contract cases with

227
00:15:33.711 --> 00:15:38.711
compensation for monetary costs than with compensation for pain and suffering.

228
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:44.350
The damage categories relating to lost earnings and to the value of solar ovens

229
00:15:44.751 --> 00:15:48.560
knows itself also form a similar pair.

230
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:52.610
They worked the same way when protecting the reliance interest.

231
00:15:52.611 --> 00:15:56.990
We want to put Solvan back in the position she was in before the contract was

232
00:15:56.991 --> 00:16:01.991
formed and so we calculate the difference between her situation then and her

233
00:16:02.151 --> 00:16:06.530
situation.
Now when protecting the expectation interest,

234
00:16:06.531 --> 00:16:09.590
we want to put Solvan into the hypothetical position.

235
00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:14.830
She would have been in had Dr. O'Connor accomplished as promised a operation and

236
00:16:15.921 --> 00:16:20.720
so we calculate the difference between the hypothetical situation of her having

237
00:16:20.721 --> 00:16:23.990
a better knows and solvents actual situation.

238
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:29.590
We don't have any evidence of the trial court's view on lost earnings though it

239
00:16:29.811 --> 00:16:34.730
looks like reliance damages because the court did not contemplate how much

240
00:16:34.731 --> 00:16:37.850
Solvan might have earned if she looked like Hetty Lamar.

241
00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:43.370
But we know that the judge instructed the jury to calculate reliance damages for

242
00:16:43.371 --> 00:16:45.140
the value of her nose.

243
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:50.930
The final result in the case reflects the general principle that common law

244
00:16:50.931 --> 00:16:53.090
judges apply and making decisions.

245
00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:57.290
The only answer the questions that they absolutely must hear.

246
00:16:57.291 --> 00:17:01.910
Justice Kaplan is only deciding whether Sullivan can receive damages for pain

247
00:17:01.911 --> 00:17:06.911
and suffering for the third operation and damages for the worse and conditioned

248
00:17:07.071 --> 00:17:07.904
of her nose.

249
00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:13.120
It turns out that whether Justice Kaplan chooses expectancy damages or reliance

250
00:17:13.671 --> 00:17:18.070
damages,
she'd be entitled to uh,
these,
uh,

251
00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.390
two forms of damages either way,

252
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:25.520
so it's not necessary for him to pick expectation or reliance damages.

253
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:30.590
First,
let's think about the pain and suffering damages for the third operation.

254
00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.830
In the expectation damages view,

255
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:38.570
Ms. Sullivan is entitled to these because she was only supposed to undergo two

256
00:17:38.571 --> 00:17:41.630
operations in the reliance damages view,

257
00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.710
Solvan would be entitled of these along with pain and suffering for the first

258
00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:48.830
two operations because we're trying to put her back in the,

259
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:53.820
she was in before she made an agreement with Dr. O'Connor.

260
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.230
Now let's think about the damages from the worst and conditioned of her nose.

261
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:03.530
It's clear that Solvan is entitled to these on the reliance damages view because

262
00:18:03.841 --> 00:18:07.260
these damages simply reflect the harm O'Connor did to her,

263
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:11.970
which we're trying to make right in the expectancy view.
On the other hand,

264
00:18:11.971 --> 00:18:16.290
she'd be entitled to the difference between the Hetty Lamar perfect nose and the

265
00:18:16.291 --> 00:18:18.630
disfigured one she wound up with,

266
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.160
but these damages would definitely be larger and so she's at least entitled to

267
00:18:23.161 --> 00:18:27.600
the amount of the jury warded her under the instruction the judge gave.

268
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.730
So again,

269
00:18:29.731 --> 00:18:34.140
Justice Kaplan doesn't even have to come to a conclusion about what types of

270
00:18:34.141 --> 00:18:38.790
damages are appropriate in this case because the plaintiff wins either way.

271
00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:40.920
He doesn't declare a general rule.

272
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:46.280
Had Alice Silva not waived her rebuttal claims to the other types of damages,

273
00:18:46.531 --> 00:18:50.910
he might have had to come to a decision about whether she could receive

274
00:18:50.911 --> 00:18:54.870
expectation damages for the disfigurement of her nose.

275
00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.760
It's true that she received her out of pocket expenses for all three operations,

276
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.390
which would only be valid,
valid under a reliance measure.

277
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.950
But that issue was not before the Supreme Judicial Court in this case because

278
00:19:07.951 --> 00:19:12.210
neither of the parties challenged it.
So let's take a little quiz.

279
00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:17.490
Imagine that Michael has yellow teeth and Dr. Smith promises to make them white,

280
00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:21.300
but instead they end up brown.
Michael Sues for breach of contract.

281
00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:26.570
Which of the following would be calculated for expectation damages?

282
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.600
The answer is the second is the second answer here.

283
00:19:30.601 --> 00:19:34.560
It's the difference in the value between the white and the brown teeth.

284
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:39.840
It's the difference between what the position he ends up with is with Brown

285
00:19:39.841 --> 00:19:42.840
teeth in the position he was promised was the white teeth,

286
00:19:42.841 --> 00:19:47.140
which is what is get granted by expectation damages.
Okay.

287
00:19:47.141 --> 00:19:51.180
And now here's a related question.
It's the same hypothetical,

288
00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:56.520
but the question is which of the following would be calculated for reliance

289
00:19:57.151 --> 00:20:01.410
damages?
The correct answer is number three,

290
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:06.360
the difference in value between yellow and brown teeth.
Uh,

291
00:20:06.361 --> 00:20:10.080
for reliance damages,
we're trying to put the party,

292
00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:13.860
the non breaching party back in the position as if the contract had not been

293
00:20:13.861 --> 00:20:16.200
formed.
The position with the,

294
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:20.850
that Michael was in before the contract was having yellow teeth.
Uh,

295
00:20:20.851 --> 00:20:24.990
the position he ended up with was brown teeth and so we have to come up with a

296
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:30.200
monetary value for the difference between having yellow and brown teeth from

297
00:20:30.901 --> 00:20:32.700
reading Sullivan and O'connor.

298
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:37.760
We've learned about three different damage measures that may help protect

299
00:20:37.861 --> 00:20:41.670
people's contractual interests.
Expectation damages,

300
00:20:41.671 --> 00:20:46.320
try to put the non breaching party in the same position she would have been in

301
00:20:46.321 --> 00:20:48.160
had the contract been carried out.

302
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:52.420
These are most common in a commercial contract cases.

303
00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:54.730
Reliance damages in contrast,

304
00:20:54.731 --> 00:20:58.600
try to put the non breaching party in the same position she would have been in

305
00:20:58.601 --> 00:21:03.601
had the contract never been entered and restitution damages try to pull back

306
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:09.970
from the breaching party any benefit that he or she received from the contract.

307
00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:15.060
The general rule is that plaintiffs can choose which of the three damaged

308
00:21:15.061 --> 00:21:19.360
measures they want to pursue in contractual breach cases.

309
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.510
Now,
at least as an initial starting point,

310
00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.510
defendants can have an ability to,
uh,
uh,

311
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:31.510
suggest that under some circumstances there that expectations would,

312
00:21:31.511 --> 00:21:34.210
for example,
be over compensatory.

313
00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.790
But as a starting matter,

314
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:40.900
the plaintiffs have the right to choose among these three and often choose

315
00:21:40.901 --> 00:21:45.070
expectation as the most beneficial.
In this case,

316
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:50.020
Alice Sullivan waived some of the additional damages she might have received

317
00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:55.220
under the expectation measure.
Had she pursued a different litigation strategy,

318
00:21:55.221 --> 00:21:56.470
she might have one more,

319
00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.800
or Justice Kaplan might've explicitly ruled against awarding expectation damages

320
00:22:03.011 --> 00:22:04.300
in medical cases.
