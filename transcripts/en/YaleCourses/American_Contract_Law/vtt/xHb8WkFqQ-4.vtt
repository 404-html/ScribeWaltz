1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.420
Today we learned about the mitigation rule,

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.080
particularly in the context of anticipatory repudiation.

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.650
Well first examine the pre UCC case of reliance Cooper Ridge versus treat and

4
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:18.591
eight circuit decision from 1952 well then learn about how the UCC treats

5
00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:23.940
mitigation and how the reliance cooperage case might be decided.

6
00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:25.110
Under the UCC.

7
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.130
Mitigation is the principle that a party that has suffered a loss has to take

8
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:36.000
reasonable actions to minimize that loss,
uh,

9
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.010
or at least damages will be limited as if they had taken such action.

10
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.413
For example,

11
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.540
suppose Sarah contracts with the bakery to buy a hundred cupcakes but decides to

12
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:53.280
back out of the contract at the last minute.
The cupcakes have already been made.

13
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.250
The mitigation rule suggests that the bakery should try to sell the a hundred

14
00:00:57.251 --> 00:01:01.020
pupcakes cupcakes to someone else before they go bad,

15
00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:06.021
or at least that her damages will be limited to those damages that she would

16
00:01:06.201 --> 00:01:10.170
have incurred if she had a sold them or tried to sell them.

17
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.490
So the bakery wouldn't be entitled to damages for all the cupcakes.

18
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.330
Just the damages that it couldn't mitigate.
In other words,

19
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.550
the cupcakes it couldn't sell from an efficiency perspective,
uh,

20
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.950
the mitigation rule certainly makes sense.

21
00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:30.951
We want to create incentives for the aggrieved party to minimize damages and

22
00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:32.370
avoid waste.

23
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.960
Plaintiff Appellant Reliance Cooper Ridge and defendant appellee treat entered

24
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:44.451
into a written contract in this case under which defendant agreed to produce and

25
00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:49.971
deliver 300,000 White Oak Bourbon staves.

26
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.170
The staves are the things that go into barrels that makeup barrels then that

27
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:57.510
these would be uh,
uh,

28
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.200
delivered by December 31st,

29
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.850
1950 at a price of $450 per thousand.
Staves.

30
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.350
Subsequently,

31
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.470
the defendant seller repudiated the contract by letter and phone on October six

32
00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:14.970
1950.

33
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.300
Plaintiff informed defendant that they would hold him to strict compliance of

34
00:02:20.401 --> 00:02:21.300
their promise.

35
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.670
Defendant never replied or or or performed at trial.

36
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.750
Plaintiff requested damages of the difference between the contract price and the

37
00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:35.751
market price on December 31st the date of contractual performance was do the

38
00:02:37.141 --> 00:02:41.790
trial.
Judge refused instructing the jury that if they found that the defendant

39
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:43.290
repudiated the contract,

40
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.550
then the measure of damages should be the difference between the contract price

41
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.390
and the lower market price plaintiff could have obtained.

42
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.700
Upon learning of the repudiation,

43
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.830
the jury awarded plaintiff $500 and the instant court reversed.

44
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.180
The main issue in this case is whether the plaintiff was under an unconditional

45
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:05.800
duty to mitigate damages.

46
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:09.430
Upon learning of defendant's anticipatory repudiation,

47
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.470
the court held for the plaintiff,

48
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.570
there is no obligation to mitigate damages until there are damages to mitigate

49
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.670
and there are no damages accrued in this case until the date of performance.

50
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.890
It's possible for us to break down the court's reasoning into two inquiry's.

51
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.851
First,

52
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:32.851
the court held that a buyer upon repudiation by the seller may sit and wait in a

53
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:38.641
rising market until the date due for performance and recover damages based upon

54
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:43.150
the difference between the contract price and the market price at that date.

55
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:44.643
Second,

56
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.270
the court held that the buyer did not have a duty to mitigate damages by

57
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:54.271
purchasing stays elsewhere on October six earlier than called for in the

58
00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:57.250
original contract.
When the market price was lower.

59
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.110
What's the rule under the UCC under section two six 10 the non breaching party

60
00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:10.240
has given the option to wait a commercially reasonable time after the

61
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:14.650
repudiation or to cancel or and seek damages.

62
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.010
It is not clear what happens if the buyer Wa waits for more than a commercially

63
00:04:20.021 --> 00:04:22.090
reasonable time and does not cancel.

64
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.140
Also under section two seven 13,

65
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.360
a buyer is only awarded the difference between the market price at the time when

66
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:35.290
the buyer learned of the breach and the contract price.

67
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.080
The opinion in the reliance Cooper's case said that the buyer had no duty to

68
00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:46.081
mitigate even if he accepted the anticipatory repudiation as an actionable

69
00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:50.980
breach of the contract.
Is that consistent or inconsistent with the UCC?

70
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.380
Well,
it's probably inconsistent with UCC.
While at common law,

71
00:04:56.381 --> 00:04:59.640
the promise he can resist repudiation,
uh,

72
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.590
which remember is like an offer to cancel,

73
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:07.270
which the promise he can reject.
But under two seven,

74
00:05:07.271 --> 00:05:10.030
13,
the repudiation can only be,

75
00:05:10.031 --> 00:05:13.210
we be resisted for a commercially reasonable time.

76
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.660
After that time passes that non repudiating buyers damages should not increase

77
00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:24.700
because the buyer failed to mitigate damages.
In other words,

78
00:05:24.701 --> 00:05:29.701
the UCC is likely to to deem that the buyer learned of the breach at the time a

79
00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:35.110
commercially reasonable time to wait performance that expired.

80
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.590
Any waiting after that is done is that the buyer is at risk that the market

81
00:05:42.011 --> 00:05:47.011
price may turn against the buyer after the buyer learns of the sellers breach,

82
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.790
the buyer takes the risk of market fluctuations at his own peril.

83
00:05:51.791 --> 00:05:56.380
If the market price decreases after the date,
the breach is known,

84
00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.420
the damages should not decrease.

85
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.950
If the market price increases after the date the breach is known,

86
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:08.951
the buyer will not get any enhancement in damages under the UCC,

87
00:06:09.591 --> 00:06:14.591
a buyer has another option for damages after breach in addition to two seven 13

88
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.210
under section two seven 12,
uh,

89
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.110
there is the option of cover two section.

90
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.350
This cover damages is describes when a buyer procurers a substitute for the

91
00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:28.220
promised performance.

92
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:34.180
UCC Section two seven 12 says that after a buyer covers the damages he is owed

93
00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:41.210
is the difference between the cost of the substitute goods and the contract

94
00:06:41.211 --> 00:06:46.070
price.
Let's go through an example to see how this would work.

95
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.490
Remember that reliance signed the contract with treat for $450 per thousand

96
00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:57.910
stays.
Now suppose reliance on September 1st,

97
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.500
1950 had canceled the contract because of treats.

98
00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:05.501
Anticipatory breach and reliance purchased 300,000 barrels,

99
00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:11.081
stays at $500 and $25 per thousand from another producer on December 31st,

100
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.180
1950 the market price had dropped back to $450 per thousand.

101
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.530
Uh,

102
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.330
what damages would result if the buyer had covered in this way?

103
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.910
Well,
if the conditions of the UCC two seven 12 one are met,

104
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:32.930
if this was,

105
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.580
if the purchase was done in good faith and it was reasonable,

106
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.890
then the uh,

107
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:46.180
damages should be the difference between the contract price of $450 and the

108
00:07:47.841 --> 00:07:52.670
cover price of $525.
Without knowing more,

109
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.700
it was probably reasonable for reliance as a buyer to cover at the market price

110
00:07:58.281 --> 00:08:03.281
of $525 even though it turned out that it would have been cheaper,

111
00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:04.730
uh,
to wait,

112
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.320
buyers usually don't have a crystal ball to know what will happen to the future

113
00:08:09.321 --> 00:08:10.160
market price.

114
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.630
What damages would result if the buyer failed to cover?

115
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:19.010
Well then damages would be determined by another UCC section,

116
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.970
UCC section two seven 13 in other words,

117
00:08:22.971 --> 00:08:27.971
the court would evaluate what the market price was at the time of breach and

118
00:08:29.001 --> 00:08:33.590
award the difference between the contract price and that market price.

119
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.270
The bottom line is that regardless of whether the buyer actually covers,

120
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.500
the buyer cannot profit from speculation and in both cases,

121
00:08:42.501 --> 00:08:46.880
the remedies approximate what a reasonable cover would cost.

122
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:53.720
Now suppose that reliance still canceled the contract for breach in September

123
00:08:53.721 --> 00:08:57.900
and purchase the stays at $525 per thousand.

124
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:03.000
But now instead,
imagine that the market price instead of falling,

125
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:08.001
that the market price actually increased to $750 per thousand on December 31st,

126
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:15.650
1950 instead of suing for damages under UCC section two seven 12 reliance Sue's

127
00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:21.600
under section two,
seven 13 subparagraph one.

128
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.370
What damages would result?
Well,

129
00:09:26.371 --> 00:09:31.371
the buyer can only recover damages under UCC two seven 12.

130
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:33.451
Uh,

131
00:09:33.451 --> 00:09:38.451
under this kind of a hypothetical actual cover that satisfies UCC section two

132
00:09:39.451 --> 00:09:44.070
seven 12 precludes recovery under UCC section two,

133
00:09:44.071 --> 00:09:45.090
seven 13.

134
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.860
There was some ambiguity in this because section two,

135
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:52.590
seven 12 is silent on this question,

136
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:57.830
but a comment in section to section two seven 13 clarifies the issue and

137
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:04.550
basically if you pursue cover and actually go out and buy substitute goods,

138
00:10:04.561 --> 00:10:07.800
you're going to be limited to two,
seven 12.
Damages.

139
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:09.870
In summary,

140
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.420
reliance cooperage held that there is no obligation to mitigate damages until

141
00:10:15.421 --> 00:10:19.200
the date of performance.
The UCC takes a different position.

142
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:24.530
The obligation to mitigate damages starts at the time the buyer learns of the

143
00:10:24.751 --> 00:10:25.584
breach.

144
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:30.790
There are two ways to calculate damages if the buyer covers and buys as a

145
00:10:32.581 --> 00:10:33.660
substitute.
Good.

146
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:38.930
Then UCC section two seven 12 governs and damages is going to be the difference

147
00:10:39.841 --> 00:10:44.841
between the value of the contract and the value of the substitute goods if the

148
00:10:44.971 --> 00:10:46.380
buyer doesn't cover.

149
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.680
Then UCC section two seven 13 governs and damages is the difference between the

150
00:10:52.471 --> 00:10:57.330
value of the contract and the market price of the goods at the time the buyer

151
00:10:57.331 --> 00:10:58.770
learned of the breach.
