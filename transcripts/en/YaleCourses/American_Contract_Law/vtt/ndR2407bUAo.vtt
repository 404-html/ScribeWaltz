00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.500
Today we explore the concept of mutual assent by examining the case of Emory

2
00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:11.901
versus Harget Dine and some relevant provisions of the uniform commercial code.

3
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.080
Mutual assent describes an agreement between two parties that intend to form a

4
00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:21.450
contract.
Before we take a look at Embry,

5
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.980
let's discuss why mutual assent is such an important concept.

6
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.240
As you know,

7
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.070
parties often have extensive negotiations before signing the contract.

8
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.170
These negotiations happen over time that are subject to the parties choice and

9
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:40.200
not predetermined by law or a circumstance.

10
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.850
Parties can discuss everything from price,
quantity,
quality,

11
00:00:44.851 --> 00:00:48.930
the method of payment,
which party will bear certain risks,

12
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.290
the d distribution of the relationship,

13
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.030
the duration of their relationship and so forth.
At some point,

14
00:00:57.031 --> 00:01:01.710
the parties will end the negotiations and might agree to be bound by contractual

15
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:03.600
obligations.
In other words,

16
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.500
they might bring the contract into formal existence.

17
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.780
Freedom from contract is just as important as freedom to contract.

18
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.990
Individuals don't have to be bound by contractual promises unless they want to,

19
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.290
so figuring out whether they want to be bound is important.

20
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.700
As we go through the next few lessons including this one.

21
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.640
Keep in mind this guiding question.

22
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.620
How do courts tell when there's been sufficient agreement to form a contract?

23
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.930
A contract usually is formed when there's mutual assent.

24
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.790
I think of this as the moment the bell rings,

25
00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:48.791
so kind of trans substantiation that changes legal duties of the parties.

26
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:51.420
Uh,

27
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.420
mutual assent describes the act of agreeing to the terms of the contract.

28
00:01:56.701 --> 00:01:59.460
It's a green to the exchange of promises.

29
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
A related concept that is sometimes treated as a synonym is the meeting of the

30
00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:06.354
minds.

31
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.070
Meeting of the minds describes a situation where there is a common understanding

32
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.380
in the formation of the contract,

33
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.890
a common understanding of what has been exchanged.

34
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.690
Phrase differently.

35
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.750
There's a meeting of the minds when both parties agree to the promised exchange.

36
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.870
Mutual assent usually contains two components.

37
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.450
Offer and acceptance offer.

38
00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:35.040
An acceptance are elements that traditionally were required for the formation of

39
00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:36.720
a legally binding contract.

40
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.820
The person who makes an offer is often called the offer roar and the person who

41
00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:45.450
hears and considers the offer is the offeree.

42
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.460
If I ask,
would you like to buy this pen for $50?

43
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.590
I am a an offer making an offer.
You are the offeree.

44
00:02:55.591 --> 00:02:56.790
If you say yes,

45
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.270
then that is an acceptance with both offer and acceptance.

46
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.900
There is also mutual assent.
Uh,
in this example,

47
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.170
the two of us have mutually assented to the contract through the process of

48
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:12.160
offer and acceptance.

49
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.410
The uniform commercial code which governs the sale of goods has a number of

50
00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:21.790
provisions concerning mutual assent as well as offer and acceptance.

51
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.240
We will now introduce these provisions and they are frequently cited in many of

52
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:31.510
the cases we will learn so it's good to be familiar with them.
First,

53
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:34.480
let's look at UCC two two oh four.

54
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.370
It deals with contract formation in general and it states that a contract for a

55
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:44.371
sale of good can come into being in a variety of ways as long as it's clear that

56
00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:46.780
the parties have reached agreement,

57
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.050
the agreement can be found from conduct or behavior,

58
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:52.300
so does not always have to be in writing.

59
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.970
The provision also states that agreement is enough to be a contract even if we

60
00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:01.750
don't know when the contract started,
when it was formed.

61
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.110
The timing of a contract can be of crucial importance in some contract disputes.

62
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.690
So it's always helpful to ask when the contract is formed or as I sometimes

63
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:14.650
think of it when the bell rings.

64
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.440
UCC Two dash two oh five deals with what are called from offers.

65
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.510
If a merchant makes an offer in writing and is explicit that the offer will be

66
00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:26.344
held open,

67
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.620
then the offer is not revokable for a period of up to three months,

68
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.770
uh,
for it's open,

69
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:40.450
it's going to be held open non revokable for reasonable time but up to three

70
00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:45.040
months.
And in this way the sense of the offer is not revokable,

71
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:47.140
it's called a firm.

72
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.530
You'll notice that there's no consideration in the case of a firm offer because

73
00:04:53.741 --> 00:04:58.741
the offeree hasn't done anything or paid anything to make the offer from

74
00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.951
however,

75
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:04.951
this provision is explicit that at least a merchant offer or is obliged to keep

76
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:10.861
affirm oppor offer open for this period of time of up to three months phrased

77
00:05:12.621 --> 00:05:15.970
differently.
A firm offer is an irrevocable offer.

78
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.420
This is an exception to the general rule that most offers can be revoked by the

79
00:05:21.791 --> 00:05:25.330
offer roar bef at any time before they're accepted.

80
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.400
UCC Two two oh six is an unusual default rule which says that an offer invites

81
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:39.100
acceptance by any reasonable means unless the offer or,

82
00:05:39.101 --> 00:05:43.390
or circumstances unambiguously indicate otherwise.

83
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.050
This suggests that courts require unambiguous evidence to overturn the strong

84
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:55.921
presumption that offers intend to be acceptable by any reasonable means.

85
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.740
The qualifies the common law idea that the offer or is master of her offer at

86
00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:08.570
common law.
The FN offer roar,
uh,
say,

87
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.430
uh,
said something like,
I'll sell you my car for $10,

88
00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:18.431
but you can only accept by sky riding across the sky in New York City law and

89
00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:24.140
economics rocks.
And you respond to this by saying,
thanks,

90
00:06:24.141 --> 00:06:25.930
I accept,
well,

91
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.940
we don't have a contract because you haven't met my conditions for acceptance

92
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.970
and uh,
as master of my offer,

93
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:40.210
I can condition your acceptance on you doing something crazy like skywriting

94
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.280
under the UCC.
In contrast,

95
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.460
I'd have to be careful as the offer or to unambiguously make skywriting the only

96
00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:51.440
means of accepting the contract.

97
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.480
<v 1>Okay?</v>

98
00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.100
<v 0>We just went through three very important provisions of the uniform commercial</v>

99
00:07:01.101 --> 00:07:05.780
code.
It's okay if you're confused or didn't keep track of everything perfectly.

100
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.100
Let's answer two questions to review.
Number one,

101
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.580
I offer you a pen for $100 and you nod and pay me the hundred dollars and take

102
00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:17.624
the pen.

103
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.010
Do we have a contract and which section of the UCC applies?

104
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:23.940
<v 1>Okay,</v>

105
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.300
<v 0>well,
the answer is this is a valid contract.
UCC Two,</v>

106
00:07:27.301 --> 00:07:30.870
two Oh four states that conduct is sufficient for agreement.

107
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.150
All right.
Number two,

108
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.250
a merchant posts an ad to sell a pen for $100 and states the offer is good until

109
00:07:38.251 --> 00:07:39.084
next Friday.

110
00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:44.540
You show up on Tuesday and the merchant has raised the price to $120 what price

111
00:07:45.061 --> 00:07:49.170
are you supposed to pay and which section of the UCC applies?

112
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.190
Well,
the answer is that you should be able to buy the pen for $100.

113
00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.400
And the merchant made a firm offer and is bound by that under UCC two two oh

114
00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:02.114
five.

115
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:08.520
Let's turn now to the case of Embry versus Harget dine in this case.

116
00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:09.180
Embry,

117
00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:14.180
the plaintiff is an employee of the defendant Harget dine Embry told the

118
00:08:14.461 --> 00:08:19.120
president of the company that he would quit his job if he were not given an,

119
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.650
uh,
a renewed employment contract for the following year.

120
00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:26.930
According to the plaintiff,
the president replied,
quote,

121
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.160
go ahead your all right.

122
00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:34.470
Get your men out and don't let that worry you unquote.
At this point,

123
00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.410
the plaintiff believed he had an employment contract.

124
00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:42.240
The president argues he never intended for this to be a contract and plaintiff

125
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:47.450
was an employee at will throughout this period that could an employee at will as

126
00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:51.240
somebody that can be hot fired for good,
bad or no reason.

127
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.930
When employment was terminated early,

128
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.510
the plaintiff sued for breach of contract.

129
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:03.480
The trial judge instructed the jury that defined for plaintiff,

130
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.250
they had to find both that the president uttered the aforementioned phrase and

131
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:13.251
that both parties intended by having such conversation to contract for

132
00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:14.640
plaintiffs reemployment,

133
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.360
the jury found for the defendant and the instant court reversed and remanded

134
00:09:20.611 --> 00:09:24.600
defined out what words were actually used by the employer.

135
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:31.370
So is this an implied in fact or an express contract?

136
00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:33.450
<v 1>Okay.</v>

137
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.090
<v 0>While not the main focus of the opinion,</v>

138
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.350
note that this case lies somewhere in the middle of the spectrum between implied

139
00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:44.670
in fact contracts and express contracts.
Uh,

140
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:49.380
the employer did not express Lee say that he was a rehiring Embry.

141
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:54.560
So it's probably better to think of this as an implied in fact contract that is

142
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.910
words and conduct,

143
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.450
if anything suggested or implied a promise.

144
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:06.230
So under the plaintiff's theory of the case,

145
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:09.440
who is the offer here?
Well,

146
00:10:09.441 --> 00:10:14.090
the answer is that the plaintiff Embry is the offer who offered to be rehired

147
00:10:14.091 --> 00:10:17.480
for another year,
presumably at the same rate of pay.

148
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:22.580
And under the plaintiff's theory Harget Diane accepted the offer by saying,

149
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.030
go ahead.
You're all right.
Get your men out,
et cetera.

150
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.570
The main issue in this case is this.

151
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:33.680
If the plaintiff was reasonable and interpreting defendant's behavior,

152
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:34.730
uh,

153
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:39.730
is it still necessary for the defendant to have an intention to contract for the

154
00:10:40.161 --> 00:10:43.550
contract to exist?
Or in other words,

155
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:48.770
is it what you say or what a reasonable listener would have understood you to

156
00:10:48.771 --> 00:10:52.190
mean?
That determines whether a contract exists?

157
00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:57.680
The court held that it is not necessary for the defendant to have an intention

158
00:10:57.681 --> 00:11:01.160
to contract.
What matters is the expressed intention,

159
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:06.020
although a meeting of the minds is the usual requirement of contract formation,

160
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:11.090
plaintiffs will be held to their expressed intention even if they secretly

161
00:11:11.091 --> 00:11:12.890
harbored contrary thoughts.

162
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:18.230
The court is clear that it's really the objective manifestation of consent that

163
00:11:18.231 --> 00:11:22.640
controls what the speaker is subjectively meant or what the listener

164
00:11:22.641 --> 00:11:25.430
subjectively believed the speaker to mean.

165
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.630
Doesn't count parties that intend but don't manifest.

166
00:11:29.631 --> 00:11:34.580
Don't have a contract parties that don't intend but do manifest,

167
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:35.960
do have a contract.

168
00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:37.893
<v 1>Okay.</v>

169
00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.760
<v 0>Evaluating People's objective.</v>

170
00:11:39.761 --> 00:11:43.600
Manifestation of intent might make a lot of sense at first.

171
00:11:43.601 --> 00:11:47.980
Imagine if you agree to a contract,
but cross your fingers behind your back.

172
00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:52.600
We certainly don't want you to be led out of the contract.
That would be a gross.

173
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:54.543
However,

174
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.840
the reasonable person standard that the court adopts can create a lot of

175
00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:02.800
ambiguity.
The court says that the plaintiff's version of events,

176
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:03.850
if true,

177
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:09.150
was sufficient to be taken by any reasonable person as an assent to the demand.

178
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.790
Do you think that's really true?

179
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:17.230
Some might view the president's speech is a polite brush off rather than the

180
00:12:17.231 --> 00:12:21.840
offer or the acceptance of the uh,

181
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:23.080
employees offer.

182
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.120
Also notice that the court took the decision away from the jury.

183
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.170
It found that the issue as a matter of law,

184
00:12:32.171 --> 00:12:35.500
because no reasonable juror could find differently.

185
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:40.960
This seems quite an extreme position to take given the ambiguity in what the

186
00:12:40.961 --> 00:12:42.430
president actually said.

187
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.140
Today we examine the question of mutual assent.

188
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:51.760
Mutual assent describes an agreement between two parties to create a contract

189
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:55.270
and is a necessary condition of most contracting.

190
00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.710
We took a look at important provisions in the uniform commercial code,

191
00:12:59.711 --> 00:13:03.850
which we will encounter many more times in the rest of this course.

192
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:08.530
The provisions defined offers and acceptance and when they constitute the

193
00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:12.970
formation of a contract.
Finally,
we discussed the Embry case,

194
00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:18.060
which held that the test for agreement is the objective reasonable listener.
