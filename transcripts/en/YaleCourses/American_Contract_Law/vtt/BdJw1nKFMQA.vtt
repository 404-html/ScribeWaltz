00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.620
Today we continue our discussion of impracticability and now impossibility by

2
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:12.180
learning about the case of Taylor versus Caldwell.

3
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.200
This is another landmark English contract law case,

4
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:19.740
which helped to establish an important common law doctrine.

5
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.000
It was decided by the court of Queens bench in 1863 I,

6
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.580
during the US civil war,

7
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.530
the opinions author Justice Blackburn was a highly respected judge who is

8
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.440
remembered for his work on contracts,
common law.

9
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.750
Before we get to the facts of the case,
let's review two key terms.

10
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.460
The doctrine of impracticability is a common law doctrine that excuse

11
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:45.930
performance of the duty.

12
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.060
When that duty became unfeasibly difficult,
uh,
or expensive,

13
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.970
you might hear a separate and related doctrine.

14
00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:58.890
The doctrine of impossibility mentioned in the context of Taylor versus Caldwell

15
00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:02.970
case,
impossibilities impracticability on steroids.

16
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.590
It excuses performance where the duty cannot be physically performed.

17
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.151
In other words,

18
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:13.710
the excuse of impossibility is raised when there's no way for performance to be

19
00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:16.980
accomplished.
The excuse to have impracticability,

20
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.050
which we talked about in the last,
uh,
uh,

21
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.580
video applies when performance is still possible,

22
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.720
but only at an unreasonable cost while not identical.

23
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:32.721
These are certainly similar and intertwined concepts in Taylor versus Caldwell.

24
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.320
The defendant Caldwell agreed to license the music hall to plaintiff Taylor so

25
00:01:39.691 --> 00:01:44.670
that Taylor could host concerts and major events at the venue before these

26
00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:48.000
concerts were held and before the plaintiff had paid the defendant,

27
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.840
the music hall burned down without the fault of either party.

28
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.270
Taylor versus Caldwell is famous for helping to establish the common law defense

29
00:01:57.271 --> 00:02:01.110
of impossibility.
The main issue presented is this,

30
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.750
given that the agreement failed to anticipate the destruction of the music hall

31
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.460
was defendant hall loner,

32
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.490
the Hall loaner still obligated to perform or pay damages he couldn't perform,

33
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:16.800
so it comes down to is it's still obligated to pay damages.

34
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.280
The court held that know the defendant is not on the hook for the contract after

35
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:23.670
the music hall fire.

36
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.380
Reasoning that the parties could not reasonably be expected to anticipate every

37
00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:29.580
unlikely occurrence.

38
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.800
The court announces that the contract contained an implied or default condition

39
00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:39.270
excusing the parties from performance.
If the hall ceased to exist,

40
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.220
the court treated the existence of the music hall as an implicit condition.

41
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.700
Let's try a quiz for the existence of the music hall to be an implicit

42
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.110
condition.
Does it matter if the parties actually contemplated it?

43
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.221
In other words,

44
00:02:56.221 --> 00:03:01.090
did the parties need to have the implicit condition in their minds at the time

45
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:04.930
performing the contract?
Well,
no.

46
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:09.280
It usually doesn't matter whether the parties actually had this implicit

47
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:10.660
condition in mind.

48
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.820
The inquiry usually focuses on what reasonable people would have intended rather

49
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:20.500
than what the parties actually thought about the implied condition that the

50
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:25.390
music hall would still exists is implied by force of law and not because the

51
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:27.100
parties had it in mind.

52
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.920
Recall that the efficient risk bear analysis suggests that a risk should be

53
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:37.270
allocated to the party who's best able to bear the risk.

54
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.780
How does the Taylor v Caldwell case square with this concern of economic

55
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:44.764
efficiency?

56
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.900
While the rule that the continued existence of the thing necessary for

57
00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:54.901
performances and implied condition ignores whether the defendant promissor may

58
00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:59.470
be the better bearer of the risk of the thing perishing.
For instance,

59
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:04.330
if the hall owner is in the best position to prevent a fire to the music call,

60
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:08.680
say by having regular patrols or reducing smoking nearby,

61
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.410
then it might make sense from a,
uh,

62
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.440
efficient risk bearer analysis to have the hollowing or bear the risk of the

63
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:19.270
hall burning down.
However,

64
00:04:19.271 --> 00:04:23.320
remember that this case is a case where the fire happened,

65
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:25.900
quote without fault of either party and quote.

66
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.550
So perhaps there is no superior risk.
Bear in this particular case,

67
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.930
at any rate,

68
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.930
justice Blackburn has definitely was definitely more influenced by the civil law

69
00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:41.530
then by considerations of economic efficiency when he decided this case,

70
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.370
Taylor versus Caldwell establishes the common law roots of an impracticability

71
00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:51.190
defense and it remains important in modern contracts.

72
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.530
Section two six one of the second restatement allows him practice the

73
00:04:56.531 --> 00:05:00.970
impracticability defense to discharge a party's duty to perform.

74
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.300
And Section two six three specifically discusses cases where an object's

75
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:08.920
existence is necessary for performance.

76
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.360
If the existence of a physical object is necessary for performance,

77
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.460
then it is viewed as a basic assumption and and implicit condition upon which

78
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:22.780
the contract is made.
If the physical object does not exist,

79
00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:27.100
then performance is impracticable and the duty to perform is discharged.

80
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.370
If the Taylor case was decided today,

81
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.840
then whether the particular music hall is necessary for performance is an

82
00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:35.920
important inquiry.

83
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.250
If the court finds that the burn hall was necessary for the performance and that

84
00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:44.380
other halls weren't reasonable substitutes,

85
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.250
then the fire would discharge the owner's duty to provide a hall.

86
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.040
Another major category of impracticability is the death or incapacity of

87
00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:55.390
unessential person.

88
00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:01.140
As with restatement section two six three the key question is to determine

89
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:06.200
whether the particular person is necessary for the performance of the duty.

90
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.530
The question of who is necessary may be determined by the agreement or if the

91
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:16.310
agreement is silent and assessment of whether the performance was a personal

92
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:21.200
matter requiring personal experience,
ability,
skill and judgment.

93
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.240
Under this test,

94
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:27.770
the death of an artist employed to paint a portrait would discharge the

95
00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:28.604
contract,

96
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.470
but the death of the subject of the portrait would not discharge a duty to pay

97
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:34.640
the agreed price.

98
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.300
Another way to determine who is necessary is to ask whether the person who dies

99
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:45.470
or was incapacitated could have delegated his or her duty to a third party

100
00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:47.180
without the other party's consent.

101
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.520
The question is whether the other party has a substantial interest in having the

102
00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:56.720
contract performed by the this particular person.
If so,

103
00:06:56.721 --> 00:06:59.240
the contract is discharged.
For instance,

104
00:06:59.241 --> 00:07:04.241
the death of the contractor might not excuse con a contract to do construction

105
00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:09.020
work,
but death of an attorney likely would discharge a,

106
00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:11.030
a contract with a law firm,

107
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:16.630
but since people rather than corporations die or become incapacitated and become

108
00:07:17.541 --> 00:07:18.620
incapacitated,

109
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.790
the question remains whether the performance to be rendered was so personal in

110
00:07:22.791 --> 00:07:27.791
nature that it could not have been discharged in Taylor versus Caldwell.

111
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.010
Was this a case of supervening or existing impracticability.

112
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:35.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

113
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.021
<v 0>Well,</v>

114
00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:41.021
this is a case of supervening impracticability meaning the events giving rise to

115
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:46.130
the impracticability occurred after the formation of the contract.

116
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:52.100
The difference between supervening and existing impracticability is an important

117
00:07:52.101 --> 00:07:54.410
one for analyzing economic efficiency.

118
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:58.640
The difference lies in the opportunity for one or both parties to know at the

119
00:07:58.641 --> 00:08:03.641
time of contracting whether the risk event has occurred for existing

120
00:08:04.821 --> 00:08:05.800
impracticability,

121
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.460
the promise or may know or have reason to know that the risk has already

122
00:08:10.461 --> 00:08:11.360
materialized.

123
00:08:11.361 --> 00:08:16.250
So it's difficult to conclude that the promise or did not assume it put another

124
00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:19.610
way.
When existing impracticability is involved,

125
00:08:19.611 --> 00:08:24.080
it's easier to determine which party was in the best position when information

126
00:08:24.081 --> 00:08:28.640
costs are considered to ascertain the exact state of things.

127
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.660
If the promised her was,
uh,
has that information,

128
00:08:32.661 --> 00:08:36.230
he or she may now be the superior risk bear.

129
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

130
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:38.853
<v 0>In summary,</v>

131
00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:43.360
Taylor v Caldwell is a common law case that introduces the doctrine of

132
00:08:43.361 --> 00:08:44.410
impossibility,

133
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:49.300
which excuses performance when the duty becomes impossible.
Uh,

134
00:08:49.301 --> 00:08:50.230
in particular,

135
00:08:50.231 --> 00:08:55.210
the existence of the thing necessary for performance is seen as an implied

136
00:08:55.211 --> 00:08:57.100
condition to the contract.

137
00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:02.320
This also applies to the existence of a person necessary to a contract.
