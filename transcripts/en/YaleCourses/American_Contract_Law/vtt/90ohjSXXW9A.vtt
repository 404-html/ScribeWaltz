00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.120
Welcome back to further explorations of the UCC section two seven Oh eight,

2
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.990
section two seven Oh eight subparagraph two doesn't only cover lost volume

3
00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:13.254
sellers.

4
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.380
There are other circumstances in which the damages calculated according to two

5
00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:23.340
seven Oh eight subparagraph one might be inadequate.

6
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.860
Let's consider a hypothetical.

7
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.670
Imagine a seller [inaudible] entered into a contract with a buyer Bisco whereby

8
00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:38.481
smergo would manufacture and sell 200 toaster ovens to Bisco for our $60 per

9
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:43.890
oven,
uh,
for a total of $12,000.

10
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.320
Bisco repudiates the agreement while summer go is manufacturing the ovens

11
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.120
because the market for toaster ovens is dismal.
SMERGO stops,

12
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.860
uh,
manufacturing them.

13
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.430
Smergo suse and proves the following facts.

14
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.530
The market price for ovens if completed at the time and place of tender was

15
00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:08.550
$7,000.
[inaudible] can sell them material.

16
00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:13.551
He's amassed for manufacturing the ovens for $3,500 smirk.

17
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.210
We'll have $800 in cost of shipping the ovens to the buyer.

18
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.880
Uh,
if,
if the,
if the,

19
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.050
if the ovens were completed and sold a smirk,

20
00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:30.420
GGO has incurred $6,000 in expenses at the time of the breach.

21
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.050
SMERGO would have to spend $600 more to perform the contract and smirk go has

22
00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:41.670
allocated overhead at $10 per oven,
uh,

23
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.160
for a total of $2,000.

24
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.870
What would damages look like under two seven Oh eight one.

25
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.320
And what would they look like under subparagraph two seven Oh eight two uh,

26
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.810
plugging in the data we have to the formula provided in those provisions,

27
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.030
we'd get the following that four to seven Oh eight one we'd have the $12,000

28
00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:11.721
contract price minus the $7,000 market price plus $0 million for incidental

29
00:02:13.471 --> 00:02:16.950
damages minus $800,
uh,

30
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.100
as the expenses saved for shipping,

31
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.860
which equals $4,200.

32
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.050
Note that this amount is not taking into account the amount smergo has incurred

33
00:02:28.051 --> 00:02:32.490
in expenses is overhead or the value of manufacturing materials?

34
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.773
Well,

35
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.780
what would damage his be under two seven Oh eight subparagraph to one formula

36
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:44.070
offered by professor John Siebert for calculating damages under that provision.

37
00:02:44.071 --> 00:02:48.540
In the case,
in cases that don't involve lost volume is as follows,

38
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.050
you take the unpaid contract price minus total variable costs plus incidental

39
00:02:55.411 --> 00:02:58.080
damages plus reliance damages.

40
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.340
Minus the proceeds of resale minus expenses saved.

41
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.230
And here is how subparagraph to damages would look like.

42
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.500
They would be equal to $12,000 minus $6,600 plus zero plus $2,500 minus zero

43
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.350
minus $800 which all adds up to $7,100.

44
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.200
The first formula does not capture smirk goes expected profits,

45
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.640
including fixed cost nor his reliance damages.

46
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.170
The second formula does and would produce a greater damage.

47
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.190
So in this case,

48
00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:43.900
Margot would want to argue that sub paragraph to damages were appropriate

49
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:48.610
because sub paragraph one would be insufficient to put them in as good a

50
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:52.150
position as if uh,
the buyer had performed.

51
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.450
Catch your breath.
And now let's consider another mathematical hypothetical.

52
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.960
Suppose a middleman agrees to supply 9,000 units of goods to a buyer in six

53
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.130
regular installments on July 1st and on January 2nd of every year for three

54
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:14.500
years at $100 per unit.

55
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.300
At the time of the first scheduled delivery,
which is July 1st,

56
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.470
the market price for the goods was $95 per unit.

57
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.250
At that time,
the seller delivered 1500 units.

58
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.820
But by December 1st the price plummeted to $45 per unit.

59
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.240
The buyer repudiated on that date.
At this point,

60
00:04:37.241 --> 00:04:42.241
the seller had a forward contract with an option to purchase 1500 units for the

61
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:47.881
next installment at $75 per unit and had no other goods or forward contracts on

62
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:52.630
the date for the next delivery,

63
00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:57.631
which is January 2nd by which time the market price had now dropped to $40 per

64
00:04:58.511 --> 00:05:02.800
unit.
The buyer rejected the second installment and said he would take no more

65
00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:03.634
deliveries.

66
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.360
The seller sued on July 1st the intended date of the third delivery.

67
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.910
The market price was now at $50 but was expected to gradually recover.

68
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.830
The seller wanted to use t two seven oh eight one as the basis of recovery.

69
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.140
The buyer believes this will overcompensate the seller.
Can you see why

70
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.730
well considered the goods at the second delivery date?

71
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.210
The contract price minus the market price.

72
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.610
That is the measure of damages.

73
00:05:36.611 --> 00:05:40.570
Under sub paragraph one would be $60 per unit,

74
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.260
but because of the buyers option contract at $75 per unit,

75
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.100
the profit would have been only $25 per unit.

76
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.670
Some courts would limit sellers recovery here because with his option contract

77
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.760
he had hedge the risk of a declining market price.

78
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.360
But in the third delivery where there was no forward contract under two seven Oh

79
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:12.710
eight one the seller would be able to recover $50 per unit,

80
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.390
the hundred dollar contract price minus the $50 market price.

81
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.410
The remaining intended deliveries are initially appear more complex because we

82
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:28.370
do not know what the market price at the time and place of Tinder would be for

83
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:29.720
these future deliveries,

84
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.140
but a different UCC provision section two seven 23 one provides that in such

85
00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:39.020
situations,
uh,

86
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.400
where the time for performance has not yet occurred.

87
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.110
The market price at the time the seller learned of the repudiation,

88
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:53.530
which here is $45 will be used to calculate damages for all these remaining

89
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:56.870
delivery times.

90
00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:02.230
So the seller would get $55 per units for all of these final delivery times.

91
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.990
As these examples suggest,

92
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.710
the damage calculation rules can lead to very different and somewhat perverse

93
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.390
results for different installments.

94
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:20.510
We've packed a whole lot into these,
this two part video,

95
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.120
so let's summarize what we've learned.

96
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:28.130
First we use Locke v Wade to discuss lost volume sellers.

97
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:33.230
Then we introduced and discussed UCC provision two seven oh eight and the

98
00:07:33.231 --> 00:07:37.940
differences between subsection one subsection two finally,

99
00:07:37.941 --> 00:07:42.941
we applied these subsections to two different mathematical hypothetical's and

100
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.300
together we calculated damages under each.
