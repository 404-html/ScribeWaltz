1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.440
Justice.

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.440
Oliver Wendell Holmes once famously said that the duty to keep a contract at

3
00:00:06.781 --> 00:00:11.781
common law means a prediction that you must pay damages if you do not keep it

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.620
and nothing else.

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.050
Imagine you sign a contract stating that you will perform renovations at another

6
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:24.051
person's apartment in return for $500 payment upfront and $3,000 total homes is

7
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:31.500
quote suggests that you have not so much promise that you will do the

8
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:32.281
renovations,

9
00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:36.930
but only that you promise to perform or pay damages if you do not do them.

10
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.750
The distinction may initially seem unclear or even only a matter of semantics,

11
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.380
but today we're going to discuss promissory fraud,

12
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.240
a doctrine that demonstrates just how important this distinction is.

13
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.970
And by the way,

14
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.030
I have a small obsession with promissory fraud and Greg class and I have written

15
00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:02.520
an entire book called insincere promises.

16
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:06.540
And so if you want to learn more about it,
you can always,
uh,
look up that book.

17
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.140
So a claim of promissory fraud is simply a claim that when a promise or made a

18
00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:16.530
promise,
the promise or did not intend to keep that promise.

19
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.170
If a party prove such a claim,

20
00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:23.870
a court can impose punitive damages on the promissory note.
As a reminder,

21
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.590
punitive damages are damages awarded to punish a party's behavior and not to

22
00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:33.591
compensate the breached party for the losses the that the breach causes.

23
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.210
The goal of punitive damages is to deter a the certain behavior.

24
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.550
The award of CUNYs are exceedingly rare in contractual cases,

25
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.450
but promissory fraud is one of the places where you might win them.

26
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.250
Taking up again our renovation contract example,

27
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.900
if you promise to do the renovations because you needed the $500 up front

28
00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:02.190
payment but had no intention of actually performing the renovations,

29
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.260
you could end up paying not just expectation damages for the buyers value of the

30
00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:08.094
contract,

31
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:13.370
but also damages punishing you specifically for misrepresenting your intent to

32
00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:15.270
fulfill your promise.

33
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.720
Some people have trouble seeing promissory insincerity as even a kind of

34
00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:26.250
misrepresentation.
But to paraphrase a famous English case,

35
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.550
a person's intention is as much a fact as what he or she had for breakfast that

36
00:02:32.581 --> 00:02:37.581
morning and hence intention might be expressly or implicitly misrepresented.

37
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:41.311
Both.

38
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:46.290
The restatement of torts and the restatement of contracts contain provisions on

39
00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:47.340
promissory fraud.

40
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.060
The Tort restatement provides that a representation of the makers own intention

41
00:02:54.301 --> 00:02:59.301
to do or not do a particular thing is fraudulent if he does not have that

42
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:00.304
intention.

43
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.560
Comments see to this provision explains its application to misrepresentation of

44
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:08.740
intent to perform an agreement quote.

45
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.010
Since a promise necessarily carries with it the implied assertion of an

46
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:15.970
intention to perform it,

47
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.720
it follows that a promise made without such an intention is fraudulent and

48
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:22.984
actionable.

49
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.180
The restatement of contracts uses language that initially seems not quite as

50
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:29.014
decisive.

51
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.290
Section one 71 subparagraph two provides that if it is reasonable to do so,

52
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.260
the promise,

53
00:03:37.261 --> 00:03:42.261
he may properly interpret a promise as an assertion that the promise or intends

54
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:47.911
to perform the promise but comment be brings the provision closer to the

55
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:51.970
categorical torch provision.
Clarifying quote,

56
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.180
it is ordinarily reasonable for the prophecy to infer from the making of a

57
00:03:57.221 --> 00:04:02.221
promise that the promise or intends to perform it if therefore the promise is

58
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:05.320
made with the intention of not performing it.

59
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.790
This implied assertion is false and a misrepresentation.

60
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.580
Unsurprisingly,

61
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.610
the primary difficulty in any promissory fraud case is proving the promissory

62
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.710
his intent.
At the time the promise was made.

63
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:26.490
Both the restatement of torts and contracts make clear that the mere fact of

64
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:32.341
nonperformance is not itself sufficient to prove the promise or never intended

65
00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:37.951
to perform his promise to breaching promised or might've s simply changed her

66
00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:42.040
mind.
That is changed her intent after promising

67
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.330
that tort restatement ads as well,

68
00:04:46.331 --> 00:04:51.331
that the promises nonperformance doesn't place on the promise or the burden of

69
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:56.401
showing that he failed to carry out his promise for reasons that didn't arise

70
00:04:56.771 --> 00:05:00.720
until after the parties entered into an agreement.
It's the promise.

71
00:05:00.721 --> 00:05:05.721
See that retains the burden in a promissory fraud claim of actually proving that

72
00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:08.350
the promise or did not intend to perform.

73
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.570
So what kinds of evidence might a party use to show that the promissor

74
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.840
misrepresented his or her intent and never intended to actually perform her

75
00:05:20.951 --> 00:05:21.784
promise?

76
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.750
A pattern of repeated breaching promises over and over again over time can be

77
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:30.581
powerful,

78
00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:34.960
circumstantial evidence that a promise or never intended to carry out his

79
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:39.850
promises.
Think of the musical,
the music man,
uh,

80
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.780
the plot centers on a so-called professor Harold Hill,

81
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.960
who pretends in community after community to be a band I organizer and

82
00:05:49.421 --> 00:05:51.760
repeatedly sells town members,

83
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.060
band instruments and uniforms by promising that he will teach their children to

84
00:05:57.621 --> 00:05:59.960
be musicians and then he skips town.

85
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.590
The fact that hill makes the same promise over and over and never performs

86
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:11.951
compellingly suggests that he never intended to fulfill his promises at the time

87
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:16.370
of promising.
In fact,
under Illinois law,

88
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:21.371
plaintiffs must prove such a pattern called a scheme to defraud in order to

89
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:24.290
prove a promissory fraud claim.

90
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.450
As judge Richard Posner has explained by requiring that the plaintiff show a

91
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:34.451
pattern by this not letting him rest on proving a single false promise,

92
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.740
promise the law reduces the likelihood of a spurious suit.

93
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.460
For a series of unfulfilled promises is better though,

94
00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:48.461
of course not conclusive evidence of fraud then a single unfulfilled promise,

95
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.460
but evidence of such a scheme isn't necessary.

96
00:06:52.461 --> 00:06:57.461
Another jurisdictions and factors beyond a pattern of false promises of,

97
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.500
of a series of breaches,

98
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.070
a can also be probative of promissory fraud.

99
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:09.370
Perhaps the most commonly raised type of evidence is lack of change

100
00:07:09.981 --> 00:07:10.970
circumstance,

101
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.870
a promise or who fails to perform and who is accused of misrepresentation

102
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.280
usually will argue that he or she fully intended to carry out the promise when

103
00:07:22.281 --> 00:07:27.281
making it but then events or circumstances subsequently arose which caused him

104
00:07:27.561 --> 00:07:29.930
or her to change his or her mind.

105
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:33.063
<v 1>Uh,</v>

106
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:38.150
<v 0>it's especially probative that there is a lack of change circumstances when the</v>

107
00:07:38.971 --> 00:07:43.971
time period between the making of a promise and the breaching of it is short

108
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:49.670
because this lack of time suggest that the promise or misrepresented his or her

109
00:07:51.511 --> 00:07:52.344
intention.

110
00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:57.920
If you rent a car promising to return it in a week and immediately after driving

111
00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:01.740
it off the rental lot,
go sell it to someone else,

112
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.820
courts are likely to infer that you never intended to return it.

113
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:12.490
Courts will also consider whether it would have been possible for the promise or

114
00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:15.940
to perform his or her promise at the time the promise was made.

115
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.970
Consider the music man example again,

116
00:08:18.971 --> 00:08:23.200
assume Harold Hill did not know how to play a musical instrument.

117
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.490
He couldn't possibly have taught the children of those to whom he sold

118
00:08:27.491 --> 00:08:30.550
instruments,
how to play those instruments.

119
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.560
This would be good evidence of promissory fraud because of the,
uh,

120
00:08:35.561 --> 00:08:40.561
the promise or knew that at the time of promising that his performance would be

121
00:08:40.781 --> 00:08:42.730
impossible.
Finally,

122
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.710
courts may look at internal documents from the promise or indicating that the

123
00:08:47.711 --> 00:08:52.360
promise or had no intent to perform emails showing the promise or had plans to

124
00:08:52.361 --> 00:08:56.360
be in a different location at the time or performance.
Uh,
uh,

125
00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.750
for instance would fall into this category.
Finally,

126
00:09:00.751 --> 00:09:05.751
it's important for us to recognize how promissory fraud law can be and has been

127
00:09:06.481 --> 00:09:10.860
subject to misuse a labor law.
Uh,

128
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:14.940
in the Jim Crow South provides an egregiously clear example.

129
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:19.700
Uh,
th this law which,
uh,

130
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.360
was on the books in Alabama in the first decade of the 20th century,

131
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:28.820
made it a crime for any employee,
uh,

132
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.550
with an intent to defraud his employer Tanner into an a,

133
00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:38.580
a contract obtained money from the employer for the promised act or services and

134
00:09:39.451 --> 00:09:42.930
then fail to perform the promise.
Further,

135
00:09:42.931 --> 00:09:47.931
the statute made an employee's failure to perform prime aphasia evidence of the

136
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:50.610
employee's intent to defraud.

137
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:56.390
The statute was enforced almost exclusively against African Americans and the

138
00:09:56.701 --> 00:09:59.790
statute was challenged in Bailey versus Alabama.

139
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:05.150
And in a 1911 opinion authored by Justice Charles Evans Hughes,

140
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.330
the Supreme Court found that it violated the 13th amendment,

141
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:11.280
ironically,

142
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:15.510
just as homes dissented arguing that quote,

143
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:20.810
a false representation expressed or implied at the time of making the contract

144
00:10:20.881 --> 00:10:25.881
of Labor that one intends to perform it and thereby obtaining an advance may be

145
00:10:27.091 --> 00:10:31.500
declared a case of fraud,
gently obtaining money as well as any other,

146
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.360
that if made a crime,
it may be punished like any other crime.

147
00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:42.980
Holmes's scholarly theory that a contractual promise is nothing more than a duty

148
00:10:43.081 --> 00:10:48.081
to perform or pay damages might suggest a limited ambit for promissory fraud

149
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.250
because the promissor might argue that her promise merely implied that she

150
00:10:53.251 --> 00:10:55.290
intended to perform or pay damages.

151
00:10:55.890 --> 00:11:00.890
But Justice Holmes had what many believe to be one of his weakest descents,

152
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:06.350
was willing to countenance Alabama's attempt to use promissory fraud to shore up

153
00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:11.160
a system of Jim Crow,
labor restrictions targeting African Americans.

154
00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:16.920
So what have we learned?
We've learned that usually when you make a promise,

155
00:11:16.921 --> 00:11:21.030
you imply have asserted an intention to perform that promise.

156
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:22.650
As a result,

157
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.940
when a party can prove that you never actually intended to carry out what you

158
00:11:26.941 --> 00:11:31.020
promised,
that party may recover punitive damages,

159
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:35.640
not just whatever amount that party's entitled to by virtue of your contractual

160
00:11:35.641 --> 00:11:36.474
breach,

161
00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:41.510
but an amount that punishes you for the misrepresentation and attempts to deter

162
00:11:42.391 --> 00:11:45.450
you from making such misrepresentations in the future.

163
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:50.760
We also talked about what kinds of evidence might serve to prove that you had no

164
00:11:50.761 --> 00:11:55.210
intention of keeping your promise,
a pattern,
or a scheme to defraud,

165
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.500
the lack of change circumstances,
impossibilities of performance,

166
00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:02.920
or ancillary private documents.
Finally,

167
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.190
we discussed Bailey versus Alabama,
uh,

168
00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:11.280
in which a statute improperly presumed promissory fraud from any employees

169
00:12:11.891 --> 00:12:15.850
breach,
at least when the employee was African American.
