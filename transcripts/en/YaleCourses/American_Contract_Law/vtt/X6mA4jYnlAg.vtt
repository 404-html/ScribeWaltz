1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.630
At long last we come to our last substantive lecture,
uh,
on,

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.050
on contract law.
So thanks for making it this far,

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.700
pat yourself.
On the back.

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.330
Today we're going to be discussing delegation assignment and third party

5
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:18.720
beneficiaries.

6
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.650
We've almost exclusively talk so far in this course about contracts formed are

7
00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:28.030
not formed between two parties,
uh,

8
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.890
and performance or breach by those two parties.

9
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.110
Once a contract is formed,

10
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.070
to what extent may one of the parties delegate his or her duty to perform as a

11
00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:45.540
promise or or assign his or her rights as a promise.

12
00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:50.541
See under the contract to a third party without the consent of the other side of

13
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:52.440
the contract.

14
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.220
I find it helpful to remember the double d delegation concerns,

15
00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:02.520
duties,
assignments,
concern,
contractual rights,

16
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:06.690
you delegate duties,
you assigned rights,
uh,
uh,

17
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:10.170
don't ever ask whether you can delegate a right.

18
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.850
You can only delegate duties.

19
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.630
So the restatement second of contracts provides the basic answer of how the law

20
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:24.000
regulates delegation.
And it's section three 18.

21
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.060
It says that unless otherwise agreed,

22
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.300
a promise requires performance by a particular person only to the extent that

23
00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:38.391
the obligation has a substantial interest in having that person perform or

24
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:41.130
control the ax promise,

25
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.740
unless the obligation agrees otherwise.
Neither delegation or performance,

26
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.520
uh,

27
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.520
Nora contract assume the duty made with the Aba Gore by the person delegated

28
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.050
discharges any duty or liability of the delegating obligate [inaudible].

29
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.410
So what does that mean?
Under the restatement by default,

30
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.770
a promise or has the right to get delegate or duties except where the promise

31
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:12.711
see obligate [inaudible] has a substantial interest in having the original

32
00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:18.090
promise or perform.
But unless otherwise the,

33
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.690
but this,
unless otherwise agreed,
proviso is important.

34
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.080
Parties in the initial contract can make any duty nondelegable or they can make

35
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.530
what might have been deemed a nondelegable duty because courts might deem the

36
00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:39.531
promising you to have a substantial interest into a delegable duty by including

37
00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:42.510
a clause saying that the duty is delegable.

38
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.320
So what's at stake here crucially is whether a promise or 10 delegate ex post

39
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.710
without the promises,
permission the promissory and promise.

40
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.650
He can always agree to modify the contract to allow the promise or to delegate a

41
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:03.610
duty to someone else,
even if the promise or has this substantial,

42
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.110
even if the promise see has a substantial interest in performance by the

43
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:10.870
original promise or,
and even if the contract,

44
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:14.140
the original contract included a non delegation provision.

45
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.550
So in what scenarios might someone have this kind of substantial interests such

46
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:26.920
that delegation of a contractual duty would be by default?
Impermissible.

47
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.503
The,

48
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.660
the typical scenarios involve contracts related to personal service or contracts

49
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:36.340
that involve a unique skill or discretion.

50
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.820
These contracts create duties that cannot be delegated unless the parties agree

51
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.640
in advance or,
uh,
uh,
uh,
ex post.

52
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.750
So if you,
for example,

53
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:54.430
in a highly recommended French language tutor agree that the tutor will give you

54
00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:56.050
French lessons twice a week,

55
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.920
the tutor cannot delegate her duties to someone else.

56
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.170
Similarly,

57
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.200
the UCC section two to 10 provides a party may perform it his or her duty

58
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.080
through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a

59
00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:20.950
substantial interest in having the original promise or perform or control of the

60
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:21.910
ax required.

61
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:26.911
By the contract and no delegation of performance relieves the party delegating,

62
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.300
uh,
have any duty to perform or any liability for breach.

63
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.840
Because the UCC only cover sales of goods,

64
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.000
not the provision of personal services.

65
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.560
Exceptions to delegation under the UCC or less obvious,

66
00:04:41.561 --> 00:04:46.561
although parties can of course specify in their contracts that delegation is not

67
00:04:46.631 --> 00:04:47.464
permissible.

68
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.770
Note that both the restatement and the UCC keep the delegator on the hook for

69
00:04:53.441 --> 00:04:54.520
breach of contract.

70
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.570
So even when they promise or has a right to delegate,

71
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.780
if the delegate t fails to perform the privacy can sue the original delegating

72
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.100
promissor on the basis of the original contract for breach

73
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.020
assignment is the analogous situation where after an initial contract is formed,

74
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.110
a promise see wants to assign her rights to the promissory is performance

75
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.390
without seeking the original promissory.
His permission.

76
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.110
Section three 17 of the restatement creates an analogous default rule saying

77
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:35.050
that contractual rights are assignable by default,

78
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:40.290
unless the assignment would materially change the duty of the obligation,

79
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.630
Gore or materially increased the burden or risk imposed on him by his contract

80
00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:51.631
or materially impair his chance of obtaining return performance or materially

81
00:05:51.821 --> 00:05:54.550
reducing its value to him.
Again,

82
00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:59.510
him being the Ob Ob [inaudible].
If you promise to paint my house,

83
00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:04.070
I probably cannot assign my right to your performance to someone who has a much

84
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:09.071
bigger house or a house that is far away that that's I my right of assignment

85
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.360
isn't the right to make your job of performance harder.

86
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.310
At least I can't do it by default unless I secure your permission at the time of

87
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:22.340
the initial contract or after the fact.

88
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:27.341
By modifying the contract delegation and assignment concern,

89
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:32.831
transfers of duties and rights to third parties after a contract is performed.

90
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:39.130
Now we turn to the question of ex ante assignment where the parties to the

91
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:44.621
initial contract agree that the promise or will perform for the benefit of third

92
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:46.250
party,
uh,

93
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:50.480
and give that third party the right to sue for any breach that occur.

94
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.930
This is a kind of ex ante assignment.

95
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.730
This ex ante assignee is called a third party beneficiary.

96
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:04.630
Sometimes this creation of a third party beneficiary is quite explicit and

97
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:06.224
intentional.

98
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.120
Imagine for instance that you signed a contract with an insurance company by

99
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:15.860
which terms the company will pay your daughter a substantial sum if you die.

100
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.730
Your daughter was not a party to the contract,

101
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:23.540
but she is a beneficiary of it,
a third party beneficiary.

102
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.100
In other cases,

103
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:29.870
third parties are beneficiaries of an agreement even when this wasn't the

104
00:07:29.871 --> 00:07:32.360
contracting parties intention.

105
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.900
Suppose that Brian and Carolyn own adjoining plots of land and Brian contracts

106
00:07:39.141 --> 00:07:44.030
with Alpha Company for Alpha to build a luxury building on Brian's land.

107
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.920
If the building is built,

108
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.790
Carolyn might very well benefit because her land values will increase

109
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:52.670
substantially by having a luxury building next door,

110
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.740
but she is not an intended benefit.

111
00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.760
Officiary in what circumstances can a beneficiary who was not a party to a

112
00:08:01.341 --> 00:08:06.230
contract assert claims based upon that contract?
Well,

113
00:08:06.231 --> 00:08:11.231
the restatement of contracts differentiates between intended beneficiaries and

114
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.490
incidental beneficiaries.

115
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:18.920
Section three Oh two provides that unless otherwise agreed between promissory

116
00:08:18.921 --> 00:08:19.820
and promise.
See,

117
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.200
a beneficiary of a of a promise is an intended beneficiary.

118
00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.680
If recognition of a right to performance in the beneficiary is appropriate to

119
00:08:30.771 --> 00:08:35.720
effectuate the intention of the parties and either the performance of the

120
00:08:35.721 --> 00:08:40.490
promise will satisfy an obligation of the primacy to pay money to the

121
00:08:40.491 --> 00:08:41.360
beneficiary,

122
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:46.070
or the circumstances indicate that the promise he intends to give the

123
00:08:46.071 --> 00:08:51.071
beneficiary the benefit of the promised performance and incidental beneficiary

124
00:08:52.011 --> 00:08:55.160
is the beneficiary who's not an intended beneficiary.

125
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:01.280
Section three or four then explains that a promise in a contract creates a duty

126
00:09:02.171 --> 00:09:07.171
in the promise or to any intended beneficiary to perform the promise and the

127
00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:10.620
intended beneficiary may enforce the duty.

128
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.980
So in our life insurance contract example,

129
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.970
the insurance company has a duty to pay your daughter the third party

130
00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:22.710
beneficiary and your daughter as a third party beneficiary can enforce the

131
00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:27.630
contract even though she wasn't an original party to it.
By contrast,

132
00:09:27.631 --> 00:09:28.410
however,

133
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:33.410
section three 15 of the restatement explains that an incidental beneficiary

134
00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:36.570
acquires by virtue of the promise,

135
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.930
no right against the promise or or the promise.

136
00:09:39.931 --> 00:09:43.350
See Carolyn as your neighbor,

137
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:47.880
then we'd have no rights under the contract between uh,

138
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:52.380
uh,
be an Alpha company.
Of course,

139
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:57.620
the distinctions are not always easy to make and indeed typically require

140
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:02.930
examination on a case by case basis if the parties didn't explicitly designate,

141
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.000
uh,
uh,

142
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:11.030
the a daughter as a third party beneficiary when the initial contract does not

143
00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:15.600
explicitly designate a third party beneficiary.

144
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:20.670
Courts typically look at a number of factors in determining whether the

145
00:10:20.671 --> 00:10:25.560
beneficiaries are intended or incidental.
The language of the promise which the,

146
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.010
uh,
third party seeks to enforce is one of the factors,

147
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:34.190
the intention or purpose of the parties or the primacy to be derived from the

148
00:10:35.191 --> 00:10:39.780
evidence.
In addition to the promise,
some vague notion of utility.

149
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:41.250
That is why,

150
00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:45.480
why not enforce the promise if the parties so intended in the promise,

151
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:50.530
he is not bringing suit and some even less explicit notions about the needs of

152
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:57.120
the commercial setting in which the promise was made.
Interestingly,

153
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:02.250
the third party beneficiary need not show reliance upon the promise,

154
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:06.450
uh,
to gain protected status.
The primary source,

155
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.390
then a third party beneficiary rights is agreement of the promise or and

156
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:11.821
promise.

157
00:11:11.821 --> 00:11:16.821
See and enforcement turns on a judgment that the purpose of these parties will

158
00:11:17.371 --> 00:11:19.050
or will not be effectuated.

159
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:24.420
So let's consider how courts have dealt with the question of whether a

160
00:11:24.421 --> 00:11:29.421
beneficiary was in an intended bender in it was an intended beneficiary and some

161
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.350
real cases.

162
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.980
We can see an entertaining example in Warren versus Monaghan beach beaches,

163
00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:43.050
jewelry company.
The plaintiff,
uh,
was,
uh,

164
00:11:43.051 --> 00:11:45.780
Warren's fiance a,

165
00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:49.830
the plaintiff gave her what he thought was a diamond ring,

166
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:55.070
which he had purchased from the defendant's store before purchasing the ring.

167
00:11:55.930 --> 00:12:00.930
The fiance had spoken to the employees of the company about the size,

168
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.850
type and style of ring he wanted for Warren.

169
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:09.090
And the company suggested that Warren might like or dislike about the ring.

170
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.250
It turned out that the ring though contained no diamond,

171
00:12:12.251 --> 00:12:15.650
just glass and cubic Zirconia.
Uh,

172
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:21.090
and so the question was Warren and intended beneficiary of the contract between

173
00:12:21.461 --> 00:12:25.090
the jewelry company in warrants fiance.
Well,

174
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:27.280
a Florida court determine quote,

175
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:32.310
the contract dealings between Anderson and the appellee and the subsequent

176
00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:37.330
dealings between appellant and appellee clearly establish appellant as an

177
00:12:37.331 --> 00:12:41.470
intended third party beneficiary of,
of the contract at issue.

178
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:47.940
Now consider a case with perhaps greater public interest implication Zig Goss

179
00:12:48.551 --> 00:12:49.930
versus superior court.

180
00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:55.410
Their tenets of the San Francisco apartment building that was financed with a

181
00:12:55.661 --> 00:13:00.661
federally insured mortgage pursuant to the National Housing Act and regulations

182
00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.340
promulgated pursuant to that act,

183
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:08.910
the financing agreement between the landlord and the Department of Housing and

184
00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:10.091
Urban Development,

185
00:13:10.091 --> 00:13:15.091
Hud required that the landlord's not charge more than Hud's approved rent

186
00:13:15.251 --> 00:13:16.084
schedule.

187
00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:20.050
But the plaintiffs allege that the landlords were charging in excess of that

188
00:13:20.051 --> 00:13:22.900
schedule where the tenants,
uh,

189
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:27.700
intended beneficiaries of the financing agreement.
And the court said,

190
00:13:27.701 --> 00:13:29.200
yes,
quote,

191
00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:34.260
even the most cursory review of the statutes and regulations which resulted in

192
00:13:34.661 --> 00:13:39.250
the contract and the present case leads to the conclusion that the tenants

193
00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:43.770
constitute the class which congress intended to benefit unquote.

194
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:50.070
This has been just a very quick run through of delegation assignment and third

195
00:13:51.611 --> 00:13:56.140
party beneficiary law.
There's much more we could discuss but to recap,

196
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.020
uh,
here's what we've learned.
Number one,

197
00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:03.520
we've discussed delegation and learned that generally parties may delegate

198
00:14:03.521 --> 00:14:08.521
contractual duties and less a party has a substantial interest in the particular

199
00:14:08.711 --> 00:14:11.020
party performing the contract.

200
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:16.500
We also discuss cases that typically a fall within this substantial interest

201
00:14:17.561 --> 00:14:22.561
exception including contracts for service or those involving a unique skill.

202
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:29.150
We also discussed assignment which is a very analogous regulating whether you

203
00:14:29.531 --> 00:14:33.700
can assign your rights under a contract and by default you can,

204
00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:37.120
unless that assignment isn't going to impose extra duties,

205
00:14:37.121 --> 00:14:42.121
burdens on the promise or we talked about third party beneficiary law and the

206
00:14:43.511 --> 00:14:48.130
difference between intended beneficiaries and incidental beneficiaries.

207
00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.740
The former can enforce contractual terms.

208
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.480
The ladder may not to test our knowledge of this distinction.

209
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.910
We ran through a couple of the cases,

210
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:03.770
and in all three of these contexts,
delegation,
assignment,

211
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.020
and third party beneficiary law,

212
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:10.670
you should be clear on the default nature of these,

213
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:11.480
uh,

214
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:16.480
legal rules that the parties in their initial agreement can explicitly designate

215
00:15:16.731 --> 00:15:20.990
people to be.
Third Party beneficiaries are not to be third party beneficiaries.

216
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:26.380
They can explicitly allow delegation of duties or not allow it.

217
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:31.160
They can explicitly allow assignment or not allow it.

218
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:36.460
And that the crucial area of the law here is establishing default rules in the

219
00:15:37.371 --> 00:15:38.900
absence of such agreements.
