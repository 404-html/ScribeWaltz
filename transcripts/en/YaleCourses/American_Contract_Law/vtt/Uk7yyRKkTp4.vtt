00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.920
The next case continues our discussion of exclusive conditions in this case,

2
00:00:07.381 --> 00:00:10.380
which comes to us from the Kansas Supreme Court.

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.300
We deal with an insurance company that refuses to pay a claim because of the

4
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:16.230
policy holders.

5
00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:20.190
Failure to meet one of the conditions stated in the insurance policy.

6
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.390
The plaintiff in this case is Forrest d Ferguson who ran a drugstore in a small

7
00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:32.211
town in eastern Kansas on the night of March 8th,

8
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.280
1960.
The drugstore was burgled.

9
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.780
The burglar caused some damage to the store and stole some pills,

10
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.960
but the biggest lost with $433 stored in a safe in the drugstore.

11
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.960
The safe had two layers of protection.

12
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:53.640
The outer door had a combination lock while the inner door opened with the key.

13
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.180
The burglar had somehow managed to open the outer door,

14
00:00:57.181 --> 00:00:59.070
leaving no visible damage,

15
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.510
but he or she had punched out the lock on the inner door.

16
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.260
Mr. Ferguson had taken out a storekeepers burglary and robbery policy from

17
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:13.530
Phoenix Assurance Company of New York,

18
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.570
which he expected would cover his losses from the burglary.
Instead it,

19
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.230
uh,

20
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.230
it pointed to the section of the policy on safe burglary and claimed that it

21
00:01:24.421 --> 00:01:29.421
could not cover the losses above $50 unless there was visible damages on all of

22
00:01:31.771 --> 00:01:36.030
the safes doors.
Ferguson then sued for the remainder of the money.

23
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.590
We're reading the Kansas Supreme Court's opinion in this case,

24
00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:45.540
which deals with the question of whether a court can compel an insurance company

25
00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:50.541
to reimburse a policy holder if that policy holders loss is excluded by

26
00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:51.930
contractual language,

27
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.310
but that exclusion appears to contravene the contracts purpose.

28
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.930
The trial court in this case had found this question obvious.

29
00:02:00.931 --> 00:02:05.340
A burglary had clearly occurred and money was taken from the safe.

30
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.200
Compensating for this kind of loss was exactly the purpose for which Mr.

31
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.100
Ferguson had bought the insurance in the first place and so it wouldn't allow

32
00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:18.900
the insurance company to get out of pain by using quote an escape clause.

33
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.060
The Kansas Supreme Court takes a somewhat more circuitous route to affirming the

34
00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:25.230
trial court's ruling.

35
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.860
It starts by noting the general rule that ambiguities and insurance contracts

36
00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:34.890
are interpreted against the insurance company that issued them.

37
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.810
This is the great contra proffer.
Endom uh,
standard,
uh,

38
00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:41.460
for insurance interpretation,

39
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.060
Justice Schroeder writing for the majority concedes that even so they cannot

40
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.550
quote give an unnatural meaning to the language unquote of the contract.

41
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.700
This is a fancy way of saying if it's not ambiguous,

42
00:02:56.701 --> 00:02:59.920
you can't hold the ambiguity's against the drafter.

43
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.160
This is where justice prices descent branches off.

44
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.320
He finds that the clause in question is plain,
clear and unambiguous.

45
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.050
Let's take a look at the clause in question.

46
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.740
The contracts definition of safe burglary.

47
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.690
As we can see in order to count as safe burglary,

48
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.550
the money must have been stored in a safe with a combination lock and the safe

49
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.570
must have been completely closed and locked at the time of the burglary.

50
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.970
The burglar must have used force and violence to get into the safe and there

51
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:38.971
must be visible marks of that force and violence on the exterior of all the

52
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:39.941
safes.

53
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:44.941
Doors just as Schroeder makes the distinction between substantive and

54
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:49.000
evidentiary conditions.
In his analysis of this clause.

55
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.270
He finds that the requirement that the safe be opened with force and violence is

56
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:59.620
a substantive condition meant to exclude the possibility of an inside job done

57
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.630
simply to collect insurance money.

58
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.110
This requirement's specifies the types of risks that are meant to be insured and

59
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:11.560
is therefore essential to the insurance company's ability to price it's

60
00:04:11.561 --> 00:04:14.230
insurance policies.
On the other hand,

61
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.500
the requirement that there be visible marks is quote intended to determine the

62
00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:23.740
character of the evidence necessary to show liability unquote,

63
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.330
not to specify the sorts of situations the insurance policy is meant to cover

64
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:29.210
just just,

65
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.210
just as Schroeder holds that where a rule of evidence is imposed by a provision

66
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:36.550
in an insurance policy is here.

67
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.110
The assertion of such rule by the insurance carrier beyond the reasonable

68
00:04:41.111 --> 00:04:46.111
requirements necessary to prevent fraudulent claims against it in proof of the

69
00:04:46.121 --> 00:04:51.121
substantive conditions imposed by the policy contravenes the public policy of

70
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:55.390
this state,
the trial court found that the drug store is safe,

71
00:04:55.391 --> 00:05:00.160
was truly broken into by burglars.
That is,
it wasn't an inside job.

72
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.690
Exactly the sort of thing the clause was meant to protect against to just as

73
00:05:04.691 --> 00:05:09.520
Schroeder,
it goes against public policy to allow the insurance company to use an

74
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.510
evidentiary condition to say that this is not the case,

75
00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:18.040
especially when a court of law has found that it is in fact true.

76
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.180
There are a couple of things worth noting about this decision.

77
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.640
The first is that the court is not finding the condition to be unconscionable or

78
00:05:27.641 --> 00:05:31.420
construing the contract in favor of the insured.
Instead,

79
00:05:31.421 --> 00:05:36.421
it's finding it to be against public policy for insurance companies to use super

80
00:05:36.641 --> 00:05:41.230
restrictive evidentiary rules to avoid acknowledging what has been shown to be

81
00:05:41.231 --> 00:05:42.064
the truth.

82
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.290
Other states often have statutory rules against insurance companies use of

83
00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:52.291
conditions requiring that the condition actually have quote increased the risk

84
00:05:52.571 --> 00:05:56.290
of loss or contributed to the loss under such rules.

85
00:05:56.291 --> 00:06:00.800
That condition in this case would probably not justify denying an insurance

86
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:01.634
payment.

87
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.770
It's possible though that had the Phoenix assurance company written the contract

88
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:08.390
differently.
For example,

89
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:12.320
by clearly labeling this requirement as an exclusion,

90
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:13.670
it might've prevailed.

91
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.620
This would not have been a ridiculous requirement to impose this kind of

92
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:23.621
exclusion provision would have incentivized policy holders like Mr. Ferguson to

93
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.680
close and lock the door and spin the combination rather than leaving the door,

94
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:35.110
the outer door of the safe unlocked as many people do or choosing not to spin

95
00:06:35.901 --> 00:06:38.120
the combination students,

96
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.480
a former high school students might remember from your high school days that if

97
00:06:44.901 --> 00:06:48.290
you don't spin the combination,
uh,
on your locker,

98
00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:51.890
you can sometimes open the locker,
but just moving the uh,

99
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.990
the spinner to the third number instead of having to dial in all three numbers.

100
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.590
Burt Reynolds explained this in his role as a safecracker in the movie breaking

101
00:07:04.101 --> 00:07:04.700
in,

102
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.700
he was able to break into safes more easily because people often fail to spin

103
00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:14.270
the dial after the last time they unlocked the safe.

104
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:20.110
One way to criticize the opinion then is that the court might have been mistaken

105
00:07:20.151 --> 00:07:25.010
in thinking that the only purpose of the visible marks language was as evidence

106
00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:26.390
of inside jobs.

107
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:31.690
It might have had an additional purpose to exclude coverage if the insured was

108
00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:36.290
negligent in closing,
locking and spinning.
The combination.

109
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:42.690
Well,
let's take a look at a quiz.
Hey,

110
00:07:42.691 --> 00:07:45.920
car insurance contract excludes recovery.

111
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:51.130
If the driver was under the influence of alcohol or any intoxicants that impairs

112
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:57.010
the driver's ability to drive unquote a driver is drowsy because he took an

113
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.760
antihistamine and hit a tree.
Can he recover?

114
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:08.910
The court would likely find that this contract is ambiguous and raw and resolve

115
00:08:09.131 --> 00:08:10.840
the meaning against the company.

116
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:15.460
While anti-histamines do impair a person's ability to function normally and

117
00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:16.810
particularly to drive,

118
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.430
they do not generally fall into the category of drugs we call and toxicants.

119
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:26.170
Since exceptions to insurance contracts or read narrowly so as to favor the

120
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.890
policyholder,
this driver would be likely to recover.

121
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:36.070
We have seen the courts tend to construe insurance contracts against insurance

122
00:08:36.071 --> 00:08:41.071
companies and that many states even have statutory rules that disfavor insurance

123
00:08:41.261 --> 00:08:45.730
company's use of conditions to limit their liability.
In this case,

124
00:08:45.731 --> 00:08:50.350
the Kansas Supreme Court found that it contravene public policy to allow an

125
00:08:50.351 --> 00:08:55.351
insurance company to avoid liability by means of an evidentiary policy provision

126
00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:01.180
that went well beyond what was necessary to prove the substantive requirements

127
00:09:01.181 --> 00:09:02.110
for liability.
