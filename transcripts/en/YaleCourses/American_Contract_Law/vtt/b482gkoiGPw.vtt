00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.810
Today we examine a case that deals with contracts in the modern world of

2
00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:08.310
technology and Internet contract.

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.480
Many of you use web based services such as Google,
Facebook,

4
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:15.570
or apps on your phone,
uh,
uh,

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.000
like Uber or seamless.

6
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.040
Do you remember the last time you read through the terms and conditions of any

7
00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:25.080
of those service contracts?

8
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.090
Have you wondered why some surfaces require you to separately click a button to

9
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:33.510
accept the terms and conditions whereas others do not.

10
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.010
These issues are raised in sprec versus Netscape.

11
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.790
A 2002 case that was heard by the second circuit.

12
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.560
The decision was authored by judge,
uh,
Sotomayor,

13
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.680
who as you know,
is now a supreme court justice.

14
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.890
Before we turn to the case,

15
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.330
let's take a moment to learn a few key concepts.

16
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.810
Click wrap refers to an electronic agreement in which are user indicates

17
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:07.360
agreement to terms by clicking on our radio button,

18
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.850
checking a box or the like.

19
00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:14.080
Usually as a condition of using a device or a piece of software.

20
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.580
Browse wrap refers to terms of use,

21
00:01:18.581 --> 00:01:23.581
often found via link or a website's main page that purport to bind to user

22
00:01:24.231 --> 00:01:28.330
solely by virtue of his or her continued use of the site.

23
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.630
These terms come from uh,

24
00:01:31.631 --> 00:01:36.631
the use of quote shrink wrap contracts which were frequently litigated in the

25
00:01:37.511 --> 00:01:38.590
1990s.

26
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.060
Shrink wrap contracts were commonly used in boxed software packages which

27
00:01:44.441 --> 00:01:49.441
contained a notice that by on the outside of the box that by tearing open the

28
00:01:50.051 --> 00:01:55.051
shrink wrap the user was assenting to the software terms and closed with it.

29
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.970
In this Brecht case,

30
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.090
the plaintiff Apelle Lee's downloaded defendant netscapes smart download

31
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:05.714
program.

32
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.670
This was a program which facilitated transmission of files online.

33
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.330
Underneath the download button in a nonobvious position was a link to the terms

34
00:02:16.611 --> 00:02:21.080
associated with the download and use of the smart download.

35
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.150
A software and arbitration clause was included among those terms.

36
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.430
The smart download program allowed Netscape to record any subsequent downloads

37
00:02:31.431 --> 00:02:33.740
obtained by smart download users.

38
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.880
Plaintiff's claim that this feature violated federal privacy laws.

39
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.710
Netscape moved to compel arbitration in accordance with the terms associated

40
00:02:42.711 --> 00:02:45.780
with the smart download,
uh,
uh,

41
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.620
terms and conditions as well as Netscape,

42
00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:50.810
communicator and associated program.

43
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.770
The plaintiff argued that arbitration would not be appropriate because they

44
00:02:56.901 --> 00:02:59.060
hadn't agreed to it.
In other words,

45
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.820
argued that the arbitration clause hidden underneath the download button was not

46
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:04.654
enforceable.

47
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.130
The District Court denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration.

48
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.100
The instinct court affirmed the district court's ruling.

49
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.870
The main issue in the case as you can already tell is whether the plaintiffs are

50
00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:19.720
bound by the terms of a download program,

51
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.040
if they could have reasonably downloaded the program without becoming aware of

52
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:27.130
the existence of the terms.
In other words,

53
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:32.050
the main issue is whether the kind of browse wrap agreements at east,
uh,
uh,

54
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.880
in this case are enforceable.

55
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.270
The second circuit's sided with the plaintiffs.

56
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.540
They ruled that an offeree must receive clear notice of a contracts associated

57
00:03:43.031 --> 00:03:48.031
terms if a download is to constitute acceptance of those terms.

58
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.440
A contract requires mutual assent because plaintiffs did not assent to the

59
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:57.760
contractual terms and could not be expected to be aware of the terms existence.

60
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.610
They are not bound by the arbitration clause.

61
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.170
So what law did the court apply to this transaction where the subject matter is

62
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:09.580
a license of intangible software?

63
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.010
The court's answer here,
it's the common law when pressed.

64
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.010
Some courts might apply the UCC by analogy to supplement the common law.

65
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.580
However,
remember the,

66
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.750
that the UCC article two only applies to the sale of goods.

67
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.950
Something else that might apply is the uniform computer information transactions

68
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:37.360
act you see to the model act was designed to govern computer information

69
00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:41.950
transactions.
Section one oh three,
a of that act,
uh,

70
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.851
uh,

71
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:47.851
has defined computer information and information in electronic form which is

72
00:04:47.981 --> 00:04:52.981
obtained from or through the use of a computer or which is in a form capable of

73
00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:55.360
being processed by a computer.

74
00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.780
Section one 12 a would have dealt with click wrap and browse wrap stating that a

75
00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:06.391
person manifests dissent if she intentionally authenticates the term or engages

76
00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:11.080
in behavior that is likely to be perceived as manifesting descent.

77
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.450
But only two states,
Virginia and Maryland have enacted.
You see them.

78
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.740
And the project has been abandoned by the national conference of Commissioners

79
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.820
after several states enacted legislation prohibiting,

80
00:05:24.821 --> 00:05:28.150
you see there from regulating transaction within their borders.

81
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.910
The American Law Institute adopted principles of the law of software contracts

82
00:05:33.911 --> 00:05:38.911
in 2009 but it remains to be seen how influential these principles will have a

83
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.620
how much impact they'll have on judicial opinions.
However,

84
00:05:44.621 --> 00:05:48.070
this doesn't mean that browse wrap agreements are never okay.

85
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.140
The court held that browse wrap agreements may be enforced if the browsing user

86
00:05:53.141 --> 00:05:53.974
a sense to it.

87
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.640
This is going to be done on a case by case basis and there are no bright line

88
00:05:58.641 --> 00:05:59.474
rules,

89
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.010
but the key is that a given agreement must be sufficiently conspicuous.

90
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.590
What are some ways to make a browse wrap agreement highly visible?
Well,

91
00:06:09.591 --> 00:06:14.591
some suggests that the icon for the terms of the user agreement can be placed in

92
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:19.661
the upper left hand quadrant of the homepage because Internet pages open from

93
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:22.010
the upper left hand quadrant.

94
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:26.180
This guarantees that the user will be able to see the icon.

95
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.420
Think back to the last time you used Google,

96
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.590
not g-mail or Google chat or some other Google service,

97
00:06:33.591 --> 00:06:35.270
but Google the search engine.

98
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.190
Did you remember accepting the terms and conditions for Google search?

99
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:45.530
Google search terms and conditions are on the bottom right hand corner of its

100
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.450
page and as you can guess,

101
00:06:47.451 --> 00:06:51.710
it's usually a browse wrap because you don't have to click on any button to

102
00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:52.544
accept it.

103
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.810
Usage of the service means you're agreeing to the conditions.

104
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.920
Let's turn back to the click wrap agreements for a second.

105
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.590
There is a little question that click rack agreements there.

106
00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:08.570
There's little question that clicker agreements are presumptively enforceable.

107
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.680
Courts have held that a click is usually enough to satisfy agreement to an

108
00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:14.210
electronic transaction,

109
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.960
but both cognitive theory and empirical studies demonstrate that this might not

110
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:21.710
be such a good thing.

111
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:26.330
Professor Robert Hilleman and Jeffrey were Klonsky argue that while an

112
00:07:26.331 --> 00:07:31.010
individual's opportunity to protect herself against one sided standard form

113
00:07:31.011 --> 00:07:35.990
contracts is are arguably greater when contracting by computer.

114
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.270
Then when contracting through written forms,

115
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.980
the cognitive perspective that consumers tend to adopt with respect to

116
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:48.310
contractual risks makes it unlikely that many will take advantage of these new

117
00:07:48.411 --> 00:07:51.050
electronic tools.
In short,

118
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:56.290
almost no one reads the terms of the click wrap license before assenting to the

119
00:07:56.811 --> 00:07:57.644
program.

120
00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:02.480
In a study of 47,000 households over a one month period,

121
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:06.770
the readership of end user license agreements is,

122
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:11.930
was found to be on the order of 0.12 w uh,
1%.

123
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:17.320
Maybe this explains how the British software retail our game station was able to

124
00:08:17.631 --> 00:08:22.631
successfully add an immortal soul clause to its end user license agreement,

125
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:28.780
which stated that the user would give up his or her immortal soul at the

126
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:34.490
seller's request.
Making matters worse,

127
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:39.610
consumers sometimes demonstrate something that might be called term optimism.

128
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:45.460
The consumer sometimes believes that the contractual terms are more favorable to

129
00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:50.630
them than they actually are.
For instance,
in a survey of consumers,

130
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.180
uh,
concerning insurance,

131
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:58.390
the consumers believed they had more coverage from different types of harm than

132
00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:00.600
the insurance actually offered.

133
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.730
So the consumer attributes more utility to the insurance contract and the

134
00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:08.760
contract actually generates for her.

135
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:14.510
Some websites require users to actually click through and even scroll through to

136
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:19.881
the bottom of the terms before they're able to agree to accept the offer.

137
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.050
A few websites even required the term box to be open for a certain amount of

138
00:09:25.051 --> 00:09:28.600
time before the offer becomes acceptable,
uh,

139
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:33.120
to assure that the consumer had enough time to actually read the terms.

140
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:36.520
But the vast majority of websites,
uh,

141
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:40.760
make it so that the consumer offer re,
uh,
uh,

142
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:45.420
doesn't have to read.
Uh,
and it's,
and it's possible of course,

143
00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:50.220
if the consumer offerings don't want the hassle of these extra clicks are these

144
00:09:50.221 --> 00:09:52.650
extra precautionary devices.

145
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:57.210
They prefer a bug may not approach to contract formation,

146
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:02.400
even if it leads to the problem of term optimism.
Now,

147
00:10:02.401 --> 00:10:06.890
section two,
11 of the restatement of contracts,
um,

148
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.320
which is sometimes referred to as the know thy customer provision might provide

149
00:10:12.571 --> 00:10:16.840
a little bit of consumer protection against this,
uh,

150
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.610
term optimism section two 11 states.

151
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.330
If the other party has reason to believe that the other party manifesting such a

152
00:10:24.331 --> 00:10:29.040
scent would not do so.
If he knew that the writing contained this term,

153
00:10:29.041 --> 00:10:31.530
then that term is not a binding part of the agreement.

154
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.570
A comment to the section notes that customers do not in fact ordinarily

155
00:10:36.571 --> 00:10:39.300
understand or even read the standard terms.

156
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:43.020
They trust the good faith of the party using the form.

157
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.370
Although customers tick typically,
uh,
adhere to standardize agreements,

158
00:10:47.371 --> 00:10:51.810
it doesn't make sense to bind them to unknown terms which are beyond the range

159
00:10:51.811 --> 00:10:54.510
of reasonable expectations.
For instance,

160
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.890
this comment says a debtor who delivers a check to his creditor with the amount

161
00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:03.150
of blank does not authorize an infinite figure.
Uh,

162
00:11:03.151 --> 00:11:07.620
we're not giving the sellers blank checks when we click through on these

163
00:11:07.621 --> 00:11:08.454
contracts.

164
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.120
Professor Alan Schwartz and I have proposed another solution in an article which

165
00:11:15.151 --> 00:11:17.040
we published in the Stanford Law Review.

166
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:22.290
We suggested that sellers should be required to disclose a standardized warning

167
00:11:22.291 --> 00:11:27.060
box containing unexpected unfavorable terms.

168
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:31.500
And this is actually an example of such a box as applied to Facebook,

169
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:37.100
but we also suggested that representative consumers should be empowered to waive

170
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.860
the provision of some of these terms.

171
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:46.370
If it turns out that a majority of consumers would prefer not to be warned,

172
00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:52.020
then the seller would be able to forego a providing this warning box of

173
00:11:52.021 --> 00:11:52.854
unexpected.

174
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:58.950
We suggested that this would together create a kind of form democratization

175
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:04.620
where customers would have the power to both be warned about unexpected terms

176
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.260
and the power to waive those terms.

177
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.850
If representative consumers would prefer not to be bugged by them.

178
00:12:12.851 --> 00:12:16.510
If the representative consumers find these to be unhelpful,

179
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:21.070
then they wouldn't have to see them.
In our paper,

180
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:26.100
we actually tested 25 core questions about Facebook terms concerning privacy,

181
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.010
a statement of rights and responsibility.

182
00:12:30.011 --> 00:12:34.930
And we were trying to see which terms are the terms that people would expect in

183
00:12:34.931 --> 00:12:38.170
which terms are unexpected and unfavorable.

184
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:43.710
We found five unexpected unfavorable terms and this slide shows you the two that

185
00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:48.190
were most unexpected and unfavorable.

186
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.770
And we'll provide the kind of examples that we were trying to,
uh,

187
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.950
disclose to consumers.
So,
uh,

188
00:12:56.951 --> 00:13:01.570
today we have examined click wrap and browse wrap contracts.

189
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.970
We learned that while click wrap,
uh,

190
00:13:03.971 --> 00:13:06.970
agreements are usually enforceable.

191
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:12.090
Browse wrap agreements are not enforceable unless they are sufficiently visible.

192
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:13.631
However,

193
00:13:13.631 --> 00:13:18.631
consumers rarely read a click wrap terms or the terms in a browser rack a

194
00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:21.251
agreement.

195
00:13:21.251 --> 00:13:26.251
Either a better option might be to ensure that sellers disclose terms that are

196
00:13:27.581 --> 00:13:29.890
unexpected and unfavorable.
