00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.340
Today we examine the requirement of good faith by examining the case of market

2
00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:07.500
street associates versus fry.

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.520
The implied covenant of Good Faith and fair dealing is a mandatory rule that

4
00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:16.440
parties will deal with each other in good faith.

5
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.310
It's an implied obligation in every contract,

6
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.730
meaning it does not need to be explicitly written or stated and it can't be

7
00:00:26.191 --> 00:00:27.060
disclaimed.

8
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.720
The covenant is incorporated into the uniform commercial code section one dash

9
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:38.541
three Oh four and section two dash one oh three defines good faith in the case

10
00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:43.701
of merchants as honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial

11
00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:46.380
standards of fair dealing in the trade.

12
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.310
The restatement Second Section Two oh five also states that every contract

13
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:57.321
imposes upon each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance

14
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.310
and its enforcement.

15
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.720
The case of market street associates versus fry was decided by the seventh

16
00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:09.480
circuit in 1991 the opinions author,

17
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:13.920
Judge Richard Posner is a leading figure in the field of law and economics.

18
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.660
The Journal of Legal Studies identified him as the most cited legal scholar of

19
00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:19.800
the 20th century.

20
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.090
He is the closest thing we have today to Oliver Wendell Holmes,

21
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.380
a Promethian scholar turn judge with seemingly unbounded capacities.

22
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.230
The opinion while very long gives a detailed explanation of judge Posner's take

23
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.940
on the duty of good faith in contracts,

24
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.230
JC penny and General Electric Pension Trust entered into a sale and leaseback

25
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.170
agreement to understand the case.

26
00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:54.171
It's useful to understand that sale and leaseback transactions are incredibly

27
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.810
similar to a mortgage loan but are characterized as sale and lease back for

28
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.370
various tax purposes with alone.
Of course,

29
00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:10.371
the lender initially lends money to a borrower and the borrower then pays back

30
00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:13.620
the loan with smaller periodic payments

31
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.970
with a sale and leaseback transactions.

32
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.880
The cashflows are identical.

33
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.610
The effective lender in this case,

34
00:02:23.611 --> 00:02:28.611
General Electric Pension Trust initially sends the cuase I borrower JC Penney,

35
00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:35.061
a bunch of money when GE buys the property and then Jacques Pinay effectively

36
00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:41.691
pays back the loan when it sends a it's periodic rent money back to the lender

37
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.560
at the end of the lease back period.

38
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.560
That cuase I bar often can repurchase the property by paying what is similar to

39
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.300
what would be a balloon payment.

40
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.540
If the transaction where a traditional mortgage loan.

41
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.860
Of course if this had been a traditional business loan,

42
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.790
JC penny would have been able to make improvements and uh,

43
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:11.791
and it's property and parties to sale and leaseback transactions often include

44
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:17.671
provisions to give the renter this affective borrower various rights to allow

45
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:23.050
the same kinds of improvement in the property without distorting the parties.

46
00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:26.230
Incentives regarding the buyback option.

47
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.120
In this case,

48
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.590
the contract included a provision requiring the trust to give reasonable

49
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:36.220
consideration and to negotiate in good faith.

50
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:41.221
Should JC penny make request to borrow more money for improvements to the leased

51
00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:42.244
property,

52
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.810
the contract further stated that should negotiations fail this,

53
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:51.811
the negotiations to acquire this new funding a JC Penney would be entitled to

54
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:57.151
immediately buy back the property from the trust with the purchase price

55
00:03:57.341 --> 00:04:01.240
stipulated by a formula specified in the contract.

56
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.710
These important provisions are in paragraph 34 of the lease.

57
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.510
Even though the contractual formula was an attempt to capture what the value of

58
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:12.280
the property would be in the future,

59
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.200
the formula in this case failed to accurately reflect what the market price

60
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:20.380
turned out to be.
So at the time of this dispute,

61
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.570
the formula price was far below the actual market price of the property.

62
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.620
JC Penny later assigned its interest in the lease a two market street which was

63
00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:37.600
the plaintiff and that now the appellant market street requested financing from

64
00:04:37.601 --> 00:04:42.601
the trust without informing the trust about the contractual terms granting

65
00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:47.941
market street and option to buy the property immediately at the formulaic price

66
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:52.930
should the financing negotiations fail.
The trust,
uh,

67
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.850
was apparently unaware of the purchase option term in the contract.

68
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.070
The negotiations failed and market street attempted to exercise the purchase

69
00:05:03.071 --> 00:05:08.071
option at the formulaic price stipulated in the contract which has mentioned

70
00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:13.441
above was well below the market value after the trust refused to sell the

71
00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:17.830
property at that price market street sued for specific performance.

72
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.180
The district court granted summary Judgment to the trust ruling that market

73
00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:29.221
street's behavior violated a good faith contractual requirement in the instant

74
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:30.484
decision.

75
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.580
Judge Posner writing for the appellate panel reversed and remanded holding that

76
00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:41.260
the facts could be construed to find that market straight behaved in good faith.

77
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.450
Just to make sure we understand the facts of the case.

78
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.870
What does paragraph 34 of the lease and title the lessee to do?

79
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.870
Which term did market street fail to disclose about?

80
00:05:58.471 --> 00:06:00.590
Two important things.
First,

81
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.130
it allows market street to request that the pension trust finance,

82
00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:08.450
the cost and expense of improving on the property.

83
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.960
The pension fund is under a contractual obligation to consider and negotiate in

84
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:18.740
good faith after it receives this request.
Second,

85
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:20.480
if these negotiation fails,

86
00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:25.070
the contract gives market street the option to immediately repurchase the

87
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:29.630
property at a price derived from a formula specified in the contract.

88
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.790
Market Street's alleged failure was one of nondisclosure.

89
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:40.030
They did not inform the trust about the purchase option term in paragraph 34

90
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.350
which gave market street this right or option to repurchase the property.

91
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:50.180
Should negotiations fail like judge suitor in Central Phoenix?

92
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.890
Judge Posner emphasizes that good faith can mean different things at different

93
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:58.340
stages of contracting.
At the formation stage,

94
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.550
the duty is minimized whereas at the performance and post contractual

95
00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:08.921
enforcement stage and good faith is heightened because of change circumstances

96
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.370
and the parties were reliance.
Judge Posner says,
quote,

97
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.500
before the contract is signed,

98
00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:19.310
the parties confront each other with a natural wariness.

99
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.720
Neither expects the other to be particularly forthcoming and therefore there's

100
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:28.280
no deception when one is not afterward,
the situation is different.

101
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.160
The parties are now in a cooperative relationship.

102
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.360
The cost of which will be considerably reduced by a measure of trust.

103
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:40.690
So each lowers his guard a bit and now silence is more apt to be deceptive.

104
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.160
Posner sees that,
uh,

105
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.800
the good faith duty is equivalent to the law finding and implied or our default

106
00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:56.771
condition to a contract and suggests that the goal of courts in setting these

107
00:07:56.871 --> 00:08:01.871
implied conditions should be quote to give the parties what they would have

108
00:08:02.121 --> 00:08:07.010
stipulated for expressly if at the time of making the contract they had had

109
00:08:07.011 --> 00:08:11.000
complete knowledge of the future and the cost of negotiating and adding

110
00:08:11.001 --> 00:08:13.250
provisions to the contract had been zero.

111
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.870
He says that the concept of the duty of good faith,

112
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:23.020
like the concept of fiduciary duty is a stab at approximating the terms the

113
00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:28.571
parties would have negotiated had they foreseen the circumstances that have

114
00:08:29.421 --> 00:08:31.040
given rise to their dispute.

115
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.410
These petitions are classic statements of what contract theorists call

116
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.570
hypothetical default setting,

117
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.100
setting the legal default at what the parties would have wanted.

118
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.300
So what would the parties have wanted?

119
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:52.720
Posner suggest that the duty of good faith in this context is quote halfway

120
00:08:54.681 --> 00:08:56.520
between a fiduciary duty,

121
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
the duty of utmost good faith and the duty merely to refrain from active fraud.

122
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.030
Despite its moralistic overtones.

123
00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:11.031
It's no more the injection of moral principles into contract law than the

124
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:13.770
fiduciary concept itself is unquote.

125
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:18.990
The major issue is whether market street's duty of good faith to the trust

126
00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:22.650
included a duty to disclose the repurchase consequence.

127
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.200
The courts ruled yes,

128
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:30.740
judge Posner reason that both market street and the trust might want to minimize

129
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:33.900
the cost of performing the contract.

130
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:38.560
The point of the doctrine of good faith is to reduce defensive expenditures.

131
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:43.570
So at least in part it seems to fit in this case in good faith should apply.

132
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:49.260
Now you might wonder what these defensive expenditures are.
Basically,

133
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:54.530
these are costs that a person occur is to minimize damage to himself,
uh,

134
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.970
including the damage from making a mistake.

135
00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:01.740
Judge Posner uses the examples of theft because of the thread of theft.

136
00:10:01.741 --> 00:10:06.741
People often take out insurance and install security systems or get menacing

137
00:10:07.051 --> 00:10:11.820
dogs.
All of these are defensive expenditures.
In the case of a contract,

138
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.820
if parties did not have to negotiate in good faith,

139
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:19.440
there would be a lot of investment in defensive expenditures to protect each

140
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:24.030
that each party would make to protect themselves against making an um,

141
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.230
uh,
a poorly thought out,
a agreement.

142
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.680
Defensive expenditures are bad because they are a waste of society's resources.

143
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:38.490
Removing the good faith requirement would induce more defensive expenditures

144
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:43.440
because people would need to investigate whether the other party is being honest

145
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.960
rather than taking their word for it.

146
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.890
It would require more defensive expenditures cause you'd have to make sure you

147
00:10:49.891 --> 00:10:52.590
weren't a for getting a contractual term.

148
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.980
It would be better if people just negotiated honestly and openly and the use the

149
00:10:59.311 --> 00:11:03.600
resources they would have spent on defensive expenditures.
Uh,

150
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.510
somewhere else.
In this case,

151
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:11.600
Posner characterized as the failure to disclose as sharp dealing a sharp sharp

152
00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:17.700
dealing is when a party takes advantage of a clear oversight by the opposite

153
00:11:17.701 --> 00:11:18.534
party.

154
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:23.600
There's no social benefit to inducing sharp dealings such as this one having

155
00:11:24.361 --> 00:11:27.180
concluded that the failure to disclose the sharp dealing,

156
00:11:27.181 --> 00:11:30.300
which itself might be a tort,
the balance of the opinion.

157
00:11:30.301 --> 00:11:35.301
Next explicates the theory of post contractual cooperation in the performance of

158
00:11:36.211 --> 00:11:41.211
the contract within which good faith operates to prevent opportunistic behavior,

159
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.970
deliberate advantage taking without justification.

160
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:50.430
The bottom line is that the less or on these facts should have disclosed the

161
00:11:50.431 --> 00:11:55.030
contract clause much like a vendor should have a termite infestation.

162
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.660
However,
there's a limit to the good faith requirement.

163
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:03.070
Judge Posner does not think that every contract makes a party his brother's

164
00:12:03.071 --> 00:12:03.904
keeper.

165
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:08.910
Otherwise Mirror difficulty of performance would excuse a contracting party

166
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:13.210
because the other failed to relax the terms of the contract.

167
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.580
There's another issue in this case.

168
00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:21.720
Do you remember what the opinion said about whether the facts justify a summary

169
00:12:21.721 --> 00:12:25.920
judgement ruling against market street for violating the duty of good faith?

170
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:32.230
The court held that no market street should not lose the summary Judgment motion

171
00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.890
interpreting the facts most favorably to market street.

172
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.360
Because this is a motion for summary Judgment and market street is the non

173
00:12:39.361 --> 00:12:40.360
moving party.

174
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:44.560
It would be possible to conclude that market street did not violate it's good

175
00:12:44.561 --> 00:12:48.760
faith obligations,
so the case must be remanded.
So a,

176
00:12:48.761 --> 00:12:53.300
that a jury can decide whether market street violated his duty,
uh,

177
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:57.520
by failing to disclose a for sharp dealing reasons.

178
00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.050
In summary,

179
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:04.530
the decision in market street associates versus fry gave us a perspective on the

180
00:13:05.231 --> 00:13:07.240
duty of good faith and contracting.

181
00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:12.640
Good faith is an implied duty not to intentionally take advantage of the other

182
00:13:12.641 --> 00:13:16.210
party's ignorance of the terms.
Somewhat surprisingly,

183
00:13:16.211 --> 00:13:21.160
judge Posner fines that the law may require that a contract or a mind,

184
00:13:21.161 --> 00:13:26.161
a sophisticated party of the terms of a contract that a sophisticated party has

185
00:13:26.501 --> 00:13:28.210
already agreed to.

186
00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:33.880
Posner explain that good faith requirements and the performance of a contract

187
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:38.970
help prevent opportunistic behavior and thus economize on inefficient defensive

188
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:40.750
expenditures.
