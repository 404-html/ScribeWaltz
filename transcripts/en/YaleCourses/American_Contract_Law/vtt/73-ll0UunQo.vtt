00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.990
Today we discuss unconscionability through the classic case of Williams versus

2
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:08.370
Walker Thomas Furniture.

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.880
This case was decided in 1965 by a well known judge,
uh,

4
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.120
Jay Skelly,
right of the circuit court of the District of Columbia.

5
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.250
It also raises important questions about the respective roles of courts and

6
00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:27.690
legislatures.
The facts orally.
Williams,

7
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.930
the defendant and appellant in this case purchased several items on installment

8
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.400
from the Walker Thomas Furniture Company.

9
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.030
The last of these items was a stereo set valued at over $500.

10
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.840
Ms. Williams,

11
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:47.841
a woman have limited education and means owed $164 from her prior purchases at

12
00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:51.060
the time she bought the stereo.

13
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.380
The contracts for these goods contained in fine print,

14
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.950
a cross collateral clause.
In effect,

15
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.310
this clause gave the furniture company the right to repossess all of Mrs.

16
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.630
Williams prior purchases if she defaulted on the payments for one of her last

17
00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:10.464
purchases,

18
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.060
even if you'd paid enough to previously pay off some of her dead on these

19
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.320
earlier purchases.

20
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.660
Ms. Williams did indeed default on a stereo payment and Walker Thomas Furniture

21
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.810
attempted to repossess all of her prior purchases.

22
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.510
So the procedural history was this,

23
00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:31.320
the trial court found for Walker Thomas Furniture Company,

24
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.800
the district of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed but the instant court with

25
00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:40.380
Skelly right a reversed and remanded the case.

26
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.020
The central issue was this,

27
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.620
even though even the lower court that had ruled in favor of Walker Thomas

28
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.860
Furniture Company believed that the company's contracts were exploitive but

29
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:58.410
believe there was no basis not to enforce the contracts.

30
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.630
So the central issue is this,

31
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.870
can courts declined to enforce unconscionable contracts and were these contracts

32
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:07.974
unconscionable?

33
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.720
This central issue was a matter of first impression in the district of Columbia

34
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.580
in his opinion,

35
00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:22.581
judge right look to provision of the uniform commercial code two dash three Oh

36
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:24.570
two,
uh,

37
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.600
which had just recently been enacted but had not yet taken effect and judge

38
00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:35.691
right felt his power as a common law judge and relied on this provision even

39
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:41.010
though it wasn't enforced yet,
saying that was persuasive authority.

40
00:02:41.011 --> 00:02:44.310
It was authority because he was persuaded by it.

41
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.910
And this provision says that courts can refuse to enforce contracts.

42
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:52.830
They find unconscionable judge right held that where the element of

43
00:02:52.831 --> 00:02:57.090
unconscionability is present at the time a contract is made.

44
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.860
The contract should not be

45
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.510
the case was remanded in order to determine whether the contracts in questions

46
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:08.590
were in fact unconscionable.
Now in dissent,

47
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.920
Judge Donna her agreed with the lower court which found no basis for failing to

48
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:18.730
enforce the contract but concluded Congress you should consider corrective

49
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:22.930
legislation to protect the public from such exploitive contracts.

50
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.290
He emphasized the many public policy concerns,

51
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:31.291
the case involved and suggested that the court's decision might have unintended

52
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:35.290
negative effects on the on individuals of low income.

53
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.800
Maybe it would increase the interest at which they had to borrow money.

54
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.410
So let's make sure we understand the structure of the purchase at issue.

55
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:45.250
In this case,

56
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.440
first walker furniture sold goods on installment.

57
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.520
It's sales contract specified that instead of paying for an item all at once,

58
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.170
the purchaser would make regular smaller periodic rent payments on the items

59
00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:04.171
purchased and the furniture company would retain title to it until the total

60
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:06.730
installment payments equal.
The item's value.

61
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.320
A transaction is structured in this way can be especially appealing for

62
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:16.321
individuals who want to give an item but don't have the ability to pay for it

63
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:17.284
all at once.

64
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.980
The very controversial provision in the Walker Thomas Furniture contracts was

65
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.440
the cross collateral clause.

66
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.770
This clause required that all installment payments on a given purchased to be

67
00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:37.350
prorated against the amounts due on all purchases,
uh,

68
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.160
uh,
that uh,
a borrower such as Ms. Williams had outstanding.

69
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.350
This would keep open the debts on each purchase until all the goods were paid

70
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:48.850
for.
As a result,

71
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.140
the Walker Thomas Furniture Company retained a security interest in all of the

72
00:04:53.141 --> 00:04:57.370
goods Ms. Williams bought until the balance on the last item she purchased with

73
00:04:57.371 --> 00:04:58.204
paid.

74
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.480
This means that company could seize those goods to discharge a debt on whatever

75
00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:08.671
item those good secured all of the goods that the Walker Thomas furniture

76
00:05:08.831 --> 00:05:13.690
companies sold to Ms. Williams were security for the last thing she bought in

77
00:05:13.691 --> 00:05:15.100
this case,
the stereo.

78
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.120
This meant that if Ms. Williams couldn't make the payment on that Stereo Walker

79
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.610
Thomas Furniture under this provision could take all of the goods that had

80
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.280
previously sold on credit to Ms. Williams.

81
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.750
This they did a Marshall seized from her,
among other things,

82
00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:35.920
draperies and apron set,
a potholder set and rugs.

83
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.920
So now let's talk about unconscionability.

84
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.920
What does a unconscionability actually mean?
Well,

85
00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:46.921
here's what the UCC section two three Oh two a says the provision that judge

86
00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:52.810
right found pervasive.
If the court finds as a matter of law,

87
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.070
any clause of a contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made,

88
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.870
the court may refuse to enforce the contract.

89
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.850
Comment one to that provision provide some additional guidance.

90
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:09.800
It says the basic test is whether in light of the general commercial background

91
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:13.460
and the commercial needs of the particular trade or case,

92
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.680
the clauses involved are so one sided as to be unconscionable under the

93
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:22.160
circumstances existing at the time of the making of the contract.

94
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.820
The principal is one of prevention of oppression and unfair surprise and not of

95
00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:33.290
disturbance of allocation of risks because of superior bargaining power.

96
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.470
According to the UCC,

97
00:06:36.471 --> 00:06:40.940
the primary factors and turn in determining unconscionability or whether it

98
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:45.500
causes depression and unfair surprise to one of the parties to a contract.

99
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.540
Judge Wright went into a considerably deeper discussion of unconscionability,

100
00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:55.541
his meaning and his own opinion focusing on an absence of meaningful choice on

101
00:06:56.481 --> 00:07:01.220
the part of one of the parties together with contractual terms which are

102
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:03.650
unreasonably favorable to the other party.

103
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.310
Acknowledging that both these factors are difficult to define.

104
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.520
Judge right nevertheless noted that meaningful choice could be negated by gross

105
00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:17.450
inequality of bargaining power and by a party's lack of opportunity to

106
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:19.430
understand the terms of the contract.

107
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.360
Another common way of talking about unconscionability is to distinguish between

108
00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:30.320
procedural unconscionability on one hand and substantive unconscionability on

109
00:07:30.321 --> 00:07:34.520
the other.
The former refers to defects in the bargaining process,

110
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.360
the ladder to unfairness in the outcome of the process,

111
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:40.760
the terms of the agreed upon contract,

112
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:46.210
usually some mixture of both procedural and substantive unconscionability must

113
00:07:46.581 --> 00:07:50.510
be present for a court to declare a CCO contract unconscionable.

114
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:56.080
The distinction between procedural and substantive unconscionability maps nicely

115
00:07:56.421 --> 00:08:01.421
onto judge writes requirements of absence of meaningful choice and unreasonably

116
00:08:02.331 --> 00:08:04.310
favorable terms respectively.

117
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:09.700
They also map onto the factors in UCC two dash three Oh two comment one the,

118
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:16.070
the issues of oppression and unfair surprise where there is procedural

119
00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:17.360
unconscionability.

120
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.810
The victim is surprised to learn about the contract substantive,
uh,

121
00:08:21.811 --> 00:08:22.760
unfairness.

122
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.960
Can you think of any instances in which either procedural or substantive

123
00:08:26.961 --> 00:08:31.160
unconscionability on its own should be enough to avoid a contract?

124
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.290
Can you think of a contract that is substantively but not procedurally

125
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:40.370
unconscionable or vice versa?
Uh,
if you're,

126
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.100
uh,
uh,

127
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.710
knowledgeable of the Old Testament in the Bible,

128
00:08:45.711 --> 00:08:49.910
you might think of two different contracts that Jacob entered into.

129
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.290
One which is dominantly,
uh,

130
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.070
unconscionable from a substantive standpoint.

131
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.880
And another is dominantly unconscionable.
From a procedural standpoint,

132
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:05.010
a party's level of education is relevant to whether there is procedural

133
00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:06.060
unconscionability.

134
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.110
So was the way in which significant terms of the contract,

135
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:14.370
like the cross collateral clause at issue here are presented?

136
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:15.840
Uh,

137
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.840
the hiding of one sided terms in fine print is the paradigmatic example of

138
00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:26.070
procedural unconscionability.
As for substantive unconscionability,

139
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.710
right.
Applied the test,
the Corbyn,

140
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:33.711
a famous commentator on contracts set forth whether the contracts terms are so

141
00:09:34.381 --> 00:09:39.330
extreme as GOP are unconscionable according to the mores and business practices

142
00:09:39.331 --> 00:09:40.650
of the time and place.

143
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:46.650
Richard Epstein is a famous libertarian law professor who tends to extol freedom

144
00:09:46.651 --> 00:09:51.000
of contract with a libertarian like Epstein tend to have more concerns about

145
00:09:51.001 --> 00:09:55.670
procedural or substantive unconscionability.
Well,

146
00:09:55.850 --> 00:10:00.500
libertarians would tend to be more concerned about procedural unconscionability

147
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:05.770
if terms are hidden in fine print so that the non drafters surprised to learn

148
00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:06.830
what she promised.

149
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.850
Then a libertarian might worry that the surprise party did not make a

150
00:10:10.851 --> 00:10:14.180
sufficiently informed decision about whether or not to contract,

151
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.200
but Epstein famously saw that substantive Lee unconscionable terms could be

152
00:10:21.051 --> 00:10:25.670
problematic because they're evidence of procedural unconscionability.

153
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:26.743
For example,

154
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:31.280
if the term is so unfavorable that no person in their right mind would have

155
00:10:31.281 --> 00:10:32.114
agreed to it,

156
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:37.040
then the existence of substantively unconscionable terms in a contract is

157
00:10:37.041 --> 00:10:42.041
evidence that there must have been some procedural defect in contracting.

158
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:45.240
Okay,
here's another quiz.

159
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:50.540
Did the DC circuit court find that Walker Thomas furnitures contract wasn't

160
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.560
unconscionable?
Yes or no?

161
00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

162
00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:58.150
<v 0>Well,
it's a trick question.
Judge Wright didn't actually decide this question.</v>

163
00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:02.350
He instead remanded the question for the lower court's consideration.

164
00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:05.210
Ultimately the company settled with the plaintiff,

165
00:11:05.211 --> 00:11:10.120
so no court made a final determination as to whether the cross collateral term

166
00:11:10.121 --> 00:11:13.880
was unconscionable.
But lets us do that.

167
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:17.450
Considering the contract at issue against these various test,

168
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.760
what factors point toward or against unconscionability?
Well,

169
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.150
the way to approach this is to first break it down into procedural and

170
00:11:26.151 --> 00:11:28.610
substantive,
uh,
uh,
questions.

171
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.990
There's pretty strong evidence of procedural unconscionability given the

172
00:11:32.991 --> 00:11:35.900
convoluted language of the cross collateral term.

173
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.730
It's probable that the borrower,

174
00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:43.640
a purchaser would not have understood that the seller was retaining a security

175
00:11:43.641 --> 00:11:45.800
interest in all of the previous purchases.

176
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:51.470
But the harder question is whether the cross collateral clause is substantively

177
00:11:51.471 --> 00:11:52.340
unconscionable.

178
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:57.900
This is much harder question because the law often allows borrowers to give

179
00:11:58.181 --> 00:12:00.330
security,
uh,
uh,

180
00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:05.170
that is higher in value than the amount that's being borrowed by over

181
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:09.820
securitizing the debt.
The borrower might receive more favorable terms,

182
00:12:09.821 --> 00:12:11.470
including a lower interest rate.

183
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:17.220
Most home mortgages are over securitized because of the buyer's down payment.

184
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.580
Right now.
Uh,

185
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.780
my home mortgage is only about half as large as the amount of the value of the

186
00:12:24.851 --> 00:12:26.710
House that,
uh,
that secures it.

187
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.110
It's also hard to see how the seller could earn an unconscionable windfall

188
00:12:32.111 --> 00:12:37.111
profit from the over securitization as there's a duty to give any excess value

189
00:12:38.651 --> 00:12:42.010
from seized assets back to the borrower.
Thus,

190
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:43.660
once security is seized,

191
00:12:43.661 --> 00:12:48.550
the seller would have a duty to sell it at auction and any extra proceeds of the

192
00:12:48.551 --> 00:12:53.551
auction after paying off the borrower's debt would be paid back to the borrower.

193
00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:59.220
The cross collateral clause also seems substantively conscionable when we

194
00:13:00.101 --> 00:13:03.010
consider that in the absence of any security interest,

195
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.520
a lender could seek a monetary judgment,

196
00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:09.100
a court judgment against a defaulting borrower,

197
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:13.540
and normally would be able to hire a sheriff to seize any of the borrowers

198
00:13:13.541 --> 00:13:18.220
assets.
And that means any of them in order to satisfy the monetary judgment.

199
00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:21.610
So normally the lender would have been able to,

200
00:13:21.611 --> 00:13:26.440
through the monetary judgment mechanism,
through getting a court order,

201
00:13:26.441 --> 00:13:31.300
a court judgment to seize the same channel that were seized in this very case.

202
00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:33.341
In fact,

203
00:13:33.341 --> 00:13:37.600
Doug Baird discovered that one reason Walker Thomas might have used the cross

204
00:13:37.601 --> 00:13:42.601
collateralization clause was to get around the effect of a very unusual local

205
00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:47.500
code ordinance in the District of Columbia under this local statute.

206
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:52.570
All beds betting household furniture,
furnishings,
sewing machines,

207
00:13:52.571 --> 00:13:56.920
radios,
stoves,
cooking utensils,
not exceeding $300 in value.

208
00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.730
We're free and exempt from distrait attachment.

209
00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:05.850
Levy seizure under any court order has Doug Baird explains Walker Thomas took

210
00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:13.270
the security interest in Williams other household goods because these assets

211
00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:18.100
where otherwise exempt from the monetary a judgment mechanism.

212
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:23.530
Baird says that Walker Thomas had to take a security interest in them in order

213
00:14:23.531 --> 00:14:28.180
to be able to reach them.
In the event of a borrower default,

214
00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:32.920
the cross collateralization clause,
uh,
Baird says,

215
00:14:32.921 --> 00:14:35.800
serve this purpose and no,
no other purpose.

216
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:41.250
And possibly it was the Walker Thomas furnitures end run of the local code that

217
00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:46.870
makes this term substantively unconscionable.
Finally,

218
00:14:46.871 --> 00:14:48.790
let's consider the dissent in the case.

219
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.300
Why might someone in Ms. Williams position agree with the descent?

220
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.780
Well,
Judge Donna,
hers noted for instance,

221
00:14:56.781 --> 00:15:00.950
that many poor people lack credit and thus pose a risk to companies selling

222
00:15:00.951 --> 00:15:03.450
goods on installment.
Uh,

223
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:07.640
he suggested that companies might only be willing to sell goods on credit to

224
00:15:07.641 --> 00:15:11.750
these individuals when they're pricing policies will afford the degree of

225
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.970
protection commensurate with the risk.

226
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:18.410
If courts refused to enforce Walker Thomas Furniture's contracts,

227
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.450
might the company,
uh,

228
00:15:20.451 --> 00:15:25.451
see selling expensive items to low income purchasers at all or bite they charge

229
00:15:26.541 --> 00:15:29.060
higher interest rate.
And who is that?

230
00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:33.920
The court or the legislature in that is in the best position decide what

231
00:15:33.921 --> 00:15:38.570
contractual terms are so exploited as to become unconscionable.

232
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:44.290
And so Walker Thomas Furniture also stands for our standard concern that

233
00:15:44.451 --> 00:15:49.451
whenever the law imposes a mandatory restriction to protect,

234
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:53.760
uh,
buyers,
uh,
it,
the,
um,

235
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:56.370
perverse effect is that,
uh,

236
00:15:56.630 --> 00:16:01.630
it might end up hurting them if the seller's react negatively enough to the

237
00:16:01.851 --> 00:16:02.450
restriction.
