1
00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.880
Our next case continues.
Our discussion of unconscionability.

2
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.150
Looking closely at one common type of contractor will provision arbitration

3
00:00:10.551 --> 00:00:15.290
clauses.
The facts of this case are relatively straight forward.

4
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.300
Misty Ferguson was an employee of countrywide when she began working there.

5
00:00:20.301 --> 00:00:25.130
She signed a contract which included a provision mandating that certain types of

6
00:00:25.131 --> 00:00:30.131
disputes between her and countrywide would be arbitrated rather than going to

7
00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:31.754
court.

8
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:37.030
She later filed a lawsuit in court for sexual harassment against countrywide and

9
00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:43.361
her manager Leo Dileo when countrywide tried to force Ferguson to go to

10
00:00:45.321 --> 00:00:46.190
arbitration,

11
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.630
the court refused to enforce the arbitration clause finding it to be

12
00:00:50.631 --> 00:00:51.590
unconscionable

13
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.280
in the opinion you have read.

14
00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.310
Judge Pregerson is reviewing that decision to see whether the arbitration clause

15
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:08.631
and Ferguson's employment contract was in fact unconscionable and therefore

16
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.220
unenforceable under California law.

17
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.890
Arbitration has come up a couple of times during this course but this case

18
00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:21.891
delves into the arbitration process in more detail so it's worth saying a little

19
00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:23.100
bit more about it.

20
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.140
Arbitration is an alternative to a a lawsuit in an ordinary court,

21
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.390
a neutral third party called the arbitrator gets still look at evidence here,

22
00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:35.820
the parties arguments and decide the case.

23
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.240
The arbitrators decision is binding on the parties and it generally cannot be

24
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:46.710
appealed to a court.
The details of how an arbitration works.

25
00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:51.500
For example,
how the arbitrator is selected,
what evidence can be presented,

26
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.430
etc. Are All determined by the contract in which the parties agreed to

27
00:01:56.431 --> 00:01:57.264
arbitrate.

28
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.080
Some state courts have been skeptical about the impartiality of arbitrators and

29
00:02:04.331 --> 00:02:06.760
the fairness of the arbitration process,

30
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.300
but Congress in 19 Tony five passed the Federal Arbitration Act or FAA to ensure

31
00:02:14.411 --> 00:02:18.310
that courts would enforce arbitration agreements and less.

32
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.490
Those agreements were unenforceable because of some generally applicable state

33
00:02:23.531 --> 00:02:28.531
contract law doctrine under the FAA estate cannot carve out special rules

34
00:02:30.371 --> 00:02:33.280
limiting enforcement of arbitration agreements.

35
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.790
Those agreements can only be set aside for reasons that might also render other

36
00:02:38.981 --> 00:02:43.750
types of agreements on enforceable.
Not Withstanding the FAA,

37
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.960
some state courts have remained hostile to the enforcement of arbitration

38
00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:49.870
clause,

39
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.870
so much so that states like California have been willing to distort their

40
00:02:55.241 --> 00:03:00.241
generally applicable law in order to reduce of arbitration agreements.

41
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.290
Judge Pregerson applies California law to determine whether the arbitration

42
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:13.111
clause in Ferguson this employment contract with contra countrywide is a valid

43
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:18.721
contract provision under California state law under California law to find an

44
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:21.640
arbitration clause unconscionable,

45
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.770
the judge must find both procedural unconscionability and substantive

46
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:27.850
unconscionability,

47
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.220
but the precise mix of these two elements can vary.
Quote,

48
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.060
the more substantively oppressive the contract term,

49
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.680
the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the

50
00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:44.740
conclusion that the term is unenforceable unquote.

51
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.550
Here the court finds both procedural and substantive unconscionability and so

52
00:03:50.861 --> 00:03:53.620
the arbitration clause is unenforceable.

53
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.650
The court looks at two factors to determine procedural unconscionability,

54
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.270
which is about the fairness of the process by which the parties arrived at the

55
00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:06.610
contract.
The first is oppression.

56
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.610
Did the parties have unequal bargaining power?

57
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.680
Was there actual meaningful negotiation between the parties and did both parties

58
00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:16.570
have a choice here?

59
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.130
Ferguson had no ability to bargain to vary the terms of the agreement.

60
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:24.550
The contract was offered on a take it or leave it basis.

61
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.810
The second factor for procedural unconscionability is surprise.

62
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.180
Was the arbitration clause hidden.

63
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.960
The court didn't discuss the surprise question in detail,

64
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:39.340
but it seems to reject the Countrywide's claim.
That quote,

65
00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:41.620
the contract was written in plain language.

66
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.460
One way that California hostility to arbitration clauses has distorted

67
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:52.600
unconscionability doctrine is by changing what constitutes procedural

68
00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:55.900
unconscionability today in California,

69
00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.200
any form contract that is offered on a take it or leave it basis is going to be

70
00:05:01.211 --> 00:05:06.211
treated as having at least some degree of procedural unconscionability.

71
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.940
This means that the vast majority of consumer and employment contracts have are

72
00:05:14.171 --> 00:05:15.630
going to be um,

73
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.120
procedurally unconscionable so that the question of unconscionability and

74
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.100
setting aside the term will turn solely on whether the contract is sufficiently

75
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.560
unconscionable in a substantive sense.

76
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.910
In discussing substantive unconscionability,

77
00:05:33.911 --> 00:05:38.470
judge Pregerson focuses on the question of whether the terms of the agreement

78
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.790
quote are so one sided as to shock the conscience unquote.

79
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.410
He finds three ways in which they are substantively unconscionable.

80
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.311
First,

81
00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:53.230
the arbitration clause only applies to the sorts of claims and employee like

82
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:58.231
Ferguson might bring against countrywide discrimination or harassment tort

83
00:05:59.091 --> 00:05:59.924
claims,

84
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.110
but the clause leaves countrywide free to go to court for the sorts of claims

85
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:10.790
that it might bring against Ferguson violations of intellectual property or

86
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.960
unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets.
Second,

87
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.350
the contract forces Ferguson to bear a significant portion of the cost of

88
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:21.494
arbitration.

89
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.920
An earlier California Supreme Court decision had held that mandatory arbitration

90
00:06:27.231 --> 00:06:32.120
clauses in employment contracts could only be enforceable if the cost to the

91
00:06:32.121 --> 00:06:36.470
employee for arbitration was no more than the cost of going to court.

92
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.840
Splitting the arbitration fees with the employee by itself can be substantively

93
00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:42.740
unconscionable.

94
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.750
The court found that countrywise fees to be substantially unconscionable because

95
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:51.890
they might be higher than an employee would pay in going to court.

96
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:53.773
Third,

97
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.610
the provisions of the contract that limit discovery in a way that

98
00:06:58.611 --> 00:07:00.770
disproportionally d disadvantages.

99
00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:05.771
Ferguson was found to be substantively unconscionable countrywide as the

100
00:07:05.871 --> 00:07:10.820
employer likely has access to all sorts of information about what happened

101
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.740
without needing discovery.

102
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.160
While Ferguson needs discovery to have any information at all.

103
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.630
These three one sided aspects of the arbitration provision seem to judge

104
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:26.660
progress in like an intentional attempt by countrywide to bias the arbitration

105
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.970
process in its own favor.

106
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.650
And so he ruled that the whole arbitration clause was unconscionable and

107
00:07:33.651 --> 00:07:37.070
therefore unenforceable.
But frankly,

108
00:07:37.071 --> 00:07:41.540
the court's analysis of substantive unconscionability is hard to understand

109
00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:46.541
except as an expression of judicial hostility toward enforcement of arbitration

110
00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:50.620
agreements possibly,
especially when they,
uh,

111
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:55.190
are being used to deny an employee from having her day in court concerning the

112
00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:56.330
civil rights claim.

113
00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:02.240
Many individual provisions of a contract or by themselves one sided,

114
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.310
one provision might for example,

115
00:08:04.311 --> 00:08:09.311
mandate that an employee worked 40 hours per week and not require anything of an

116
00:08:09.351 --> 00:08:11.150
employer.
But of course,

117
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:15.530
another provision of that contract might one sidedly provide that the employer

118
00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:17.850
must pay the employee.
Uh,

119
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:23.230
and here is it really one sided for the employer and employee to split the

120
00:08:23.271 --> 00:08:26.180
arbitration fees.
Splitting seems the

121
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.280
opposite of one side.

122
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:34.310
This and employment provision that said employees had to send their kids to an

123
00:08:34.821 --> 00:08:39.821
employer and employers private kindergarten is likely to be enforced even if the

124
00:08:40.371 --> 00:08:45.050
fees were greater than what the employee would have to pay for public school.

125
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:51.040
The provision covering the kinds of actions that can be brought is one sided,

126
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.110
but the one sidedness might be reasonable.

127
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:58.950
Employers might be more subject to reputational discipline than employees,

128
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:03.980
especially today with social media that might justify asymmetric access to

129
00:09:04.441 --> 00:09:08.010
courts.
In two recent cases,

130
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:13.011
the United States Supreme Court has overturned California law about the Ar

131
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:19.510
unconscionability of arbitration clauses at and t mobility versus Concepcion in

132
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:26.091
2011 and American Express versus Italian colors and 2013 both of these cases

133
00:09:29.131 --> 00:09:32.550
dealt with provisions preventing class arbitration,

134
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:37.800
the arbitration equivalent of class action lawsuits,
and in both cases,

135
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:42.950
the u s supreme court overturned California decisions to say that arbitration

136
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:48.900
clauses were valid and enforceable.
The U s supreme court in a sense,

137
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:53.930
understands that states like California are manipulating unconscionability law

138
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.640
to end run the FAA,

139
00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:02.030
and these two sovereigns can be seen as in a struggle over arbitration

140
00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:06.630
enforceability.
So let's take a quiz.

141
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.280
Two companies negotiate a contract that includes an arbitration clause.

142
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:16.320
The arbitration clause says that one of the companies will have much more

143
00:10:16.321 --> 00:10:18.840
extensive discovery powers in arbitration.

144
00:10:18.841 --> 00:10:22.470
Then the other is the arbitration clause.
Unconscionable,

145
00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:24.821
uh,

146
00:10:24.821 --> 00:10:29.821
court probably wouldn't find this arbitration clause unconscionable.

147
00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:35.140
Recall that unconscionability requires both procedural and substantive

148
00:10:35.141 --> 00:10:36.310
unconscionability.

149
00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:41.470
While this agreement might be lopsided enough to be substantively
unconscionable,

150
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.690
it seems like the two companies had a real opportunity to negotiate the terms of

151
00:10:46.691 --> 00:10:51.130
the contract until the contract is not procedurally unconscionable.

152
00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:56.500
Whichever company gave up its discovery powers probably got something else in

153
00:10:56.501 --> 00:10:57.334
exchange.

154
00:10:58.780 --> 00:10:59.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

155
00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.680
<v 0>Under California law,
arbitration clauses are invalid.</v>

156
00:11:02.681 --> 00:11:05.800
If there are no opportunity to negotiate,

157
00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:08.410
that would be procedural unconscionability.

158
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:13.180
And the arbitration process is stacked against the weaker party.

159
