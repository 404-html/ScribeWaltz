00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.170
In this lecture,
we continue our discussion of fraud.

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.560
We do so by looking at a 1968 Florida case Volks versus Arthur Murray where the

3
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:17.841
court considered whether misrepresenting statements of opinion could qualify as

4
00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:20.574
fraud.

5
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.630
Volks was a 51 year old widow who desired to become an accomplished dancer.

6
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.990
She spent over $31,000 and that's in 1960 $8 over 16 months on dance lessons

7
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:39.900
provided by the defendant Arthur Murray incorporated,

8
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.740
relying upon the defendants,

9
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.780
elaborate assurances that she was dramatically improving and would become an

10
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.600
excellent dancer.

11
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.870
The complaint alleged that she was a poor dancer in spite of the instruction and

12
00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:58.790
that the defendant's encouragements were designed to deceive her and inducer

13
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.870
into purchasing additional lessons.

14
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.740
Volk sued to rescind the contracts for all of the lessons paid for but not

15
00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:12.321
completed and for the return of her $31,000 less the cost of lessons that she

16
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:14.520
had received,

17
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.830
the trial court dismissed or complaint for failure to state a cause of action

18
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.330
and the instant court reversed.
The central issue.
Is this,

19
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:29.331
may a contract be rescinded for fraud consisting of misrepresenting one's

20
00:01:30.391 --> 00:01:34.440
dancing abilities according to the court?
The answer is yes.

21
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.040
The court began by noting that generally a contract can only be rescinded for

22
00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:43.500
fraud following a misrepresentation of fact.

23
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.920
Usually opinions are not sufficiently falsifiable to give rise to a claim of

24
00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:52.260
misrepresentation.
However,

25
00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:57.261
the court recognized that exceptions exist to this general rule and held that

26
00:01:57.781 --> 00:02:02.640
the rule does not apply where there is a fiduciary relationship between the

27
00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:07.200
parties or where there has been some artifice or trick employed by the

28
00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:12.201
representer or where the parties do not in general deal at arm's length or where

29
00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:18.891
the representi does not have equal opportunity to become apprised of the truth

30
00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:22.650
or falsity of the fact represented.
Further,

31
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.770
the court noted that a statement of a party having superior knowledge may be

32
00:02:28.621 --> 00:02:30.780
regarded as a statement of fact,

33
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.020
although it would be considered as opinion if the parties were dealing on equal

34
00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:41.340
terms applying that principle to the facts at hand.

35
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.730
The court said that it could be reasonably,

36
00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:49.731
suppose that Arthur Murray had superior knowledge unquote about Volks is dancing

37
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:54.570
ability and potential and since quote,

38
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.170
it would be a reasonable inference from the undenying developments of the

39
00:02:59.171 --> 00:03:04.171
complaint that the flowery you load gms heaped upon her by defendants as a

40
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:09.961
prelude to her contracting for 1,944 additional hours of instruction proceeded

41
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:18.511
as much or more from the urge to ring the cash register as from any honest or

42
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:25.561
realistic appraisal of her dancing prowess or a factual representation of her

43
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:28.990
progress unquote.
Because of this,

44
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:33.991
the court held that Volks is stated a legitimate claim and was entitled to quote

45
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:39.670
her day in court unquote throughout the case.

46
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.700
The judge takes what some might consider to be a disrespectful tone toward the

47
00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:49.090
plaintiff herself.
Saying,
for example,
that quote,

48
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.190
while she first exalted that she was entering the spring of her life,

49
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.290
she finally was awakened to the fact that there was spring,
neither in her life,

50
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.060
nor in her feet unquote.

51
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.320
Volks ends up winning the right to have her day in court,

52
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.430
but she might feel revictimized by the courts.

53
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:14.431
Salacious characterization that she quote wiled away the pleasant hours

54
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.790
sometimes in a private room absorbing his accomplished sales technique unquote.

55
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.070
On the other hand,

56
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.220
the procedural posture of the case might help explain the court's Innuendos.

57
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.440
This was an appeal from the trial courts order dismissing the complaint for

58
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.800
failure to state a cause of action.
In other words,

59
00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:43.330
the trial court held that even assuming all the facts alleged by the plaintiff

60
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:48.040
were true,
she wasn't legally entitled to relief.
Therefore,

61
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.810
the court had to take her allegations as true and ask whether put in the light

62
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.220
most favorable to the plaintiff.
They stated an actionable claim

63
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.440
according to section one 59 of the restatement.

64
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.650
A misrepresentation is an assertion that is not in accord with the facts as voke

65
00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:14.330
shows,
a statement of opinion can be a misrepresentation if the parties are in a

66
00:05:14.331 --> 00:05:19.331
special relationship of trust or the speaker has superior knowledge in that

67
00:05:20.051 --> 00:05:20.884
area.

68
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.220
This is captured by section one 69 B of the restatement which says that the

69
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:31.570
recipient of an opinion is justified in relying on the opinion.

70
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.760
If he quote reasonably believes that as compared with himself,

71
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.030
the person whose opinion is asserted has special skill judgment or objectivity

72
00:05:42.881 --> 00:05:45.430
with respect to the subject matter unquote.

73
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.100
So let's take a look at this quiz.
Adam is looking to buy a new car.

74
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.350
Beatrice Adam's neighbor is trying to convince that I'm to buy her old Ford

75
00:05:56.351 --> 00:05:59.390
focus of a Honda Civic.
She tells Adam,

76
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.330
I think my focus is a great looking car,

77
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.390
better looking car than any Honda civic relying on Beatrice's opinion.

78
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.510
Adam agrees to purchase the Ford Focus from Beatrice later that day.

79
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.290
Adam's teenage daughter tells him that the car is ugly.

80
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.680
Can Adam rescind the contract based on Beatrice's misrepresentation that are

81
00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:27.140
Ford focus was a great looking car.

82
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.000
This is a pretty simple quiz.
The answer is probably not.

83
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.680
Whether a car is good looking or ugly.
As a matter of opinion,
not fact,

84
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.570
Adam would be justified in relying on Beatrice's opinion if your opinion was

85
00:06:41.571 --> 00:06:42.261
fraudulent.

86
00:06:42.261 --> 00:06:47.030
And he reasonably believed that she had some special skill judgment or

87
00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:50.870
objectivity regarding whether a car is good looking or not.

88
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:56.060
But there no indication that Beatrice his opinion was fraudulent or that Adam

89
00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:58.370
was justified in relying on her opinion.

90
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.350
Sam Buel has argued that criminal fraud functions to deter and punish novel

91
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:11.470
wrongful acts that evade narrow legal definition and therefore it must remain

92
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.780
it.
The fraud action must remain adaptive.
He says,
quote,

93
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:23.050
open textured law that grows and innovates in competition with those who seek to

94
00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:24.231
evade.

95
00:07:24.231 --> 00:07:29.231
It appears to be characteristic of any legal order that seeks to control harmful

96
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.970
human behavior,
at least in any society,
mature enough to have a large economy.

97
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.250
Similar literally,

98
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:42.430
courts have also interpreted misrepresentation in contract law to cover more

99
00:07:43.521 --> 00:07:47.720
than just statements of fact or expressions of opinion.

100
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.040
For example,

101
00:07:49.041 --> 00:07:54.041
a statement might also be literally true but contained false implications in

102
00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:59.390
context.
The classic example of this is the half truth.

103
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:00.920
In one case,

104
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:06.190
after repeated inquiries by the buyer about an oil storage facility,

105
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:11.530
the seller disclosed the existence of one leak but not others of which it

106
00:08:11.531 --> 00:08:12.530
allegedly knew.

107
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:17.960
The court held that the disclosure of one leak carried with it quote some

108
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.140
implication of exclusivity unquote.

109
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.550
That is an implication that the seller knew of no other leaks.

110
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.600
Courts have also interpreted misrepresentation to include acts of concealment in

111
00:08:32.181 --> 00:08:33.710
failures to disclose.

112
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:38.540
Concealment is the covering up of some facts such as painting over water,

113
00:08:38.541 --> 00:08:43.541
damage on basement walls or hiding evidence of termite damages as we're about to

114
00:08:44.001 --> 00:08:47.630
discuss and the one of the very next classes.

115
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:53.140
While concealment is not exactly a falsehood or at least not an express

116
00:08:53.511 --> 00:08:54.710
misrepresentation,

117
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:59.990
courts have held that such acts constitute actionable false hoods by hearing

118
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.670
implicit misrepresentations.

119
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:09.110
Once the court has identified an express or implied representation that is

120
00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:10.674
untrue,

121
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:16.070
there are additional elements still required for a contracting party to

122
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:21.381
establish the defense and be able to void a contract.

123
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:27.020
The listener must have justifiably relied on the misrepresentation in deciding

124
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:32.511
to enter into the contract and the miss representation must be either fraudulent

125
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.250
or material.

126
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:42.330
The usual effect of wrongful misrepresentation is to render the contract

127
00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:44.520
voidable by the deceived party,

128
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:49.740
but courts have identified to kind of fraud in the execution as distinguished

129
00:09:49.741 --> 00:09:54.090
from ordinary fraud in the inducement that precludes the formation of any

130
00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:55.230
contract at all.

131
00:09:55.770 --> 00:10:00.770
As an an example is where a party secure is another signature by misrepresenting

132
00:10:01.231 --> 00:10:05.820
the character of the document.
So let's review.

133
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:11.480
A contract may be rescinded if one party made fraudulent misrepresentations to

134
00:10:11.821 --> 00:10:16.440
induce the other party to agree to the contract.
Generally,

135
00:10:16.441 --> 00:10:20.550
this rule is limited to misrepresentations of fact.
However,

136
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.260
this may be expanded to other kinds of misrepresentations,

137
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:30.530
such as misrepresentations of professional opinions as demonstrated by Volks

138
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.120
versus Arthur Murray.
