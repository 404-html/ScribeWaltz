00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.370
Today we're going to discuss the statute of frauds which concerns the kinds of

2
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:10.371
agreements that must be in writing in order to be enforceable if an agreement

3
00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:13.350
falls within the statute,

4
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.650
then having a written contract is a requirement for enforcing the promises.

5
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.220
In the agreement we'll discuss the historical origins and context of the

6
00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:26.964
statute,

7
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.090
the types of transactions that fall within the statute and the requirements for

8
00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:34.590
fulfilling the statutes,
uh,

9
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.100
itself and the consequences of noncompliance and varying judicial

10
00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:42.660
interpretations of the statute.

11
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.430
Let's start with some historical background.

12
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.120
In 1677 the English parliament passed the precursor to the modern American

13
00:00:54.631 --> 00:00:56.070
statute of frauds.

14
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.290
It was called an act for prevention of frauds and surgeries.

15
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.090
The act was meant to prevent individuals from falsely claiming that another

16
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:11.091
party had promised them something and from then assuming that party for breach

17
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.330
of the alleged contract,

18
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.160
this kind of false claim was particularly pernicious because in England at the

19
00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:21.870
time of the statutes,

20
00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:25.200
enactment interested parties to litigation.

21
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.160
That is the parties who had a real stake in the outcome of the lawsuit.

22
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:33.150
The plaintiff and defendant were not permitted to testify in court.

23
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.630
If a claimed that be agreed to sell him a plot of land and then breach their

24
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:40.044
contract.

25
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.200
The neither a nor B could testify about the alleged agreement to combat this

26
00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:46.974
phenomenon.

27
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.290
The act for prevention of frauds and perjurious required that certain kinds of

28
00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:55.680
contracts had to be in writing and signed.

29
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.730
Section four of the act required that no action shall be brought unless the

30
00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:07.731
agreement upon which such action shall be brought shall be in writing and signed

31
00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:13.341
by the parties to be charged there with or some other person there unto by him a

32
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.660
lawfully authorized for certain types of actions.

33
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.960
These included suing one for a green and failing to pay another's debts,

34
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.590
suing for violation of agreements made on consideration of marriage,

35
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.500
suing on agreements for the sale of land and suing on agreements that could not

36
00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:39.840
be performed within a year.

37
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.920
Section four has been widely imitated since then and as the restatement second

38
00:02:47.581 --> 00:02:48.331
of contracts.

39
00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:53.331
Section one 10 makes clear and you can see here basically the same provisions

40
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.530
appearing,
uh,

41
00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.650
almost word for word section 17 of this 1677 statute of frauds govern the sale

42
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:05.554
of goods.

43
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.620
It provided no contract for the sale of any goods for the price of 10 pounds,

44
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:16.501
sterling or upwards shall be allowed to be good except the buyer shall accept

45
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:22.801
part of the goods sold or give something in earnest to bind the bargain or that

46
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:28.261
some note or memorandum in writing of said bargain be made and signed by the

47
00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:34.480
parties to be charged by such contract.
That section too,

48
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:39.481
she's a very similar counterpart in the UCC in section two Dash Two oh one

49
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.010
subsection one provides that a contract for the sale of goods for a price of

50
00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:53.041
$500 or more is not enforceable unless there is some writing sufficient to

51
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:58.531
indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed

52
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:01.600
by the party against whom enforcement is sought.

53
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.330
A writing is not insufficient because it admits or incur incorrectly states a

54
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:08.710
term agreed upon,

55
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.880
but the contract's not enforceable under this provision.

56
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.380
Beyond the quantity of goods shown in the in the writing,

57
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.870
the provision only requires signing by the party against whom enforcement is

58
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:27.220
sought because the seeker is not denying the existence of the contract.

59
00:04:27.221 --> 00:04:28.540
It's only the other side.

60
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.150
But subsection three of this provision lists some ex,
uh,

61
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.043
exceptions,

62
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.470
a contract which does not satisfy the requirements of subsection one,

63
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.280
but which is valid in other respects,
is enforceable.

64
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.930
A,

65
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.930
if the goods are to be specially manufactured for the buyer and are not suitable

66
00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:56.890
for sale to others in the ordinary course of business.
B,

67
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.130
if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in his pleading testimony

68
00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:03.610
or otherwise in court,

69
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.030
that a contract for sale was made or see with respect to goods for which payment

70
00:05:10.121 --> 00:05:14.410
has been made and accepted or which have been received and accepted,

71
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.650
admitting that a contract was made and a buyer's payment or acceptance of goods

72
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.600
is a fairly good substitute for a buyer signature.

73
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.380
But especially manufacture goods might substitute for a seller signature as an

74
00:05:31.721 --> 00:05:36.160
indication that the seller must have thought there was a contract or wouldn't

75
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:40.450
have produced these specially manufactured goods.

76
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.880
So here's a question.

77
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.900
The statute of frauds was meant to address false allegations that agreement

78
00:05:49.301 --> 00:05:52.690
existed,
but in addressing that process problem,

79
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.160
could the statute promote another kind of fraud?
Well,

80
00:05:58.161 --> 00:05:59.720
sadly,
the answer is yes,

81
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.050
it might encourage the converse concern alleging no agreement existed when in

82
00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:10.331
fact in agreement did without the statute of frauds were apt to see false

83
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:13.640
allegations of contract,
uh,

84
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:18.350
when the parties never in fact agreed.
But with the statute,

85
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.440
we're apt to see false denials of contracts where the parties actually did agree

86
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.320
parties can protect themselves from denial fraud by insisting that the other

87
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:33.230
side to a contract always sign an agreement,

88
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.860
then she can't deny the contracts existence.

89
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:42.430
While false allegations of oral contracting are much harder to disprove.

90
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:48.020
So we might on balance prefer the statute and rely on parties incentives to

91
00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:52.970
insist on written contracts to avoid denial fraud.
Sadly,

92
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:58.090
parties still make many oral arguments make many oral contracts that are not

93
00:06:58.671 --> 00:07:02.930
reduced to writing.
And so the statute of frauds actually promotes,

94
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.550
uh,
uh,

95
00:07:04.551 --> 00:07:09.551
some fraudulent deniers to escape liability for breaching their actual promises.

96
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.760
This is one of the reasons why the statute has been repealed in of all places,

97
00:07:16.611 --> 00:07:18.950
the jurisdiction of its birth England

98
00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:22.500
complying with the statute.

99
00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.440
The statute of Fart frauds requires not only that contract's being writing,

100
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.020
but also that they'd be signed.

101
00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:35.580
Think for a moment of the kinds of contracts you have entered when you shop

102
00:07:35.581 --> 00:07:38.970
online.
For instance,
did you sign those agreements?

103
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.370
The official comment to the UCC two two oh one says that the word signed

104
00:07:44.371 --> 00:07:49.371
includes any authentication which identifies the party to be charged.

105
00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.640
Generally,
courts take a broad view of what constitutes as a signature.

106
00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:57.770
The restatement second of contracts,
one 34 says,

107
00:07:57.771 --> 00:08:01.800
is that the signature may be any symbol,
uh,

108
00:08:01.801 --> 00:08:03.510
or adopted with an intention,

109
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.710
actual or apparent to authenticate the writing as that of the signers.

110
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.980
So A and B agreed to a contract,

111
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:16.960
the terms of which a makes a written record a rights.
Okay.

112
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:20.650
Followed by Aes initial at the top of this record.

113
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:25.470
Does this qualify as a signature by a
well,

114
00:08:25.471 --> 00:08:26.490
the answer is yes.

115
00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:32.540
As the UCC and restatements suggests courts have taken a broad view of what

116
00:08:32.881 --> 00:08:36.120
counts as a signature.
I sent it a few minutes ago.

117
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:41.390
The fact that many transactions now place electronically sits awkwardly with

118
00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:46.460
requirements that certain contracts be written accordingly.
In 2008,

119
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:51.060
Congress passed the electronics records and signature in commerce act,

120
00:08:51.061 --> 00:08:53.400
also known as the e sign act.

121
00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:58.940
This act provides signature contract or rather record relating to a transaction.

122
00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:00.630
Uh,

123
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:05.630
may not be denied legal effect validity or enforceability solely because it's in

124
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:07.800
electronic form.

125
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.870
And that a contract relating to such transaction may not be denied legal effect

126
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.880
or enforceability because an electronic signature or an electronic record was

127
00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:20.700
used in its formation.
Further,

128
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:25.730
almost every state has adopted the uniform electronic transaction act.

129
00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.900
The only two non enacting states are New York and Washington,

130
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.230
which overlaps significantly with east sign,

131
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.860
but it's even more comprehensive in allowing you to,
uh,

132
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:43.440
uh,
sign,
uh,
for,
uh,

133
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.830
Internet contract by just clicking through.

134
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.253
Uh,

135
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:53.670
so what happens if parties fail to comply with the statute of frauds?

136
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:59.270
A failure to have a writing and a s a sufficient signature doesn't render an

137
00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:04.611
oral agreement automatically avoid rather an oral agreement that falls within

138
00:10:05.461 --> 00:10:07.520
the statute of frauds,
uh,

139
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:12.530
but is does not meet its requirement will be unenforceable at the option of the

140
00:10:12.601 --> 00:10:17.010
party against whom enforcement of the agreement is sought.

141
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.400
In legal terms,
it's voidable not void.

142
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.870
So if a and B orally agree that be,

143
00:10:24.871 --> 00:10:29.871
we'll sell a several acres of land and the parties never put that agreement in

144
00:10:30.751 --> 00:10:34.830
writing and afterward be fails to sell the land to a,

145
00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:40.540
a sues B and the contract will be unenforceable if be raises as a defense that

146
00:10:41.821 --> 00:10:45.210
the statute of fraud requires such an agreement to be in writing.

147
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.300
Jurisdictions differ on whether a person raising the statute of frauds,

148
00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:56.301
defense needs to promise or represent under oath that there was in fact no

149
00:10:57.841 --> 00:10:58.674
agreement.

150
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.030
Does the seller in the land hypothetical just given above,

151
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.960
have to say there was no agreement in a deposition,
for example.
Whereas there,
uh,

152
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:12.510
her attorney signing a of a brief,
uh,
that resists,

153
00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.010
that raises this defense.

154
00:11:14.011 --> 00:11:19.011
Is the attorney signing sufficient to make a claim of there not being a

155
00:11:19.201 --> 00:11:20.034
contract.

156
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:26.580
Previously we discussed promissory Estoppel and the famous section of the

157
00:11:26.581 --> 00:11:31.560
restatement section 90,
uh,
which is the promissory estoppel section.

158
00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:37.010
What happens if someone makes an oral promise that falls within the statute of

159
00:11:37.141 --> 00:11:41.190
frauds and the other party relies upon it?
Well,

160
00:11:41.191 --> 00:11:46.191
section one 39 of the restatement addresses this and repeats the language at the

161
00:11:48.781 --> 00:11:53.781
elements of section 90 saying that the agreement is enforceable not withstanding

162
00:11:54.491 --> 00:11:59.491
the statute of frauds if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the

163
00:11:59.831 --> 00:12:03.130
promise.
What about the UCC?

164
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.810
There's disagreement over whether promissory Estoppel can be used to save an

165
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.980
oral sales contract that falls within the statute,

166
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:15.700
but which is not in writing.
Uh,
under the UCC,

167
00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.710
the inconsistency extends not just between,
but within jurisdictions.
See,

168
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:21.431
for example,

169
00:12:21.431 --> 00:12:26.410
the seventh circuit's opinion in Manetti versus anchor hocking corporation.

170
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:31.450
They're the court outlined some of the arguments for and against applying

171
00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:36.280
promissory Estoppel to save an agreement that failed to meet the statute of

172
00:12:36.281 --> 00:12:38.530
frauds requirements under the UCC.

173
00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:44.050
That opinion explained that it had in past cases,

174
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:49.410
quote cut loose promissory Estoppel from contract law and permitted promissory

175
00:12:49.661 --> 00:12:52.420
Estoppel in statute of frauds cases.

176
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.510
By that it was having second thoughts lately.

177
00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.510
So what have we learned?

178
00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:03.400
We've learned that certain kinds of contracts must be in writing in order to be

179
00:13:03.401 --> 00:13:04.234
enforceable,

180
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:08.680
and that this work requirement has deep historic origins,

181
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:14.080
were familiar with the basic types of contracts that fall within the ambit of

182
00:13:14.081 --> 00:13:19.081
the statute of frauds contracts to buy and sell goods over $500 contracts to buy

183
00:13:21.281 --> 00:13:26.281
or sell real property contracts that cannot be performed within one year and

184
00:13:27.551 --> 00:13:32.551
contracts offering something in return for a marriage promise and finally

185
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.500
agreements to pay another person's debt.

186
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.810
But we've also learned that parties often can pursue promissory estoppel

187
00:13:40.811 --> 00:13:45.811
theories just as if the agreement in question weren't one to which the statute

188
00:13:46.181 --> 00:13:47.560
of frauds applied.
