1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.020
Imagine that you and a prospective homeowner,

2
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.180
I have entered a contract,

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.220
you agree to sell and the prospective homeowner agrees to buy your home for

4
00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:16.040
$500,000 the buyer breaches,
but with no trouble,

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.080
you quickly reach an identical agreement with another purchaser for $500,000.

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.200
You are in exactly the same position you expect it to be in despite the first

7
00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.010
buyer's breach.

8
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.510
If you intuitively think you wouldn't be able to get much in the way of damages.

9
00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:37.710
If you sued the first buyer for breach of contract,
you'd be correct.

10
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.410
Today though,
we're going to discuss a special concept in contract law,

11
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.650
which would allow recovery in a somewhat similar scenario where there is a lost

12
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.840
volume seller.

13
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.470
We will examine this concept by looking at a case called locks the wade.

14
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.400
It was decided by the New Jersey,
uh,

15
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.960
a New Jersey Superior Court in 1955.
After that,

16
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.580
we will discuss important provisions of the uniform commercial code that deal

17
00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:14.010
with damages in the case of buyer breach,

18
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.760
including damages for lost volume sellers.

19
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.300
And in part two of this video we'll consider some hypothetical scenarios to

20
00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:28.611
which we'll try to apply even coming up with numbers as answers,

21
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.680
uh,
for damages under these provisions.

22
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.410
Jerry locks was in the business of leasing music equipment.

23
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.890
He contracted to lease a Juke box to the defendant Gerald Wade for two years.

24
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.360
Lockwood provide records and replace the worn out parts on the jukebox.

25
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.490
He and Wade would split the profits and Wade with wade pain lock and minimum of

26
00:01:53.491 --> 00:01:54.750
$20 per week.

27
00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.010
Weighed the lessee repudiated the agreement before the jukebox was installed and

28
00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:06.921
locks lease the equipment to others but he sued wade for breach of contract and

29
00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:13.341
recovered $836 and amount representing the $20 per week for the two years he

30
00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:18.840
would have received that he would have received if the contract had been

31
00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:23.841
performed minus the cost lock would have had to put in the jukebox box and to

32
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:27.090
maintain it weighed appealed.

33
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.080
He argued that because the plaintiff was able to lease the equipment elsewhere,

34
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.320
he hadn't really lost those two years of profits to the extent he owed anything.

35
00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:41.361
Wade argued he only owed the amount that remained after the mounted gained from

36
00:02:41.491 --> 00:02:46.491
the leases were taken into account considering our home sale example again,

37
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:52.041
suppose a court awarded you the full purchase price for the first buyer's breach

38
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.500
even though you'd completed the sale with the different buyer.

39
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.100
Wade argued this was essentially what happened in this case.

40
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.550
The court disagreed it explain that locks had many jukeboxes to sell or rent,

41
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.060
where in our earlier hypothetical you only had one house you could sell locks

42
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.190
had many jukeboxes.
Moreover,

43
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:19.240
locks had argued that quote locations were very hard to get.

44
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.720
There weren't many people seeking to lease the equipment because of this ample

45
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:27.400
supply and limited demand.

46
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.150
If weighted kept his promise and and uh,

47
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.240
least the jukebox equipment lock still would have been able to Elise additional

48
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:37.290
loop,

49
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.290
a jukebox equipment to the same people who wanted the equipment.

50
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.930
After Wade breached,

51
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.490
he would have realized the profits from both agreements.

52
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.340
Thus the court concluded quote,

53
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.790
whereas here a plaintiff less or agrees to lease an article of which the supply

54
00:03:57.161 --> 00:04:00.370
in the market is for practical purposes not limited,

55
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.290
then the law would be depriving him of the benefit of his bargain.

56
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.320
If on the breach of the agreement it required his claim against the lessee to be

57
00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:11.570
reduced by the mount,

58
00:04:11.571 --> 00:04:16.571
he actually did or reasonably could realize on a relenting of the article if the

59
00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:20.860
lessee were uh,
if the,

60
00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:23.470
if the first lease were breached quote,

61
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.740
he should have the benefit of both bargains unquote.

62
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.480
Does it matter not just that the supply of jukebox equipment is high,

63
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.800
but the number of people looking to lease the equipment is low with the same

64
00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:43.801
result obtained if that demand had to outpace the available equipment?

65
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.590
Yes,
it matters.

66
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.370
This short side of the market controls the amount of,
uh,

67
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.810
of a good that is sold when there are more people wanting to buy widgets,

68
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.530
then,
uh,
then there are widgets to be sold.

69
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.360
The short supply will determine the amount sold.
Conversely,

70
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:07.480
if there are fewer people looking to buy a car,

71
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.300
then cars to be sold,

72
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.410
then the short demand side of the market will determine the amount sold.

73
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.040
Undergraduate economics is about finding the equilibrium price where supply

74
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.670
equals demand,

75
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.890
but in disequilibrium it's the short side of the market that determines how much

76
00:05:26.891 --> 00:05:31.630
will be sold.
If there are fewer perspective,
less ease of Jukeboxes,

77
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.000
then there are jukeboxes to be leased.

78
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.800
Those prospective lessees determine the quantity of jukebox sold.

79
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.290
This is the circumstance the court found that supply was greater than demand,

80
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.530
so that Wade's breach impacted the volume that Loc was ultimately able to sell

81
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.090
and so lock was entitled to lost volume damages.

82
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.500
By contrast,

83
00:05:56.501 --> 00:06:01.501
if the number people seeking jukeboxes was greater than the number available for

84
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:04.460
leasing the same number of juke boxes,

85
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.480
all of them would be least regardless of Wade's preach,

86
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.580
there would be no lost volume and so lock would not be entitled to damages.

87
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.120
Another way of thinking about this is to ask whether Wade's breach was a but for

88
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:24.611
cause of Locke's renting the Juke box equipment to a subsequent lessees.

89
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.720
Lost volume.

90
00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:31.721
Damages should only be a warden worded if the breach was not a but for cause of

91
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.220
the lease or sale of a good to another lessee or buyer.

92
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.230
We can also formulate the test differently but equivalently asking whether the

93
00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:46.890
breach was a but for cause of the change in the less orders,

94
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.910
volume lost volume damages should only be awarded if the breach is a but for

95
00:06:52.611 --> 00:06:57.560
because of a change in the seller's volume.
Importantly,

96
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.710
it is the breaching lessees a burden to prove that there was no lost volume in

97
00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:05.354
these cases.

98
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.800
Section two seven Oh eight of the UCC is the provision of that,

99
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:17.370
uh,
of the code that deals with the seller's damages in the case of a buyer's not

100
00:07:17.371 --> 00:07:21.070
acceptance or repudiation of the contract.
What the,

101
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.120
what happened in this case two seven Oh eight one provides the standard UCC

102
00:07:27.471 --> 00:07:30.120
measure of damages.
Quote.

103
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:35.410
The measure of damages for non acceptance or repudiation by the buyer is the

104
00:07:35.541 --> 00:07:40.460
difference between the market price at the time and place for tender and the

105
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:45.461
unpaid contract price together with any incidental damages but less expenses

106
00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:49.310
saved in consequence of the buyer's breach.
In other words,

107
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:54.550
if the market price of the goods at the specified performance time and place is

108
00:07:54.831 --> 00:07:57.470
less than the amount specified in the contract,

109
00:07:57.471 --> 00:07:59.330
the seller can recover the difference,

110
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:04.630
but if the market price is the same two seven oh eight one wouldn't provide

111
00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:06.710
damages for the seller.

112
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:12.580
This is where it's two seven oh eight subparagraph two comes in this provision.

113
00:08:13.611 --> 00:08:14.990
States quote,

114
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:20.890
if the measure of damages provided in subsection one is inadequate to put the

115
00:08:21.591 --> 00:08:24.890
seller in as good a position as performance would have done,

116
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.280
then the measure of damages is the profit which the seller would have made from

117
00:08:30.621 --> 00:08:34.970
full performance by the buyer.
Together with any incidental damages,

118
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:39.990
due allowance for cost reasonably occurred and do credit for payments or pro

119
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:41.450
proceeds of resale.

120
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:47.110
Sellers in Locke's position who for practical purposes have unlimited quantities

121
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.180
of their goods and who resell goods.

122
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:55.630
After a party's repudiation for the same price as that offered,

123
00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:00.270
those goods to the repudiating party can claim their damages,

124
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.290
which under sub par paragraph one are going to be basically zero.

125
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.730
They can claim that those damages are inadequate to put them back in the

126
00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:13.080
position they would have been in,
had the repudiation not occurred.

127
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.820
So we're now going in the next,
uh,
uh,
video,

128
00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:22.020
part two of this module.
We'll go and,
and go ahead and apply.

129
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:26.880
See how section two seven Oh eight applies in other circumstances.
