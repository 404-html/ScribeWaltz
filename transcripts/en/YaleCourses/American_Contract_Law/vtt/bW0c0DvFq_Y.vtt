00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.300
Today we're going to learn about the concept of consideration by exploring the

2
00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:09.840
classic Cesnet of a case Hamer versus Sidway,

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.340
which was decided by the New York Court of Appeals in 1891.

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.120
The facts of this family dispute are memorable.

5
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.570
William III story senior promised to pay his nephew William he story the second

6
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.920
$5,000.
If the ladder would refrain from drinking,

7
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:30.030
using tobacco,

8
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:35.031
swearing and playing cards or billiards for money until he became 21 years of

9
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:40.370
age,
the nephew agreed and performed his promise.
Uh,

10
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.940
on his 21st birthday,

11
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:46.320
the nephew requested the $5,000 and the uncle told him that he had had the money

12
00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:51.321
certain but that it would be held from him until the uncle thought the nephew

13
00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:56.100
was capable of taking care of it after the uncle's death.

14
00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.730
This suit was brought by the plaintiff and the present appellant,

15
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.310
Louisa Haimer.
She was the assignee of the nephew.

16
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.970
After several mean assignments,

17
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.270
that's it looks like it's spelled Mez,

18
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.890
but it means it's pronounced mean and it means intermediate assignments.

19
00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:17.250
So it's where the nephew,

20
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.080
we design his interest in bringing this case to somebody else who ultimately

21
00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:26.820
assigned it a to Louisa Haimer,
the other party,

22
00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:31.821
Franklin Sidway was the executor of the uncle's estate and who was claiming that

23
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.070
the estate didn't have to pay the $5,000.

24
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.910
The central issue in the case is this is forbearance from arguably harmful

25
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:47.001
activity like drinking sufficient consideration to support a contract.

26
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:49.773
Um,

27
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.570
Sidway representing the uncle's estate argued that the uncles promise to pay

28
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.810
wasn't enforceable because the agreement lacked the necessary consideration.

29
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.050
We need to understand the concept of consideration because consideration is a

30
00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:11.370
traditional prerequisite to enforcing a contractual promise.

31
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.120
Section 17 of the second restatement of contracts provides the formation of a

32
00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:22.401
contract requires a bargain in which there is a manifestation of mutual assent

33
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.100
to the exchange and a consideration.

34
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:28.643
By the way,

35
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.710
was there a manifestation of mutual assent and in hammer you bet the uncle made

36
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:40.491
an offer and the case says the nephew assented from that moment on both parties

37
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:43.770
were bound to a contract.

38
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.220
That is if there is sufficient consideration once the contractual bell rings,

39
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.770
the nephew would have breached a contract created by the exchange of promises if

40
00:02:55.831 --> 00:02:59.860
he drank at any point after,
uh,
promising.

41
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.220
So in Hamer versus Sidway,
uh,

42
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.420
it's included in most contract case book because it helps teach us what counts

43
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:12.670
as consideration.
So to begin,

44
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:17.260
it's helpful to think of consideration as what's given in return for somebody,

45
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.790
someone else's promise.

46
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.400
It is the quid given for the quo and the phrase quid pro quo.

47
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.610
Sidway argued that in return for the uncles promise,

48
00:03:28.611 --> 00:03:32.380
the nephew hadn't given up enough because the nephew had only promised to

49
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:35.500
forbear from doing things that would have harmed him.

50
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.710
The court rejected Sidway his argument and found there was a sufficient

51
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:43.270
consideration quote.

52
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.930
A valuable consideration in the sense of the law may consist either in some

53
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:50.410
right interest,

54
00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:55.411
profit or benefit accruing to the one party or some forbearance loss or

55
00:03:56.891 --> 00:04:01.891
responsibility given suffered or undertaken by the other under Hamer versus

56
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:05.044
Sidway.

57
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.170
A return promise to be a sufficient consideration doesn't have to be an actual

58
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:12.124
detriment.

59
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.170
It is enough for it to be a legal detriment to the promise.
See,

60
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.160
illegal detriment means promising to do anything that you didn't have to do or

61
00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:29.050
promising to forbear from doing anything that you might have legally done.

62
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.160
The case is interesting because the uncle didn't receive any obvious benefit and

63
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:40.981
one might plausibly argue the nephew did not suffer an actual detriment from the

64
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:45.760
performance of his promise.
Thus,

65
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.910
the court's conclusion that illegal detriment for purposes of consideration can

66
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:56.251
be very different from the common sense meaning of what an actual detriment is.

67
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.910
The Hammer decision is a classic statement of the benefit detriment conception

68
00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:08.110
of consideration.
Under this definition,

69
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:13.170
either an actual benefit to the promise or or a legal detriment to the promise

70
00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:20.481
see is a sufficient consideration because it's hard to factually established

71
00:05:21.901 --> 00:05:23.950
whether the promise sore here,

72
00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:28.951
the uncle actually benefited from his nephew's abstinence.

73
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.530
The benefit detriment conception of consideration almost always looks to whether

74
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:36.730
there was illegal detriment.

75
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.700
One way of establishing a promise or his benefit would be to rely on the

76
00:05:42.701 --> 00:05:45.010
economic concept of revealed preference.

77
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.850
The uncle must have benefited from the nephews,

78
00:05:48.851 --> 00:05:52.270
abstinence or the uncle wouldn't have been willing to pay for it,

79
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.390
but the revealed preference argument proves too much.

80
00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.140
The consideration requirement is meant to preclude legal enforcement of

81
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:02.600
gratuity.
Gratuitous promises,

82
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.140
promises for which there is no return promise,

83
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.770
but anyone who promises to give $1,000 a gratuitously to another reveals a

84
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:14.300
preference for that state of the world.

85
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.400
That gratuitous promise doesn't reveal that the promise or gained anything from

86
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:22.370
the promises,
a return promise when there isn't one.

87
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.390
The problem with the legal detriment,

88
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:31.391
conception of consideration is that savvy contractors could manipulate the

89
00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:36.140
return promise to qualify as a legal detriment.

90
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.980
For example,

91
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.490
Jane offers to pay Joe $10,000 if Joe promises to inhale sometimes in the next

92
00:06:46.361 --> 00:06:47.320
60 seconds,

93
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:53.070
Joe readily agrees and then loudly and hails Jane then refuses to pay.

94
00:06:53.711 --> 00:06:56.050
And when Joe Sues for breach of contract,

95
00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.850
Jane has the audacity to argue that there was no consideration for her promise

96
00:07:00.851 --> 00:07:05.851
to pay $10,000 the question here is under the benefit detriment conception of

97
00:07:07.301 --> 00:07:09.850
consideration should Jane when,

98
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.530
and the answer to this quiz is no.

99
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.010
Joe had a legal right to hold his breath for a minute.

100
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.400
His promise to forbear from holding his breath is the legal detriment,

101
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.750
creating consideration for Jane's promise to pay $10,000.

102
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:34.860
Even though courts wanted to avoid having to assess the messy factual,

103
00:07:35.821 --> 00:07:39.910
a question of whether the promise or actually benefits from the promises.

104
00:07:39.911 --> 00:07:40.990
Return promise,

105
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:46.620
the Joe and Jane Hypothetical show why the promise or benefit question is hard

106
00:07:47.141 --> 00:07:52.090
to avoid.
If we want to stop,
uh,
hold your breath.
Types of shapes.

107
00:07:52.091 --> 00:07:52.960
Shenanigans,

108
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:58.890
the common law of responded to this problem in cases decided after Hamer versus

109
00:08:01.391 --> 00:08:02.990
Sidway,
um,

110
00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:08.190
by replacing the early conception of consideration as either a benefit to the

111
00:08:08.741 --> 00:08:13.741
promise or or a detriment to the primacy with what is known as the bargain for

112
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.070
conception of consideration.

113
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:23.910
This bargain for or inducement conception of consideration can be seen in

114
00:08:25.091 --> 00:08:30.091
section 71 of the restatement second of contracts to constitute consideration,

115
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:37.240
a performance or return prominence must be bargained for.

116
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.550
And then section two tells us that a performance or return promise is bargain

117
00:08:42.551 --> 00:08:47.551
for if it is sought by the promise or in exchange for his promise.

118
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:52.060
And is given by the promise see and exchange for that promise.

119
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:57.510
In contrast to the benefit detriment of consideration which focuses on the

120
00:08:58.411 --> 00:08:59.820
welfare of the parties.

121
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.580
The bargain for conception focuses on the parties reasons for entering into the

122
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:06.420
transaction.

123
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.970
Although the benefit detriment framework still exerts considerable influence in

124
00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:13.740
England and Commonwealth countries.

125
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:18.240
The bargain for theory has largely won the day in the United States.

126
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:22.350
That said,
because contract law is a product of judicial decisions,

127
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.920
it has many authors and old rules die hard.

128
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:30.921
Although the bargain for theory is the dominant approach to consideration the

129
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:35.400
benefit and detriment test still figure into many courts holdings.

130
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.900
Section 79 of the second restatement states that if the requirement of

131
00:09:43.171 --> 00:09:44.430
consideration is met,

132
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.930
there's no additional requirement of a gain advantage or benefit to the promise

133
00:09:48.931 --> 00:09:53.931
or or have a loss disadvantage or detriment to the primacy common be to the same

134
00:09:55.831 --> 00:10:00.510
section observes that some courts say illegal detriment is sufficient even

135
00:10:00.511 --> 00:10:04.680
though there is no economic detriment or at or other actual loss,

136
00:10:04.681 --> 00:10:09.180
but suggest that it's more realistic to say simply that there is no requirement

137
00:10:09.181 --> 00:10:10.530
of detriment anymore.

138
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:16.310
Another way of looking at the haimer versus Sidway case is that the court isn't

139
00:10:16.531 --> 00:10:20.220
really looking for a benefit or a legal detriment,

140
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.130
but simply for a bargain for exchange,

141
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:28.430
the uncle has offered to pay $5,000 in exchange for the nephews clean living.

142
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.920
Isn't it fairly clear that the return promise was sought by the promise or in

143
00:10:34.651 --> 00:10:38.850
exchange for this return promise?
After all,

144
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.170
we don't think the uncle would have been willing to make his promise to pay

145
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:48.000
unless the nephew had made his promise in return.

146
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.290
Thus,
the facts of the case,
if not the court's actual language,

147
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:58.100
provide support for the second restatements bargained for rule that neither our

148
00:10:58.801 --> 00:11:03.240
benefit nor,
uh,
an actual detriment is essential.

149
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.943
Finally,

150
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:10.040
a close reading of the case reveals that the uncle in Hamer versus Sidway made

151
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:15.330
two separate promises,
one on March 20th at a wedding anniversary,

152
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.600
and the second one in a letter of February six 1875.

153
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:26.270
The court's analysis of the case focuses entirely on whether the first promise

154
00:11:26.951 --> 00:11:31.530
was supported by consideration,
but the suit is more,

155
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.560
I think,
accurately premised on the second progress.

156
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.010
The nephews consideration for,
uh,

157
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.290
the uncle second promise was different.

158
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:45.120
The nephews promise not to drink or smoke was the consideration for the first

159
00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:49.950
promise.
And even if there was no consideration for that first promise,

160
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:55.190
the second promise might well be supported consideration for the second promise.

161
00:11:56.141 --> 00:12:01.141
This nephew gave up a plausible s a lawsuit for breach of the first promise in

162
00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:07.621
exchange for the uncles promise to pay $5,000 plus interest giving up the right

163
00:12:08.801 --> 00:12:13.801
to sue was arguably a settlement of a claim and separately enforceable.

164
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.260
So what have we learned?

165
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:22.710
Consideration is a requirement for a contractual promise to be enforced under

166
00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:28.201
hammer consideration could be either a promise or benefit,

167
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.950
or more likely a legal detriment to the promise.
See,

168
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:34.181
and finally,

169
00:12:34.181 --> 00:12:38.350
because of the problems with the legal detriment test being manipulated,

170
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.740
modern courts 10 now to require that the promise or his return promise was

171
00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:44.860
bargained for,

172
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:50.080
that the return promise actually induce the promise or to make his or her

173
00:12:50.081 --> 00:12:50.650
promise.
