00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.430
If you've been watching these modules in the suggested order,

2
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.200
uh,
we have now finished the introductory part of the course.

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.210
We've covered cases on how to form an enforceable promise.

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.433
We have,
uh,

5
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.480
been introduced to a few cases on a defenses to enforcement and a couple of

6
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:25.200
cases,
uh,
having to do with remedies.

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.060
Now we're going to go back and take up in more depth,
uh,

8
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:35.061
how to create enforceable contracts and starting again with the concept of

9
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:39.930
consideration.
In an earlier lecture,

10
00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:44.931
we talked about consideration as a traditional prerequisite for forming a

11
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:50.211
contract by introducing that concept with the classic Cesnet of a case,

12
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.030
a Hamer versus Sidway.

13
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.920
You remember that was the one where an uncle bribed his nephew to refrain from

14
00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:03.360
drinking and using tobacco until he was 21 in Hammer.

15
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.060
The court found that there was consideration.

16
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.560
Today we consider a case called Kirksey versus Kirksey where the court

17
00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:14.130
considered a promise that lacked consideration.
In other words,

18
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.510
a gratuitous promise.

19
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.810
The defendant in Kirksey wrote a letter to the plaintiff.
Uh,

20
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.240
angelical Kirksey is widowed sister in law.

21
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.430
After you learned of his brother's death,
he wrote,
if you come down and see me,

22
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.450
I will let you have a place to raise your family.
A,

23
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:38.250
the plaintiff had been squatting on public land,
which she could have secured,

24
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.140
but after receiving the letter,

25
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.850
she abandoned the land and moved her children about 65 miles to live with the

26
00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:49.800
defendant,
the defendant,
how's the plaintiff for over two years.

27
00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:54.330
But then forester to leave.
And the Cra Trial Court,

28
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.660
uh,
awarded the plaintiff $200.
Uh,

29
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.340
but the instant court that we're going to be,
uh,
uh,
focusing on reversed.

30
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.590
And so the central issue was simple.

31
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.800
Was the defendant's promise supported by consideration?

32
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.630
The court's opinion in this case is short and sweet.

33
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.460
The opinion begins with what is in effect a one sentence dissent by the

34
00:02:17.461 --> 00:02:21.060
authoring judge who is inclined to hold that quote,

35
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.770
the loss and convenience which the plaintiff sustained and breaking up and

36
00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:27.210
moving to the defendants.

37
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.920
A distance of 60 miles is sufficient consideration to support the promise

38
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.940
unquote the author and judge whoever is out voted.

39
00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:39.960
He's outnumbered by the other judges on the court who quote think that the

40
00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:44.961
promise on the part of the defendant was a mere gratuity and that inaction will

41
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:49.020
not lie for it's breach unquote.
With that,

42
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:52.320
the court reverses the lower court's opinion in,
uh,

43
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.930
just three sentences and rules for the defendant.

44
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.320
When we discussed Hamer versus Sidway,

45
00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:03.280
we concluded that the nephews agreement to give up his legal right to engage in

46
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:08.281
certain vices counted as illegal detriment as consideration because it was

47
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:12.520
illegal detriment and a detriment to the promise or accounts this consideration.

48
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.770
How about in this case,
was there a detriment to the primacy and Kirksey?

49
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.270
Well,
yes,

50
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:24.040
she could have continued to squad on the public land and eventually secure it,

51
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.170
but instead she abandoned the property and traveled 60 miles and reliance on her

52
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:30.430
brother in law,
his promise.

53
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.600
So if consideration is either a detriment to the promise,
see,

54
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:38.800
or a benefit to the promise or the plaintiffs seems like she should win,
right?

55
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.010
Well,
wrong.
Reliance alone is not enough.

56
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.220
There must be a bargain,
a quid pro quo.

57
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.590
You remember that section 71 of the restatement.
Second of contracts,

58
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.830
states that to constitute consideration or performance or return promise must be

59
00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.260
bargained for a promise for a return promise is bargained for if it's sought by

60
00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:06.400
the promise or in exchange for the promise and is given probably the primacy in

61
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:08.020
exchange for that promise.

62
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.480
So was there a bargain for exchange and Kirksey versus Kirksey?

63
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.510
No,
at least the court which called the promise,
a mere gratuity,

64
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.590
not just a gratuity,
but a mere gratuity.
He didn't seem to think so.

65
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.911
Then again,

66
00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:29.710
it can be difficult to distinguish a conditional promise from a bargain for

67
00:04:29.711 --> 00:04:34.660
promise.
For another example,
imagine this offers made.
If you come to my house,

68
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:39.661
you can play with my dog is the promised their bargaining with you to persuade

69
00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:43.870
you to visit or as the promise promise her.
Simply saying,

70
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.530
my dog is here.
So if you happen to stop by,
you can play with it.

71
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.100
The ladder is a gratuitous but conditional gratuitous promise.

72
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.130
Often we need extra facts to figure out whether a particular promise is offering

73
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:01.990
a quid pro quo,
uh,

74
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.020
or offering a conditional gratuity was the sister's conduct in the Kirksey's

75
00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:09.370
case.
Bargain for?
Well,

76
00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:13.180
not if it was not sought by the promise or an exchange for the promise.

77
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.190
When are we sure that it was not right?
What if the promissor is Jewish and his,

78
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.220
it's a Mitzvah for him to marry the widow of his brother,
mighty,

79
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.980
be willing to pay for her to come.

80
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.610
Generations of law students have wondered about the story of sister until Echo.

81
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.420
Why did her brother in law invite her to come stay with him?

82
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.420
Was the promise purely gratuitous or did he expect to get something out,
uh,

83
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.990
from her,
out of her moving,
uh,
closer to him.

84
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.180
And why did he later changed his mind and eject her from,
uh,
his property?

85
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:55.140
A 2006 article by William Casto and Val Rick's cast some light,

86
00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.280
uh,
some new light on this question.

87
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.370
They found that under a federal law at the time,

88
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.910
squatters on federal lands and Alabama and elsewhere,

89
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.650
we're often able to obtain a preference on those lands that allowed them to

90
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:12.650
purchase the lands at below market price.

91
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.610
But the law only permitted one preference per person.

92
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.650
So if the brother in law had already exercised at PR preference on other land,

93
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.920
he may have sought to persuade Angelica to occupy the land and exercise a

94
00:06:28.691 --> 00:06:32.840
preference,
buy it at a below market price,
and then transfer it back to him.

95
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.420
But if this is the story,
why was that Angelica evicted?
After two years?

96
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.400
Casto and Rick's find records indicating that the brother in law,

97
00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:44.061
in fact,

98
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:48.680
gave joint possession of the property to his son who turned 21 around the time

99
00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:52.100
Angelica was ejected once he turned 21.

100
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.870
The son was now of age enabled to exercise the preference himself.

101
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.350
Making Angelica is continued occupancy unnecessary.

102
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.840
These added details suggest that maybe a JELLCO's brother in law was in fact

103
00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:10.841
seeking a quid pro quo in the lecture following Hamer versus Sidway.

104
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.890
I talked about the case of rickets versus Scott Thorn and introduce the doctrine

105
00:07:15.891 --> 00:07:19.910
of promissory Estoppel.
Promissory Estoppel you'll remember,

106
00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:24.530
allows courts to enforce promises even if there are not contracts because of

107
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:27.110
lack of consideration in rickets.

108
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.580
Remember a grandfather promised his granddaughter that he would pay her $2,000

109
00:07:31.581 --> 00:07:35.240
plus interest so that she would,
uh,
uh,

110
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.980
not have to go to work anymore.
The grandfather,
the grand daughter,

111
00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:42.590
quit her job,
but after the ground father died,

112
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.800
the executor of the grandfather's estate refused to pay the promise $2,000.

113
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.700
The court held that the promise was binding because the granddaughter relied on

114
00:07:52.701 --> 00:07:56.300
the promise to her detriment and it'd be an equitable not to enforce it.

115
00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:01.840
Remember that section 90 of the restatement second outlines the conditions for

116
00:08:01.971 --> 00:08:03.260
promissory Estoppel,

117
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:07.900
a promise which the promise or should reasonably expect induce action or

118
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.090
forbearance on the part of the promise,

119
00:08:10.091 --> 00:08:15.091
he or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding

120
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:20.090
if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.

121
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:25.550
So did the brother-in-law's promise in Kirksey meet the requirements of

122
00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:28.460
promissory Estoppel?
Yes.

123
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:33.380
A promise or who promises to give you a place to raise your family should

124
00:08:33.381 --> 00:08:37.160
reasonably expect that the promise we'll induce you to abandon the land you are

125
00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:41.360
squatting on and move a 65 miles and encourage either promises.

126
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.880
Did in fact induce the plaintiff to move.

127
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.170
So why didn't the court enforce the promise?
Well,

128
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:53.200
the easy answer is that when Kirksey was decided in 1845 promissory Estoppel was

129
00:08:54.441 --> 00:08:57.480
not yet a thing in contract law.
Remember,

130
00:08:57.481 --> 00:09:02.481
rickets is recognized as one of the genesis cases,

131
00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:02.850
uh,

132
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:07.850
with regard to promissory Estoppel and it was not decided until 1898 further

133
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.170
Kirksey was decided in Alabama and Ricketts was decided in Nebraska.

134
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.490
Since law changes over time and can differ from place to place,

135
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.240
these factors might simply explain the outcome,

136
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.050
but I'm not going to let you off with just the easy answer nor food.

137
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.330
Most law professors,

138
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:32.460
you should also think of a if there are other ways that we can distinguish these

139
00:09:32.461 --> 00:09:34.740
cases factually to explain the outcome.

140
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:40.220
One possible key differences that the promise or in Ricketts had passed away and

141
00:09:41.011 --> 00:09:45.000
the available facts suggest that he's still intended for the granddaughter to

142
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:49.020
receive the gift.
It was the executor of the estate who refuse to pay.

143
00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.570
While this is with this in mind,

144
00:09:51.571 --> 00:09:55.440
the question in Ricketts was arguably less about whether the grandfather's

145
00:09:55.441 --> 00:10:00.120
promise should have inner irrevocably bound him and more about how the

146
00:10:00.121 --> 00:10:04.440
grandfather's estate should be divided among the descendants since the

147
00:10:04.441 --> 00:10:08.990
grandfather apparently wanted his granddaughter wished for a while,

148
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.370
wanted his granddaughters,
what his granddaughters,

149
00:10:11.371 --> 00:10:15.240
his wish for his granddaughter to receive this money until it's in the outcome

150
00:10:15.241 --> 00:10:17.070
seems justified.

151
00:10:17.071 --> 00:10:21.510
But in Kirksey it was the promise or who decided himself to take back is

152
00:10:21.511 --> 00:10:25.860
gratuitous promise.
So with the doctrine of Estoppel aside,

153
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:31.010
the cases might also be reconciled by a rule that says an individual who makes

154
00:10:31.471 --> 00:10:36.471
it gratuitous promise may later or may later revoke or more easily revoke that

155
00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:37.644
promise,

156
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:42.740
but he must do it himself or make his intention to revoke posthumously clear to

157
00:10:43.501 --> 00:10:45.350
the court.
Uh,

158
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:50.040
even if both of these cases may come out the same today under section 90 under

159
00:10:50.041 --> 00:10:53.640
this theory of promissory Estoppel.
And I tend to think they would,

160
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.140
thinking through the factual differences in the cases is a useful exercise.

161
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:03.380
This is what common law is frequently about finding a potentially relevant

162
00:11:03.751 --> 00:11:08.400
factual distinctions in order to reconcile seemingly,
uh,

163
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:12.780
unreconcilable,
uh,
uh,
and different outcomes.

164
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:17.430
A clever lawyer will often find factual distinctions that allow her to argue

165
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:22.020
that our client's situation is more similar to cases without comes more

166
00:11:22.021 --> 00:11:27.021
favorable and more distinguishable from outcomes that she doesn't like.

167
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:28.860
So what have we learned?

168
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.700
A conditional gratuitous promise does not create a contract.

169
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.970
A contract requires bargain for exchange.

170
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:41.240
So even if a promise induces the primacy to take or for bear from taking a

171
00:11:43.081 --> 00:11:44.040
certain action,

172
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:49.220
the promise will not be an enforceable contract if that action was not sought by

173
00:11:49.471 --> 00:11:52.470
the promised or in exchange for his promise.
