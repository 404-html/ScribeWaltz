00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.420
Today's case,
like Michael V.

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.570
Price deals with what's called a requirement's contract.

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.980
Hanley t price sold sand through his business,

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.010
the sooner sand company he and Mcmichael entered into a contract in which

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.670
mcmichael agreed to supply price with all the sand that price could resell for

6
00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:29.571
the next 10 years at a price of 60% of the market price at the sands

7
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:32.730
destination.
So Price,

8
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.880
Aka sooner sand is the plaintiff and the purchaser from Mcmichael.

9
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.230
It's a little bit confusing because it seems that price,
uh,

10
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.290
speaks,
uh,
the cons contract speaks as price as being the seller,

11
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.920
but he's actually a reseller of sand that he buys from Mcmichael.

12
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.750
So after some time,
uh,
under this contract,

13
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.640
Ma Mcmichael refuse to continue supplying price with sand.

14
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.200
And so price sued to enforce the contract.
At the trial,

15
00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:10.740
the jury awarded price $7,500.

16
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.010
Though the judge reduced that to $5,000 through remittitur order.

17
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.190
Mcmichael argued in this case that is contract with price was invalid because

18
00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:26.730
the contract was not mutual.
If price decided to go out of business,

19
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.200
he would no longer be obligated to purchase any sand for Mcmichael.

20
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.550
In particular,

21
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.940
Mcmichael pointed out that price had quote no established business and was not

22
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:41.940
bound to sell any sand whatsoever unquote.

23
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.800
We are reading the decision from the Oklahoma Supreme Court.

24
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.850
That's one reasons it's called sooner sand because it's as sooner state.

25
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.650
The court must decide whether requirement contracts are void for lack of

26
00:01:55.651 --> 00:02:00.651
mutuality because the purchaser can avoid his obligation by going out of

27
00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:05.460
business.
The court finds that this is not the case.

28
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.440
Each of the parties does have an obligation under the contract price.

29
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.510
The purchaser reseller must not buy sand from anyone else.

30
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.130
If price does mcmichael could sue him for breach of contract,

31
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.290
you should see that this promise not to buy from anyone else is illegal

32
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:29.160
detriment.
That helps satisfy the consideration requirement.

33
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.910
Mcmichael the seller must sell price for its side of the contract for its

34
00:02:35.461 --> 00:02:38.220
promise.
All the sand that price needs.

35
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.350
This form of contract is called a requirements contract and it's one where a

36
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:48.351
seller agrees to supply all of a purchaser's requirements in exchange for a

37
00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:54.861
promise that the purchaser will buy exclusively from that seller and output

38
00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:58.920
contract is in a sense the reverse.

39
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.130
A buyer agrees to purchase all of the supplier's product in exchange for the uh,

40
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:12.331
suppliers promise not to sell to anyone else in order for requirements and

41
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:18.760
output contracts and indeed for other contracts to be valid,

42
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:21.100
the contracts must be mutual.

43
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.010
That is they must bind both parties.

44
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.140
Neither party can have a freeway out of the contract.

45
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.400
Both must be making actual commitments that might be breached.

46
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.480
This is the consideration for each other's promise.

47
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.730
Must be something that if it's not given,

48
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.400
would give rise to a breach of contract action.

49
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.470
Courts generally haven't considered the exact level of commitment to be

50
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:48.520
important.
That is,

51
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:53.521
it's up to the parties themselves to negotiate just what they are bound to or

52
00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:57.640
not bound to under the uniform commercial code,

53
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.850
the purchaser and a requirements contract like the one in Mcmichael v price has

54
00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:07.330
the duty to also make reasonable efforts to generate sales.

55
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.840
Section two three Oh six subparagraph one provides that a term which measures

56
00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:18.010
the quantity by the output of the seller or the requirements.

57
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.040
The buyer means such actual output or requirements as may occur in good faith,

58
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.630
except that no quantity unreasonably disproportionate to any stated estimate may

59
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:34.390
be tendered or demanded under the UCC.

60
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:39.391
Then Mcmichael would have a legal claim against price if he decided to stop

61
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:43.720
selling sand entirely.
Uh,
for no good reason.

62
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.880
Parties have a responsibility to stick relatively close to any estimates they

63
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:53.881
gave when negotiating the contract for our requirements are an output agreement.

64
00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.190
Though they are allowed to fluctuate somewhat based on their actual business

65
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:04.670
needs.
So under the UCC,

66
00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:09.671
which of the following would violate price and Mick Michael's contract a price

67
00:05:10.641 --> 00:05:15.641
makes no effort to resell and never order sand from Mcmichael be mcmichael

68
00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:21.170
refuses to sell price more than half the amount of sand price at estimated.

69
00:05:21.171 --> 00:05:26.171
He would need see price orders from Mcmichael 20 times more sand than he

70
00:05:27.471 --> 00:05:31.160
suggested he would need or d,
all of the above.

71
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.770
<v 1>Okay,</v>

72
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.770
<v 0>well all of these accidents here would violate either the terms of the contract</v>

73
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.500
or section two,
three Oh six of the UCC.

74
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.580
The estimated amount of sand is presumptively reasonable.

75
00:05:45.581 --> 00:05:49.840
And so mcmichael his refusal to sell price more than half the estimated amount

76
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.010
violates his promise.
If price requests,
uh,

77
00:05:54.011 --> 00:05:58.280
no sand or 20 times as much sand as he said he would need,

78
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.720
a court would likely find that the amount required were unreasonably

79
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:06.020
disproportionate to the,
uh,
earlier estimates.

80
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.980
If price made reasonable efforts and could not sell any sand,

81
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.750
that might not be a breach,

82
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.850
but important questions arise as to how much effort and whether the resale must

83
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:21.230
be profitable
in mcmichael versus price.

84
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.760
We have seen that the requirement of mutuality simply means that both parties

85
00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:30.761
must have obligations under a contract in order for that contract to be valid.

86
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.790
A good test for whether parties have ob a mutual obligations is what is judged,

87
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.120
uh,
is whether judged at the moment of contracting,

88
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.720
there is some course of action they could take for which the other party could

89
00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:48.080
sue them for breach of contract.
In particular,

90
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.180
requirement contracts and output contracts are enforceable because of the

91
00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:58.181
exclusivity and reasonable efforts promises these can be violated if you buy or

92
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.400
sell a from the wrong person.

93
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.980
We have also seen that the uniform commercial code requires purchasers and

94
00:07:07.161 --> 00:07:11.900
requirement contracts and suppliers and output contracts to make good firth good

95
00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:16.520
faith efforts to stick to any estimates they gave when they were negotiating

96
00:07:16.521 --> 00:07:17.510
their contracts.
