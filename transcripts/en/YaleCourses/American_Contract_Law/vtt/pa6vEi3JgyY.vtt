00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:01.980
In this lecture,

2
00:00:01.981 --> 00:00:06.981
we continue our discussion of the manifestation of mutual assent by considering

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.680
Lucy versus Zimmer in 1954 Virginia Case in which the promise or appeared to

4
00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:18.000
assent to a contract,
but later claimed this,

5
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.390
a offer that his offer was merely a joke in Lucy versus Zimmer.

6
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.540
The defendant Zimmer drafted and executed a short written agreement on the back

7
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:35.151
of a restaurant receipt to sell his farm for $50,000 to the plaintiff.

8
00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:40.821
Lucy Zimmer subsequently refused to consummate the sale asserting that he didn't

9
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:47.301
ever believe Lucy had $50,000 and that the offer that he had made was just

10
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.963
ingest.

11
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.740
Lucy sought specific enforcement of the sale agreement the trial court found for

12
00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:58.620
Zimmer,
but the instinct court reversed.

13
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.350
So what's the central issue?

14
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.100
Did Zimmers action bind him contractually,

15
00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:08.760
despite his claimed subjective intent to joke,

16
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.290
the court held that it did concluding that the agreement constituted a binding

17
00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:20.730
contract of sale between the two parties,
whether it was quote,

18
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.380
the result of a serious offered by Lucy and a serious acceptance by the

19
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:26.214
defendants,

20
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.350
or was a serious offer by Lucy and an acceptance in secret.

21
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.030
Just by the defendants
to reach this conclusion.

22
00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:41.031
The court cited the rule that the law imputes to a person and intention

23
00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:46.650
corresponding to the reasonable meaning of his words and acts.

24
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.060
This is another example of the objective listener standard.

25
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.260
In other words,

26
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.470
the court applied the objective theory of manifestation of mutual assent that we

27
00:01:57.601 --> 00:01:59.340
discussed in the last lecture,

28
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.790
the uninsured undisclosed intention of the promise or is immaterial if his

29
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.900
outward actions would lead a reasonable person to conclude that he intends to

30
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:11.070
form a contract.

31
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.560
This case is arguably the poster child for a very formalist version of the

32
00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:19.380
objective theory.
At a minimum,

33
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.530
the case stands for the rule that court should look at a parties outward

34
00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:27.840
expression rather than the internal intention of the party.

35
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.550
In this case,

36
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.050
there's actually the outward manifestation of two parties,
uh,

37
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.970
on the two sellers in the sense that both both Zimmer's,

38
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.070
both of the spouses,
uh,

39
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.000
manifested a intent to contract,
uh,

40
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:49.260
and that even if one of those sellers was jesting,

41
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.000
I think it's important that the other spouse also signed,

42
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.080
helps to add to the court's willingness to enforce the contract.

43
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.190
And now and an opinion by one of America's most famous and aptly named judges.

44
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:11.161
Judge learned hand provides with an extreme statement of the objective theory of

45
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:12.364
agreement.

46
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.700
Hand said a contract has strictly speaking nothing to do with the personal or

47
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:20.800
individual intent of the parties.

48
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.250
A contract is an obligation attached by mere force of law to certain acts of the

49
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:27.520
parties,

50
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.520
usually words which ordinarily company and represent a known intent.

51
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.060
If however,

52
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.040
it were approved by 20 bishops that either party when he used those words

53
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.250
intended something else than the usual meaning which the law imposes upon them,

54
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.630
he would still be held unless there were some mutual mistake or something else

55
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:53.920
of that sort.
So why should this be the rule?

56
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.810
Even if some people attach idiosyncratic meaning to their words or actions,

57
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.080
it may be more efficient to make those people change rather to then to make the

58
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:05.980
majority change.

59
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.340
The idiosyncratic bargainers could probably adjust their behavior more easily

60
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.230
and at a lower cost than the majority.

61
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.960
Part of the efficiency from the objective listener standard is that it allows

62
00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:24.961
contract law to avoid jury questions and have disputes decided instead on the

63
00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:28.210
papers.
Under a subjective theory,

64
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.280
a defendant might cause almost any case to go to trial to decide whether both

65
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:35.710
parties really intended to contract.

66
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.990
One way to justify Zimmers liability in this case is to focus on how

67
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.020
inconsiderate the Zimmer's defense is with regard to other contract writers.

68
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.970
If Zimmer wins,
written contracts become less useful.

69
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.560
A completely subjective theory of intent also creates a serious moral hazard

70
00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:00.424
problem.

71
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.610
Parties who later wished to get out or modify regrettable bargains could claim

72
00:05:06.161 --> 00:05:10.780
idiosyncratic meanings after the fact,
as frank Easterbrook puts it.

73
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.800
If unilateral or secret intentions could bind,

74
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.330
parties would become wary and the written word would lose some of its power.

75
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.930
This is a case where the future written contract sellers are likely rooting

76
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.260
against Zimmer.

77
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.140
So after signing the agreement,

78
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.200
imagine that Zimmer immediately tells Lucy that it was all a joke and he doesn't

79
00:05:35.541 --> 00:05:36.830
intend to sell his farm.

80
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.610
Under this objective theory is the contract binding.

81
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.500
The answer's yes and offer or may revoke an offer.

82
00:05:46.501 --> 00:05:51.390
Until it is accepted,
but not after it's accepted.
If Zimmer is outward,

83
00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:54.330
actions imply that the offer is serious.

84
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.360
A contract is formed as soon as Lucy accepts it under the objective theory,

85
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.340
and if it is too late for Zimmer to revoke by revealing that he has secretly

86
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.110
joking,
uh,
uh,
then he can't retract the contract.

87
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.720
In fact,
in Lucy versus Zimmer,

88
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.840
Zimmer argued that he did tell Lucy that the whole thing was a joke immediately

89
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:22.370
after the contract was signed and he realized that Lucy was serious,

90
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.520
but that wasn't enough to avoid Zimmers liability.

91
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.910
But is this really a good rule?

92
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.060
Malcolm sharp who emphasizes the freedom from contract argues that in light of

93
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:37.160
the cost,
individual freedom,

94
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.660
the objective tests should be employed to only where the defendant has induced

95
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:44.990
actual unjustified reliance by the plaintiff.

96
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.820
If Zimmer told Lucy that he was joking before Lucy left the bar,

97
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:52.160
then what difference does it make to Lucy?

98
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.340
Lucy hasn't yet relied on the promise,

99
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.460
so is no worse off than he would have been had.

100
00:06:58.461 --> 00:07:03.050
Zimmer told him it was a joke immediately before assigning or and refusing to

101
00:07:03.051 --> 00:07:08.010
sign.
Sharps reliance approach is not perfect.
However,
uh,

102
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.890
whether the promise he relied on the promise can itself be a matter of dispute

103
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.690
that may require jury adjudication of whether there was actual and justified

104
00:07:17.691 --> 00:07:18.524
reliance.

105
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:23.150
There would be fewer summary Judgments and directed verdicts if there was a

106
00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:25.130
required a reliance requirement.

107
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.900
So let's recap for two parties to establish a valid contract.

108
00:07:29.901 --> 00:07:33.890
There must be a manifestation of mutual assent by both parties.

109
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.960
Under the objective theory,

110
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.730
whether a scent is manifested is determined by the actions of the parties.

111
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.410
And so a party may be bound despite a hidden contrary intent,

112
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:51.060
the reasonable listener standard determines whether someone has manifested a

113
00:07:51.061 --> 00:07:51.530
scent.
