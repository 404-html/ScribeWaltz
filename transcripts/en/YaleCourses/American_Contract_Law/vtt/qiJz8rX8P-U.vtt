00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.630
Last time we talked about Kirksey versus Kirksey,

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.580
where the court deemed a promise Amir gratuity because the promise lacked

3
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:09.450
consideration.

4
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.990
Today we will continue to discuss consideration this time we'll examine Langer

5
00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:17.460
versus superior steel corporation,

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.350
a case that is explicitly distinguished from Kirksey and which presents an

7
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:26.340
interesting transition case in the understanding of consideration.

8
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.920
In discussing Langer will also revisit the concept of promissory Estoppel,

9
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.750
which we saw earlier in the introductory case rickets versus scar thorn.

10
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.380
The langor case was decided by the Pennsylvania Superior Court in 1932 first,

11
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.310
let's quickly recap Kirksey versus Kirksey.

12
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.550
There we saw a gratuitous promise is not an enforceable contract because

13
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.860
contracts require consideration.
Moreover,

14
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.840
a detriment caused by the uh,

15
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.940
promises reliance on the promise does not itself constitute consideration if

16
00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:09.360
it's not bargained for.
In this case,

17
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.430
the Superior Steel Corporation determined to replace Langer,

18
00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:17.700
the plaintiff,
his foreman of one of its departments.

19
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.940
Langhart had worked for the company for over 30 years.

20
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.190
Langer received a letter from the company.

21
00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:28.191
The letter stated that the company would pay him a pension of $100 per month as

22
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:34.341
long as the plaintiff preserved his present attitude of loyalty to the company

23
00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:40.401
and its officers and was not employed in any competitive occupation.

24
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.840
The plaintiff did not go to work for a competitor and superior steel made the

25
00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:50.250
pension payments described in the letter around four years later,
however,

26
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:52.710
the company stopped making the payments.

27
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.450
So the plaintiff sued for enforcement of the terms of the letter.

28
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.100
The trial court found in favor of the company on dimmer that sustaining

29
00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:05.250
questions of law the company had raised,
uh,

30
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:09.180
but the instant court reversed and remanded the case for a new trial.

31
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.140
The issue is this was the companies promise to pay supported by consideration.

32
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.760
Well,
by now we know that enforceable contract requires consideration.

33
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.180
How should a court determine whether there's consideration?

34
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.830
Kirksey did not offer much guidance on this and on this question it was just a

35
00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:32.550
three sentence opinion.
So let's compare some definitions.

36
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.190
The restatement of contracts first,

37
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.570
which was published the same year and indeed within the same week says the

38
00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:44.571
opinion issued in Langer defined consideration in section 75 as and action other

39
00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:50.940
than a promise or a forbearance or the creation,

40
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:55.941
modification or destruction of a legal relationship or return promise bargained

41
00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.150
for and given in exchange for the promise.
An interesting example,

42
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.330
it was a of consideration is given in the comments a promises be $500 when be

43
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:11.590
goes to college.
This can be understood in a couple of ways.

44
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:15.730
Say a mother really wants her rebellious teenage son to go to college,

45
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.170
but her son doesn't want to plan on doing so.
In that scenario,

46
00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:23.410
the mother's promise to pay is supported by consideration.

47
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.290
She's bargaining for the sun to go to college,

48
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.340
but what if a mother assumes her son is going to college and treats the

49
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:31.290
departure of her college?

50
00:03:31.291 --> 00:03:35.230
Is a kin to say an 18th birthday and occasion for celebration,

51
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:36.400
not for bargaining.

52
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.080
If the promise isn't made as an agreed exchange for our son's going to college,

53
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.860
but as a conditional gift payable on his departure.

54
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.650
This wouldn't be consideration for a promise.

55
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.980
The first restatements definition might seem counter to the result we saw in

56
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:54.604
Kirksey.

57
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.120
The plaintiff's abandoning her and her land and moving to her brother in law's

58
00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:00.370
seemed at first to fit it,

59
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.710
but comments see to this section states in part that quote the fact that the

60
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:10.480
promise he relies on the promise to his injury or the promise or gain some

61
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:14.860
advantage there from does not establish consideration without the element of

62
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:16.840
bargain or agreed exchange.

63
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.440
Now consider section 71 of the restatement of contracts second published in 1981

64
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.220
it states that to constitute consideration of performance or return promise must

65
00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:30.520
be bargained for.

66
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.660
We've been emphasizing this before and the text then explains that to be

67
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:39.661
bargained for a performance or return promise is have must be sought by the

68
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:45.211
promise or in exchange for his promise and is given by the promise in exchange

69
00:04:45.521 --> 00:04:46.420
for that promise.

70
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.960
This is also referred to as the inducement requirement that one quid induces the

71
00:04:53.051 --> 00:04:57.370
quo and the CWO induces the quid comment.

72
00:04:57.371 --> 00:05:02.080
P B of this section further elaborates on bargaining,

73
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.900
noting that in the typical bargain,

74
00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:09.820
the consideration and the promise bear reciprocal relation of motive or

75
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:10.780
inducement,

76
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.140
that consideration induces the making of the promise and the promise induces the

77
00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:17.860
furnishing of the consideration.

78
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.780
But it's not enough that the promise induces the conduct of the promise.
See,

79
00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:27.040
or that the conduct of the promising induces the making the promise both

80
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:29.920
elements must be present or there is no bargain.

81
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.060
So says the comment to restatement second.
Now,

82
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.890
how did the court explained consideration in the Langer opinion?

83
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.241
Well,

84
00:05:40.241 --> 00:05:45.190
the court sided Wilson who wrote a famous treatise on contracts and it was a

85
00:05:45.191 --> 00:05:49.240
member of the committee creating the 1932 restatement of contracts.

86
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.940
Willison offered a helpful,

87
00:05:50.941 --> 00:05:55.941
although not conclusive tests for determining whether a condition included in an

88
00:05:56.291 --> 00:06:01.100
offer constituted consideration for the offer or was quote,

89
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.280
a mirror condition in a gratuitous promise unquote,

90
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.470
if the currents of the condition would benefit the promise or it could be fairly

91
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:14.030
inferred that the currents of the condition was requested as consideration.

92
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.350
In other words,

93
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.560
the fact that the condition would benefit the promise promise or suggest that

94
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:24.620
the promised or his promise was meant to induce the promises,

95
00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:29.480
conduct applying this test to the condition and superior steel,

96
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.990
uh,
uh,
uh,
that Langer quote,

97
00:06:32.991 --> 00:06:37.991
preserve his attitude of loyalty to the company and its officers and not be

98
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:41.540
employed in any competitive co,
uh,
occupation.

99
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.840
The court found that this would benefit the company and so suggested that it

100
00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:50.990
constituted sufficient consideration.
Now,

101
00:06:50.991 --> 00:06:54.020
let's consider by contrast,
Kirksey versus Kirksey,

102
00:06:54.021 --> 00:06:57.980
which the court distinguished from langurs case.
Remember that in Kirksey,

103
00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.450
a widow received a letter like in Langer,
uh,

104
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.510
but this time from her late husband's brother advising there to sell our land

105
00:07:05.511 --> 00:07:08.600
and telling her that if she came to where he lived,

106
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:12.320
he would put her up in a home and let her have a place to raise her children

107
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.580
because,
uh,
he wanted her and her children to do well.

108
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.230
The widow did move and abandoned her land and her brother-in-law put her up for

109
00:07:21.231 --> 00:07:21.981
a couple of years,

110
00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:26.440
but afterward requested her to leave the three Supreme Court of Alabama to

111
00:07:26.441 --> 00:07:30.830
determine that there was no consideration and that the defendant's offer was a

112
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:32.810
mere gratuitous promise.

113
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.250
Would the condition and the brother in law's offer survive?

114
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.030
Willis [inaudible] benefit test?
Well,
no,

115
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:46.570
the Kirksey court found it hard to see how the brother in law was benefited by

116
00:07:46.761 --> 00:07:49.220
her coming to live where he lived.

117
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.520
But if you go back to the module we just had on Kirksey versus Kirksey,

118
00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.350
there is new history that suggests that maybe it could have even survived the

119
00:08:00.351 --> 00:08:02.510
benefit test that Willis didn't propose,

120
00:08:02.511 --> 00:08:06.920
that maybe there was actually a hidden benefit.
Uh,
uh,
uh,

121
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:11.360
for this brother in law,
in having her move to his land.

122
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:17.050
But another way of thinking about a inducement is to ask whether the parties

123
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:20.630
contemplated mutuality of obligation.

124
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:26.030
That is whether they believe both parties were going to be bound to perform

125
00:08:26.031 --> 00:08:27.260
their obligations.

126
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.300
If Langer believed he was obligated to refrain from what he otherwise could do

127
00:08:32.301 --> 00:08:34.040
work for a competitor company,

128
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:39.200
then we might infer that there was a bargain for exchange and not merely a

129
00:08:39.201 --> 00:08:43.040
conditional gift.
If I say to you,
I'll give you my old coat.

130
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:47.420
If you come to buy my house to pick it up and you say,
okay,

131
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:51.800
neither of us thinks that you'll be in breach of contract if you fail to come by

132
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:52.940
and pick it up.

133
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:57.240
But the parties might have believed that Langer would be in breach if he went to

134
00:08:57.241 --> 00:08:58.890
work for a competitor.

135
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.710
Though the court found that the companies promise was supported by consideration

136
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.350
so as to create an enforceable contract.

137
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:12.360
The court proposed alternative reasoning by which to enforce the steel companies

138
00:09:12.361 --> 00:09:15.660
promise.
This was the theory of promissory Estoppel,

139
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.930
which we discussed earlier in rickets versus thorn.

140
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:24.210
A case which the Langer court cited as well.
In addition to siting records,

141
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.920
the court quoted section 90 of the first restatement of contracts which said a

142
00:09:28.921 --> 00:09:33.000
promise which the promise or should reasonably expect to induce action or

143
00:09:33.001 --> 00:09:38.001
forbearance of a definite and substantial character on the part of the primacy

144
00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:43.330
in which does into such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be

145
00:09:43.861 --> 00:09:46.470
avoided only by enforcement of the promise.

146
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:51.750
Is the theory of promissory Estoppel and alternative convincing basis for

147
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.610
adverse for enforcing the terms of the steel companies letter?
Well,

148
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.680
probably yes.
Uh,

149
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:02.910
but remedy the remedy might be limited to what justice demands.

150
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:08.300
What about in Kirksey versus Kirksey with the logic of promissory Estoppel have

151
00:10:08.491 --> 00:10:12.210
made sense in that case?
Again,
the answer is yes,

152
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:17.160
but as we discussed in the earlier module,
it hadn't been developed then.

153
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:19.800
So what have we learned?

154
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.970
We see that even minor requested performance,

155
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
which includes refraining from doing something,

156
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.500
can constitute consideration whether the port performance is great,

157
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.120
uh,
is far less significant to question than whether the performance is bargained

158
00:10:36.121 --> 00:10:37.980
for.
We also learned,

159
00:10:37.981 --> 00:10:42.981
importantly that Wilson's benefit tests provides a useful means for evaluating

160
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:48.830
and identifying whether a good given condition was bargained for,

161
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:54.540
or merely a gratuitous condition.
Uh,
uh,
provision.

162
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:55.711
And finally,

163
00:10:55.711 --> 00:11:00.390
we saw that promissory Estoppel is a potential alternative grounds for

164
00:11:00.391 --> 00:11:01.020
enforcement.
