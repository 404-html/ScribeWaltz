00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.170
The next case delves into one of the most opaque sections of the uniform

2
00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:11.301
commercial code in is hung filled opinion in textile unlimited versus a BMH

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.281
judge.

4
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:19.281
Thomas of the ninth circuit had to grapple with the battle of the forms in which

5
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:24.861
two companies send each other form documents with incompatible terms and

6
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:27.570
conditions.
Uh,

7
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.830
the case involved textile unlimited,

8
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.950
a yarn distributor in California and a Bmh,

9
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.540
a yarn manufacturer in Georgia.

10
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.290
The two companies regularly did business with textile by new yarn from a BMH 38

11
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:51.420
times.
You can see some of textiles yarn here.

12
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.200
Each time textile sent a purchase order to a Bmh via a broker,

13
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.580
and then a BMH would send an invoice and a,

14
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.600
an order acknowledgement that contained an arbitration clause stating that any

15
00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:10.050
dispute would have to be arbitrated.

16
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.440
Back in Atlanta on the 39th order textile received what it claimed was defective

17
00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:19.170
yarn.

18
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.170
And so it refuse to pay a BMH set up an arbitration in Atlanta,

19
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.110
but textile sued in federal court in California to prevent are the arbitration

20
00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:31.680
from going forward.

21
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.140
We're looking at the opinion from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

22
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.210
The federal appeals court that covers California and other western states.

23
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.690
Judge Thomas must decide whether the arbitration clause is enforceable even if

24
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:52.050
textile unlimited never explicitly agreed to it.

25
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.240
Let's walk through the key sections of the uniform commercial code a section two

26
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.230
two oh seven to see how judge Thomas reaches his conclusion that the arbitration

27
00:02:07.891 --> 00:02:12.891
clause is not enforceable because it's not part of the contract between the two

28
00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:13.944
parties.

29
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.060
Subsection one deals with the basic question of whether there's a contract in

30
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.620
the these battle of the form context where two companies are sending back and

31
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:31.350
forth forms with conflicting terms.

32
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.340
When confronting a two two oh seven question,

33
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.400
it's important to separately address different routes to whether a contract is

34
00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:42.840
formed and separately.

35
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.750
What are the terms of the contract if it is formed?

36
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.440
Two Two oh seven lays out different ways of forming the contract and different

37
00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:55.530
ways can produce different terms.

38
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.030
Section one first tells us that an expression of acceptance can operate as an

39
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:08.311
acceptance even if that expression states terms that are additional to or

40
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:11.920
different from those that are offered.

41
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.580
That by itself tells us that the UCC rejects the common laws mirror image rule

42
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.720
in the Minneapolis and St Louis Railway case,

43
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.170
when the offeree made an expression of acceptance that stated different terms,

44
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.830
the expression was considered a counteroffer,
not an acceptance,

45
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.050
but two two,
Oh oh seven,

46
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:40.051
one tells us that non-matching acceptances can operate.

47
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.490
They do operate as acceptances and therefore can form contracts.

48
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.240
Second subsection one says that a Ritter written confirmation of an earlier oral

49
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.560
agreement can also operate as an acceptance even if the confirmation states

50
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:00.670
different terms.

51
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.060
So if a buyer and seller agree orally to a big order on the telephone and then

52
00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:12.010
one sends a written confirmation in part to satisfy the statute of frauds,

53
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.490
the confirmation can operate as an acceptance even if this confirmation includes

54
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:20.620
different or additional terms.

55
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.930
But subsection one also includes the,
uh,

56
00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:28.120
the famous unless clause,

57
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.130
which tells us that the two ways of creating a contract,

58
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.680
the non-matching acceptance route.

59
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.920
And the non-matching confirmation route that these two routes are not effective.

60
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.830
If acceptance is expressly made conditional on a scent to additional or

61
00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:49.210
different terms.

62
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.470
The unless question boils down to whether the offer reis form says that the

63
00:04:57.101 --> 00:05:02.101
acceptance is conditional on the offer awards accepting the uh,

64
00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:04.360
the new or additional terms.

65
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.900
If that's the case then the writing does not operate as an acceptance but

66
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.940
operates merely as a counteroffer.
In this case,

67
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.690
a Bmh,
the offeree,
uh,

68
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.840
had a form that is quite explicit sellers willingness to sell yarn to you is

69
00:05:25.631 --> 00:05:29.110
conditioned on your acceptance of these terms of sale.

70
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.710
So a BMH is forum expressedly triggers the unless clause there is therefore no

71
00:05:36.281 --> 00:05:39.430
contract based on two two,
Oh oh seven one.

72
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.650
It's interesting to note that in this context,
textile unlimited,

73
00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:49.651
his receipt of the yarn wasn't an acceptance of new terms as judge Thomas notes.

74
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.390
We don't want a rule where whoever sends the last form wins.

75
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:02.140
So if subsection one tells us that the contract has been entered into based on

76
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:03.050
the forms,

77
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.290
subsection two tells us what the actual contents of the contract are.

78
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.880
If it is formed under subsection one,

79
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:16.280
it doesn't apply in this case because there was no sub section one formation,

80
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.760
but it's worth familiarizing yourself with what the terms would be a under

81
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:23.420
subsection two.

82
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.670
The first sentence of subsection two tells us that additional terms are to be

83
00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:32.060
construed as proposals for additions to the contract.

84
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.020
Remember the contract was formed with non-matching terms,

85
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:41.021
but according to the first sentence of subsection to those new terms are not

86
00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:46.241
included in the contract but are an offer to modify a if the other side agrees

87
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:51.920
to this modification proposal.
The second sentence,
however,

88
00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:56.921
lays out a different treatment of contracts formed under subsection one that are

89
00:06:57.321 --> 00:07:00.740
between two merchants by default.

90
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.470
The new terms on the offer,

91
00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:08.471
reis form become part of the contract if the formation is between two merchants

92
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.750
except uh,
under three listed,
uh,
conditions.

93
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.400
Number one,

94
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.540
the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer.

95
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.280
Number two,
if the additional terms materially change the agreement.

96
00:07:25.281 --> 00:07:28.850
And number three,
if the other side,
uh,
objects.

97
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:34.760
In this case,
if there had been a contract formed under subsection one,

98
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:40.120
the arbitration clause would probably have been valid because the parties are

99
00:07:40.371 --> 00:07:45.371
merchants and textile textiles offered didn't express Li limit acceptance to its

100
00:07:46.551 --> 00:07:47.810
terms of the offer.

101
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:53.470
And crucially the court probably would find that the additional arbitration term

102
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.500
isn't a material alteration.
And finally,

103
00:07:57.501 --> 00:08:02.330
textile unlimited never objected to this arbitration clause.

104
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:08.230
Many times the question of whether non-matching terms between merchants come

105
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.990
into the contract is going to be governed by the Schicks Shakespearean question

106
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.300
to be or not to be.

107
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.840
Did the terms materially alter the agreement?

108
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:27.310
Subsection three of two two oh seven tells us what happens if there's no

109
00:08:28.431 --> 00:08:30.770
formation under subsection one,

110
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:35.930
but the parties conduct based on what they do.

111
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:40.880
Evidence is that they believed they were in a contract.

112
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:46.030
If the Parties Act as if there is a contract by shipping and accepting the

113
00:08:46.101 --> 00:08:47.520
goods,
uh,

114
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:52.940
so there can still be a contract based on their conduct.
And secondly,

115
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:58.150
it tells us what terms to apply when we're going to have formation via party

116
00:09:00.031 --> 00:09:00.864
conduct.

117
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.800
And that's those terms are going to be governed by what's called the knockout

118
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:08.460
doctrine.
So under the knockout doctrine,

119
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.640
we remove any terms on which the two companies forms do not agree and then

120
00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:19.161
supplement what what's left over with the default rules from the UCC as applied

121
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:21.840
to this case.

122
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:27.110
The arbitration agreement is not in both forms and so the it would be knocked

123
00:09:27.121 --> 00:09:28.980
out.
We strike it out.

124
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.990
It isn't part of the contract and and so the court will not enforce it.

125
00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:35.450
Uh,

126
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:40.450
sub section three provides both a third route to non-matching formation and a

127
00:09:41.771 --> 00:09:46.080
knockout rule for determining what terms will be in the contract.

128
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:51.180
Subjects in three is important because in a classic battle of the forms,

129
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:56.390
there will not be subsection one formation because the forms will always demand

130
00:09:56.971 --> 00:10:00.600
additional assent.
So the head,
unless clause will be triggered.

131
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:06.290
The drafters of two two oh seven hoped that the knockout rule would put a thumb

132
00:10:07.051 --> 00:10:12.051
on the scale in favor of the UCC defaults under the common laws mirror image

133
00:10:13.741 --> 00:10:14.400
rule.

134
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.400
The last form tended to win the battle of the forms you see under the mirror

135
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:20.364
image rule.

136
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:25.090
Each writing exchanged between the buyer and the seller failed to form a

137
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:27.510
contract because it was not a mirror image.

138
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:31.200
Each writing was therefore just a counter offer.

139
00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:36.410
The seller forms would often restrict warranties and the virus forms would not

140
00:10:36.601 --> 00:10:37.950
restrict the warranties.

141
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.950
Each non-matching form would merely be a counter offer.

142
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:47.190
The seller would normally then when the battle of the forms because the seller

143
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:52.191
would send the last form with its shipment and the buyer would be deemed to

144
00:10:52.711 --> 00:10:54.750
accept this last form,

145
00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.490
this last counter offer by taking physical possession of the goods.

146
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.760
So under the common law and the mirror image rule,

147
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.720
the seller's form restricting warranties would normally govern,
uh,

148
00:11:07.721 --> 00:11:11.460
the terms of the contract.
But subsection three,

149
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:16.580
sought to fix that by saying that when the conduct of the parties evidence the

150
00:11:16.741 --> 00:11:19.350
formation of a contract,
that the,

151
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:24.590
that conflicting terms drop out and the default warranties,
uh,

152
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.740
and other terms would govern,
uh,
whenever there was a disagreement.

153
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:35.930
So imagine this hypothetical ABC sends an order to x,

154
00:11:36.611 --> 00:11:38.760
Y,
Z to buy 100 widgets,

155
00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:42.120
Xyz sends an invoice and then the goods,

156
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:47.070
the invoice contains a provision saying only quote,

157
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.280
there will be no punitive damages based on this sale.

158
00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:54.940
ABC does not say anything.
The punitive damages provision,

159
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.840
the widgets turned out to be defective and ABC,
suse,

160
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:04.120
are they bound by the punitive damages provision?
Well,

161
00:12:04.121 --> 00:12:07.300
the answer is probably yes.
In this situation,

162
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.560
the term concerning,
uh,
uh,

163
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.640
the punitive damages is incorporated probably into the contract first.

164
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.620
We see that under subsection one,

165
00:12:20.621 --> 00:12:25.621
there is a contract because the non-matching invoice operates as an acceptance

166
00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:27.591
and x,

167
00:12:27.591 --> 00:12:32.591
Y Z's form doesn't condition it's acceptance on ABC's assent to additional

168
00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:36.790
terms.
So we have sub section one formation.

169
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.950
We then look to subsection two to find out what the terms of this formed

170
00:12:41.951 --> 00:12:45.640
contract are.
So under subsection two,

171
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:49.300
it says that the contracts between merchants,
which we have here,

172
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:54.550
the new terms become binding in London unless one of the three conditions apply.

173
00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.500
Well ABC didn't object and uh,

174
00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:02.730
and the court likely wouldn't find a material material alteration in this

175
00:13:03.641 --> 00:13:08.641
prohibition on punitive damages since we'll learn later on in the course or

176
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:14.020
actually in contracts to that punitive damages usually aren't allowed and and

177
00:13:14.021 --> 00:13:15.160
contract cases.

178
00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:19.420
So the new condition is likely to be found to be binding.

179
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:24.960
But the big fight,
again we'll be to be or not to be,

180
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.090
whether the provision was a material alteration.

181
00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:34.450
There are three main takeaways from this battle of forms discussion.

182
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.960
The first is that in transactions between merchants,

183
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:43.200
new terms on the he is form generally do become part of the contract unless the

184
00:13:43.961 --> 00:13:48.961
offer or objects or the Ma these new terms material or materially alter the

185
00:13:49.991 --> 00:13:50.824
agreement.

186
00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:55.090
And when the two parties don't ever come to agreement based on the forms,

187
00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:00.070
courts apply under subsection three of two two oh seven,
the knockout doctrine.

188
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:05.430
So the actual contract is any terms that appear on both forms together with the

189
00:14:05.621 --> 00:14:10.390
default rules from the UCC.
And finally,
when analyzing two,

190
00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:12.790
two oh seven separately,
uh,

191
00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:17.850
it's important that you separately analyze what terms govern from the question

192
00:14:18.461 --> 00:14:23.340
of whether a contract is formed by one of the three routes than non-matching

193
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.520
acceptance route.

194
00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:29.880
That non-matching confirmation route and the conduct of the parties route.
