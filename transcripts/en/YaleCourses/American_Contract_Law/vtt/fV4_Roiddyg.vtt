00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.110
We've spoken frequently in this course about promises and the conditions under

2
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:10.380
which promises are and are not enforceable.
Indeed,

3
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:14.430
we usually think of contract laws primarily concerning promises.

4
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.760
Today we're going to talk about related but slightly different concerns that are

5
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:22.680
also integral to contract law.

6
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.990
These are representations and warranties.
What's a representation?

7
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.420
Representation,
concerns,

8
00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:33.990
facts or circumstances related to propose transaction.

9
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.690
They are not the same as promises.

10
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.130
One helpful way to distinguish between the two is to remember that while

11
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:42.900
promises are forward looking,

12
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.910
representations generally involve past or present facts about the world.

13
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.080
Consider a potential agreement to sell a used car.

14
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.090
The seller's promise is that she will deliver the car.

15
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.100
She may make many factual representations about the car in the process.

16
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.120
She might say it is blue.
It has 50,000 miles on it.

17
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.300
It has a small dent on the rear door.

18
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.940
Those examples are all likely express representation.

19
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.420
The seller express Lee or explicitly and forms the buyer of those facts about

20
00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:25.470
the car.
But just as we saw with promises,

21
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.310
representations can be either expressed or implied.

22
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.580
Most sellers implicitly represent,
for instance,

23
00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:37.460
that they own the things they are selling and that those things are of

24
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.990
reasonable quality.
Moreover,

25
00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:44.991
it's possible for explicit promises to throw off implicit representations.

26
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.880
When I promised to deliver a car,

27
00:01:47.881 --> 00:01:52.881
I implicitly represent that I presently intend to perform that promise.

28
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.200
That's how the doctrine of promissory fraud as possible.
Conversely,

29
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.940
explicit representations can throw off implicit promises.

30
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.040
When I represent that my car was only driven to church on Sunday,

31
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.080
I implicitly promise or warrant that my representation is true.

32
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.860
Explicit promises or explicit representations can throw off a host of implicit

33
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.560
representations or promises and part of the task of being trained in contracts.

34
00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:28.980
Law is being able to hear these implicit utterances.

35
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.030
We can think of warranties on the other hand as a special kind of promise,

36
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.010
a warranty promises that a person's representations are true.

37
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.400
Judge learned hand explained in a second circuit case from 1946 metropolitan

38
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.870
coal versus Howard,

39
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.230
that a warranty quote amounts to a promise to indemnify the promising for any

40
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:59.931
loss if the fact warranted proves untrue for obviously the promise or cannot

41
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:05.870
control what does it already in the past.
In other words,

42
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.970
if a representation proves false,

43
00:03:07.971 --> 00:03:11.720
the party who made it has breached his or her warranty,

44
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.810
that all representations of fact are true.

45
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.680
The representation of fact in question.
However,

46
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.030
it must become a term of the contract in order for the warrantying party to be

47
00:03:23.031 --> 00:03:28.031
liable in some then a warranty is made by one party to another about existing or

48
00:03:29.361 --> 00:03:34.361
past facts that are knowable but not necessarily known and that become a term in

49
00:03:34.941 --> 00:03:37.550
the contract.
Now,
sadly,

50
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.730
people use the word warranty at times is the synonym for a Ford looking promise.

51
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.850
Hyundai has a warranty that it's transmission will not break for a hundred

52
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.350
thousand miles.
One get tried to fit this warranty.

53
00:03:51.351 --> 00:03:55.700
Talk into the traditional definition of learned hand and others saying that

54
00:03:55.701 --> 00:04:00.701
Hyundai has represented that it's selling the type of car that has a

55
00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:03.890
transmission that will last for a hundred thousand miles,

56
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.360
but it's easier to distinguish between warranties that promise that

57
00:04:08.361 --> 00:04:13.361
representations are true and warranties that promise that goods will not break a

58
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.920
in specified ways in the future.

59
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:18.690
<v 1>Okay.</v>

60
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.170
<v 0>Warranties are very important because they allocate risk.</v>

61
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.880
The party who makes a representation bears the risk that the representation made

62
00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:30.960
will prove quote not in accord with the facts unquote.

63
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.210
How does this allocation of risks compare to the mistake doctrines we've earlier

64
00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:38.400
discussed?
Well,

65
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.610
mistake doctrines tend to let sellers out of contracts where there are basic

66
00:04:43.891 --> 00:04:47.700
mistakes that increased the value of the thing traded.

67
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.970
Think of Sherwood v versus walkers and the mistake doctrines let buyers out of

68
00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:57.870
contracts where there are basic mistakes that decrease the value of the thing

69
00:04:57.871 --> 00:04:59.880
traded.
Think of the Lenawee case,

70
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.990
that is your lead out the buyer or the seller,

71
00:05:03.991 --> 00:05:08.370
unless a contract allocates the risk and to the other side,

72
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.730
a seller making a representation is one of the ways that the parties can

73
00:05:13.741 --> 00:05:16.650
allocate a risk to the seller or to the buyer.

74
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.430
<v 1>Okay.</v>

75
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.230
<v 0>Warranties unsurprisingly can also be express or implied.</v>

76
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.560
The UCC section two three 13 establishes three ways sellers of goods can create

77
00:05:30.941 --> 00:05:33.010
express warranties.
First,

78
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.320
any affirmation of fact the seller makes that relates to the goods being sold

79
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.140
and becomes part of the basis of the bargain,

80
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.940
creates an express warranty that the goods will conform to that affirmation.

81
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.553
Second,

82
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.510
any description of the goods that becomes part of the basis of the bargain

83
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.100
creates an express warranty that the goods will conform to that description.

84
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:58.880
And third,

85
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.590
any sample or a model of the goods which is made part of the basis of the

86
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:08.510
bargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the goods will conform to

87
00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:10.130
the sample or to the model.

88
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.640
The UCC emphasizes further that sellers do not have to specifically intend to

89
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:21.011
make a warranty or need use or need use words like warranty or guarantee in

90
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:26.060
order to create an express warranty.
Indeed,

91
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:31.040
because any agreement must involve some minimum description of the goods being

92
00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:35.450
transacted in,
in order to be specific enough to be enforceable.

93
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.610
Every contract will necessarily entail some express warranty.

94
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.550
If you're trying to have a contract to buy a bicycle,
it's very hard to have it,

95
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:46.400
uh,

96
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.320
not make at least a description that what is being purchased is a bicycle.

97
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.920
But the UCC section two,

98
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:59.921
three 13 also specifies certain statements that don't create express warranties,

99
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:05.360
affirmations of the value of the goods or statements that only purport to be the

100
00:07:05.361 --> 00:07:08.360
seller's opinion or commendation of the goods.

101
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.820
These statements regarding opinion or commendation or an effect just puffing,

102
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:19.420
but I find it annoyingly ambiguous that the UCC provision says that quote,

103
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:25.390
an affirmation merely of the value of the goods unquote does not create an

104
00:07:25.431 --> 00:07:30.431
express warranty and affirmation about the value of the goods to my mind is not

105
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.940
mere.
It seems to go to the central basis of the bargain.

106
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:40.300
If the seller says that a baseball card has a market value of $45 that should

107
00:07:40.971 --> 00:07:45.971
create an express warranty because market value is falsifiable.

108
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:52.330
Even saying that a baseball card has a value of $45 should to my mind,

109
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:58.310
create an express warranty that would be violated if the market value is

110
00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:02.480
substantially lower.
Saying that a painting has a high value,

111
00:08:02.481 --> 00:08:05.150
on the other hand might be mere puffing.

112
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:10.490
The section doesn't distinguish between these different scenarios.
Luckily,

113
00:08:10.491 --> 00:08:15.200
comment eight to the section says that with regard to false statements of value

114
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.250
quote,

115
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:21.250
the possibility is left open that a remedy may be provided by the law relating

116
00:08:21.471 --> 00:08:23.360
to fraud or misrepresentation.

117
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:29.030
The UCC also establishes in three separate provisions,

118
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.870
three important implied or default warranties.

119
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:34.400
The first of these,

120
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.630
section two three 12 is the implied warranty of title,

121
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.370
which applies to all sales.

122
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:45.790
The second of these two three 14 is the implied warranty of merchantability

123
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.560
which applies only to merchants.

124
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:53.890
This provision states that in a contract for the sale of goods the seller as if

125
00:08:54.441 --> 00:08:56.010
a merchant impliedly

126
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:01.010
warrants those goods will be merchantable with respect to the goods of that

127
00:09:01.651 --> 00:09:02.484
kind.

128
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:07.050
The core meaning of merchantability is basically that the goods are fit for the

129
00:09:07.051 --> 00:09:10.200
ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.

130
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:16.580
The third of these default warranties is section two three 15 and it's the

131
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:20.850
implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.

132
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:25.890
This comes up with buyers who disclose that they need goods for our particular

133
00:09:25.891 --> 00:09:26.724
purpose.

134
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:31.230
That particular purpose is distinct from the ordinary purpose we just mentioned.

135
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:32.880
With respect to merchantability,

136
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:38.330
it concerns a specific use by the buyer that is peculiar to the nature of the

137
00:09:38.671 --> 00:09:43.590
buyer's business or use of the goods and not just the ordinary use of the goods.

138
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:48.840
Section two three 15 explains that there is an implied warranty.

139
00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:53.760
The goods will be fit for that particular purpose where the seller at the time

140
00:09:53.761 --> 00:09:58.050
of contracting has reason to know any particular purpose for which the goods are

141
00:09:58.051 --> 00:10:03.051
required and that buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select

142
00:10:03.391 --> 00:10:08.391
or furnish suitable goods to three 15 is another circumstance we're making a

143
00:10:09.661 --> 00:10:14.250
representation may impose duties on the other contractor.

144
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:19.320
We already discussed how making a representation may create a duty on the other

145
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:24.321
contractor to correct your mistake but with section two three 15 making a

146
00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:30.591
representation as to why you require a good can create a duty on skilled sellers

147
00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:34.680
at least to provide goods that conform to that requirement.

148
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.880
These three provisions are default rules.

149
00:10:38.881 --> 00:10:41.880
Parties can contract around them if they wish,

150
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:47.210
but the UCC in section two three 16 also lays out altering rules.

151
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:53.750
The second order legal rules regulating the ways in which parties can disclaim

152
00:10:54.691 --> 00:10:59.400
or limit the warranties or remedies for breach of these warranties.

153
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.440
Subsection two for instance,

154
00:11:01.441 --> 00:11:06.210
says that in order to exclude or modified the implied warranty of

155
00:11:06.211 --> 00:11:07.200
merchantability,

156
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:11.520
the contractual language must mention merchantability.

157
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.890
And in the case of a writing,
it must be a conspicuous statement.

158
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.720
Similarly to exclude or modified the implied warranty of fitness for a

159
00:11:21.721 --> 00:11:22.890
particular purpose.

160
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:27.420
The exclusion must be a writing and be conspicuous.

161
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:33.140
But subsection two is subject to set to subsection three which states more

162
00:11:33.331 --> 00:11:38.331
broadly that all implied warranties can be excluded by expressions such as,

163
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:44.330
as is or with all faults or other language which in common understanding calls

164
00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:49.590
the buyer's attention to the exclusion of warranties and makes plain that there

165
00:11:49.591 --> 00:11:51.900
is no implied warranty.

166
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:57.530
So even subsection two says that waiver of the warranty of merchantability must

167
00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:03.301
mention merchantability subsection three says mentioned that such mentions of

168
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:08.461
merchant ability are not necessary if the contract includes as is or a similar,

169
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:14.770
uh,
waiver language further and in and importantly,

170
00:12:14.771 --> 00:12:19.480
the UCC denies buyer's protection of implied warranties.

171
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:24.690
If goods have defects about which the buyer knew or should have known quote when

172
00:12:26.801 --> 00:12:31.801
the buyer before entering into the contract has examined the goods or the sample

173
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:37.260
or model as fully as he desired or has refused to examine the goods.

174
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:42.720
There is no implied warranty with regard to defects which an examination art in

175
00:12:43.031 --> 00:12:45.040
the circumstances to have revealed to him.

176
00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:50.880
You probably noticed warranty provisions in the agreements for purchases you've

177
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:55.150
made for hard goods like your computer or smartphone.

178
00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:00.600
These clauses and become quite standard across the various industries that they,

179
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:06.450
these clauses generally disclaim implied warranties and expressly warrant the

180
00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:11.050
goods against defects in material and workmanship.
Further,

181
00:13:11.051 --> 00:13:16.051
they usually limit the remedies for breach of the warranties to just repairing

182
00:13:16.541 --> 00:13:17.980
or replacing the product.

183
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:23.310
That is that they promised to either repair the defective good or replace the

184
00:13:24.431 --> 00:13:27.250
defective parts and also they,

185
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.020
these provisions tend to set a limit on the amount of time in which claims under

186
00:13:32.021 --> 00:13:37.021
the warranties can be made and they exclude liability for a contractual damages.

187
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:45.300
But the capacity of companies to contract around liability in this manner is at

188
00:13:45.941 --> 00:13:48.610
least a little circumscribed.

189
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.830
Imagine you purchase a product that uh,

190
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:54.760
uh,

191
00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:59.760
it becomes defective and after several attempts by the manufacturer to repair or

192
00:14:01.781 --> 00:14:02.614
replace,

193
00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:07.360
the product still doesn't work even though the agreement for the product states

194
00:14:07.361 --> 00:14:12.361
that your remedies are limited to repair or replacement of defective parts,

195
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:17.940
the UCC section two 719 provides that when a remedy quote fails,

196
00:14:19.721 --> 00:14:24.640
if it's essential purpose unquote a buyer may seek damages for the defective

197
00:14:24.641 --> 00:14:27.850
product using the default,
uh,

198
00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.010
remedies of the UCC.

199
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:35.370
So if you attempt attempt to repair and replacement time and time again and it

200
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:40.570
continues to fail to put the product back into working condition,

201
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.990
you might be able to recover full UCC damages.

202
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.360
So what have we learned?

203
00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:51.840
We've learned about the important role of representations of fact and contract

204
00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:56.891
law and we won't forget that representations of fact are distinct from promises.

205
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:03.220
We've learned that representation and contracts throw off implied warranties and

206
00:15:04.041 --> 00:15:08.060
that because all contracts must contain some representations,

207
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.650
all contracts entail some kinds of at least implied warranties.

208
00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:17.360
We've learned these warranties allocate risk to the representing party,

209
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:21.950
and so sellers can be liable when their representations turned out to be false.

210
00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.780
We talked about the express warranties and implied warranties that the UCC sets

211
00:15:26.781 --> 00:15:29.930
out and about.
The UCC is altering rules,

212
00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:35.140
the provisions that limit the ways to contract around those default rules.
