00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.190
We've talked at length in this course about contractual breaches.
Indeed,

2
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:10.020
the majority of the cases we've discussed thus far have involved a breach of a

3
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.030
or a claim of breach.

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.290
Today we're going to continue our discussion of anticipatory breach.

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.360
Will do so by examining,

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.840
examining a colorful case decided by the Supreme Court of California in 1975

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.500
Taylor versus Johnston h be Taylor and his wife bred,

8
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:34.470
raised and raced thoroughbred horses in Los Angeles.

9
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.950
Two of those horses were mayors named Sunday slippers and sandy fork,

10
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.010
Elizabeth and Elwood Johnston operated old English Rancho,

11
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.610
a well known horse farm that provided stallion stud services.

12
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.040
The the plaintiffs sought to have Sunday slippers and sandy fork breed with the

13
00:00:57.511 --> 00:01:00.900
Johnston stallion fleet ness ruler.

14
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.950
In January of 1965 the Taylors and the Johnston's entered into two contracts,

15
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.970
one for each mayor providing that fleet to nus.

16
00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:15.971
Roula would perform breeding services in the year 1966 for $3,500 if the mayor

17
00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:20.790
has failed to produce a life full,

18
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.710
a return breeding would be provided the following year at no additional cost.

19
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.180
However,
in October of 1965,

20
00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:33.180
the Johnston sold the stallion to two men,

21
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.330
ag Pesan and Leslie Combs,

22
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.360
the second horse breeders at spend thrift farm in Kentucky for $1 million.

23
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.870
On the day of the sale.

24
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.380
The Johnston's wrote to the tailor's advising them of the sale and telling them

25
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.130
they were released from their reservations for the stallion.

26
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.730
That letter seemed to have been a backhanded way of the Johnston's telling the

27
00:01:58.741 --> 00:02:03.390
tailors that the Johnston's weren't going to perform their promises to provide

28
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:04.410
stud services.

29
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.330
After the Taylor's attorney wrote back demanding performance and threatening

30
00:02:09.331 --> 00:02:11.940
suit,
the Johnston's ex,
uh,

31
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.720
changed their tune and they explained that they had made arrangements with the

32
00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:19.550
new owners to breed the tailors mayor to fleet Nass.

33
00:02:19.551 --> 00:02:22.480
Roula in Kentucky,
Sunday,
uh,

34
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.650
slippers and sandy fork were subsequently shipped to a farm in Kentucky awaiting

35
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.340
the opportunity to breed
pressing and combs.

36
00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:33.840
Upon purchasing fleet,

37
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.880
Nasrullah had sold various individuals shares that entitled the holders to breed

38
00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:42.330
one mayor each season to the Sallian.

39
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.890
Mayor's could only breed during a five day period when they were in heat.

40
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.190
These periods occurred every three weeks at several breeding opportunities.

41
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:56.430
The tailors representative in Kentucky attempted to book breedings,

42
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.280
but each time fleet nus Roulo was already booked.

43
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.030
Eventually both Sunday slippers and Sandy Hook.

44
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.320
We're bred to a former Kentucky Derby winner.
Chateaugay.

45
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.960
Both mayors became pregnant,

46
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.350
but with twins undesirable for thoroughbred racing.

47
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.091
Because of this,

48
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:20.560
the tailors did not have to pay the fee for that stallion services.

49
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.450
The is ultimately sued the Johnston's for breach of contract.

50
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.540
The Johnston's cross complained for stud fees,

51
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.210
the California Supreme Court,

52
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:35.140
and explained that because no actual breach could take place until the time

53
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:39.730
specified for performance at arrived and because the mayor has had been bred to

54
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:43.150
another horse before,
the time from the contractual term had ended,

55
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.340
there had been no actual breach of contract.
By contrast,

56
00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:53.200
anticipatory breach occurs when a party to a contract or Puty eight's the

57
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:58.201
contract in advance of performance being do and express repudiation is a quote,

58
00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:00.760
clear positive,

59
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.790
unequivocal refusal to perform unquote and implied repudiation results from

60
00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:12.001
conduct where the promise or puts it out of his power to perform so as to make

61
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:15.190
substantial performance of this promise impossible.

62
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.910
This parallels the two forms of repudiation we discussed in section two 50 of

63
00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:23.050
the second restatement of contracts.

64
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.680
The trial court had found anticipatory breach by selling fleet us rule love.

65
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:33.460
The Johnston said quote,
put it out of their power to perform properly.

66
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:38.320
Their contracts unquote further the conduct of the Johnson's and the Kentucky

67
00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:42.910
breeders to whom they'd sold pleat.
Nasrullah constituted repudiation,

68
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.870
but this court,
the supreme court disagreed.

69
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.250
It explained that when a party repudiates the other party has options,

70
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.490
she can treat repudiation as anticipatory breach and seek damages immediately or

71
00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.001
she can treat.

72
00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:03.001
The contract is still in force until the time of performance arrives and if

73
00:05:03.881 --> 00:05:06.610
actual breach occurs,
seek remedy then,

74
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.520
but if the party does the ladder quote,

75
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.570
the repudiation is nullified and the injured party is left with his remedies.

76
00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:20.350
If any in vocable at the time of performance unquote,

77
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.010
we might think of a repudiation as analogous to an offer to cancel that the

78
00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:31.441
promise he can either accept or reject or that they offer or can retract.

79
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.753
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

80
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.570
<v 0>Can you identify specific moments when the tailors repudiated the agreement</v>

81
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.730
based on the facts that you've learned?

82
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.610
<v 1>Okay.</v>

83
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.170
<v 0>Well,
looking at the facts,</v>

84
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.000
the court found two distinct potential repudiation.
First,

85
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.590
when the defendants pen their letter to the plaintiff after selling fleet

86
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.690
Nasrullah and second,

87
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.840
by virtue of the defendant's failure to provide a breeding opportunity for the

88
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:04.130
mayors to the stallion,
the court determined that the ladder,

89
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.910
that the letter was an express repudiation,

90
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.420
but that because the Taylors had responded by demanding performance electing not

91
00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:17.120
to treat the repudiation as anticipatory breach,

92
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.400
they know modified that repudiation.

93
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.630
It's as if they had by rejecting the offer,

94
00:06:23.631 --> 00:06:28.220
blown up the offer to cancel the contract.
Next,

95
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.690
examining the defendant's conduct.
Once the mayors were shipped to Kentucky,

96
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.490
the court denied that a second repudiation ever took place.

97
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.830
There had been no express repudiation because neither the Johnston's nor their

98
00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:45.260
agents said they would not perform,

99
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.170
nor was there an implied repudiation.

100
00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:52.130
The defendants never put it out of their power to perform the contracts.

101
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:57.080
They merely postpone the time of performance those postponements and never went

102
00:06:57.081 --> 00:06:58.850
beyond the terms of the contract.

103
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.240
There was thus no anticipatory breach and the court reversed as we studied in

104
00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:08.060
the last class.

105
00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:13.061
Restatement section two 50 defines repudiation in terms similar to those used by

106
00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:19.001
the California Supreme Court of Repudiation is a statement by the obligation war

107
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.300
to the obligation indicating that the obligation will commit a breach.

108
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:28.510
That of itself give the obligate a claim for damages for total breech or be a

109
00:07:31.521 --> 00:07:36.020
voluntary affirmative act which renders the obligation unable or apparently

110
00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:41.021
unable to perform without such a breach comment be to this section explains that

111
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:44.720
to constitute a repudiation quote,

112
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:49.750
a party's language must be sufficiently positive to be reasonably interpreted to

113
00:07:50.181 --> 00:07:54.920
mean that the party will not or cannot perform language that under a fair

114
00:07:54.921 --> 00:07:59.921
reading amounts to a statement of intention not to perform except on conditions

115
00:08:00.551 --> 00:08:05.551
with which go beyond the contract that constitutes a repudiation.

116
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:12.190
We see in Taylor that the letter the Johnston's wrote upon sale of fleet nus

117
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:17.550
ruler is a statement by the [inaudible] that falls into section two 58 this is

118
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.550
equivalent of express repudiation.

119
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:28.190
Did the defendant's commit any voluntary affirmative act that would render them

120
00:08:28.191 --> 00:08:32.930
unable or apparently unable to perform without a breach?
Well,
probably not.

121
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:37.920
It may have been the case that fleet Nasrullah was booked every time the tail

122
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.610
representative tried to range a breeding appointment,

123
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.510
but it's not at all evidence that the defendants were unable or apparently

124
00:08:44.511 --> 00:08:45.590
unable to perform.

125
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:52.150
The UCC section two six 10 similarly treats anticipatory repudiation as a

126
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:58.410
promises offered to cancel the contract that the promise he can quote for a

127
00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:03.711
commercially reasonable time await performance by the repudiating party or

128
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.020
resort to any remedy for breach even though he's notified the repudiating party

129
00:09:10.021 --> 00:09:15.021
that he would await the ladders performance and is urged retraction and in

130
00:09:15.091 --> 00:09:17.580
either case suspend his own performance.

131
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.480
One way that the UCC prods buyers not to wait too long before deciding whether

132
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:30.080
to accept a seller's offered repudiation is that the market measure of damages

133
00:09:30.631 --> 00:09:35.631
is limited under UCC section two seven 13 to the difference between the market

134
00:09:37.051 --> 00:09:41.370
price when the buyer learned of the breach and the contract price.

135
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.300
If a buyer waits longer than is commercially reasonable,

136
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.260
when the seller is jumping up and down telling the buyer that the seller is not

137
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:50.250
going to perform,

138
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:55.550
then the buyer might get less than full compensatory damages because the court

139
00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:01.040
may find that the buyer learned of the breach either earlier before arise in the

140
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:03.330
market price.

141
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.460
So what have we learned from Taylor versus Johnston?

142
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:13.940
The case provided us a clear overview of the concept of anticipatory breach.

143
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:19.610
We learned what constitutes both expressed and implied repudiation and what

144
00:10:19.621 --> 00:10:23.850
options a party has if the other party to an agreement has repudiated the

145
00:10:23.851 --> 00:10:24.684
contract.

146
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:30.110
We learned that a repudiation can be seen as an offer to cancel,

147
00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:36.030
uh,
an agreement which can be rejected,
uh,
or,

148
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:39.210
uh,
retracted by the repudiating party.

149
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.350
We'll end this lesson with some historical trivia.

150
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.800
Fleet Ness Roula fleet rule is genealogical line went on to produce famous prize

151
00:10:51.601 --> 00:10:56.290
winning horses like the triple crown winner and Disney films.

152
00:10:56.291 --> 00:10:59.940
Subject secretary it,
it's not surprising.

153
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:03.000
Fleet Nasrallah was in such high demand.
