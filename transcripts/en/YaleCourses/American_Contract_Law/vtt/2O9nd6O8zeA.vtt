00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.020
Our next case comes from the Supreme Court of Minnesota in 1957 and deals with

2
00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:11.730
the role of advertising and forming the contract.
On Friday,

3
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.520
April 6th,

4
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.110
1956 the Great Minneapolis surplus store published an advertisement in the

5
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:22.350
newspaper,
very much like the one you see here.

6
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.180
It advertised Saturday 9:00 AM sharp,

7
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.600
three brand new fur coats worth to $1,000 first come first served $1 each.

8
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.810
Then the very next day Morris Lefkowitz went to the store,

9
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.650
was the first to present himself at the appropriate counter,

10
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.070
asked for the coat and indicated his readiness to pay the sales price of $1 but

11
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:51.780
the store refused to sell it to him.

12
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.170
Telling him that they had a house rule that the advertised offer applied only to

13
00:00:58.501 --> 00:00:59.334
women.

14
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.910
The following week on Friday the 13th the Great Minneapolis surplus store again

15
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:07.710
placed an ad in the newspaper.

16
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.280
This time advertising scarves and stoles in particular at advertised one black

17
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.420
Lapin stole beautiful worth $139 and 50 cents $1 first come first served.

18
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.470
Mr Luftwitz again went to the store again was the first to ask for the stole,

19
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.090
but they once again told him that they would not sell it to him and that he

20
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:37.890
already knew the house rule.

21
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.470
Lefkowitz then proceeded to sue the store for the value of the firs they refuse

22
00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:44.304
to sell him.

23
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.860
The court in this case face the question of whether there was a contract at all.

24
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.900
Lefkowitz argued that the advertisements constituted offers which he had then

25
00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:59.610
accepted by showing up at the Great Minneapolis surplus store at the appointed

26
00:01:59.611 --> 00:02:01.500
time and ready to pay a dollar.

27
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.690
The store on the other hand argued that the ads were just invitations for an

28
00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:11.230
offer,
uh,
and not offers themselves the store.

29
00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:15.240
His argument is equivalent to saying that the ads were soliciting offers from

30
00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:16.530
prospective customers.

31
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.960
Justice Murphy had to decide whether the advertisements in this case we're

32
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:26.400
offers that become binding contracts when Lefkowitz excepted them.

33
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.040
There are three different ways we can view advertisements.
First,
they could be,

34
00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:36.660
as Lefkowitz argues,
simply offers.
Once they are accepted,

35
00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:39.000
they become binding contracts.
Second,

36
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.030
they might instead be just notices that the seller plans to make offers at a

37
00:02:44.251 --> 00:02:47.910
particular time and place in the future or third,

38
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.240
they might be solicitations notices that the seller would like to receive offers

39
00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:56.250
from.
Interested buyers in general.

40
00:02:56.251 --> 00:03:01.090
Advertisements nowadays are usually interpreted belonged to categories two and

41
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:04.660
three.
Category One is rather exceptional.

42
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.010
The court lays out a rule for when advertisements constitute an offer saying

43
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:13.900
that where the offer is clear,

44
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.980
definite and explicit and leaves nothing open for negotiation,

45
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.630
it constitutes an offer acceptance of which will complete the contract.

46
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.160
That is if an ad specifies the exact exchange,

47
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.750
the terms that will take place and exactly what the buyer must do in order to

48
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:32.890
take advantage of it.

49
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.960
The ad is an offer and the buyer can enforce once he or she has accepted it.

50
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.520
Take note of something odd about this rule.

51
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.960
It seems to be intended to encourage definite contracting,
uh,

52
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.880
presumably to protect consumers from an,

53
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.360
from unscrupulous businesses.

54
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.310
But what would you do if you owned a store and you read this opinion?

55
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.630
You would make sure that all advertisements in the future,

56
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.280
we're indefinite enough that no one could enforce them against you in court.

57
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.760
Justice Murphy goes on to apply the rule to the two advertisements that

58
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:13.750
Lefkowitz saw.

59
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.530
He finds that the first advertisement for the coat was not an offer worth to

60
00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:23.770
$100 was not sufficiently definite good.

61
00:04:23.771 --> 00:04:28.771
A coat been worth 50 or $60 be relevant would it have to be exactly $100 but the

62
00:04:30.821 --> 00:04:35.690
second advertisement,
which exactly specified the value of the stall,

63
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.690
uh,
was definite enough.

64
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.740
And so Lefkowitz was able to receive expectation damages.

65
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.040
The $139 and 50 cent value of the stool minus the $1 he would had to pay for it.

66
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.430
Notice that Murphy's rule has a perverse likely consequence.

67
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.760
The reluctance of courts to enforce indefinite contracts seems to be intended to

68
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:06.001
encourage both parties to take more care to resolve ambiguities in there

69
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.840
drafting language.

70
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.290
But Justice Murphy's being unwilling to give legal effects to indefinite offers

71
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.330
might have the opposite effect.

72
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.130
What would you do if you owned a store the week after you read this opinion?

73
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.570
What kind of an ad would you place the next week?
Well,

74
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.550
you might make sure that all advertisements you issued from here on out,

75
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.580
we're indefinite enough by saying things like worth two x dollars so that no one

76
00:05:37.451 --> 00:05:39.490
could enforce them against you in court.

77
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.810
As for the house rule,

78
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.410
Justice Murphy deals with it quite quickly.

79
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.390
The restriction was not part of the original offer and quote.

80
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.380
While an advertiser has the right at any time before acceptance to modify his

81
00:05:57.381 --> 00:05:58.214
offer,

82
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.600
he does not have the right after acceptance to impose new or arbitrary

83
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:03.434
conditions.

84
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.840
Since the restriction to women wasn't part of the original newspaper Ad,

85
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:13.841
the store couldn't add it as an extra condition after Lefkowitz had successfully

86
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:15.320
accepted the offer.

87
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.910
Notice again how crucial timing is in this case,

88
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.460
if the store manager had called out,
we revoke the offer before I left,

89
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.470
Jeff Lefkowitz said anything or if a large sign on the outside of the store said

90
00:06:29.961 --> 00:06:34.010
we revoke our code offer,
then Lefkowitz might have lost.

91
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.170
Even with regard to the second ad.

92
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.540
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

93
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.250
<v 0>The court doesn't seem to care that Lefkowitz already knew about the house rule</v>

94
00:06:42.251 --> 00:06:46.930
when he came to the store the second time.
So with regard to the house rule,

95
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.730
there is a stronger case for not allowing Lefkowitz to accept the second offer.

96
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:57.210
Perhaps the court thought the store was engaging in deceptive bait and switch

97
00:06:57.431 --> 00:07:01.780
marketing tactics and wanting to find a way to penalize the score store,

98
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.910
believe it or not,

99
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.890
gender discrimination and contracting is actually legal in every state except

100
00:07:08.891 --> 00:07:12.910
California.
Unlike race discrimination and contracting,

101
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.980
which is prohibited under federal law,

102
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.340
federal law prohibits gender discrimination in contract late in contracting only

103
00:07:20.771 --> 00:07:25.771
in a handful of specific markets such as employment and housing.

104
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.920
California's Unruh Civil Rights Act does band gender discrimination in

105
00:07:32.531 --> 00:07:37.420
contracting along with dim miss discrimination on the basis of wide range of

106
00:07:37.421 --> 00:07:38.710
other characteristics.

107
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:44.250
Several states have now also prohibited sex discrimination with regard to public

108
00:07:44.501 --> 00:07:45.580
accommodations,

109
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.260
which increasingly encompasses a wide range of retail sales.

110
00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.480
<v 1>Okay.</v>

111
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.100
<v 0>Which of the following ads would,</v>

112
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.850
would justice Murphy be most likely to consider an offer?

113
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:07.450
Option d is the one that is most likely to be an offer because it specifies the

114
00:08:07.851 --> 00:08:10.940
exact value of the products on offer,

115
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
as well as how a buyer can accept by being among the first customers to arrive

116
00:08:16.941 --> 00:08:21.210
on the specify day.
From this case.

117
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:25.440
We have seen that advertisements are typically treated as solicitations for

118
00:08:25.441 --> 00:08:29.730
customers to make offers rather than as offers themselves.

119
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:35.330
But some courts do treat advertisements as offers when they are clear,

120
00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:39.420
definite and explicit,
and leave nothing open for negotiation.

121
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.070
And the court's view,
the Great Minneapolis surplus stores,

122
00:08:44.071 --> 00:08:47.370
second advertisement met these requirements.

123
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.540
<v 1>Okay.</v>
