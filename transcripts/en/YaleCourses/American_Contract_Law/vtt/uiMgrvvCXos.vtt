1
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.050
An offer that is unequivocally accepted,

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.100
creates a contract,
but what happens when an offer?

3
00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:12.120
He attempts to accept an offer while modifying the terms.

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.510
Today we consider that question and learn about the mirror image rule.

5
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.850
By looking at the 1886 case decided by the United States Supreme Court called

6
00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:29.361
Minneapolis and Saint Louis Railway Company versus Columbus Rolling Mill Company

7
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.540
in Minneapolis and Saint Louis Railway.
The plaintiff,
a railroad company,

8
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.320
sent a letter dated December 5th two the defendant,

9
00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:45.150
a manufacturer requesting price quotes for steel rails.

10
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.570
The letter asked for the prices for 500 to 3000 tons of steel rails and 2000 to

11
00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:56.160
5,000 tons of iron rails.

12
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.940
The defendant manufacturer replied on December 8th writing that it did not make

13
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:07.281
steel rails but would sell 2000 to 5,000 tons of iron rails for $54 per gross

14
00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:12.120
ton for cash.

15
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.840
On December 16th the railway company responded by telegram and followed up with

16
00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:23.811
a second letter to accept the manufacturer's off offer for 1200 tons of iron

17
00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:28.650
rails at the quoted price.

18
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.460
The manufacturer responded by telegram that he could not book the order at that

19
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:36.054
price.

20
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.270
The railway then sent a telegram accepting the offer to sell 2000 tons.

21
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.970
The manufacturer did not fill that order either and denied the existence of any

22
00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:48.804
contract.

23
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.240
The trial court found for the defendant manufacturer and the instant court

24
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.133
affirmed.

25
00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.300
So the central issue in this case is fairly straight forward.

26
00:02:00.301 --> 00:02:05.301
Was the defendant bound to honor the plaintiff's final acceptance of the offer

27
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:09.930
to sell 2000 tons of iron rails?

28
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.330
And the answer is no.

29
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.190
The court agreed with the defendant and held that no contract was formed.

30
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.910
The defendant offered to sell 2000 to 5,000 tons of iron rail to the plaintiff.

31
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.350
The plaintiff then attempted to accept the offer by ordering just 1200 tons,

32
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.670
an amount less than the 2000 ton minimum offered.

33
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.280
The court held that quote,

34
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.340
a proposal to accept or an acceptance upon terms varying from those offered is a

35
00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:50.181
rejection of the offer and puts an end to the negotiation unless the party who

36
00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:58.251
made the original offer renews it or a sense to the modification suggested since

37
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:04.981
the plaintiffs qualified acceptance varied the number of tons it was in law,

38
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.140
our rejection of the offer,

39
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.560
the plaintiff subsequent attempt to accept the defendant's offer to sell 2000

40
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:19.561
tons of iron rails was therefore unenforceable because as the court put it,

41
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.770
the other party having once rejected the offer cannot afterward revive it by

42
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:27.940
tendering and acceptance to it.

43
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.210
The holding in Minneapolis and Saint Louis Railways is really a classic example

44
00:03:35.211 --> 00:03:37.760
of the common law mirror image rule.

45
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.170
The mirror image rule operates with admirable simplicity.

46
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.750
Any response by an offeree,

47
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.440
which varies or adds to the terms of an offer,

48
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.650
is treated as a counteroffer.
In turn,

49
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.480
that counter offer terminates or blows up the original offer.

50
00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.220
Traditionally,

51
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.280
courts have insisted upon a total congruent between the offer and acceptance.

52
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:05.421
In other words,

53
00:04:05.421 --> 00:04:09.710
the acceptance must be the mirror image of the offer.

54
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.300
So here's a pop quiz.
Ben,

55
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.250
knowing Alex is looking to sell his car meets Alex at his home.

56
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.700
Alex offers to sell the car for $10,000 after kicking the tires a bit,

57
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.600
Ben Tells Alex,

58
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.630
I'll take the car with the new air freshener for $10,000 immediately after Ben

59
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.120
Finishes the sentence,
carry drives by,
leans out the window and shouts,

60
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.360
I'll take the car for $12,000 Alex then refuses to sell the car to Ben,

61
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.020
who is now willing to take the car as is without a new air freshener for $10,000

62
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.140
is Alex bound to sell the car to Ben?

63
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:55.783
<v 1>No.</v>

64
00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.040
<v 0>Ben's response that he would buy the car and a new air freshener vary the terms</v>

65
00:05:02.071 --> 00:05:06.420
of Alex's original offer.
Therefore,
under the mirror image rule,

66
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.520
it was not an acceptance.

67
00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:13.521
It was a counter offer and thus a rejection that terminated the original offer.

68
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.930
Under the mirror image rule,

69
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.670
even a nonmaterial variation like an air freshener can be fatal.

70
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.973
<v 1>Okay.</v>

71
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.060
<v 0>The assumption underlying the mirror image rule is that if the offeree</v>

72
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.220
introduces new or different terms,

73
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.410
the offeree does not assent to the offer and further negotiation is required.

74
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:39.070
It would be clearly impermissible for an offeree buyer to accept an offer while

75
00:05:41.211 --> 00:05:44.930
at the same time reducing the offer or a selling price,

76
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.920
but other less important terms are connected to the price.

77
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.700
Unilateral changes introduced by the offeree might change.

78
00:05:52.701 --> 00:05:55.310
The offer is costs or risk.

79
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.920
The offer might agree to changes,

80
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.050
but that should be the offer wars choice an offer he cannot pick and choose from

81
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:07.130
among the terms agreeing here and disagreeing there and then assert the

82
00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:11.060
existence of a mutual agreement.

83
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.710
However,
the mirror image rule has its downsides.

84
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.630
The mirror image rule makes it more difficult to create contracts because any

85
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:25.631
deviation by the offeree and restating the terms can destroy what otherwise

86
00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:29.300
would be a validly formed contract.

87
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.990
Accepting by restating terms of the offer is dangerous because if you miss state

88
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:39.830
any of the terms you not only don't accept but you,

89
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.120
you're misstatement blows up the original offer and your option to accept is

90
00:06:44.121 --> 00:06:44.954
gone.

91
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:50.170
That's why it's safer to accept by simply saying I accept or okay or done.

92
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.180
If a party wishes to negotiate a point,

93
00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:01.490
he does so at his own peril because doing so will terminate the original offer

94
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.090
or if the party seemingly reach an agreement,

95
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.010
but one party later discovers that the acceptance that the acceptance differs

96
00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:11.420
slightly from the offer.

97
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.750
The Mirror image rule provides that party with a route to withhold performance.

98
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:23.950
There are strong hints of the Mirror image rule in section 59 of the restatement

99
00:07:24.621 --> 00:07:29.621
second of contracts which as a reply to an offer which purports to accept it but

100
00:07:31.401 --> 00:07:36.401
is conditional on the offer or is sent to terms additional to or different from

101
00:07:37.191 --> 00:07:40.610
those offered is not an acceptance but as a counteroffer.

102
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.080
The restatement however is a little more forgiving than the common law mirror

103
00:07:45.081 --> 00:07:50.081
image rule under section 61 an offeree may request additional changes when she

104
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:52.700
accepts an offer.

105
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:57.910
Section 61 reads quote and acceptance which requests a change or addition to the

106
00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:04.241
terms of an offer is not thereby and validated unless the acceptance is made to

107
00:08:04.581 --> 00:08:08.420
depend on a sent to the changed or added terms.

108
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:14.560
So consider again the example above were Alex offers to sell his car to Ben for

109
00:08:15.801 --> 00:08:20.801
10,000 this time instead of insisting on a new Air Freshener,

110
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.200
Ben Tells Alex you have a deal and I'd appreciate it if you could throw in a new

111
00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:30.800
air freshener for good measure.
Under this scenario.

112
00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:35.801
Can Alex revoke is a offer after Carrie drives by and offers $12,000 for the

113
00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:38.300
car?
No.

114
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:43.600
Under section 61 of the restatement Ben is allowed to accept Alex his offer and

115
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.820
request a complimentary air fresher as long as this acceptance does not depend

116
00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:52.370
on Alex providing the air freshener here.

117
00:08:52.371 --> 00:08:56.250
Ben Explicitly accepted out cause his offer and did not seem to condition that

118
00:08:56.251 --> 00:08:59.850
acceptance,
uh,
on his request for a new air freshener

119
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:03.100
under the common law.

120
00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:08.130
The mirror image rule is a default rule which can be contracted around by either

121
00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.320
the offer or or the offeree,

122
00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:16.860
as described by section 39 sub part two of the restatement and offer.

123
00:09:18.321 --> 00:09:23.321
His power of acceptance is terminated by his making a counter offer unless the

124
00:09:25.031 --> 00:09:30.031
offer or has manifested a contrary intention or unless the counteroffer manifest

125
00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:34.240
and contrary intention of the offeree,

126
00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:40.170
in other words and offer or can specify that an offer is not terminated by a

127
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:46.690
counteroffer and an offeree can make a counteroffer without rejecting the

128
00:09:46.691 --> 00:09:47.680
original offer.

129
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:53.500
Section 39 is unusual because it creates what might be called the double sided

130
00:09:53.501 --> 00:09:54.370
default rule,

131
00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.640
which can be unilaterally altered by either the offer or or the offeree.

132
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.980
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

133
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.450
<v 0>Let's recap.
Today we discuss the mirror image rule,</v>

134
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:11.690
which says that an offeree cannot accept an offer while simultaneously and

135
00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:14.970
unilaterally changing the terms of the offer.

136
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:20.450
Introducing do terms creates a counteroffer and unless otherwise specified by

137
00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:26.220
either of the parties,
a counteroffer destroys the original offer.
