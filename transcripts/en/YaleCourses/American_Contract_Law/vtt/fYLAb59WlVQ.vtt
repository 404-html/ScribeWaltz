00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.141
Today,

2
00:00:01.141 --> 00:00:06.030
we're going to introduce the notion of impracticability in contracting.

3
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.070
We've early earlier discussed a host of formation defenses that are judged at

4
00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:13.080
the time of contract formation,

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.440
but impracticability is a post formation defense that can discharge contractual

6
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:22.290
duties for events occurring after a contract is formed.

7
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.890
To learn about impracticability doctrine,

8
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.760
we examine us versus Wedge hematic corporation.

9
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.030
A case decided by the second circuit in 1966 back in 1956 when computers were

10
00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:42.780
still relatively new,
immense mysterious technologies.

11
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.060
The Federal Reserve Bank invited companies to submit proposals for an electronic

12
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:52.440
digital computing system.
It's stressed and it's invitations.

13
00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:56.880
The need for early delivery.
What'd geomatic corporation,

14
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.720
which had recently produced a successful computing system,

15
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.960
the Al whack three e but which nevertheless was a relative newcomer to the

16
00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:09.480
industry submitted the winning proposal.

17
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.710
The Federal Reserve Bank and Wedge amatic agreed to a contract under the terms

18
00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:20.910
of which what,
what geomatic would deliver by June 30th,

19
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.330
1957 nine months hence a new computer model.

20
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.540
The Al Whack 800 where dramatic proclaimed this would be a truly revolutionary

21
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:36.030
system utilizing all of the latest technological advances.

22
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.780
The Federal Reserve Board agreed to pay $231,000 for the Al [inaudible] 800

23
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:44.760
additionally,

24
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.940
the contract provided that wedge dramatic would pay liquidated damages of $100

25
00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:55.281
per day for every day that delivery of the computer was delayed and that if

26
00:01:55.471 --> 00:01:59.430
wedge geomatic failed to comply with any provisions of the agreement,

27
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.790
the board may procure the services described in the contract from other sources

28
00:02:04.831 --> 00:02:08.850
and hold the contractor responsible for any excess costs.

29
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.880
Occasions thereby problems weren't long and coming in March a few a month before

30
00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:18.300
the delivery date.

31
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.710
What dramatic suggested postponing delivery the next month,

32
00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:26.610
the company wrote a letter to the board stating that due to the need for

33
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.640
redesign delivery would be delayed from June 30th until October 30th the letter

34
00:02:33.151 --> 00:02:36.780
also requested waiver of the liquidated damages clause.

35
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.170
The board took the requests under advisement on August 30th,

36
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.170
1957 wedge dramatic wrote to the board that delivery would be delayed possibly

37
00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:50.550
into 1959 unquote.

38
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.850
Well over a year hence and suggested use of it's al whack three e equipment

39
00:02:56.911 --> 00:03:01.911
until then and again requested waiver of the liquidated damages clause.

40
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.450
The board did not agree to the waiver.

41
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.870
The nail in the coffin came in October when wedge amatic informed the board that

42
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.430
due to engineering difficulties,

43
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.080
it has become impracticable to deliver the Alek 800 computing system.

44
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.980
At this time,

45
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.240
the board managed to secure another manufacturer and about a year after Wedge

46
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.940
Maddix announcement,

47
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.940
Ibm delivered to the board a computing system serving substantially the same

48
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:35.221
functions as wedge a Maddix proposed owl whack 800 the rental price for the IBM

49
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:41.311
system was $102,000 per year with an option to purchase the equipment for

50
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.670
$410,000 in accordance with the terms of their contract.

51
00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:52.000
The board sought damages from what dramatic a court awarded the board.

52
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:57.001
$46,300 for delay under the liquidated damages clause,

53
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.550
$179,000 for the excess cost of the IBM equipment and $10,000 for preperatory

54
00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:09.220
expenses that proved useless and operating the IBM system.

55
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.640
A total of more than $235,000 in damages plus interest when geomatics soul

56
00:04:17.531 --> 00:04:19.990
defense was impracticability.

57
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.350
It argued that delivery was made impossible by basic engineering difficulties

58
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.920
who's correction would have taken between one and two years and would have cost

59
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:34.810
between 1,000,001 and a half million dollars and the success of which was not

60
00:04:34.811 --> 00:04:37.240
certain in making this claim,

61
00:04:37.241 --> 00:04:42.241
the company relied on UCC section two six 15 that provision governing excuse by

62
00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:49.201
failure of presupposed conditions provides in part that except so far as a

63
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:55.351
seller may have assumed a greater obligation delay in delivery or nondelivery in

64
00:04:55.931 --> 00:05:00.910
whole or in part by a seller is not a breach of his duty under a contract for

65
00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:05.911
sale if performance as agreed has been made impracticable by the occurrence of

66
00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:08.620
the contingency,

67
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.910
the non occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was

68
00:05:12.911 --> 00:05:13.744
made.

69
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.160
The court in an opinion by the well known judge Henry friendly,

70
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.660
agreed that the UCC was the proper guidance to seek on the matter,

71
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.010
but denied that the engineering difficulties preventing wedge geomatic from

72
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:32.011
achieving its revolutionary computing breakthrough could constitute

73
00:05:32.021 --> 00:05:37.000
impracticability.
Specifically the court asserted quote,

74
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:42.001
we see no basis for thinking that when an electronic system is promoted by its

75
00:05:42.461 --> 00:05:45.580
manufacturer as a revolutionary breakthrough,

76
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.960
the risk of the revolutions occurrence falls on the purchaser.

77
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.290
The reasonable supposition is that it has already occurred or at least uh,

78
00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.390
the manufacturer is assuring the purchaser that it will be found to have have

79
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:02.360
when the machine is assembled.

80
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.800
The court explained the negative implications that would follow from the

81
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:07.820
defendant's argument.

82
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:13.060
Such a policy would allow manufacturers to express what are only aspirations in

83
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:18.200
order to induce agreements and gamble on mere probabilities of fulfillment

84
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.740
without any risk of liability.
Additionally,

85
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:26.600
the court believed that the contractual terms and language place the risk that

86
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:31.601
wedge amatic would be able to achieve its revolutionary breakthrough squarely on

87
00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:32.774
wedge dramatic.

88
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.050
It noted the provisions allowing for liquidated damages and providing that the

89
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.480
Federal Reserve Bank can look to other sources in case of nondelivery.

90
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.770
Judge friendly also decided that quote,

91
00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:50.390
if a manufacturer wishes to be relieved of the risk that what looks good on

92
00:06:50.391 --> 00:06:53.450
paper may not prove so good in in hardware,

93
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:58.780
the appropriate exculpatory language is well known and often used unquote.

94
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.950
So what is the exculpatory language?
Uh,
that the,
uh,

95
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.080
judge is referring to his claim that there exists an altering rule from the

96
00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:16.070
default rule that places risk on the seller and altering role that not only

97
00:07:16.071 --> 00:07:18.080
exists but it's often used.

98
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:23.530
Concern comes without any citation or support and legal scholars have not

99
00:07:24.741 --> 00:07:28.970
identified what the words the judge had in mind might be.

100
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:34.390
It's rather difficult indeed to imagine any parties conditioning a contract on

101
00:07:36.171 --> 00:07:41.060
the occurrence of a technological revolution,
much less doing so often.

102
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:46.310
One problem is that it's going to be very difficult for contractors to prove to

103
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.660
a court whether a technological revolution has occurred.

104
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.990
In the words of Gil Scott Heron.

105
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:59.530
The revolution will not be televised but judge friendly should at least be given

106
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:03.470
credit for seeing that the doctrine of impracticability,

107
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:08.630
like the mistake drop that we studied earlier are merely default that the

108
00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:11.120
parties should be able to contract around.

109
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:16.310
Indeed both the impracticability and the mistake doctrines can be seen as

110
00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:21.311
default conditions to every contractual promise unless otherwise agreed.

111
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.780
A promise to perform is conditioned on the party's not being mistaken at the

112
00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:31.781
time of formation as to a basic assumption and is also conditioned on the non

113
00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:37.790
occurrence of contingencies who's not occurrence was a basic assumption on which

114
00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:39.080
the contract was made.

115
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:45.370
What kinds of scenarios do you think the UCC contemplates in two six 15 as being

116
00:08:46.971 --> 00:08:51.860
the types of contingency who's not occurrence was a basic assumption on which

117
00:08:51.861 --> 00:08:55.680
the contract was made.
Well,

118
00:08:55.681 --> 00:09:00.681
one example of a successful claim under UCC to six 15 is red river commodities

119
00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:07.851
incorporated versus ides ness where the plaintiff sued EITs nest for breach

120
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:14.030
because he failed to deliver 250,000 pounds of sunflowers as required by the

121
00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:17.370
contract due to a drought.

122
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:22.400
I ness only produced 75,000 pounds because it provision in the contract,

123
00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:27.630
excuse the parties from performance if fire strikes accidents,

124
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:32.870
acts of God and public enemy or other causes beyond the control of the parties

125
00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:34.770
took place,

126
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:40.070
the court determined that non occurrence of a crop destroying drought was a

127
00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:44.520
basic assumption on which the contract was made and excused.

128
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:49.730
I'd snus performance based on UCC section two six 15 the court's reliance in Red

129
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:58.140
River commodities on the particulars of a contractual clause offering excuses

130
00:09:58.141 --> 00:10:00.030
for nonperformance is important.

131
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:05.460
Normally a contracting party will not be excused under the contract default

132
00:10:05.461 --> 00:10:09.630
clause or standard risk allocation clauses and less.

133
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.770
The clause provides for such an excuse.
By the way,

134
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:19.070
the act of the act of God clause has been sometimes defined as an an act of God

135
00:10:22.051 --> 00:10:24.720
is an act that no reasonable God would do.

136
00:10:24.721 --> 00:10:28.740
It's hurricanes and other weather misfortunes.

137
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:35.030
How does the UCC is impracticability provision compare to the mutual mistake

138
00:10:35.611 --> 00:10:37.980
doctrine we covered earlier in the course?

139
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:43.460
One important difference is that the UCC seems to contemplate circumstances that

140
00:10:43.531 --> 00:10:48.270
arise after the parties have already formed an agreement.
While a mutual mistake,

141
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:51.900
the mistake in assumption exist at the time the contract is formed.

142
00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.650
Notably the restatement has to in practice,

143
00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.680
but impracticability provisions section two six one which governs supervening

144
00:11:02.851 --> 00:11:07.851
impracticability and it closely mirrors the UCC is provision and then there's a

145
00:11:08.941 --> 00:11:13.941
second provision section two six six which concerns existing impracticability.

146
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.000
This provision is much closer to mutual mistake.

147
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:22.650
One difference is that under the existing impracticability provision,

148
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:27.330
no duty to perform a rises if the conditions are met while under the mutual

149
00:11:27.331 --> 00:11:31.980
mistake provision to duty arises,
which is voidable by one party,

150
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:35.610
but in both cases,
if the defense has properly invoked,

151
00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:39.030
there is no enforceable duty and the remedy is restitution.

152
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:44.520
Another difference is that the impracticability provision doesn't contain the

153
00:11:44.521 --> 00:11:49.521
quote assumption of risk language that the mutual mistake provision contains.

154
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:51.263
However,

155
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:56.510
the restatement section two 66 does say that the provision doesn't apply if

156
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.710
language or circumstances indicate contrary,

157
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.370
which might produce the same default like result.

158
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.650
So what have we learned?

159
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:10.860
We introduced the concept of impracticability and examine not only the

160
00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:15.930
[inaudible] provision concerning impracticability present in the wedge asthmatic

161
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.820
case,
but also the restatement definitions.

162
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.920
We compared this new doctrine with a now familiar one mutual mistake,

163
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:28.780
and we had occasion again to revisit the concepts of assumption of risk and

164
00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:33.930
default and altering rules and the possible policy consequences of such rules.

165
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:35.591
Finally,

166
00:12:35.591 --> 00:12:40.591
looking back at the mass to Dodick computers of the 1950s,

167
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:45.520
uh,
from the age of the smartphone that we now live in,

168
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:50.820
reminds us of a technological revolution that unlike in the wedge amatic case,

169
00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.710
has indeed taken place.
