00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.580
The case of Sherwood,

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.390
the walker which comes from late 19th century Michigan,

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.100
asks the question,

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.140
what happens when both parties to a contract base their agreement to the

5
00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:16.710
contract on a mistaken understanding of the situation.

6
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.090
Mr Sherwood was a banker and he wanted to buy some cattle from Mr. Walker who

7
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:28.320
imported and bread black Angus cattle,
like the ones you see in this photo.

8
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.820
He went to one of walkers farms but didn't like any of the cattle there.

9
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.100
He then went to a second farm where he was told the cows were probably baron and

10
00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:42.900
he decided to buy a cow named rose.
The second to Viber alone,

11
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.420
sure would called up walker and they agreed to a price that came to about $80

12
00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:50.670
that five and a half cents per pound,

13
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.170
but when Sherwood went to pay for and pick up,

14
00:00:55.171 --> 00:01:00.171
Rose Walker refused to sell because rose had turned out to be pregnant.

15
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.320
This is a suit for replevin that is Sherwood is claiming that Walker should be

16
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.900
ordered by the court to give Sherwood his namely rows the second of Ab or alone.

17
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.640
One interesting thing about this case is that the majority opinion and the

18
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:25.500
dissenting opinions tell the story of how sure what and Walker came to agree on

19
00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:26.334
the sale.

20
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.880
Judge Morris for the majority says that both Sherwood and Walker were convinced

21
00:01:32.221 --> 00:01:36.150
that rose was barren and therefore only valuable for her meat.

22
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.260
That's why the price was so low and by the pound,

23
00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:45.261
a dairy cow would fetch a price more than 10 times higher around $850 and would

24
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:51.510
be valued based on her ability to bear calves and produce milk.

25
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.860
In this story,

26
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.410
both parties are mistaken about Rose Justice.

27
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.920
Justice Sherwood in his dissent suggests that sure would.

28
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.880
The plaintiff's suspected all along that rose wasn't baron.

29
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.010
He bought her on the hope that she might turn out to be able to bear calves and

30
00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:14.370
give milk on this view at most,

31
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.330
one of the parties was truly mistaken about Rose's condition.

32
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.170
The question the court must answer is,

33
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.030
can walker get out of the contract now that both parties know that rose is 10

34
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:30.240
times more valuable than either of them thought?

35
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.120
Both of the lower courts had said no and ruled for share would,

36
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.540
but Justice Morse reversed ruling for Walker.

37
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.960
He says that when a sent to a contract was based upon the mistake of a material

38
00:02:46.741 --> 00:02:50.280
fact and that mistake is mutual,

39
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.230
a party can refuse to go through with the transaction or even get it reversed by

40
00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:56.064
the courts.

41
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.720
The question is what counts as mistake of a material fact?

42
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.070
Justice Morse gives a rather unhelpful metaphysical even Aristotelian answer.

43
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.240
He says that when the mistake gets to quote the substance of the thing,

44
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.950
the contract is unenforceable,

45
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.730
but when it only gets to the condition or value of the thing,

46
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.260
it's still enforceable.

47
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.480
Even if that very condition or quality was what motivated the parties to enter

48
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:32.740
into the contract in the first place.
For Justice Morse,

49
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.180
the question of whether a cow is barren or not gets to the very core of the

50
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:42.181
substance of what sort of creature rose is and so walker can refuse to sell her.

51
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.030
The question of whether a horse is sound,

52
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:51.031
on the other hand is in his view a quality or accident,

53
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.570
no matter that it may be viewed as essential,
uh,
to the buyer.

54
00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.080
It isn't clear though exactly how to extend justice is Morse is distinction to

55
00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:02.170
other cases.

56
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.550
Section one 52 of the second restatement provides a bit more guidance if the

57
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:14.431
parties are both mistaken when making the contract as to a basic assumption and

58
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:20.821
that mistake has a material effect on the agreed exchange of performances.

59
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.300
The party who is made worse off relative to the parties.

60
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.290
Original expectation has the option to void the contract.

61
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.340
The exceptions in section one 54 of the restatement allow for the parties

62
00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:40.591
themselves to a portion the risk of mistake between themselves for the court to

63
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:46.351
decide that it is reasonable under the circumstances for one party to bear the

64
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:51.601
risk or for a party to assume the risk by agreeing to the contract knowing that

65
00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:54.520
he or she is missing essential information.

66
00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.670
These are exceptions that are important because they make the mutual mistake

67
00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:03.310
drop doctrine merely a default.

68
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.730
While the doctrine sets out conditions where contractual duties can become

69
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:09.724
voidable,

70
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.180
the sellers right to void can be eliminated ex ante by the parties allocating

71
00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:20.980
the risks of a particular mistake to a particular party.
In question.

72
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.380
Under section one 54 the parties could have agreed that the seller would bear

73
00:05:26.381 --> 00:05:31.330
the risk that rose would turn out to be more much more valuable.

74
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.070
It still may be difficult for the parties to prove that they base their

75
00:05:38.081 --> 00:05:42.340
agreement on certain assumptions,
but in a case like Sherwood,

76
00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:47.260
the defendant can point to the fact that the agreed upon price clearly reflects

77
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.460
the going rate for a barren cow is evidence that their negotiations were

78
00:05:51.461 --> 00:05:52.870
premised on that assumption.

79
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.370
So here's the quiz walker grease to sell.
Sure.

80
00:05:59.371 --> 00:06:04.371
What a beautiful home and they negotiate a satisfactory price unbeknownst to

81
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:07.100
them.
The house is currently on fire.

82
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.610
Which party has the right to void the contract under restatement to one 52 sure

83
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.080
would walker both neither.
Well,

84
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.730
the buyer Sherwood can void the contract under section one 52.

85
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.150
Both parties are mistaken and the house being unburnt was certainly a basic

86
00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:33.300
assumption to the contract without evidence that the parties allocated this risk

87
00:06:33.301 --> 00:06:38.180
to the buyer say with a contractual provision requiring Sherwood to take out

88
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:40.040
fire insurance before closing.

89
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.500
The mutual mistake doctrine would place the risk of this basic assumption,

90
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.700
uh,

91
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.320
failing with the seller by giving Sherwood the right to void the contract

92
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.600
earlier suggested that formation defenses help courts police or shore up the

93
00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:04.361
revealed preference inference that a contractual agreement actually increases

94
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:07.423
value.

95
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.910
That's one way of explaining why courts make agreement agreements voidable when

96
00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:18.941
one of the contracting parties lack the cognitive capacity to know what's in his

97
00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:23.810
or her best interest.
It can also help explain the mistake doctrine.

98
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.830
If the contractors were mistaken about a basic assumption,

99
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.450
it undermines the court's confidence that the contract is value enhancing.

100
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:37.040
Small mistakes aren't enough to undermine a court's confidence.

101
00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.460
If we learn that our race horse goes a bit faster,

102
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:42.830
a bit slower than the parties thought,

103
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:46.460
the buyer still probably values the horse more than the seller.

104
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.380
But larger mistakes that go to the heart of what the parties were exchanging

105
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:56.510
might make a court wonder whether the buyer values the horse more than the

106
00:07:56.511 --> 00:08:00.020
seller.
By making the contracts voidable,

107
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:05.260
it saves the parties from the extra burden of having to bargain their way out of

108
00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:09.020
a bad deal.
Imagine for example,

109
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:14.050
that Taylor agrees to buy a used piano from Tom for $1,200 as Taylor is starting

110
00:08:16.821 --> 00:08:19.310
to load the piano into her truck.

111
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.520
Both Tom and Taylor see that $10,000 is taped inside the piano.

112
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:31.540
Tom Sue's Taylor arguing there is mutual mistake as to a basic assumption.

113
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.800
Not Knowing about the $10,000 is a pretty large mistake,

114
00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:41.900
but it might not undermine our confidence that Taylor is the higher valuer of

115
00:08:41.901 --> 00:08:42.734
the piano.

116
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.210
Taylor and Tom would have contracted for a higher price,

117
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:52.450
probably $11,200 if they'd known about the money taped inside,

118
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:59.130
but the court not make the contract voidable because in this kind of

119
00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:02.160
circumstances,
because there's still gains of trade

120
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.670
applying revealed preference.

121
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:10.880
This revealed preference idea to the case at hand in Sherwood versus Walker is

122
00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:15.900
to ask whether the parties mistake was sufficient to undermine our confidence

123
00:09:15.901 --> 00:09:19.410
that Sherwood is the higher valuer.
Sure,

124
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.860
they would have contracted for a higher price if they knew she was pregnant,

125
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.510
but is share with the higher valuing owner of a pregnant cow.

126
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.880
If sure would own the glue factory and only bought cows for the value of their

127
00:09:32.881 --> 00:09:36.720
parts,
then we might think that this is a kind of mistake.

128
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.670
If I've corrected Dec Santi,

129
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:42.450
that would have stopped the parties from contracting at any price.

130
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.780
In earlier cases.

131
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:50.370
We've seen that parties must have a meeting of the minds in order to have a

132
00:09:50.371 --> 00:09:51.450
valid contract.

133
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:56.790
Ensure would we've seen that the parties must meet in a place close enough to

134
00:09:56.791 --> 00:10:00.060
the truth.
If the mistake they made is important enough,

135
00:10:00.061 --> 00:10:05.061
it goes to the substance of the thing and justice Morris's words or it is a

136
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.970
basic assumption in the words of the restatement.

137
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.480
The parties who come to regret the bargain when they find out the truth then has

138
00:10:15.211 --> 00:10:17.250
the option of voiding it.
Of course,

139
00:10:17.251 --> 00:10:21.270
it may be difficult to convince a court that a particular belief was a basic

140
00:10:21.271 --> 00:10:24.090
assumption or that the assumption is material,

141
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:29.660
but the big innovation of the restatement is to more clearly established that

142
00:10:29.821 --> 00:10:31.020
the mutual mistake,

143
00:10:31.021 --> 00:10:36.021
void ability is merely a default allocation of risks that can be contracted

144
00:10:36.631 --> 00:10:39.120
around by the parties themselves.
