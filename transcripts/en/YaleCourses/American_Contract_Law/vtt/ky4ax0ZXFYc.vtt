1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.940
Contracts are understood and enforced as voluntary agreements between parties.

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.820
So when one party lacks volition,

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.330
the basis for enforcing the contract does not exist.

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.220
In today's lecture,

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.400
we talk about a party must have legal capacity in order to enter into a contract

6
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.420
under the common law.
Minors,

7
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.480
which are often called infants by the court do not have legal capacity to

8
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:30.684
contract.

9
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.200
In 1950 Ohio Court of Appeals Case David versus Cleland provides a stark example

10
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.770
of this doctrine in Davis.

11
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:45.630
The defendant's sold a car to a minor after crashing the car into a telephone

12
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:50.520
pole.
The minor sought to rescind the transaction and get his money back.

13
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.690
The court ruling for the minor reason that quote,

14
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.960
those who deal with a minor must do so charged with the knowledge of the

15
00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:02.310
controlling principle of law,

16
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.960
which is here may work some injustice in individual cases,

17
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.290
but affords in general the protection of minors against their own improvidence

18
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.300
at a time when they are presumed to be incapable of protecting themselves

19
00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:21.150
unquote.
In recent years,

20
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:25.980
courts and legislatures have diminished the protection from minors somewhat
even.

21
00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:30.510
So miners still lack the full legal capacity to contract.

22
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.950
The rule that miners lack capacity to enter a contract is captured by section 14

23
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.370
of the restatement of contracts which reads unless the statute provides.

24
00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:44.610
Otherwise,

25
00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:49.611
a natural person has the capacity to incur only voidable contractual duties

26
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.540
until the beginning of the day before the person's 18th birthday.

27
00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.250
In general,
uh,

28
00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:02.970
minors contracts are voidable as opposed to void.

29
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.360
This means a minor can avoid his or her contractual obligations by timely and

30
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.110
appropriate disaffirm.
It's but the other party,

31
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.180
if an adult is bound,

32
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.470
the rule makes contracting with minors risky.
However,

33
00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:22.170
once a minor reaches the age of majority,

34
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.100
the minor can ratify or affirm the contract.

35
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.910
Even adults may lack the capacity to contract if they're mentally incompetent.

36
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.880
Section 15 of the restatement provides a person incur is only voidable

37
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:43.491
contractual duties by entering into a transaction if by reason of mental illness

38
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:46.650
or defect.
A,

39
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.720
he's unable to understand in a reasonable manner the nature and consequences of

40
00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:54.060
the transaction.
Or B,

41
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.390
he is unable to act in a reasonable manner in relation to the transaction and

42
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:02.890
the other party has reason to know of his condition.

43
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.610
Subsection two tells us that where the contract is made on fair terms and the

44
00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:12.670
other party is without knowledge of the mental illness or defect.

45
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.710
The power of avoidance under subsection one terminates to the extent that the

46
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:22.711
contract has been so performed in whole or in part or the circumstances of so

47
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:28.060
changed that avoidance would be unjust.
In such a case,

48
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.240
a court may grant relief as justice requires as events by the relative length of

49
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:40.720
the restatement sections the defense of mental and competence for an adult,

50
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:45.721
it's more complicated than the defense of lack of capacity for a minor.

51
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.900
The defense of infancy may be available even though the other party has no

52
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:55.540
reason to suspect he was contracting with a minor,

53
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.200
but the defense of mental incompetence focuses upon both the condition of the

54
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:05.470
party seeking to avoid the contract and what the other party had.

55
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.340
Reason to know.

56
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.840
Subsection one B says that a contract is voidable if a person is unable to act

57
00:04:13.871 --> 00:04:18.340
in a reasonable manner and relationship to the transaction and the other person

58
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:20.470
has reason to know if his condition,

59
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.400
but the reason to know condition is absent from subsection one a with regard to

60
00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:33.910
when a person is unable to understand in a reasonable,

61
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.410
reasonable manner the nature and consequences of the transaction.

62
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.780
Subsection two is then triggered when the other party is without actual

63
00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:44.614
knowledge,

64
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.300
but might include circumstances when there is reason to know.

65
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.350
Are these varying standards concerning what the other party knew or ought to

66
00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:57.490
have known?
Do they make sense?

67
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.840
The restatements treatment of impairment by intoxication closely mirrors its

68
00:05:04.511 --> 00:05:07.630
treatment of incapacity because of mental illness,

69
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.340
but limits void ability to circumstances where the other party had reason to

70
00:05:12.341 --> 00:05:14.500
know of the intoxication.

71
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.790
So let's see if we can answer this quiz.

72
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.170
Ashley Sells Boris a car for the Kelley blue book price.

73
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.970
Bora suffers from a mental illness and is legally incompetent to contract.

74
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.160
Ashley does not know,

75
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.140
nor does she have any reason to know that Boris lacks a capacity to contract.

76
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.660
Boris later crashes the car and hotel phone pole and seeks to return the damage

77
00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:43.270
car and get his money back.
Borris.

78
00:05:43.271 --> 00:05:46.570
His attorney argues that since Boris is mentally and competent,

79
00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:50.830
the contract is voidable and Boris may rescind the transaction.

80
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.850
Is Boris his attorney correct?
Probably not.

81
00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.360
Under section to when the contract is made on fair terms and the other party

82
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:06.770
does not know that she is dealing with them mentally and competent person.

83
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.340
The contract may not be terminated under Section 15 one if the circumstances

84
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:17.000
have so changed that avoidance would be unjust.

85
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.570
Here Ashley Sold Boris the car at a fair price,

86
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.520
did not know that Boris was mentally ill and circumstances have certainly

87
00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:26.001
changed.

88
00:06:26.001 --> 00:06:30.110
The car is now severely damaged after being driven into a telephone pole.

89
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.300
It would probably be unjust to allow Boris to rescind the contract under these

90
00:06:35.301 --> 00:06:39.020
changed circumstances.
So let's recap.

91
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.200
A person must have legal capacity to contract miners and individual vigils with

92
00:06:45.381 --> 00:06:49.340
certain mental health or drug induced issues.

93
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.640
Lack capacity to contract and their contracts may be voidable.
