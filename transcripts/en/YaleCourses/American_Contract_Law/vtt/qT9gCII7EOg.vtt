1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.720
The next case is amens versus Wilson and company and it asks the question,

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.570
when can silence constitute acceptance of an offer?

3
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.090
Our El Amens was a wholesale grocer in Bella,

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.080
Mississippi over the course of six to eight months leading up to the events in

5
00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:20.970
this case.
Uh,

6
00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:24.510
he had placed a number of orders with tweety,

7
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.090
the agent of Wilson and company,

8
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.160
a meat packing business located near my hometown of Kansas City,
Kansas.

9
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.790
On each occasion he filled out an order provided by tweety who sent the order on

10
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.880
to his bosses in Kansas City who then shipped the requested good to amens within

11
00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:50.940
a week with the order that forms the basis of this case.

12
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.240
This sequence of events did not take place as planned.

13
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.810
Tweety told Amiens that Wilson was offering shortening at seven and a half cents

14
00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:05.601
per pound and tweety booked amens for 60,000 pounds of shortening.

15
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.420
This was a booking and as a really a way to say that,

16
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.313
uh,

17
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.470
for tweety to solicit offers rather than to make or receive an offer itself.

18
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.540
About two weeks later,

19
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.690
Ayman submitted an order for 942 cases of shortening that is about 43,916 pounds

20
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:32.640
of that stuff.

21
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.120
His order was an offer to purchase shortening in the given amount at the given

22
00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:40.710
price.
Uh,

23
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.810
amens did not hear back from Wilson for 12 days at which point they told him

24
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.990
that they would not fill his order as the price of shortening had increased to 9

25
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.013
cents per pound.

26
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.560
Amens then sued Wilson and company for breach of contract alleging damages from

27
00:01:58.291 --> 00:02:01.080
the company's failure to ship the request in shortening.

28
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.120
The trial court directed a verdict against Damon's concluding there was no

29
00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:09.510
contract and so he was not entitled to damages.

30
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.680
We're looking at the decision from the Mississippi Supreme Court which looked at

31
00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:20.970
the question of whether it was possible for Wilson's 12 day silence to

32
00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:24.450
constitute acceptance of Amiens offer.

33
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.230
Note that even though they ruled for Amiens the case was remanded so that a jury

34
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:36.351
could decide whether Amiens allegations of fact were in fact true justice

35
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.450
Anderson turns to what is now section 69 of the restatement.

36
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.540
Second of contracts to determine when under what conditions silence can

37
00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:50.130
constitute acceptance of an offer.

38
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.230
The section is quite restrictive because we generally do not want people to have

39
00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:58.560
to speak in order to avoid being bound by contract.

40
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.310
Contracts are meant to reflect the conscious will of the parties involved,

41
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.720
not the accident.

42
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:09.721
Whole use of a default option taking on an obligation should normally require

43
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:16.561
conscious assent from each party even though an offer or is master of her offer

44
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.390
normally can add conditions as to how the offer can be accepted.

45
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.350
Remember an offer or might say and and as an example,

46
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:31.120
remember an offer might say that an offer can only be accepted by sky riding.

47
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.050
I accept,

48
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.800
but an offer or is not empowered to say you accept an offer unless you deviate

49
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.980
from your life path.
If you go,
if you go to work today,

50
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:46.540
I will have deemed you to have accepted my offer to sell your house for $1.

51
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.680
Or unless you say,
I love Kansas City,

52
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.770
you will be deemed to accept my offer to buy your car for 50 bucks.

53
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.690
Offer shouldn't have a right to make you speak in order to avoid contracting.

54
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

55
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.190
<v 0>Section 69 his first exception to this idea that silence is rejection is when</v>

56
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:11.050
the offeree takes what the offer has offered,

57
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:13.450
knowing that the offer expects payment for it.

58
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.370
Even though the offer he is not required to speak her taking what was offered as

59
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:22.990
a conscious action and has similar social meaning,

60
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.880
it creates an implied in fact or implied in conduct contract.

61
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

62
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.300
<v 0>Section 69 second exception is for situations where the offer or has made it</v>

63
00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:40.671
clear that he will interpret the offeree silence or inaction as acceptance.

64
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.110
The subsection makes it seem like the offer could say something like,

65
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:47.430
if you don't say anything,

66
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.440
you have agreed to pay me $1,000 in exchange for this book and then the offeree

67
00:04:52.441 --> 00:04:55.950
would be bound to pay $1,000 unless she said something.

68
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.570
But note the caveat.

69
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.930
The offeree must intend for her silence or an action to constitute acceptance

70
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.310
for this exception to to hold.

71
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.360
It's on the third exception that justice Anderson's opinion realize if the two

72
00:05:12.151 --> 00:05:17.100
parties have a practice of behaving as if silence means acceptance,

73
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.310
then it may be reasonable to require the offer read to explicitly reject an

74
00:05:22.741 --> 00:05:23.574
offer.

75
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.800
The justice found that a jury based on a man's evidence could reasonably

76
00:05:30.561 --> 00:05:35.420
conclude that Amiens and Wilson had established a pattern where silence from

77
00:05:35.421 --> 00:05:38.240
Wilson and company meant,
uh,

78
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.690
acceptance of Amos said this offer and,

79
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.550
and that acceptance that was taking on a promise to ship the requested items

80
00:05:46.551 --> 00:05:47.420
within the week.

81
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.800
When Amiens did not hear from the seller for 12 days,

82
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.480
he could reasonably conclude that they had accepted his offer by silence and

83
00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:58.190
that they had a contract.

84
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.010
Let's take a look at a couple of sections of the UCC that bear on this case.

85
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.310
Section one dash two oh one B three of the UCC defines agreement as a bargain of

86
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:13.310
the parties,
in fact,

87
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:18.260
as found in the language or implication from other circumstances including

88
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.760
course of dealing or usage of trade or course or performance.

89
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.770
This is a bit broader than the rule we saw on section 69 of the restatement

90
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.740
subsection one c,
uh,
uh,

91
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.950
of the restatement only explicitly discussed the prior course of dealings

92
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.490
between the two parties involved in the contracted issue.

93
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.060
The UCC expands this to cover usage of trade.

94
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.540
That is the general pattern of behavior,
uh,

95
00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:50.300
in the industry at issue in the case.

96
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:55.490
If the parties know that silence is viewed as acceptance in their industry,
uh,

97
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.950
their industries trade usage,

98
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.970
then they may be bound by silence as acceptance.

99
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.850
UCC section two,

100
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:09.851
two oh six goes into more detail about nonverbal ways to accept an offer to buy.

101
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:15.850
Subsection one B says that prompt promise to ship or a prompt or current

102
00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:21.140
shipment of the conforming goods constitutes acceptance.

103
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.630
Subsection two says that sometimes the beginning of requested performance

104
00:07:26.631 --> 00:07:28.130
constitutes acceptance.

105
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.840
While none of these options is an explicit verbal acceptance of the offer,

106
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.530
they are all clear indications,
uh,
uh,

107
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.440
that are akin to implied in fact,
uh,

108
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:44.530
acceptances that the offeree has understood the offer and intends to go along

109
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.220
with it to accept it.
In this case,
uh,

110
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:54.170
of Amens versus Wilson and company Wilson's general practice of simply shipping

111
00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:56.000
the goods in response to an order.

112
00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:01.170
It looks very much like subsection one B's prompt or current shipment of

113
00:08:01.431 --> 00:08:04.670
conforming goods.
So here's a quiz.

114
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:09.700
Gloria sends an order for a hundred widgets to Wilson's widget incorporated Wwi.

115
00:08:11.331 --> 00:08:16.040
Males are back a,
a box of 100 widgets of the type she ordered,

116
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.480
but they're defective.

117
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:21.620
Can Gloria Sue Wwi for breach of contract?

118
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:24.470
Well,
the answer is yes.

119
00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:29.060
Gloria can sue for breach of contract or order was an offer to buy widgets at

120
00:08:29.061 --> 00:08:34.061
the listed price and wis prompt shipment indicated it's acceptance of her offer.

121
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:39.890
The parties therefore have a binding contract and so Gloria can get whatever

122
00:08:39.891 --> 00:08:43.760
damages would ordinarily be available to,
uh,

123
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:46.670
for receiving the a defective products.

124
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.430
In our discussion of Amiens,

125
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.840
we've seen that the general rule is that parties must explicitly indicate their

126
00:08:53.841 --> 00:08:58.440
acceptance of an offer order for a valid contract to arise.
However,

127
00:08:58.441 --> 00:09:03.270
there are exceptions in situations where actions indicate acceptance as when

128
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:05.430
they shipped goods and response to an order,

129
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:10.730
or when the parties have established a pattern where silence indicates

130
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:11.760
acceptance.
