00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.470
Today we're going to discuss whether consideration can be sufficient,

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.970
even if it loses its value following contract formation.

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.720
We'll explore this question by looking at app fell versus Prudential Bache

4
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.260
securities.

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.710
A case decided by New York state's highest court in 1993 the plaintiffs and

6
00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:28.470
investment banker and lawyer approached an investment bank,

7
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.570
the predecessor to Prudential Bache securities,

8
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.200
and they approach the bank with an idea for a new way of issuing municipal bonds

9
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.760
at the time,

10
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.060
issuing stock or bonds involved issuing paper certificates.

11
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.030
The plaintiff's proposed a new system that allowed the municipal bonds to trade

12
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.270
paperlessly through electronic book entries.

13
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.680
After reviewing a lengthy detailed summary of the techniques involved in the

14
00:01:03.901 --> 00:01:07.620
plaintiff's proposal,
and after several weeks of negotiation,

15
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.330
the defendant bank entered into a contract with the plaintiffs.

16
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.680
The contract provided that the plaintiffs conveyed their rights to the

17
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:21.681
techniques in return for a stipulated payment rate from the defendant for its

18
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:26.260
use of the techniques for a period from October,

19
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.290
1982 to January,

20
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.980
1988 for at least the first year of the contract,

21
00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:36.450
the defendant company was the only underwriter and the industry using the

22
00:01:36.451 --> 00:01:41.451
paperless system by 1985 by which time many other investment banks were using

23
00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:45.570
similar computerized models.

24
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.480
The defendant companies stopped making payments.

25
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.320
The company alleged that the idea is app fell,

26
00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:54.870
can be conveyed in his proposal,

27
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.910
had been in the public domain at the time of the sale agreement and argued that

28
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:03.240
in order to constitute consideration for the party's agreement,

29
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.830
App Hill's idea had to be but was not novel.

30
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.900
The trial court found for the plaintiff,
the appellate division,

31
00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:17.250
reversed agreeing with the defendant that an idea had to be novel to constitute

32
00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:22.251
consideration and that novelty was a fact to be determined at trial.

33
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.980
But the incident court reversed determining that an idea need not be novel to

34
00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:29.910
constitute valid consideration.

35
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.900
Let's walk through the Court of Appeals Holding.

36
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.490
The court emphasized first that the parties to a contract are free to make their

37
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:43.491
bargain even if the consideration exchanged is grossly unequal or of dubious

38
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:45.264
value.

39
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.270
It's enough that something of real value in the eyes of the law was exchanged.

40
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.370
It rejected the defendants and the appellate division's belief that novelty was

41
00:02:56.371 --> 00:03:01.371
required for contracts involving the of ideas explaining that the case is on

42
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:07.291
which the defendant and lower court relied for for their contention only used

43
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:11.380
novelty as a way to ascertain the value of an idea.

44
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.930
Value at the time of contract formation was the crucial concern.

45
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.440
So long as the idea offered as consideration had value to the defendant at the

46
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:27.730
time of contract formation.
The idea was valid consideration.

47
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.313
Further,

48
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.330
the court pointed out that even if the idea itself wasn't novel,

49
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.420
it was novel to the defendant and indication that the idea had value to the

50
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:40.534
company.

51
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.840
The court also explained other reasons why the idea was quote manifestly unquote

52
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.570
of value to potential bache securities.

53
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.900
The company used APP fells proposed computerized book entry system for several

54
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.590
years.
It did so an advance of its competitors and through its confidentiality

55
00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:04.570
agreement precluded the disclosure of the ideas to its competitors.

56
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.530
A clear articulation of the relationship between novelty and value may be found

57
00:04:11.201 --> 00:04:16.201
in one of the cases on upon which the defendant relied downy versus General Food

58
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.100
Corporation and opinion.

59
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.170
The court of Appeals of New York at issued in 1972 in that case,

60
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.230
the plaintiff submitted to an employee of general foods and idea to market Jello

61
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.480
using a mister wiggle.

62
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.750
The company rejected this marketing idea,

63
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.870
but several months later other employees apparently unaware of Downey suggestion

64
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.240
also came up with the idea of Mr. Wiggle and market it when the plaintiff sued

65
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.790
General Food Corporation showed evidence that that proposed a TV commercial

66
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.940
years earlier involving variations of wiggle and the court of Appeals ruled in

67
00:04:57.671 --> 00:04:58.720
the company's favor.

68
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:04.210
The point was simply that if general foods already was aware of the wiggle

69
00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:06.940
notion when Downey proposed it to them,

70
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.180
Downey's disclosure had no value to general foods and so could not constitute

71
00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:16.690
valid consideration in this case.
By contrast,

72
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.200
Prudential Bache securities,
fully conceited,

73
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:25.230
it did not have knowledge of any similar electronic book entry proposal before

74
00:05:25.931 --> 00:05:27.370
hearing it from the plaintiff.

75
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.730
Notably lacking in this opinion are any dollar figures.

76
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.410
We do not know what prudential based securities paid for the plaintiffs
proposal.

77
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.650
What if prudential paid for the use of the idea?

78
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.890
Primarily because they believed it was a novel one and paid much more than it

79
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:49.030
otherwise would have been willing to pay,

80
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:53.680
assuming it would have more than a couple of years a headstart on its

81
00:05:53.681 --> 00:05:56.770
competitors in the paperless securities trading.

82
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:58.760
With that in mind,

83
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.660
do you see any problems with the court's determination that the idea was

84
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:04.700
obviously a value to the defendant?

85
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.560
So is the consideration doctrine concerned with the equivalents of exchange?

86
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.310
That is whether there are disparities in the value of what the parties promise

87
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:17.144
each other.

88
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.483
<v 1>No.</v>

89
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.220
<v 0>The consideration doctrine does not police the equivalents of exchange.</v>

90
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.580
Even very large disparities in the respective parties consideration typically

91
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:36.251
will not give rise to an unenforceable contract because of this,

92
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:43.340
uh,
consideration doctrine is a very poor policy instrument to assure substantive

93
00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:45.590
fairness.
On the other hand,

94
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.020
what if the plaintiffs in this case had represented that the idea was in fact

95
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:56.021
novel or if both parties wrongly believed this was so should the court have

96
00:06:56.271 --> 00:07:01.271
heard and implicit representation from the plaintiff that the idea was novel or

97
00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:05.480
is the default of non,
uh,

98
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.640
novelty preferable?

99
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.890
We will discuss cases involving misrepresentation or,

100
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:13.860
uh,

101
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.290
a mistaken inferences of fact later on in the course.

102
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:19.850
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

103
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.920
<v 0>So what have we learned from this case?</v>

104
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.410
We know that ideas do not have to be novel to constitute consideration,

105
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.320
but more broadly and more importantly,

106
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:35.360
decision suggests that consideration should be judged at the time of
contracting,

107
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.960
even if a party's consideration after formation ceases to have value as here.

108
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:45.470
Because midway through the term of the contract,
the defendant,

109
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:50.720
the defendant's competitors,
were using similar electronic book entry systems,

110
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:56.320
the consideration remains adequate because at the time of contracting it had

111
00:07:57.231 --> 00:08:01.640
value.
It's what motivated the banks promise.

112
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:02.871
Finally,

113
00:08:02.871 --> 00:08:07.460
we emphasize again that the consideration doctrine generally does not inquire

114
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:10.430
into how equal the consideration of the parties is.
