1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.460
Today we're going to continue our discussion of conditions proceeded.

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.030
In particular,

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.180
we look at the waiver of an express condition proceeded in Clark versus West in

4
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:17.250
1908 New York case in this case,

5
00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:22.251
the plaintiff William Clark agreed to write a case book about corporations law

6
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.690
for the defendant West a publisher.

7
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.170
The ingredient included a clause requiring Clark to abstain from having any

8
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:35.211
liquor during the time of the contract and said quote that the payment to him in

9
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:41.181
accordance with the terms of this contract of any money in excess of $2 per page

10
00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:46.761
is dependent on the faithful performance of this unquote Clark was to be paid $6

11
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.840
per page if he abstained.

12
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.850
Clark drank and west paid him $2 per page for the completed work.

13
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.270
Clark sued seeking the additional $4 per page and also claim that the copyright

14
00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:07.800
of the book in the name of a corporation violated the terms of the agreement.

15
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.870
The trial court overruled the defendant's dimmer.

16
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.850
The appellate court sustained the dimmer and the instinct court reversed

17
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.550
overruling the Demora and remanded.

18
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.300
The issue in this case is,

19
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.420
was the promise not to drink a condition proceeded waived by the defendant.

20
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.790
Now,
as an aside,
uh,

21
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.920
the contract law used to distinguish between conditions proceeded and condition

22
00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:38.754
subsequent.

23
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.180
And Luckily these days you don't have to really know about this distinction.

24
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.800
But,
uh,
the distinction used to me made that a condition proceedings,

25
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.640
uh,

26
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.640
was a condition that the duty to perform did not exist until that condition was

27
00:01:57.361 --> 00:02:01.580
fulfilled.
Whereas with a condition subsequent,
there was,
uh,

28
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.680
an initial duty to perform that might be eliminated if subsequently a certain

29
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:10.050
condition came about.

30
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.470
The real difference between a condition preceding then a condition subsequent is

31
00:02:15.841 --> 00:02:19.230
whether it was the promises or the promise sores,

32
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.290
duty to establish,
uh,

33
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.240
whether the condition came about or not.
But let's go to a quiz.

34
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.830
So the defendant argued that the plane is promise and not to drink was

35
00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:36.831
consideration for the payment of the difference between the $2 and the $6 per

36
00:02:37.111 --> 00:02:41.700
page.
The plaintiff argued that the plaintiffs abstinence from alcohol was the

37
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:42.810
condition proceeding.

38
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.070
Why is this distinction important to the analysis of the case?

39
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.690
Well if the plaintiffs promise not to drink was consideration in exchange for an

40
00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:59.631
additional $4 per page than the promise could not be modified except by a new

41
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:06.460
agreement between the two parties supported by a separate consideration.

42
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.691
However,

43
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:12.691
if the abstention from drinking was merely a condition that did not go to the

44
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:15.280
consideration of the contract,

45
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.140
it could be waived by the defendant without any additional consideration.

46
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.100
The court held that the promise not to drink was merely a condition proceeded in

47
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:29.230
the words of the court.

48
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.910
It was quote not a contract to write books in order that the plaintiff shall

49
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:38.911
keep sober but a contract containing a stipulation that he shall keep sober so

50
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:42.070
that he may write satisfactory books.

51
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.230
The court compared the clause requiring Clark to abstain to the clauses

52
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:52.231
governing other terms of the agreement such as those relating to time and method

53
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:57.160
of delivery of the manuscript,
revision approved citation of cases,

54
00:03:57.161 --> 00:03:58.690
assignment of copyrights,

55
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.760
keeping track of new cases and citations for new additions and other details

56
00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:08.050
which might be waived by the defendant if he saw fit to do so.

57
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.670
To be clear.

58
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.810
Some conditions do go to the consideration of an agreement.

59
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.000
A home buyer could have waved without additional consideration.
The promise,

60
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:25.030
a promise to pay that is conditioned on the contractor using coho pipe,

61
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.310
but the home buyer could not waive with out additional consideration.

62
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.470
The promise to pay that is conditioned on the contractor building the entire

63
00:04:35.471 --> 00:04:36.304
house.

64
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.050
It's one thing to say for our contractor to go to the buyer and say,
Hey,

65
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.510
I don't have any coho pipe.
Is it alright if I substitute Redding pipe?

66
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.980
That can be that kind of a condition to pay can be waived,

67
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.290
but for a contractor to go to a buyer and say,
hey,

68
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.780
I'm not feeling like building your house.

69
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.520
The buyer can't agree to waive the condition of the entire house being built.

70
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:07.360
That kind of a duty of the buyer to pay conditioned on the house.

71
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.330
That goes too much to the entire consideration.

72
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.911
In this case,

73
00:05:12.911 --> 00:05:17.911
the plaintiff's complaint alleged that West New Clark failed to observe the

74
00:05:18.281 --> 00:05:19.120
stipulation.

75
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.750
The opinion says long before the plaintiff had completed the manuscript of the

76
00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:27.280
first book undertaken under the contract,

77
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.020
the defendant had full knowledge of the plaintiffs non observance of that

78
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.900
stipulation and that was such knowledge.

79
00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:39.901
He not only accepted the completed manuscript without a objection,

80
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.120
but is this bad behavior on the part of West really objectionable?

81
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.240
In essence,
the court is saying to west,

82
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.300
how dare you not tell Clark what Clark already knew that Clark was drinking,

83
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.530
but why does Clark have an obligation?

84
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.840
But why does west to have an obligation to tell Clark that West knows that Clark

85
00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:04.430
is drinking Clark?

86
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:09.431
It didn't promise not to drink and West didn't promise to tell Clark if West

87
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:11.870
learns that Clark is drinking.

88
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.930
The most important allegation is that West not only accepted the completed

89
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:19.190
manuscript for the book,

90
00:06:19.191 --> 00:06:24.191
but also quote repeatedly avowed and represented to the plaintiff that he was

91
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:28.010
entitled to and would receive said royalty payments.

92
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:33.250
That is the additional $4 per page and plaintiff believed in relied upon such

93
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:37.610
representations unquote.
These actions according to the court,

94
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.740
if established would prove defendant's waiver of plaintiff's performance of that

95
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:45.440
contract.
Stipulation.
Therefore,

96
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:50.441
the court reversed the dimmer and remanded the case as we discussed in the

97
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:55.811
previous lecture and express condition allows a promissory to avoid performance

98
00:06:56.151 --> 00:07:01.070
unless a certain event occurs the existence of a condition in a contract and

99
00:07:01.071 --> 00:07:05.840
makes what would have been an unconditional promise into a conditional promise.

100
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.760
If the event does not occur,

101
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:11.870
there is not a duty to perform and the contract is discharged.

102
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:17.260
Some conditions like the one at issue here or for the conditional promissory its

103
00:07:17.691 --> 00:07:18.524
benefit.

104
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.560
If Clark fails to stay sober west the conditional promise or is able to withhold

105
00:07:24.831 --> 00:07:26.420
part of the promised payment,

106
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.120
but if the condition is not deemed to be consideration for the promises,

107
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.840
promise the promise or can waive it without any additional consideration.

108
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:41.770
Waiver of a condition is in effect a contract modification because it increases

109
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:47.291
the promises duty to perform before beyond the original contract terms.

110
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.360
The original contract term was for a conditional promise.

111
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.360
The waiver makes it an unconditional promise.

112
00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:57.980
The contract modification would normally need to be supported by additional

113
00:07:57.981 --> 00:08:00.560
consideration to be enforceable.

114
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:05.960
But courts courts make an exception when the condition precedent was quote,

115
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.380
not the consideration for the contract unquote.

116
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.640
This exception was evident in Clark versus West.

117
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:18.670
The court emphasized that the stipulation prohibiting Clark from drinking again

118
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:23.540
was not a contract to write books in order that the plaintiff shall keep sober,

119
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:28.580
but a contract that he keeps sober so that he may write satisfactory book.

120
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.180
The court's language here can be criticized.

121
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:37.390
Wordplay aside West might have reasonably wanted plaintiff to be sober as a

122
00:08:37.431 --> 00:08:41.060
proxy for the likelihood of writing a satisfactory book.

123
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.100
In terms of consideration,

124
00:08:43.101 --> 00:08:47.480
it's plausible that West would not have been willing to make an unconditional

125
00:08:47.481 --> 00:08:52.290
promise to pay the $4 extra,
uh,
uh,

126
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:53.383
per page.

127
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:58.680
This abstinence condition might have been what induced,
uh,

128
00:08:58.681 --> 00:09:01.170
west to promise to pay more money.

129
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:06.200
And so the condition seems to satisfy the bargain for or inducement conception

130
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:09.270
of consideration.
On the other hand,

131
00:09:09.271 --> 00:09:14.271
the law of conditions fosters a policy favoring freedom from contract.

132
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.240
If an express condition proceeding has failed the promise or may be discharged

133
00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:24.140
from the contract without any obligation to compensate the promise.

134
00:09:24.141 --> 00:09:25.680
He for past performance,

135
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:31.160
whether a promise or like west was in fact prejudiced by the failure to remain

136
00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:35.220
abstinent is in material.
On the other hand,

137
00:09:35.221 --> 00:09:40.110
the strict application of the law of conditions can produce forfeitures,

138
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:44.280
especially where the promissory has not actually prejudice by the failure of a

139
00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:49.281
condition and the promise he has engaged in extensive preparation to perform or

140
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.990
indeed has uh,
uh,

141
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.630
performed in the past put differently if the condition turns out to be in

142
00:09:56.631 --> 00:10:01.320
material to the promise or and discharge will cause promising to forfeit her

143
00:10:01.321 --> 00:10:02.880
reliance,
uh,

144
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:07.900
in any country and has conferred a benefit on the promise or discharging the

145
00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:12.450
promise or may provide a severe test for uh,

146
00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:17.451
our commitment to freedom from a contract policy courts.

147
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:22.560
So dislike the forfeitures that enforcement of conditions can have,

148
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.550
that they are both willing to allow waiver,
uh,

149
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:31.670
waivers or modifications without consideration and they are willing as a factual

150
00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:37.650
matter to find waiver where there are serious questions as to whether waiver

151
00:10:37.651 --> 00:10:38.880
actually took place.

152
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.890
A waiver has been defined generally as the voluntary relinquishment of unknown

153
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:50.030
right in the context of express conditions of promissor may voluntarily

154
00:10:50.431 --> 00:10:54.060
relinquished the right to insist on an express condition.

155
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:59.490
Analysis reveals waivers of express conditions are associated with three

156
00:10:59.491 --> 00:11:03.720
recurring fact patterns,
election waiver,
Estoppel waiver,

157
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:07.320
and the waiver without either election or Estoppel.

158
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.680
These three fact patterns are aptly illustrated by insurance contract examples.

159
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:16.860
First,
let's think about election waiver.

160
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:22.040
Imagine that plaintiff insured has not satisfied and express condition that

161
00:11:22.801 --> 00:11:26.700
notice be given within 30 days after a covered accident,

162
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:32.090
but defended insurer with full knowledge Aleks to process the claim rather than

163
00:11:32.431 --> 00:11:33.264
deny payment.

164
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.840
Because of the promises election to process the claim after the condition has

165
00:11:38.881 --> 00:11:43.440
failed,
the insurer cannot thereafter insist upon the condition.

166
00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:48.890
Waiver is here inferred from the promise of wars conduct estoppel waiver.

167
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.030
Instead,

168
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:55.420
it can be seen in the following example immediately after the accident.

169
00:11:55.421 --> 00:12:00.421
Imagine that defendant insurer tells plaintiff insured not to worry about the 30

170
00:12:01.181 --> 00:12:03.760
day notice condition.
Relying on this,

171
00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:08.680
the plaintiff submits notice within 45 days of the accident and then the

172
00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:11.050
defendant refuses to process the claim.

173
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:16.150
The condition is waived because plaintiff has materially changed his or her

174
00:12:16.151 --> 00:12:19.510
position in reliance upon defendant's representation.

175
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.650
Waiver is inferred from the promissory his words,

176
00:12:23.651 --> 00:12:26.350
the representation and the promises.

177
00:12:26.351 --> 00:12:31.351
Reliance waiver without election or Estoppel can be seen in this example after

178
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:37.330
the plaintiff insured has substantially performed the contract.

179
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.220
Defendant states that it will not insist upon a nonmaterial condition.

180
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.240
The condition is waived without election or Estoppel,

181
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.920
but more broadly when one party has promised are represented that he or she will

182
00:12:50.921 --> 00:12:53.200
not insist upon express conditions.

183
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:57.550
Waiver becomes a judicial device to avoid forfeiture.

184
00:12:57.551 --> 00:13:02.140
In particular cases where an agreed modification cannot be found.

185
00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:06.940
The willingness of courts defined waiver without reliance or Estoppel is another

186
00:13:06.941 --> 00:13:11.941
indication of the judicial hostility to conditions and their potential for

187
00:13:12.311 --> 00:13:13.144
forfeiture.

188
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:17.830
It shouldn't surprise you that many courts will not enforce anti waiver

189
00:13:17.831 --> 00:13:18.664
provisions,

190
00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:23.850
which for example might say that waivers must be supported by consideration or

191
00:13:23.891 --> 00:13:26.800
that waivers of conditions must be in writing.

192
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.280
Finding the courts find that such anti waiver provisions are also waived by the

193
00:13:33.371 --> 00:13:38.050
party's conduct or words
in Clark versus West.

194
00:13:38.051 --> 00:13:42.010
The plaintiff's claim that the copyright of the book in the name of a

195
00:13:42.011 --> 00:13:46.270
corporation of West Corporation violated the terms of the agreement.

196
00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.840
This possible bad action and copywriting.

197
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:55.330
The book in the name of the corporation might have been the real dispute in the

198
00:13:55.331 --> 00:14:00.331
case west by incorporating was playing fast and loose with the copyright to

199
00:14:00.341 --> 00:14:05.341
Clark's book and might this had been made it easier for the court to find a

200
00:14:05.381 --> 00:14:08.170
waiver on the abstinence condition?
Well,

201
00:14:08.171 --> 00:14:13.060
this is a legal realist question influenced by the forfeiture issue.

202
00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:18.280
Clark completed the book without apparently any quality impairment and the

203
00:14:18.281 --> 00:14:20.470
profits were we're rolling in.

204
00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:24.550
This implies that West got what it really bargained for and could gain a

205
00:14:24.551 --> 00:14:26.440
windfall through this forfeiture.

206
00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.610
So if west is playing games with the copyright and is trying to get a book worth

207
00:14:30.611 --> 00:14:35.560
$6 a page for $2 but the court a good court supposed to do.

208
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.370
Let's review.
Today,

209
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:42.490
we talked about waivers of express conditions.

210
00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:47.560
We learned that the promise or benefiting from an express condition may waive

211
00:14:47.561 --> 00:14:49.990
that condition without the promise.
See,

212
00:14:49.991 --> 00:14:54.991
providing any consideration for the modification if the condition does not go to

213
00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:59.890
core consideration of the original contract.
