1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.330
Instead of awarding damages,

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.740
courts may order the breaching party to actually perform its promise.

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.280
This is known as specific performance and it's the subject of today's lecture.

4
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.320
Uh,
today we're going to be talking about Northern Indiana public service company

5
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:24.321
versus Carbon County coal decided by the seventh circuit in 1986 in that case,

6
00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:32.211
Northern Indiana public service company or Nipsco entered into a 20 year

7
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:38.001
contract to buy about one and a half million tons of coal from Carbon County

8
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.700
every year for 20 years at a price of $24 per ton subject to a price escalation

9
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:46.494
clause.

10
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.790
The contract price eventually escalated $44 per time,

11
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.970
but because of a large drop in the price of oil,

12
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.030
Nipsco was able to buy electricity at prices below the cost of generation.

13
00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:01.410
With Cole Nipsco,

14
00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:05.850
the plaintiff sought declaratory judgment that it was excused from the contract.

15
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.450
Carbon County counterclaimed for specific performance.

16
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.110
The Trial Court denied specific performance and enter to a jury verdict for,
uh,

17
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.330
for the defendant for $181 million.

18
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.590
Both parties appealed and the instant court affirmed.

19
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.860
The central issue is this was carbon county and titled to specific performance

20
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.830
in an opinion written by Judge Richard Posner who as I've mentioned before is

21
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.190
known for his economic analysis of law.

22
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.640
The court held that Carbon County was not entitled to specific performance and a

23
00:01:43.981 --> 00:01:48.981
four and affirmed the damage awarded by the trial court pose near explained that

24
00:01:49.741 --> 00:01:54.741
quote like other equitable remedies specific performance is available only if

25
00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:59.901
damages are not adequate remedy and there's no reason to suppose them inadequate

26
00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:03.610
here.
Basically the test is a,

27
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.400
you don't give spe specific performance if awarding dollars would be sufficient

28
00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:11.250
to compensate.
Further,

29
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.280
Posner noted that Carbon County did not even argue that the award was not a

30
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.050
reasonable estimate of damages.
Rather,

31
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:22.050
it complained that without specific performance,

32
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.160
the miners employed by carbon county will lose their jobs.

33
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.270
Posner dismiss this reasoning saying that quote,

34
00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:35.250
since the employees are not parties to the contract,
their losses are irrelevant.

35
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.680
Indeed.
Continued poster with his characteristic economic tilt,

36
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.070
quote specific performance would be improper as well and as a necessary here

37
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.660
because it would force the continuation of production that has become

38
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.750
uneconomical and continuing to produce coal under compulsion of an order of

39
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.920
specific performance would impose costs on society greater than the benefits

40
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.980
poster.
Also predicts that were he to grant specific performance,

41
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.250
the miners would lose their jobs anyway because carbon county would merely use

42
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:19.381
the threat of specific performance as a bargaining chip in order to extract a

43
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:21.460
larger settlement payment.

44
00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:26.461
From Nipsco note that Posner's argument here is an application of the coast

45
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:31.930
there,
whether or not the court grants specific performance,

46
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.230
the efficient economic outcome is the closing of the mind and the coast there.

47
00:03:37.741 --> 00:03:42.080
I'm suggests that it's going to occur whether or not specific performance does

48
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.090
or ordered and the parties will simply negotiate how to split the economic

49
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:48.514
savings

50
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.040
as this case makes clear specific performance.

51
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.490
There's only a last resort available only if damages,
uh,

52
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.250
provide an inadequate remedy.
In other words,

53
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:05.050
the law does not actually require a promise or to keep his promise as long as

54
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:09.220
the promise or is willing to compensate the injured promise with cash.

55
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.800
To paraphrase Oliver Wendell Holmes,

56
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.640
a contractual duty is the duty to perform or pay damages.

57
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.710
Those who believe it is a moral to break the promise may find this troubling.

58
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.730
The laws ethically neutral approach to breach of contract is often justified by

59
00:04:27.491 --> 00:04:32.491
the theory of efficient breach under the theory of a bridge of efficient breach

60
00:04:33.431 --> 00:04:38.050
of promise or should be allowed to breach his promise as long as he compensates

61
00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:42.940
the primacy because of promise or will only tend to breach when the benefits

62
00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:47.941
from her breach or greater than the promises benefit from the promise or his

63
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:48.874
performance.

64
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.400
The theory of efficient breach can be illustrated with an example.

65
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.880
Suppose Acme contracts to sell a machine to big company for $100,000 the machine

66
00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:04.510
is worth $110,000 to big.

67
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.470
Who plans to use it to manufacture widgets.
However,

68
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.150
prior to the delivery date,

69
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.390
custom manufacturing offers to buy the machine from acne for $120,000.

70
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.450
Instead of delivering the machine to big his promise,

71
00:05:19.451 --> 00:05:24.430
acme sells the machine to custom manufacturing for 120,000.

72
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.940
What are bigs damages?
Well,

73
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.670
Acme must pay big $10,000 in damages.

74
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.880
The value of the machine to big less the price it would have to pay even after

75
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:40.540
paying damages.

76
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.720
Acme who received $20,000 more by breaching still comes out ahead.

77
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.470
This is considered an efficient breach because the machine was ultimately sold

78
00:05:50.471 --> 00:05:55.240
to custom manufacturing the party that apparently valued the machine the most.

79
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.561
However,

80
00:05:56.561 --> 00:06:01.561
there is a potential flaw in using the theory of efficient breach to justify

81
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.440
specific performance for the sale of the good.
If instead of damages,

82
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.840
big was granted specific performance,

83
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:13.280
acme would have to sell the machine to big for $100,000.

84
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.920
But acme would then have an incentive to bargain,
uh,

85
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.120
with big to modify Acmes performance duty.

86
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.860
Posner would predict that big would be willing to pay acme somewhere between 10

87
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:28.850
and $20,000 in order to avoid.

88
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:31.700
The courts order to inefficiently perform.

89
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:34.573
Let's review.

90
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.820
Today we learned that courts favor monetary damages over a specific performance.

91
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.001
Generally,

92
00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:46.001
specific performance is available only if monetary damages are an inadequate

93
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:47.090
remedy.
