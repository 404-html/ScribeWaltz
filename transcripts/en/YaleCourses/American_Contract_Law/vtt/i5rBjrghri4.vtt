00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.550
Congratulations on surviving.
The last lecture is on the parol evidence rule.

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.920
Today we're going to talk about contractual interpretation in Pacific gas and

3
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:13.470
electric versus Thomas Trey Edge.

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.100
In 1968 California Supreme Court case,

5
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.240
the parties disagreed about the meaning of a provision in a contract.

6
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.890
One side argued that the provision was clear from its plain meaning but the

7
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:30.160
other side argued that it's that if extrinsic evidence,
uh,

8
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.650
were admitted to aid interpretation,
they were proved the meaning was different.

9
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.770
Defendant Thomas agreed to replace part of Pacific's turbine quote at its own

10
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:42.150
risk and expense.

11
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.580
Thomas also agreed to indemnified Pacific against any loss,
damage,

12
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.610
expense and liability resulting from injury to property arising out of or in any

13
00:00:53.251 --> 00:00:55.830
way connected with performance unquote.

14
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.610
During the work the turbine cover fell and damage the turbine rotor Pacific

15
00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:04.800
sought indemnification for its cost of repair.

16
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.900
Thomas claimed that the contract only covered damages to third party property

17
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.440
and sought to introduce evidence to prove this interpretation.

18
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.520
The trial court excluded defendants parole evidence and found for the plaintiff

19
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.960
the instant court reversed.

20
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.520
So should the trial court have allowed defendants parole evidence for a to be

21
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:32.250
admitted for the purpose of establishing the party's intent.

22
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.830
The Supreme Court of California reversed the decision below and held that the

23
00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:40.560
parole evidence was admissible in this case.

24
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.310
The trial court conceded that the provision contained quote the classic language

25
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:49.860
of a third party indemnity provision unquote,

26
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.420
but nevertheless concluded that the plain language of the provision which

27
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:59.280
indemnified Pacific against injury to property without explicitly limiting the

28
00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:04.281
clause to third party property required the defendant to compensate Pacific for

29
00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:06.000
damage to Pacific's property.

30
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.840
The Supreme Court decision was written by Chief Justice Roger Trainer who we've

31
00:02:11.941 --> 00:02:16.170
read earlier in the course when we discuss Drennan versus star paving,

32
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.740
justice trainer's decision and Pacific Gas held that the trial court used the

33
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:23.800
wrong test.
It wrote quote,

34
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.620
the test of admissibility of extrinsic evidence to explain the meaning of a

35
00:02:28.621 --> 00:02:32.760
written instrument is not whether it appears to the court to be playing and

36
00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:34.350
unambiguous on its face,

37
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.670
but whether the offered evidence is relevant to prove a meaning to which the

38
00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:43.080
language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible unquote.

39
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.890
The court then held that the indemnification clause was reasonably susceptible

40
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.770
to the meaning offered by the defendant.
Accordingly,

41
00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:57.210
the court held that the evidence of the that have that meaning offered by the

42
00:02:57.211 --> 00:03:00.970
defendant was admissible and reversed the trial court's judgement

43
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.640
after the decision.

44
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.200
Is it the defendant in Pacific Gas free from liability for damaging Pacific's

45
00:03:09.201 --> 00:03:12.740
turbine rotor?
Not necessarily.

46
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.720
The court held that the defendant was able to introduce parole evidence that the

47
00:03:17.721 --> 00:03:22.400
clause was only meant to Deb nifae damage to third party property because the

48
00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:26.690
clause was reasonably susceptible to this meaning if Henri man,

49
00:03:26.691 --> 00:03:30.860
the evidence is unconvincing,
the defendant may still lose the case.

50
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.680
Judge trainor and Pacific gas would have the trial judge hold a preliminary

51
00:03:36.681 --> 00:03:41.390
hearing to examine the proffered evidence,
whether it be courser performance,

52
00:03:41.391 --> 00:03:46.070
a prior course of dealing trade usage or other circumstances to determine

53
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.450
whether the language of the contract is reasonably susceptible to the meaning

54
00:03:50.451 --> 00:03:54.080
claim to be supported by the evidence it is here.

55
00:03:54.081 --> 00:03:57.650
That evidence is either admitted or excluded put differently.

56
00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.420
The only way to know whether there is ambiguity is to first look at the

57
00:04:02.421 --> 00:04:06.980
extrinsic evidence.
If the parties have drafted a clear and complete agreement,

58
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.190
the odds favor exclusion of all but the most compelling extrinsic evidence such

59
00:04:12.411 --> 00:04:16.970
as course of performance indicating how both parties interpreted the term or a

60
00:04:16.971 --> 00:04:19.520
trade usage to which both parties are bound.

61
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.810
Section two 12 of the restatement in comment be takes a position that is

62
00:04:26.241 --> 00:04:28.790
consistent with that expressed by judge trainer.

63
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.120
It is sometimes said that extrinsic evidence can not change the plain meaning of

64
00:04:35.931 --> 00:04:40.850
a writing,
but meaning can almost never be playing except in a context.

65
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.040
Any determination of meaning or ambiguity should only be made in the light of

66
00:04:46.041 --> 00:04:49.670
the relevant evidence of the situation and relations of the parties.

67
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.160
The subject matter of the transaction,

68
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.400
preliminary negotiations and statements made therein usages of trade and the

69
00:04:57.891 --> 00:05:00.740
course of dealings between the parties unquote.

70
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.900
The UCC provides no comprehensive approach to contract interpretation.

71
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.950
However,
as we discussed earlier in connection with the Alyeska case,

72
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.250
UCC to two oh two a provides the terms in an integrated writing may be explained

73
00:05:16.881 --> 00:05:21.881
or supplemented quote by chorus or performance course of dealing or usage of

74
00:05:21.981 --> 00:05:24.170
trade unquote UCC.

75
00:05:24.171 --> 00:05:29.171
Section one three Oh three explicitly encourages the use of these important

76
00:05:29.691 --> 00:05:34.400
extrinsic aids in the interpretation process.
It reads,
quote,

77
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.230
a course of performance or course of dealing between the parties or usage of

78
00:05:39.231 --> 00:05:44.090
trade and the vocation or trade in which they are engaged or which they are or

79
00:05:44.091 --> 00:05:48.740
should be aware is relevant and ascertaining the meaning of the parties

80
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.930
agreement and may give particular meaning to specific terms of the agreement and

81
00:05:53.931 --> 00:05:57.560
may supplement or qualify the terms of the agreement unquote.

82
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.080
The Pacific gas rule is not,
however,
without it's formalist critics,

83
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.030
judge Alex Kosinski,

84
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:10.031
a prominent judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has criticized the rule

85
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.290
in extreme terms in the trident center versus Connecticut General Life Insurance

86
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:20.240
Company case over three paragraphs.
In that opinion,
judge consists,

87
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:25.420
judge Kozinski asserted that the rule makes any contract regardless of how

88
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:27.650
carefully it was negotiated,

89
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.130
susceptible to attack by parole evidence,

90
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.630
including self-serving testimony offered by partisan witnesses.

91
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.250
He questioned whether such an approach is more likely divulge the original

92
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:41.480
intention of the parties.

93
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.460
Then reliance on seemingly clear words they agreed upon at the time,

94
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.170
unquote.
Further,

95
00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:52.910
he added that the rationale underlying the rule chips away at the foundation of

96
00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:57.911
our legal system because written language is used in statutes used to imprison,

97
00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:02.150
violate,
used to imprison violators,
decrees,

98
00:07:02.151 --> 00:07:06.350
orders by courts and precedents binding lower courts.

99
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.800
If quote words are inadequate to express concepts unquote cause then judge

100
00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:16.730
Kozinski ass.
How can uh,
uh,
legal system so depend on language?

101
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:21.230
How can we ever find that a criminal statute gave a defendant adequate notice of

102
00:07:21.231 --> 00:07:23.120
what was and was not criminal?

103
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.370
While California adheres to its specific gas rule,

104
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:33.400
other jurisdictions such as New York take the more formalist plain meaning

105
00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:37.420
approach that a judge Kozinski would prefer.
In,

106
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.900
in 1,990 opinion,

107
00:07:38.901 --> 00:07:43.901
New York's highest court wrote quote of familiar and eminently sensible

108
00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:49.451
proposition of law is that when parties set down their agreement in a clear,

109
00:07:49.461 --> 00:07:51.980
complete document,
they're writing should,

110
00:07:51.981 --> 00:07:54.890
as a rule be enforced according to its terms,

111
00:07:55.310 --> 00:08:00.310
it's well settled that extrinsic and parole evidence is not admissible to create

112
00:08:00.441 --> 00:08:05.441
an ambiguity in a written agreement which is complete and clear and unambiguous

113
00:08:06.501 --> 00:08:10.880
upon its face unquote.
Let's recap.

114
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.770
Today,
we talked about contractual interpretation in many jurisdictions,

115
00:08:15.771 --> 00:08:16.330
extrinsic,

116
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:21.170
Kevin's may only be introduced to clarify ambiguous language in the contract.

117
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.420
Other jurisdictions such as California,
take a looser approach in California,

118
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.140
even if a contract appears unambiguous on its face,

119
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.860
parties may introduce evidence to Peru to prove a meaning.

120
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:38.540
If the language of the contract is reasonably susceptible to that,
meaning.
