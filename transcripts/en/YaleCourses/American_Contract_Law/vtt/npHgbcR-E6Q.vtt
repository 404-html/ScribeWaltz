1
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.260
The next case asks what court should do when two parties interpret a term in a

2
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:07.890
contract differently.

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.570
The case of for gala meant importing versus BNS.

4
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:17.070
International Sales Corporation comes to us from the Federal District Court in

5
00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:19.680
New York City because the plaintiff,

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.910
a Swiss company is suing an American company for breach of warranty.

7
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.810
The underlying issue as judge friendly rights is what is chicken.

8
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.650
The buyer for gala meant importing company announces via its New York agent that

9
00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:41.910
it was looking to buy.
Chickens have particular weights at particular prices.

10
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.360
The seller BNS international agreed to sell the buyer dozens of tons of us fresh

11
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:49.920
frozen chicken.
Great.

12
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:54.921
A government inspected eviscerated of two different weights at the set prices,

13
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.750
the smaller birds that it sent at at a higher price.
We're roasters,

14
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.960
quote young chicken suitable for a broiling and frying unquote,

15
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.100
but the larger birds were quotes,
stewing chickens or fowl,

16
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.410
which the Swiss buyers rejected.

17
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.160
They said that the word chicken referred only to broilers and friars and not to

18
00:01:19.231 --> 00:01:22.290
the old hens that seller had sent,

19
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.960
which it called foul even.

20
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:29.780
So the seller sent the second agreed upon shipment of chicken to the buyer of

21
00:01:29.781 --> 00:01:30.780
the following day.

22
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.790
The buyers then brought suit in the Federal District Court in New York City for

23
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:39.330
breach of warranty.
We're reading judge friendlies,

24
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.950
findings of fact and conclusions of law from the trial court.

25
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.260
Judge Henry friendly is an incredibly famous judge whose life and death are

26
00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:53.220
memorialized in a Harvard law review essay called the lawyers death.

27
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.350
Uh,
which is included in this module's reading materials.

28
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.490
Judge friendly runs through a number of arguments that persuaded him that the

29
00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:09.591
defendant sellers should win given the two parties different interpretations of

30
00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:12.420
the word chicken.
First,

31
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.430
he found that the seller had written a telegram to the buyer's agent to ask what

32
00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:22.431
chicken meant to which he answered that any kind of chicken was acceptable and

33
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:27.660
at further clarified that the term was equivalent to the German term Hoon,

34
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.300
which does include stewing chickens.

35
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.400
Each party also brought in an expert witnesses to testify on the meeting of

36
00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:36.090
chicken,

37
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.380
but both side's expert's testified that when they wanted to make sure they

38
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:41.460
didn't get foul,

39
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.320
they would add clarifying language to specify that they wanted broiling
chickens.

40
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.630
The Department of Agriculture Regulations to which the contract referred also

41
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.010
included stewing chickens among chickens.
Finally,

42
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.160
judge friendly looked at the price that frig offered for the larger chickens,

43
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:03.280
which was 33 cents.

44
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:07.690
He found that of all the things that the word chicken could describe,

45
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.580
only stewing chickens had a market price that matched at the time the contract

46
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:14.440
was made for Galman.

47
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.940
Therefore knew or should have known that it could only expect stewing chickens

48
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:20.260
for the price it was pain.

49
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.680
Section two oh two of the second restatement of contracts in capsulates.

50
00:03:25.681 --> 00:03:29.950
Some of the principles that judge friendly uses an interpreting the contract.

51
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.820
He interprets it in La in the light of all of the circumstances,

52
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:37.360
including the prevailing market prices for different types of chicken.

53
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:38.260
He interrupts.

54
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.790
It's a contract as a whole and tries to determine what the quote generally

55
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:47.050
prevailing meaning unquote is through the use of dictionaries,

56
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.110
regulations and expert testimony and he examines the extent to which for gallons

57
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.220
acquiesce to BNS is performance to determine if they had consistently objected

58
00:03:57.221 --> 00:03:59.950
to the stewing chickens,
judge friendlies,

59
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:04.180
arguments about what each of the parties knew or should've known corresponds

60
00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:09.181
with the rule from section two oh one subparagraph two of the restatement party

61
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.750
a.
His interpretation of the contract is binding if party be knew or should have

62
00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:17.350
known party A's interpretation and not vice versa.

63
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.270
In this case the buyer should have been aware and may have actually been aware

64
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.220
that the seller was not quote a member of the trade unquote and would not know

65
00:04:27.221 --> 00:04:32.221
any meaning for the word chicken other than the usual one in a latter case.

66
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.790
Judge friendly suggested that this case should have been decided under the

67
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:39.640
peerless doctrine.
As you'll recall,

68
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:43.870
that is the English case where the court said there was no contract at all

69
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:48.010
because the parties had been referring to different ships by the same name.

70
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:50.320
Peerless in the peerless case.

71
00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:55.321
There was no reason to think that one party was right in his actual opinion.

72
00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:55.991
In this case,

73
00:04:55.991 --> 00:05:00.520
judge friendly suggests that the correct reading of the word chicken in this

74
00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:02.560
contract includes stewing chicken.

75
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.030
He laid his later decision suggests that this case did involve true

76
00:05:07.031 --> 00:05:07.990
equivocation,

77
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.280
where there is no reason to decide that one party is reading is any better than

78
00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:13.114
the others.

79
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.390
This equivocation a belief would mean that there was no contract between for

80
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.220
Galman and BNS even.

81
00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:25.150
So the end result would not have been very different as judge friendly would've

82
00:05:25.151 --> 00:05:29.800
still ruled for the defendant seller who had reasonably relied on the plaintiff

83
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.030
buyer's promise.

84
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.170
Another doctrine that lurks in the background of this case is,

85
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.410
is contra proffer endom that we read ambiguous contractual terms against the

86
00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:47.041
party who drafted them here for Galman chose the word chicken in phrasing it's

87
00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:52.321
order and BNS reasonably provided something that coincided with an objective

88
00:05:52.481 --> 00:05:53.710
meaning of chicken.

89
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.340
The drafter would have the burden of showing that this was within the meaning of

90
00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:03.110
the contract and it did not successfully do this,
uh,
in this case.

91
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.560
So here's a quiz.

92
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.480
Now imagine that a young person contracts to buy 100 mice from an older person.

93
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.280
When the older person delivers 100 live mice instead of 100 computer mice,

94
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.380
the young person sues for breach of contract,

95
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.000
which pieces of evidence would help the older person's case?

96
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.721
Well,

97
00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:34.721
a and c would help the older person's case see falls under section two o to the

98
00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:39.500
young person should have known that the older person interpreted the agreement

99
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:40.334
differently.

100
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:46.150
A provides and in light of all the circumstances argument that the older person

101
00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:51.410
reasonably concluded that the young person wanted live mice to feed his cats.

102
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.210
B And d both provide reasons why the older person should have known that

103
00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.380
computer mice were wanted and so they would help the younger person's case.

104
00:07:00.381 --> 00:07:01.214
Instead,

105
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.880
we have seen the courts use a variety of methods to determine the meaning of

106
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.480
contract provisions,
dictionaries,
regulations,

107
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.870
maxims of interpretations such as Contra Proffer,

108
00:07:13.871 --> 00:07:18.871
Endone and the economic context are just a few examples where two parties

109
00:07:20.201 --> 00:07:22.900
disagree.
Section two oh one sub paragraph.

110
00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:27.460
Two of the restatement says that the courts can look at which party knew.

111
00:07:27.461 --> 00:07:28.930
The other is interpretation.

112
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:33.790
If a party knew the other party interpreted the contract differently,

113
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.510
they'll lose because they should have clarified the contract.
