00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.780
Today we're going to look at a well known case,

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.310
Allegheny college versus national,
uh,

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.110
Chautauqua County Bank of Jamestown,

4
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.330
which was decided by the highest court of the state of New York in 1927.

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.950
We will use the case to talk more broadly about some issues related to

6
00:00:19.951 --> 00:00:21.090
promissory Estoppel.

7
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.680
The case concerns a promise to make a charitable bequest.

8
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.760
Allegheny college,
a college in Northwestern Pennsylvania,

9
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.030
ran a fundraising drive in 1921 and persuaded Merrie Yates Johnston,

10
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:40.461
who lived in New York to promise to make a donation of $5,000 upon her death.

11
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.660
She signed a document to that effect and two witnesses signed as well.

12
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.260
She donated $1,000 in 1923 while she was still alive and she later retracted her

13
00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:56.190
promise.
Now,
when the case is being argued,

14
00:00:56.191 --> 00:01:00.960
Ms. Johnston has passed away and the college was trying to enforce her promise

15
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:04.620
against the bank that was serving as the executor of her estate.

16
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.900
In this case,
a judge Benjamin Cardozo.

17
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.900
Later Justice Cardozo had to decide whether Mrs Johnston's promise was

18
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.910
enforceable for lack of consideration.

19
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.020
Cardozo spends a significant portion of his decision discussing the doctrine of

20
00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:25.710
promissory Estoppel,

21
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.550
which he sees as a new direction in which contract law's evolving.

22
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.070
Promissory Estoppel is quote,

23
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.140
a substitute for consideration or an exception to its ordinary requirements

24
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.240
unquote.
Ordinarily,
ordinarily,
as we've discussed in past weeks,

25
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.450
a valid contract must include consideration which is bargained for benefit to

26
00:01:47.911 --> 00:01:51.450
the promise or illegal detriment to the promise.
See,

27
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.100
promissory Estoppel is quite different under this doctrine.

28
00:01:56.101 --> 00:02:00.810
A promise is enforceable if the promise he incurs expense to the knowledge of

29
00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:05.250
the promissory note and in reasonable belief that the promise would be kept.

30
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.790
Doughnut of promises to nonprofit institutions such as schools and churches

31
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.250
often give rise to this kind of reliance as the don't ease embark on big

32
00:02:17.461 --> 00:02:20.550
construction projects that depend on the promised money.

33
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.390
Notice that the focus in these cases is on the promises reliance interest.

34
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.680
They have adjusted their behavior in response to a promise and therefore are

35
00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:34.020
harmed.
When some promises are broken,

36
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.760
they might be left with half a building because the funding for the rest did not

37
00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:39.594
come through.

38
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.150
Cardoza notes that judges in New York have adopted the doctrine of promissory

39
00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:49.800
Estoppel as the equivalent of consideration in connection with our law of

40
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:52.740
charitable subscription.
In doing so,

41
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.090
the judges have been influenced by conceptions of public policy.

42
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.110
They believe that charitable organizations do important and beneficial work that

43
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:06.400
would not be possible without an ability to rely on promise donations.

44
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.950
Organizations need to be able to plan for the future.
Today,

45
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:16.951
promissory Estoppel in New York is no longer restricted only to context such as

46
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:18.460
charitable subscriptions,

47
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.540
but it does have some additional elements not required.

48
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:27.220
In section 90 of the restatement of contracts in New York,

49
00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:31.690
the promise must be clear and unambiguous and the reliance must be foreseeable

50
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:35.260
to the promise or and reasonable by the promise.
See,

51
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.620
and the resulting injury must be unconscionable.

52
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.660
It's possible that promissory estoppel would have developed more quickly,

53
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.820
but for judge Cardozo's failure to use it in Allegheny college.

54
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.610
So why didn't judge Cardozo use the doctrine of promissory Estoppel?

55
00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.090
One possibility is that section 90 of the first restatement requires a definite

56
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:06.160
and substantial reliance,
which is difficult to find.
In a case like this,

57
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.540
we can also ask what sort of damages,
uh,

58
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.770
should be available to plaintiff in cases based on promissory Estoppel,

59
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.660
the first restatement and some treatises of treated suits based on promissory

60
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:24.661
Estoppel as exactly like other contractual promissory claims with expectation

61
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:28.150
damages as the default rule.

62
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.340
But others have since argued that because the doctrine of promissory Estoppel is

63
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:35.710
based on the promises reliance,

64
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.090
the appropriate measure of damages is restricted to the promises reliance

65
00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:40.924
interest.

66
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.090
The second restatement suggests that promissory Estoppel follows the same rules

67
00:04:46.091 --> 00:04:48.880
for damages as other breach of contract cases.

68
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.180
But comment d to the section 90 section suggests the damages might quote

69
00:04:56.141 --> 00:05:01.141
sometimes to be limited to restitution or to damages or specific relief measured

70
00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:07.171
by the extent of the promises reliance rather than by the terms of the promise.

71
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.410
One of the main reasons for expectation damages is to ensure that courts fully

72
00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:17.920
compensate hidden reliance on uh,

73
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.940
in bargain for contracts.
In non bargain contracts,
courts,
uh,

74
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.970
can just protect reliance unless there's reason to suspect hidden reliance,

75
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.570
in which case they,

76
00:05:29.571 --> 00:05:34.030
you can use the expectation damaged measure to give this fuller protection.

77
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.100
So in practice,

78
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.150
what kind of damages are awarded today in promissory Estoppel cases,

79
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.070
legal scholars have read hundreds of promissory estoppel cases trying to

80
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:46.270
discover,
uh,

81
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.260
the answer to this question without coming to a clear consensus,

82
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.820
but it's reasonable to conclude that for non charity promises,

83
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.230
uh,

84
00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:01.230
the damages may be less generous than what is given under contract law.

85
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.630
Cardozo does not end up ruling based on promissory Estoppel.

86
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.840
Rather,
he argues that there was consideration in this case.

87
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.320
Ms. Johnson specified that her quote gift should be known as the Merrie Yates

88
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.263
Johnston Memorial Fund unquote.

89
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.750
He argues that by implication the college undertook when it accepted a portion

90
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:31.301
of the gift that in its circular is of information and another customary ways

91
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.940
when making announcements of the scholarship,

92
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.870
it would couple with the announcement,
the name of the donor.

93
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.840
Does this remind you of another Cardozo opinion?
Well,
it should.

94
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:50.170
Cardosa also found an implied return promise to serve as consideration in wood

95
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:52.880
versus Lucy lady death.
Gordon.

96
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.100
There it was the implied promise to use reasonable efforts in an exclusive

97
00:06:58.101 --> 00:06:59.120
dealing agreement.

98
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.620
Here it is an implied promise to publicize the donor's name.

99
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:09.310
From these two cases we can start thinking of Cardozo as the great employer.

100
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:15.140
There seems to be no nude promise that he can't close with implied return

101
00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:18.530
consideration.
Commenters.

102
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.480
Commentators have tended to view Cardoza's characterization of the transaction

103
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:28.481
quite skeptically and we can see this already in judge Kellogg's dissent in this

104
00:07:28.701 --> 00:07:30.350
case.
First of all,

105
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:35.300
Kellogg's thinks that Miss Johnson's use of the term gift undermines the idea

106
00:07:35.301 --> 00:07:38.240
that the donation was intended to be a quid pro quo.

107
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:43.630
Further her inclusion that the line in her promise to donate was an almost was

108
00:07:45.261 --> 00:07:48.080
it most an offer?
The college never accepted it,

109
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:53.560
but he views ms Johnston's communication with the college as insufficiently

110
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:58.841
concrete and specific to really count as part of the bargaining that where that

111
00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:03.110
was leading up to a contract and so there was not even an offer.

112
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:08.830
Colleges and other nonprofits do frequently bargain with donors for naming

113
00:08:08.871 --> 00:08:09.680
rights,

114
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.570
but it seems highly unlikely that such a bargain took place and Mrs Johnson's

115
00:08:14.571 --> 00:08:19.571
case bargained for naming rights look much more like ordinary contracts and

116
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:24.380
would better fit the mold into which Cardozo tries to shove this case.

117
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:30.710
So which of the following is not an element of promissory Estoppel?

118
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:36.280
The promissory should foresee that the promise see would rely the promise.

119
00:08:37.131 --> 00:08:39.950
See,
does in fact rely on the promise,

120
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:45.110
the promissory and promise he bargained for the promise,
the promise,

121
00:08:45.111 --> 00:08:47.810
he was reasonable and relying on the promise.

122
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:50.271
Well,

123
00:08:50.271 --> 00:08:55.230
the answer is c promissory Estoppel applies in exactly those cases where there

124
00:08:55.231 --> 00:08:58.230
is no bargain for exchange between the two parties.

125
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:03.030
The other items are key things that courts look for in evaluating suit based on

126
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:04.200
promissory Estoppel.

127
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:11.180
So we have seen that promissory Estoppel allows courts to enforce promises even

128
00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:16.080
in the absence of consideration.
Instead of courts look at the promise,

129
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:20.940
sees a reasonable and genuine reliance on the promise and the promise or his

130
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:25.941
knowledge of or ability to foresee that the promise or would rely.

131
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.880
We've also seen that courts may use either the expectation measure or the

132
00:09:32.161 --> 00:09:35.940
reliance measure in assessing damages.
In these cases,
though,

133
00:09:35.941 --> 00:09:40.470
we've also seen that there has been some shift over time toward limiting damages

134
00:09:40.471 --> 00:09:41.310
to alliance.
