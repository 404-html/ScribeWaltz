00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.440
In the last lecture we talked about Taylor versus Caldwell and the doctrine of

2
00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:11.490
impossibility where performance is excused because the duty can no longer be

3
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:15.690
physically perform.
Today we'll learn about a related doctrine,

4
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:18.390
the doctrine of frustration of purpose,

5
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.690
where performance is excused even if performance is physically possible because

6
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.980
the buyer's purpose for which the promise was originally entered into is no

7
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:30.300
longer attainable.

8
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.440
We do this by looking at a 1903 English case called Krill versus Henry in Krill.

9
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.110
The plaintiff Krill owned an apartment from which the coronation pres procession

10
00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:48.810
of King Edward the seventh was visible.

11
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.350
The defendant Henry contracted to rent the apartment from Crowl on the day of

12
00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:59.520
the precession and paid a 25 pound deposit.
However,

13
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.150
the king fell ill and the coronation was postponed.

14
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.440
Henry refused to pay the remaining balance and eh,
uh,

15
00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:10.680
of the contracted rent,
which was 50 pounds.

16
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.050
Krell sued for this remaining balance and Henry counter sued for the original

17
00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:20.730
deposit pack.
The trial court found for the defendant Henry.

18
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.990
The instinct court affirmed with regard to the remaining balance and it did not

19
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:28.500
decide the counter claim which was withdrawn by Henry.

20
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.790
The central issue is this was the coronation and implied condition proceeded for

21
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:40.410
the rental contract and the court answered yes.

22
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.030
The court held that the postponement of the coronation defeated the understood

23
00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:46.470
purpose of the contract,

24
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.420
which was to license the flat and in a Hanzt rent for the purpose of viewing the

25
00:01:51.421 --> 00:01:52.254
coronation.

26
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.510
The court began by referencing the doctrine of impossibility by quoting Taylor

27
00:01:57.511 --> 00:02:02.511
versus Caldwell where the court said that if the parties understand that the

28
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.670
completion of a contract requires the continued existence of some particular

29
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.450
specified thing,

30
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.800
then the contract is not to be considered a positive contract,

31
00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:18.690
but as subject to an implied condition that the parties shall be excused in
case,

32
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:19.410
uh,

33
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.300
before breach performance becomes impossible from the perishing of the thing.

34
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.080
So does the doctrine of impossibility,

35
00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:32.700
excuse defendant from paying the balance of the rent in Krell versus Henry?

36
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.340
The answer's no.
The defendant contracted to rent an apartment from plaintiff,

37
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.680
though the royal procession was cancelled.

38
00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:43.110
This did not make performance impossible.

39
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.700
The plaintiff was still physically able to supply the room that the defendant

40
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:52.500
contracted to rent and uh,
and the defendant could still pay.
This,
however,

41
00:02:52.501 --> 00:02:53.970
did not stop the court.

42
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The court held that the principle underlying Taylor versus Caldwell is not

43
00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:03.790
limited to quote cases in which the event causing the impossibility of

44
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:08.791
performance is the destruction or nonexistence of some thing which is the

45
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:13.900
subject matter of the contract or if some condition or state of things expressly

46
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:15.700
specified as a condition of it.

47
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.040
The court expanded the principal to the underlying purpose of the contract

48
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.280
saying that one must first ascertain the substance of the contract and then ask

49
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:29.620
whether the contract needs for its foundation,

50
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:33.760
the assumption of the existence of,
of a particular state of things.

51
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.150
The court concluded that the use of the rooms was let and taken for the purpose

52
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:41.740
of seeing the royal possession.

53
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.720
That purpose was frustrated by the postponement and therefore the defendant's

54
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:48.250
breach was excused.

55
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.950
The reasoning relied upon by the court in Krell versus Henry has come to be

56
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:56.590
known as the frustration of purpose doctrine.

57
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.690
Section two 65 of the restatement describes the doctrine as follows,

58
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.390
where after a contract is made,

59
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:09.391
a party's principal purpose is substantially frustrated without his fault by the

60
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:14.620
occurrence of an event than non occurrence of which was a basic assumption on

61
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:16.180
which the contract was made.

62
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.110
His remaining duties to render performance or discharged,

63
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.410
unless the language of the circumstances indicate the contrary in another famous

64
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:29.380
but much older English case.

65
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.560
The court treated frustration of purpose very differently.

66
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.860
In Paradigm v Jane decided in 1647 the defendant rented land from the plaintiff.

67
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.533
However,

68
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.980
Prince Rupert of Germany invaded and took the land for three years during the

69
00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:49.360
English civil war and the defendant did not pay rent during that time.

70
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.390
The plaintiff sued for the rent owed,

71
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.110
but the defendant claimed that he owed nothing because of the invasion had

72
00:04:56.111 --> 00:04:58.750
frustrated his purpose in rendering the land,

73
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.570
which the purpose was to a possession.

74
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.830
The court held that the defendant was not excused from paying the rent.

75
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.040
Among other reasons,
the court reasoned that quote,

76
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.120
as the lessee is to have the advantage of casual profits.

77
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.010
So he must run the hazard of casual losses unquote.
In other words,

78
00:05:18.011 --> 00:05:23.011
if the plaintiff is able to retain the unexpected benefits from renting the land

79
00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:28.420
such as a bumper harvest,
the plaintiffs should also bear the unexpected losses.

80
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.760
How would the court and Krell versus Henry respond to this policy argument?

81
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.930
For example,

82
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:40.140
what would happen if instead of the coronation a decided to give a free concert

83
00:05:40.871 --> 00:05:44.710
underneath the balcony on the day that Henry rented the apartment,

84
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.220
the lease hold might be worth more under this circumstance,

85
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.860
but the lessee wouldn't have to pay more

86
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.880
in Krell versus Henry Henry paid a $25 25 pound deposit in advance and

87
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.270
counterclaim for its return.

88
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.870
The lower court held that Henry was entitled to the return of his deposit,

89
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.710
but Henry withdrew this counter claim on appeal,

90
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.450
perhaps to bolster his case by rep representing the deposit as part of

91
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.270
liquidated damages forfeited on his breach.

92
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.960
So the king's bench did not have to review the trial court's holding,
uh,

93
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.620
on appeal about the return of the deposit.

94
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.650
But in other coordination cases,

95
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.480
the plaintiffs sought and were denied restitution of the death of their down

96
00:06:32.481 --> 00:06:36.620
payments.
The gains and losses were left were the,

97
00:06:36.621 --> 00:06:38.930
they lay at the time of the frustration.

98
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:45.350
Impracticability is about increases in sellers costs of performing promises,

99
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:52.090
whereas frustration is centrally about decreases in buyers benefits when

100
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.280
unexpected events occur that either increase the seller's cost or decrease the

101
00:06:58.281 --> 00:06:59.330
buyer's benefit.

102
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.350
Courts sometimes discharge the party's duty to perform,

103
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.650
but doctrines are both.

104
00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:11.651
Doctrines are ways that courts make promises that seem unconditional on their

105
00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:16.901
face to be conditioned by default on the seller's performance,

106
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:22.571
not becoming impracticable or the buyer's benefit from performance not being

107
00:07:22.731 --> 00:07:27.170
frustrated by discharging performance.

108
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.020
When these bad news events occur,

109
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:35.230
these doctrines spread the risk of the bad news between the two contractors.

110
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.933
In Taylor,

111
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:43.060
it'd be adding insult to injury for the law to force the landlord to pay damages

112
00:07:43.311 --> 00:07:45.680
on top of losing his music.

113
00:07:45.681 --> 00:07:50.681
Call to fire their reluctance to have landlords in Krill disgorge.

114
00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:55.700
The rent deposit might be a rough way to spread risk of the bad news of

115
00:07:55.701 --> 00:08:00.680
coronation delay between the landlord and the tenant.
By the way,

116
00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:05.330
the law treats opportunity costs very differently than costs.

117
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:10.660
A seller who faces dramatically higher opportunity cost of performance will not

118
00:08:10.821 --> 00:08:13.100
have her promise discharge.

119
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:18.550
Imagine that Rockefeller had offered to pay the landlord $1 million to rent the

120
00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:20.780
apartment for the coronation.

121
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.340
The landlord's opportunity costs of renting to the initial renter would be

122
00:08:25.341 --> 00:08:28.460
dramatically higher because of Rockefellers offer,

123
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:33.740
but the landlord would be liable for damages if he breached in forcing the

124
00:08:33.741 --> 00:08:34.460
contract.

125
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:39.410
In response to good news of a competitive offer is a way of spreading the good

126
00:08:39.411 --> 00:08:44.411
news risk by encouraging landlords to compensate the previous tenant for being

127
00:08:44.871 --> 00:08:45.710
displaced.

128
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:51.200
The doctrines of frustration and impracticability may be circumstances where the

129
00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:56.201
law is driven as much by conceptions of equity as conceptions of efficiency.

130
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:02.520
Let's recap.
Today we learned about the frustration of purpose doctrine.

131
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.600
According to the frustration of purchase doc purpose doctrine.

132
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:11.870
Nonperformance of a contract may be excused if the purpose for which the parties

133
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:16.950
entered into the contract as frustrated by an event that was not contemplated by

134
00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:19.620
the parties at the time of the contract.
