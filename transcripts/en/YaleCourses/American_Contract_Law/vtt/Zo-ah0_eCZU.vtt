00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.310
Today we're going to explore something called the preexisting duty rule by

2
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:10.311
looking at a case called Alaska packers association versus Dark Medico,

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.040
which was decided by the ninth circuit in 1902,

4
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.920
the Alaska Packers Association hired a group of sailors and salmon fishing

5
00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:20.754
people,

6
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.910
including the named Appellee Dominico for a fishing expedition.

7
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.580
Alaska packers contracted to pay each of the workers $50 or $60 for the season.

8
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.250
But after the expedition began,

9
00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:40.251
the workers stopped work and demanded a pay increase to $100 for the season

10
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.700
because the location was remote and the season was shored.

11
00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:49.701
Alaska Packers Superintendent was unable to obtain replacement workers and so

12
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.980
conceited to the demands.
Uh,

13
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.570
when the work was completed and the workers returned from the expedition,

14
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.900
Alaska packers refused to honor the contractual modification and the worker sued

15
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.230
the trial court found for the plaintiff workers and the instant court reversed.

16
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.570
So the central issue is this,

17
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:16.110
was the contractual modification supported by consideration.

18
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.870
The ninth circuit held that the contractual modification lacked consideration.

19
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.700
The court observed that the workers agreed in writing for certain stated

20
00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:31.701
compensation to render their services to the appellant in remote waters where

21
00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:37.050
the season for conducting fishing operations is extremely short and and which,

22
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.540
and in which enterprise the appellant has a large amount of money invested.

23
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.201
In fact,

24
00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:47.970
it was $150,000 invested in 1900.

25
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.860
Uh,
that was a lot of money.

26
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.170
The workers then waited until it was impossible for the appellant to secure

27
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.520
other men in their places and without any valid cause.

28
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.850
Absolutely refuse to continue the services they were under contract to perform

29
00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:08.610
unless the appellant would consent to pay them more money.

30
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.570
The court concluded that Alaska packers consent to the workers' demands was a

31
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.660
without consideration for the reason that it was based solely upon the libel

32
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.930
it's agreement to render the exact services and none other that they were

33
00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:28.380
already under contract to render.
By the way,

34
00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:32.220
the plaintiffs are called liable.
It's because this is an admiralty case.

35
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.400
This is an example of what is known today as the preexisting duty rule.

36
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.580
The preexisting duty rule says that a preexisting duty cannot be used as

37
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:49.551
consideration for a contractual modification under the preexisting duty rule.

38
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:56.151
You can't promise not to kill the president for $1,000 because you already have

39
00:02:56.431 --> 00:03:00.970
a duty not to kill the president as applied to contractual modifications.

40
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.270
The preexisting duty rule says that modifications to a contract unsupported by

41
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:10.870
additional consideration are unenforceable.
In other words,

42
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:15.871
if a party promised this to do something that is already legally bound to do,

43
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.130
his promise will not count as consideration to support a new contract with the

44
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:21.970
higher price.

45
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.350
The law will regard the promise as a new pactum,

46
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.190
a naked promise,
unclothed in consideration.

47
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.910
So here's a pop quiz.

48
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.970
Consideration is normally regarded as something which is bargained for and given

49
00:03:37.971 --> 00:03:42.220
an exchange for a promise.
Was the additional pay bargain for?

50
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.340
Well,
the answer is yes.

51
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.760
This standard bargain requirement appears to have been satisfied in Alaska

52
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:55.840
packers.
The promise to increase the fishermen's wages was knocked gratuitous,

53
00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.400
but was given to induce the Fisher men to complete their jobs.

54
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.990
Why then does the court reject the fishermen's position?
Well,

55
00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:07.450
there's still this preexisting duty problem.

56
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.790
The fishermen already had a legal duty to perform the work.
So in legal effect,

57
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:15.070
they gave up nothing extra in return.

58
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.990
Threatening to withhold what you already had a legal duty to perform is not

59
00:04:19.991 --> 00:04:22.990
consideration with the con.

60
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.520
With this question of consideration aside the court in Alaska packers,

61
00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:32.521
it's also clearly concerned about the apparent duress exerted by the fishermen.

62
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.230
This was a holdup.
Extortion.

63
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.880
The fishermen seem to be saying to the defendants,
without justification,

64
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:43.060
unless you pay us more money to do the same work,

65
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.040
we will quit and leave you stuck in a remote Alaskan Bay without a paddle.

66
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.810
The court did not look kindly on the fishermen's gamesmanship,

67
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.520
citing and old Minnesota case called King versus railway company.

68
00:04:57.521 --> 00:04:59.260
The court wrote that quote,

69
00:04:59.261 --> 00:05:03.550
the party who refuses to perform and thereby coerces a promise from the other

70
00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:08.551
party to the contract to pay him and increasing an increased compensation for

71
00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:12.550
doing that which is legally bound to do,

72
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.730
takes an unjustifiable advantage of the necessity of that other party allowing

73
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:24.661
victims of a shakedown to enter into new but void contracts where uh,

74
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.930
they promise to make nonbinding promises to pay extra money might empower the

75
00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:37.891
promises to fend off the shakedowns the immutable rule that modification must be

76
00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:41.380
supported by consideration.

77
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:44.830
Thus might protect these potential victims.

78
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.020
The law does not allow them to be fleeced and,

79
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.270
and thereby might improve their bargaining strategy.

80
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.410
After this case.
Alaska packers can say,

81
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.700
I'd really like to promise to pay you more,

82
00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:01.190
but that won't be a legally binding promise.

83
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:07.510
The preexisting duty rule is captured in section 73 of the restatement,

84
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.530
which reads performance of a legal duty owed to a promissory,

85
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.300
which is neither doubtful nor the subject of honest dispute is not

86
00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:18.230
consideration,

87
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:24.100
but a similar performance is consideration if it differs from what was required

88
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:28.010
by the duty in a way which reflects more than a pretense of bargaining.

89
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.850
Note that the restatement definition allows for contractual modifications that

90
00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:40.181
settle honest legal disputes or reflect more than just a pretense of bargaining.

91
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.480
This is not inconsistent with the opinion in Alaska packers,

92
00:06:44.481 --> 00:06:49.310
which emphasize that the workers refuse to continue services without any valid

93
00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:53.150
cause.
Well,
what would be a valid cause?

94
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.810
What if plaintiffs had claimed that defendant Alaska,
uh,

95
00:06:56.811 --> 00:07:01.811
was somehow in breach of its duty to provide decent dormitories and the extra

96
00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:07.100
money was compensation for defendant's breach of the implicit promise to provide

97
00:07:07.101 --> 00:07:08.870
livable working conditions.

98
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.200
Or suppose that severe weather increased the risks of harm to the fishers,

99
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:20.350
or what if Alaska packers provided the fishermen with inferior nets?

100
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.270
This last point is more than just a hypothetical.
In Alaska packers,

101
00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:29.300
the fishermen tried to prove that the nets furnished to them.

102
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:34.570
We're not serviceable because they permitted smaller salmon to slip through in

103
00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:39.360
her law review article,
a fish story,
Alaska packers versus Dominica.

104
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.070
Debra 3-d suggests that the fishermen,

105
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:48.080
because of differences in language and experience might have misunderstood that

106
00:07:48.081 --> 00:07:52.910
the nets were serviceable.
While this would not justify a strike,

107
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.850
it tends to neutralize the claim of duress.

108
00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:01.210
3D also suggests that nets which appear on serviceable to those hoping to catch

109
00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:06.881
more fish would be perfect for the packers who were concerned about catching too

110
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:11.270
many fish or perhaps wanted to cut corners on the equipment.

111
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.130
So let's turn now to the uh,
uh,

112
00:08:16.131 --> 00:08:19.010
the problem of the dissatisfied entertainer.

113
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:24.110
Imagine that you are a justice of a state appellate court hearing and appeal

114
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:29.090
from a judgment entered in the circuit court after a jury trial in which the

115
00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:31.040
plaintiff,
Oliver Ajax,

116
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:36.430
received a verdict of $30,000 in a breach of contract action against the

117
00:08:36.561 --> 00:08:40.730
defendant James Bond.
On February 15th.

118
00:08:40.731 --> 00:08:45.731
A Jack and bond entered into a written contract whereby Ajax,

119
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.360
a professional entertainer,

120
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:52.660
was to perform at bond's resort for the week of July 1st through July 7th for a

121
00:08:54.291 --> 00:08:57.990
fee of $20,000.
In the late spring,

122
00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.730
Ajax had a hit record,

123
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
which virtually overnight made him a star who could command at least a $50,000

124
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:09.150
fee for a one week engagement.
In early June,

125
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.860
Ajax contacted bond to renegotiate their contract,

126
00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:18.390
demanding $50,000 for this one week,
uh,

127
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:22.950
uh,
engagement initially bond refuse to renegotiate.

128
00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:25.380
But when a Jack said that he would not perform,

129
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.410
bond relented after discussion.

130
00:09:28.411 --> 00:09:32.640
Bond dictated a new contract to a stenographer and the exact words of the

131
00:09:32.641 --> 00:09:35.790
original contract and running for the same period.

132
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.570
But with the compensation change to $50,000.

133
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:44.970
As they signed the new contract,
they tore up the old one.
Thereafter,

134
00:09:44.971 --> 00:09:46.740
Ajax kept the engagement,

135
00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:50.280
but bond refused to pay him more than $20,000.

136
00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:54.490
A Jack's filed the instant suit,
uh,
uh,

137
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:59.540
seeking the additional $30,000 over the defendant's objection.

138
00:10:00.481 --> 00:10:04.620
The trial judge instructed the jury as follows,
quote,

139
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:09.770
if you find that the $20,000 contract was prior to,

140
00:10:10.141 --> 00:10:15.141
or at the time of the execution of the $50,000 contract canceled and revoked by

141
00:10:15.841 --> 00:10:20.250
the parties by their mutual consent,
then it is your duty.

142
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:25.300
Find that there was consideration for the making of the contract in this suit.

143
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:26.910
And in that event,

144
00:10:26.911 --> 00:10:31.911
the plaintiff is entitled to your verdict in the amount of $30,000 unquote on

145
00:10:32.821 --> 00:10:36.120
this appeal.
The defendant contends that giving,

146
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:40.440
that the giving of this instruction constituted a reversible error.

147
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:46.740
So what should be done,
this case is,

148
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:51.770
and another example of consideration being really a matter of form.

149
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.650
If you can convince a court that is a formality,

150
00:10:55.651 --> 00:11:00.651
you tore up the first contract first and then replaced it with a second modified

151
00:11:01.231 --> 00:11:04.980
contract that really is convincing the court,
uh,

152
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.290
in a purely formal manner to give rise to a con,

153
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.230
a modified contract with no consideration.
But the idea of,

154
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.440
of consideration is merely being a formality is one that was actually championed

155
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:24.350
by Lon fuller who said that mere formalities can produce,

156
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.520
um,
functional goods.
A fuller,
uh,

157
00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:34.320
taught us that consideration as form might provide value,

158
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:34.950
uh,

159
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:39.950
because it provides one an evidentiary function of providing evidence to courts

160
00:11:40.231 --> 00:11:45.120
that the parties intended to contract.
It also provides a cautionary,

161
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:49.470
um,
a goal of a cautionary function.

162
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:54.400
That formalities might slow people down to make that they only enter into

163
00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:58.750
contracts that they want to be legally enforceable.
And finally,

164
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:03.100
formalities including consideration is merely a formality,

165
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:08.310
might serve a channeling function of channeling people toward contracts that,

166
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.320
um,
uh,

167
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.020
that they really want to be legally enforceable and channeling other kinds of

168
00:12:14.021 --> 00:12:16.750
agreements to nonlegal enforcement.

169
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:22.120
Now and while this is a positive view of consideration is form,

170
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:26.140
there's another image of consideration is formed that's not as happy.

171
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:31.320
It's a more cynical view that a consideration is a mere formality.

172
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.740
That is a trap,
uh,

173
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:38.380
for people who just don't know how to manipulate it or it's a way of generating

174
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:39.730
income for lawyers.

175
00:12:39.731 --> 00:12:43.600
You better go get a lawyer if you want to make sure that your contract is

176
00:12:43.601 --> 00:12:48.220
enforced because the lawyer will know enough to dress it up with the trappings

177
00:12:48.221 --> 00:12:49.300
of consideration.

178
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:54.590
May Be having the singer in the Ajax case sing an extra song or throw in a meet

179
00:12:55.991 --> 00:12:57.370
and greet with fans.

180
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.590
Let's move on to another case.

181
00:13:02.591 --> 00:13:06.550
This is the case of the subcontractors added inducement.

182
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:12.390
Edward Woodward in this is the owner of a large smelting operation in

183
00:13:12.461 --> 00:13:13.360
metropolis.

184
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:18.660
On August 7th Woodward entered into a written contract with Peter Rogers,

185
00:13:19.151 --> 00:13:24.151
a general contractor for the construction of an additional power plant at his

186
00:13:24.521 --> 00:13:25.600
place of business.

187
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:31.170
On August 14th Rogers entered into a written subcontract with John Newman for

188
00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:36.811
the erection of structural steelwork required for this new power plant and for

189
00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:40.300
the purpose of performing his work.

190
00:13:40.301 --> 00:13:44.800
Newman rented certain equipment for use until the job was completed.

191
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:50.170
The work continued until October 7th when the strike occurred among Newman's

192
00:13:50.171 --> 00:13:55.120
employees and the work was gets discontinued for a period of approximately nine

193
00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:58.000
weeks.
During this time,
Newman,

194
00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:02.890
the subcontractor was obliged to pay rent for the equipment and other sums to

195
00:14:02.891 --> 00:14:03.790
ensure it's safe.

196
00:14:03.791 --> 00:14:08.791
Keeping a meeting was called to adjust differences in the contract in attendance

197
00:14:10.751 --> 00:14:15.340
were Newman,
the subcontractor,
Rogers,
the general contractor,

198
00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:16.331
and Woodward,

199
00:14:16.331 --> 00:14:20.680
the ultimate client and a representative of the Union of the strikers.

200
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:25.460
As a result of the lengthy discussion,
the strike was called off.
However,

201
00:14:25.461 --> 00:14:30.461
Doman refuse to continue performance unless he was paid for the rental and

202
00:14:30.761 --> 00:14:33.640
charges accruing during the time of the strike.

203
00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:39.510
Woodward then promised to pay this extra amount so that the work could proceed.

204
00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:42.880
The work was completed under the contracts,

205
00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:47.530
but Woodward then refuse to pay the rental charges that he had promised in the

206
00:14:47.531 --> 00:14:52.070
modification.
And Newman consults you for,
uh,

207
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:57.100
for advice on whether a Newman can enforce the promise from Woodward to pay for

208
00:14:57.861 --> 00:14:58.970
the rental charges.

209
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:05.590
So this problem presents us with a situation where additional consideration is

210
00:15:05.991 --> 00:15:09.320
paid,
but not by the other side of the contract.

211
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:13.760
Newman's has a preexisting duty to the general contractor,

212
00:15:13.761 --> 00:15:17.960
Rogers,
but not to the underlying client.
Woodward.

213
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:19.700
So Woodward,

214
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:24.850
a third party to the Rogers Newman contract is pain for something that Newman

215
00:15:25.371 --> 00:15:27.770
already owes,
but not to Woodward.

216
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.190
What's the result?
Well,

217
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:36.310
there's a trend in the cases to treat the three party situation differently,

218
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:41.540
uh,
for at least three reasons.
First,
with a third party,

219
00:15:41.541 --> 00:15:45.940
there may be a smaller likelihood of duress.
And second,
the promise.

220
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:46.641
See here,

221
00:15:46.641 --> 00:15:51.050
Newman doesn't have a preexisting duty to the third party Woodward,

222
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:55.010
even following the strictness of the preexisting duty rule,

223
00:15:55.250 --> 00:16:00.250
one can find the additional peppercorn in the promises for bearing to affect

224
00:16:00.561 --> 00:16:05.180
rescission with regard to the third party.
And finally,
third,

225
00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:10.010
the third party may be under compensated by contractual damages and therefore

226
00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:14.690
the modification may promote efficiency.
In this case,

227
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.670
one could buttress a result favoring enforcement of the um,

228
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:24.970
modify modification without consideration by drawing upon an unforeseen

229
00:16:25.341 --> 00:16:30.110
difficulty exception that although developed in the two party context would seem

230
00:16:30.111 --> 00:16:34.310
to apply in the three party settling as well.
Note,
however,

231
00:16:34.311 --> 00:16:37.280
that the promise he may have caused the strike here.

232
00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.470
So let's review.

233
00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:44.900
Today we've learned that modifications to a contract or unenforceable if there

234
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.540
aren't supported by additional consideration.

235
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.690
This is known as the preexisting duty rule.
