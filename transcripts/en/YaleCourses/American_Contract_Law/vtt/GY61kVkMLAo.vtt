1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.780
As we've discussed in previous classes and offer may typically be revoked at any

2
00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:10.740
time before the offeree accepts the offer.
Today,

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.770
we discussed an exception to that rule by looking at a 1958 California case

4
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.490
Drennan versus star paving Drennan.

5
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.580
A general contractor prepared a bid for construction contract before submitting

6
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:26.460
his bid.

7
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.460
Drennan had solicited other bids from several subcontractors and the defendant's

8
00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:35.670
star paving submitted the lowest bid for the paving.

9
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.410
Subcontract Drennan use star Paving's bid to calculate,

10
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.370
calculate his overall bid on the construction contract.

11
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.820
Drennan was awarded the construction contract and after Drennan won the bid,

12
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.090
but before he was able to notify star paving,

13
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.880
star paving discovered that it's,

14
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.210
that it's bid of $7,131 and 60 cents was an error and informed Drennan that it

15
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:09.270
would not perform for less than $15,000.

16
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.900
Drennan ended up engaging another paving subcontractor for $10,948 and sued star

17
00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:23.151
paving for the difference of $3,187.

18
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.640
This is the difference between the defendants bid and the costs that Drennan

19
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.490
actually had to pay a replacement paving subcontractor.

20
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.250
The trial court found for the plaintiff Drennan and the incident court affirmed.

21
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.520
So the central issue in the case is this,

22
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:46.521
did the plaintiffs to reliance make the defendant's offer irrevocable?

23
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.870
And the court here found yes.
Uh,

24
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.880
the reliance did make the offer.

25
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:58.881
It revokable star paving argued that there was no enforceable contract between

26
00:01:59.581 --> 00:02:00.780
the parties on the ground,

27
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:05.781
that it made a revokable offer and revoked it before plaintiff communicated his

28
00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:08.130
acceptance.
However,

29
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.310
the court in an opinion written by one of the most famous a state court justices

30
00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:18.630
in our nation's history,
uh,
justice trainer disagreed,

31
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.990
justice trainer pointed to a promissory Estoppel provision of the restatement,

32
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.790
the famous section 90,

33
00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:31.791
which says under the first restatement that a promise which the promise or

34
00:02:31.921 --> 00:02:36.330
should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of a definite and

35
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:41.331
substantial character on the part of the promise he and which does induce such

36
00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:46.431
action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement

37
00:02:46.621 --> 00:02:47.454
of the promise.

38
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.150
Since the defendant reasonably relied on star paving's bid to commit itself to

39
00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:58.611
the construction contract at a price incorporating star paving's bid star

40
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.780
paving's offer could not be revoked because injustice would otherwise result.

41
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.570
<v 1>Okay,</v>

42
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.280
<v 0>so in Drennan,</v>

43
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.760
the court relied on section 90 of the restatement and you may recall section 90

44
00:03:13.431 --> 00:03:17.990
of the restatement from our earlier discussions of promissory Estoppel in

45
00:03:17.991 --> 00:03:22.910
earlier classes.
Can you remember what his promissory Estoppel

46
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.010
under the doctrine of promissory Estoppel,

47
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.250
if a promise see reasonably relies on a promise and changes her position

48
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:33.370
accordingly,

49
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.590
the promise may be binding even without consideration if justice so requires,

50
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.510
remember rickets versus scar thorn where grandfather promise to pay his

51
00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:47.380
granddaughter $2,000 and re and in response,

52
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:49.030
the granddaughter quit her job

53
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.910
even though justice trainer used section 90 to hold that star paving's offer.

54
00:03:55.921 --> 00:04:00.090
Was he a revokable?
The facts in Drennan don't quite fit.

55
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.950
Promissory Estoppel applies when a promise he relies on an unconditional

56
00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:07.500
promise,
but in Drennan,

57
00:04:07.501 --> 00:04:12.501
star paving only made an offer to enter into a bilateral contract but never

58
00:04:12.811 --> 00:04:17.811
promised to keep that offer open and offer as a kind of conditional promise,

59
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.660
which is conditioned on the other side's return promise.

60
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.020
It can be argued that it was unreasonable for Drennan to rely on the conditional

61
00:04:27.481 --> 00:04:31.770
promise,
especially when Drennan could have made it unconditional.

62
00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:35.550
By accepting to resolve this dilemma,

63
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.920
justice Traynor held that quote,

64
00:04:37.921 --> 00:04:42.921
reasonable reliance resulting in a foreseeable prejudicial change of in position

65
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.770
affords a compelling basis also for implying of subsidiary promise not to revoke

66
00:04:50.191 --> 00:04:54.630
an offer for a bilateral contract.
In other words,

67
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.990
a sub contractors bid creates an implicit subsidiary promise not to revoke the

68
00:05:00.781 --> 00:05:03.870
offer if it becomes part of the winning bid

69
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.951
trainer.

70
00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:10.951
His reasoning is now enshrined in a separate section of the restatement section

71
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.180
87 two which reads and offer which the offer or should reasonably expect to

72
00:05:19.101 --> 00:05:24.101
induce action or forbearance of a substantial character by the offeree before

73
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.870
acceptance and which does induce such action or for Barron's is binding as an

74
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.370
option contract to the extent necessary to avoid injustice.

75
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.040
Consider the following.

76
00:05:37.041 --> 00:05:42.041
Hypothetical oil lease owner offered to enter a far amount agreement with oil

77
00:05:43.311 --> 00:05:44.144
driller.

78
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.330
The offer stated that it was era vocable for a period of 120 days plus a 30 day

79
00:05:50.361 --> 00:05:55.361
extension driller who was to accept the offer by drilling on a designated

80
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.830
parcel,

81
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.830
paid nothing for the option before acceptance driller and reliance on the option

82
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:06.260
drill the test well,
uh,
on another parcel,

83
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.770
the data from this test drilling would help to uh,

84
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.510
to evaluate whether to accept the offer before acceptance.
However,

85
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.550
owner attempted to change the terms of the offer based on the holding and

86
00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:21.230
Drennan versus star paving.

87
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.620
Can owner change the terms of the offer at this stage?

88
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.253
<v 1>No.</v>

89
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.650
<v 0>The drillers reliance upon the written option promise made the offer irrevocable</v>

90
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.820
and driller could create a contract on the original terms of the offer.

91
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:43.340
This example is based on a real case strata production versus mercury

92
00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:44.210
exploration.

93
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.160
Another way to think about this case is by asking who should bear the risk of a

94
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:52.820
subcontractor error.

95
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.170
The holding in this case puts the risk of error on the subcontractor.

96
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:58.790
This seems reasonable.

97
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.970
It forces the subcontractor to internalize the cost of its own mistakes,

98
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.510
which creates an incentive for the subcontractor to be more careful.

99
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.480
The general contractor on the other hand,

100
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.800
doesn't have much control over whether it's subcontractors make mistakes in

101
00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:20.450
their bids.
If the cost of mistake was shoulder by the general contractor,

102
00:07:20.451 --> 00:07:25.451
it might have to add a premium to its bid to compensate itself or the occasional

103
00:07:25.581 --> 00:07:27.620
mistake by a subcontractor.

104
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.520
This in turn would increase the cost of construction contracts.

105
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.020
In other words,

106
00:07:33.021 --> 00:07:37.460
the subcontractor is probably the least cost avoider in this case,

107
00:07:37.461 --> 00:07:39.080
and so should bear the risk.

108
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:43.910
The court seems to recognize this principle when it says quote as between the

109
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.890
subcontractor who made the bid and the general contractor who reasonably relied

110
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:49.580
on it.

111
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.600
The loss resulting from the mistake should fall on the party who caused it.

112
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.750
Now there are circumstances.
However,

113
00:07:56.751 --> 00:08:00.950
when the general contractor might be the least cost avoider.
For example,

114
00:08:00.951 --> 00:08:05.180
if there's a large mistake in the offered bid such as leaving off a zero

115
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.410
creating a bid 10 times smaller than the next lowest bid,

116
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:14.620
the general contractor should easily recognize that this is a mistake and maybe

117
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:19.670
pointed out if this had happened in Drennan,
it may have changed the outcome.

118
00:08:19.671 --> 00:08:22.040
The court specifically considered this point,

119
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:26.810
but found that the general contractor quote had no reason to know that the

120
00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:30.020
defendant had made a mistake in submitting it's bid

121
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.153
under Drennan.

122
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:38.160
A subcontractors bid becomes an era vocable offer when the general contractor

123
00:08:38.471 --> 00:08:41.350
relies on it in a winning bid.
However,

124
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.170
the general contractor is still not accepted.

125
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.500
The subcontractors bid and might solicit a new round of subcontractor bids,

126
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:55.140
something that is called bid shopping justice trainer was to point out quote,

127
00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:01.610
a general contractor is not free to delay acceptance after he has been awarded

128
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:05.730
the general contracted in the hope of getting a better price,

129
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
nor can he reopened bargaining with the subcontractor and at the same time claim

130
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:14.280
a continuing right to accept the original offer.

131
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
So the subcontractors offer is only a revokable if the general contractor does

132
00:09:20.341 --> 00:09:23.040
not misuse it's option power.

133
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:28.560
Since the overall project contract has already been awarded at this point,

134
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.740
only the general contractor,
not the project owner,

135
00:09:31.741 --> 00:09:33.720
will profit from this bid shopping.

136
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.320
Recognizing this potential for abuse.

137
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:42.620
In 1963 the California legislature adopted a subletting and sub Contracting Fair

138
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:49.870
Practices Act.
The statute provides that the general contractor bidding on quote,

139
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.270
any public work or improvement must disclose in its bid.

140
00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:59.271
The name of any subcontractor who's bid is incorporated into an exceeds 1% of

141
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:03.540
the price of the general contractor's bid.

142
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:08.930
The statute further provides that a general contractor who's bid on a public

143
00:10:09.001 --> 00:10:10.230
project is accepted,

144
00:10:10.231 --> 00:10:15.231
shall not replace the subcontractor listed in his bid with another subcontractor

145
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:20.310
except under certain conditions.
And with the awarding the authorities consent.

146
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.460
So what are the consequences of the statute?

147
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:27.780
Since the general contractor cannot bargain with subcontractors after winning

148
00:10:27.781 --> 00:10:28.560
the bid,

149
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.510
it must make an all or nothing choice beforehand and it would induce all

150
00:10:33.511 --> 00:10:38.010
competition beforehand to better solicit a number of bids.

151
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:43.460
Given that expos competition may not redound to the public buyer's benefit,

152
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:47.820
the statutes make some sense if it leads to more x anti-competition for

153
00:10:47.821 --> 00:10:50.850
subcontracts.
But in some circumstances,

154
00:10:50.851 --> 00:10:55.770
generals may not have time for prebid competition and the statute may not allow

155
00:10:55.771 --> 00:10:59.790
subs to exercise,
uh,
uh,
some market power.

156
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:04.680
It's difficult to assess where whether this merely protects subs or create some

157
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.060
inappropriate market power.
So for subs,
sub contractors,

158
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:15.680
the asymmetry created by the holding and Drennan could also be modified by

159
00:11:16.711 --> 00:11:19.320
contract.
The,
for starters,

160
00:11:19.321 --> 00:11:24.321
the court states quote had star Paving's bid expressly stated or clearly implied

161
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:29.520
that it was revokable at any time before acceptance.

162
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:34.140
We would treat it accordingly,
unquote.
In other words,

163
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.560
the holding in Drennan that his subcontractors bid becomes an irrevocable offer

164
00:11:39.661 --> 00:11:44.661
if it be comes part of the winning bid is merely a default rule and may be

165
00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:49.350
contracted around by the subcontractors in their initial offer.

166
00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.000
Alternatively,

167
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:56.210
a bitter with a strong bargaining power might insist upon a conditional

168
00:11:56.261 --> 00:11:57.880
bilateral contract.

169
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:03.360
I will bid and do the job only if you promise to award the contract to me.

170
00:12:03.671 --> 00:12:08.020
If you use my bid as a part of your winning overall,

171
00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.850
a submission.
This strategy creates a bilateral contract,

172
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.770
which is immediately binding,

173
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.520
but which only has to be performed if the general wins.
The general.
