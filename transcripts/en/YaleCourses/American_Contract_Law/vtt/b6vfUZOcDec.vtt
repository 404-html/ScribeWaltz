1
00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.820
Today we will examine the duress defense.

2
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.350
If someone holds a gun to your head and demands that you signed a contract.

3
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.030
That contract,
as you might suspect becomes voidable at your option.

4
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.510
Threats of your money or your life do not produce valid evidence of welfare

5
00:00:18.821 --> 00:00:19.990
enhancing trade,

6
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.850
but not all forms of duress are of this kind of physical threat.

7
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.300
What if someone threatens to breach a contract unless you agree to modify its

8
00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:35.770
terms?
Economic Duress can also make a contract.

9
00:00:35.771 --> 00:00:40.771
Voidable we will explore the concept of economic duress in Austin versus Laurel

10
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.780
decided by the Court of Appeals of New York in 1971

11
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.890
the defendant and buyer Laurel is a frequent government contractor.

12
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.250
Laurel contracted with the U S Navy to provide radar sets in order to have the

13
00:00:58.831 --> 00:01:01.590
necessary parts to make these radar sets.

14
00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:06.420
Laurel had to subcontract with the plaintiff and Seller Austin Instrument.

15
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.140
Laurel was awarded a second navy contract and inform to Austin that Austin would

16
00:01:12.631 --> 00:01:17.631
be oh awarded only those subcontracts for which it was the lowest bidder.

17
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.710
Austin unhappy with this change decided to play hardball.

18
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.190
Austin threatened to cease delivery under its first to sub contract unless the

19
00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:33.480
defendant agreed to a substantial increase in the contract price.

20
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.210
Lorell contacted 10 alternative precision gear manufacturers,

21
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:43.530
but couldn't find any that could provide the parts in time.

22
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.180
Faced with the prospect of being unable to meet the government's deadline,

23
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.510
Laurel knuckled under and agreed to Austin's demands and awarded the second sub

24
00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:57.030
contract to Austin at the higher cost.

25
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.340
After the parts were delivered,
Lorell refuse to pay the full price.

26
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.170
Boston brought suit to recover 17,750 bucks,

27
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.450
allegedly due on the second sub contract.

28
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.690
Laurel itself brought suit,

29
00:02:12.691 --> 00:02:16.320
claiming recovery of the price increase on the first subcontract.

30
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.810
The two actions were consolidated.

31
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.060
The trial judge found for Austin in the first complaint and dismissed the second

32
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.680
the appellate division affirmed and the instant court affirmed as to the first

33
00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:30.930
action and reversed as to the second.

34
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.970
So what were the prevailing military exigencies mentioned in the opinion?

35
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.440
Well,
the answer is the Vietnam War.

36
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.520
This is relevant because our soldiers lies.

37
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.260
We're potentially at stake.
If Lorell couldn't produce the radar sets,

38
00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:55.400
then American soldiers,
uh,
might be killed.

39
00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.850
This important political background may have the court's decision and as a more

40
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:02.770
general matter,

41
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:07.771
it's useful to keep track of whether there was an economic or military crisis

42
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.860
happening when a court is deciding the case.

43
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.570
The main issue in this case is whether our contractual modification made under

44
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:23.110
economic duress is voidable.
The court found that yes,

45
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:26.440
economic duress can avoid a contract.

46
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.850
Economic Duress exists when three conditions are met.
One,

47
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.770
one party threatens to breach a contract to the threatened party,

48
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:40.510
cannot cover their obligation with another source.
And three,

49
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:44.140
the ordinary remedy for breach of contract is inadequate.

50
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.310
The court found that all three of these conditions were met in his dissent.

51
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.210
Judge Bergon argued that a finding of economic duress relies on the

52
00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:59.200
determination of fact and that the trial court found no duress

53
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.930
more generally,

54
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:06.490
the court attempted to define the legal standard for economic duress.

55
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.560
It stated that quote,
a contract is voidable on the grounds of dress.

56
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.210
When it does establish that the party making the claim was forced to agree to it

57
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.450
by means of a wrongful threat precluding the exercise of his freewill unquote.

58
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.040
Let's break down the key terms of this legal standard.

59
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.560
The wrongful threat in this case was the threat to breach the contract.

60
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.550
Why was failure deliver a wrongful threat?
Well,

61
00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:41.551
because there was a prior contract and a preexisting duty to provide radar

62
00:04:42.401 --> 00:04:43.234
headsets.

63
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.130
This is different from the ski or hypothetical that we've discussed in past

64
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:48.611
lectures.

65
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:53.611
Were a rescuer demands $1 million to take a skier with a broken leg down a

66
00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:58.000
mountain because the rescue or has no,
because in this case,

67
00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:02.920
the rescuer has no preexisting duty to take the skier down the mountain.

68
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:04.720
Uh,
here,

69
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:09.721
Austin had a preexisting duty to deliver the parts under this first contract.

70
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.640
One of the key sources of duress is the failure of contractual damages.

71
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.090
If expectation damages fully compensated the primacy for a breach of contract,

72
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.110
there would not be anything,
uh,
uh,

73
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.920
threatening about a breach.
The promise he could say,

74
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:30.910
go ahead and reach.

75
00:05:30.911 --> 00:05:35.080
I won't even notice if you breach because I'll be made whole,

76
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.720
uh,
and put in such a good position that I,
uh,
as if the breach had not occurred.

77
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.680
But legal damages often do not fully compensate.

78
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.180
Promises are not awarded their attorney's fees and more importantly,

79
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.480
a promise or is sometimes have shallow pockets and cannot pay the damages that

80
00:05:55.181 --> 00:05:56.014
are awarded.

81
00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.520
The doctrine therefore is a substitute for the failure of,

82
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.590
of damages,
uh,
uh,
in contractual actions.

83
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.460
It's noteworthy that this court disposed of the case in terms of the dress

84
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:17.981
element without so much as a mention of the preexisting duty a doctrine or UCC

85
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:21.020
section two,
two Oh nine,

86
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.460
we call that two two oh nine one deals with modifications to contracts and

87
00:06:26.571 --> 00:06:31.571
states that a modification to an existing contract does not need consideration.

88
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.840
Uh,
but it does need a still be in good faith.

89
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.200
Austin's attempt at modifying the contract in this case was in bad faith.

90
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.420
Can it ever be unlawful to threaten what one has a legal right to do?

91
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.790
While on first glance it might appear that it's always lawful to threaten what

92
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:57.620
one has a legal right to do,
but this is actually not the case.
A common,

93
00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:03.060
a counter example is a threat of criminal prosecution as an improper means of

94
00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:09.461
inducing the recipient to a contract which constitutes a misuse for personal

95
00:07:09.891 --> 00:07:13.940
gain of the power given for other legitimate ends.

96
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:19.420
The person making the threat is legally allowed to call the authorities and

97
00:07:20.121 --> 00:07:21.860
report a criminal violation,

98
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.420
but the threat itself is still unlawful in the eyes of contract law.

99
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.870
Even a threat of civil process may under exceptional circumstances be abusive.

100
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.230
Quote,
if the threat is shown to have been made in bad faith,

101
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.520
for instance,

102
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:42.610
it's wrongful for a husband to threatened to inform the IRS of his wife's tax

103
00:07:43.111 --> 00:07:46.280
innovation if she does not sign a settlement agreement.

104
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:52.760
Duress,
as such is seldom recognized as an independent tort.

105
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:58.150
The victim does not usually maintain an act and action for damages in the usual

106
00:07:58.161 --> 00:07:58.491
case,

107
00:07:58.491 --> 00:08:03.491
duress is pleaded as a defense or as a basis for avoiding a transaction and

108
00:08:04.011 --> 00:08:07.820
securing restitutional relief.
Moreover,

109
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:12.020
the issues seldom arises in connection with initial contract formation.

110
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.131
Most often,

111
00:08:13.131 --> 00:08:17.960
there is an attempt to bar enforcement of a contract modification or a

112
00:08:17.961 --> 00:08:19.730
settlement agreement.
Uh,

113
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.320
Laurel was an example of trying to stop the enforcement of a modification.

114
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:29.210
There are two main types of dress discussed in the second restatement.

115
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.510
The first is a physical duress.

116
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:37.820
Normally dress by physical compulsion prevents formation of a contract,

117
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.390
whereas duressed by other threats makes it contract.

118
00:08:41.391 --> 00:08:43.910
Voidable restatement.

119
00:08:43.911 --> 00:08:48.911
Second Section one 75 discusses how nonphysical duress can render a contract.

120
00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:52.880
Voidable quote,

121
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:57.910
if a party's manifestation of the scent is induced by an improper threat by the

122
00:08:58.441 --> 00:09:02.160
other party,
that leaves the victim.
No reasonable alternative.

123
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.770
The contract is voidable by the victim.

124
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.170
Another related but separate concept is undue influence.

125
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.530
The rule for duress was developed by courts of law.

126
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:18.180
While the rule of undue influence is similar to that of duress,

127
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.430
it was developed by courts of equity.

128
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:26.300
Undue influence is characterized by unfair persuasion that may fall short of

129
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.800
constituting actual duress.

130
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:34.370
The key is usually high pressure that approaches the boundaries of coercion,

131
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:40.910
limited to situations where there is a relationship of trust or confidence such

132
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:45.690
as a parent and child,
a husband and wife or attorney and client,

133
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.040
but it also can include dysfunctional relationships of domination.

134
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:56.180
Under undue influence has also been found in where a confidential relationship,

135
00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.620
uh,
in the usual sense does not exist.
In one case,

136
00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:05.910
a school teacher was arrested on criminal charges of homosexuality,

137
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:11.090
homosexual activity and after conferring with school officials submitted a

138
00:10:11.161 --> 00:10:15.210
letter of resignation.
The very next day,
a month later,

139
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:20.340
the criminal charges were dismissed and the teacher suit for rescission of the

140
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.160
resignation and other appropriate relief.

141
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.280
The court found that undue influence,

142
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:31.700
quote over persuasion unquote existed because of several factors,

143
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:37.370
including discussing the resignation at an unusual and inappropriate time,

144
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:38.461
uh,

145
00:10:38.461 --> 00:10:43.461
extreme emphasis on untoward consequences of delay and stating that there is no

146
00:10:45.181 --> 00:10:48.480
time to consult financial advisors or attorneys.

147
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:50.543
In summary,

148
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:55.550
economic duress can render a contract voidable the threat to breach a contract

149
00:10:57.901 --> 00:11:02.400
can constitute economic duress if the innocent party cannot cover its

150
00:11:02.401 --> 00:11:07.401
obligations from another source and ordinary contract damages are inadequate.

151
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.330
Physical duress usually prevents the formation of the contract,

152
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.220
whereas nonphysical wrongful threats render a contract voidable.

153
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:22.770
Finally,
many courts also recognize the defense of undue influence,

154
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.780
high pressure exerted in relationships of trust or confidence,

155
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:29.910
uh,
