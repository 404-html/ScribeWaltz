00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.070
In today's lecture,
we'll examine the concept of nominal consideration.

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.790
Nominal consideration is the payment of a very small sum such as $1 to satisfy

3
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.350
the contracts consideration requirement.
As we will see,

4
00:00:16.351 --> 00:00:21.270
while many courts reject the idea that nominal consideration is sufficient for a

5
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:25.530
contract,
the issue remains very contentious.
First,

6
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.130
let's take a look at the basic argument for why nominal consideration should be

7
00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:33.750
sufficient for a contract.

8
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.030
It's well established that courts usually refrain from judging the fairness of

9
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:42.030
the bargain that the parties have struck.
In other words,

10
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:47.031
courts don't inquire into the adequacy of consideration whether the quid was

11
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:49.470
roughly the same value as the quo.

12
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.180
In a quid pro quo arrangement under a strict reading of this rule,

13
00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:58.620
payment of a very small sum should be enough to satisfy the consideration

14
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:00.780
requirement.
The approach,

15
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.730
this kind of approach was first advocated by the first restatement restatement

16
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:07.530
of contracts,
which said,

17
00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:12.531
a promise to pay $1 in exchange for a piece of land called black acre worth

18
00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:17.550
$5,000 was adequate consideration.
However,

19
00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:22.551
it's not clear that the first restatements position on nominal consideration was

20
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:24.300
supported by case law.

21
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.390
When discussing nominal consideration,
uh,

22
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.120
the example of a peppercorn is often used as a parent,
dogmatic,

23
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.130
uh,
instance,
uh,

24
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.790
of the smallest thing that one could give in return,
uh,

25
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.610
for someone else's promise.

26
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.590
Some contracts have used a literal peppercorn as the promise consideration.

27
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.070
The Masonic Lodge of Saint George's in Bermuda rents a lodge from the governor

28
00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:55.800
of Bermuda using an annual,
some of the single peppercorn.

29
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.940
The more widely accepted approach today rejects nominal consideration has been

30
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:08.040
sufficient consideration deeming it insufficient for creating a contract.

31
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.550
Contemporary courts are unlikely to dismiss attempts to dress up a gift with

32
00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:18.861
false recitals of consideration or exchange of a nominal sum.

33
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.100
While a peppercorn satisfies the older legal detriment definition of

34
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:26.070
consideration,

35
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.310
it doesn't satisfy the more modern bargained for or inducement conception of

36
00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:32.820
consideration.

37
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.450
The second restatement states that courts should be suspicious of contracts

38
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.490
where a large disparity in value exists.

39
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.810
The disparity in May indicate that the consideration was not in fact bargained

40
00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:46.620
for,

41
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.620
but was a mere formality or pretense of a bargain under the widely accepted

42
00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:53.700
modern rule,

43
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.730
sham or nominal consideration does not satisfy the requirement of a contract.

44
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.440
So under the restatement,

45
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.680
would the black acre example of $1 for a $5,000 piece of property,

46
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.620
uh,
be a valid contract.

47
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.370
Recall the earlier black acre example where someone offered $5,000 piece of land

48
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:24.661
in exchange for just $1 following the second restatement principles with this

49
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:30.580
black Acre contract be valid?
Well,
the answer is no.

50
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:31.481
In fact,

51
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:35.800
the second restatement clearly states that the black acre example is sham

52
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:38.200
consideration resulting in no contract.

53
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.130
One case which illustrates the widely accepted contemporary approach is Edwin

54
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.790
Farnum,
uh,
uh,

55
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.340
green case or the in what's called in Ray Green.

56
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.700
This case involved a defendant named green,

57
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:58.780
a married man who lived for several years with the plaintiff,

58
00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:02.530
a woman who was not his wife.
When the two separated,

59
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.800
they entered into a written agreement under seal requiring the defendant to a

60
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.920
pay plaintiff $1,000 per month for the rest of their joint lives and be maintain

61
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:19.810
a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy on his life with plaintiff as

62
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:24.811
the beneficiary and exchange the plaintiff release defendant from all claims she

63
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:29.881
had against him and paid him a $1 the agreement specified that the consideration

64
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:35.611
given was $1 quote and other good and valuable consideration.

65
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.000
The court made two important findings.
First,

66
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:44.410
it rejected the idea that $1 is sufficient consideration.
Second,

67
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.650
it held that it's not enough for parties to merely recite that there is good and

68
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:51.970
valuable consideration.

69
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.380
Consideration must be actually present for a contract to be valid.

70
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.330
Let's take a look at the history of of different approaches to nominal

71
00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:02.200
consideration.

72
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.390
Nominal nominal consideration can be viewed as a sort of formality.

73
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.500
It's a sign of the party's intent to achieve a certain legal result.

74
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.570
Contracting parties have historically used many different formalities to seal

75
00:05:16.571 --> 00:05:17.404
their deals,

76
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.180
sometimes as a matter of customs and sometimes to comply with legal

77
00:05:22.181 --> 00:05:24.790
requirements.
As we find in the Bible,

78
00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:29.791
Abraham established a covenant with God by the scorching of a three year old

79
00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:34.000
heifer,
a three year old goat and the three year old ram and a turtle,

80
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:36.550
dove and a pigeon.
And of course,

81
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.750
contracting parties today often end to deal with a handshake.

82
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.550
All of these conventions reflect the traditional employment of formalities to

83
00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:48.460
signal seriousness or enforceability.

84
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.030
And important example of legal formality was the rope and was the Roman a stip

85
00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:56.480
Bellagio,

86
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.070
a stipulation or stipulation under the Justinian code.

87
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.080
Some agreements would be enforced,

88
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:08.081
only have one side requested performance prefaced by spawn deaths nay and the

89
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:15.330
other side responded using the words spawn Deo meaning,
uh,
uh,

90
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.450
respectively.
Do you promise?

91
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.770
And then I do promise without those recitations,

92
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.930
the deal wouldn't be legally enforceable.

93
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.710
Lon Fuller in a classic article called consideration and form suggested that

94
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.850
legal formalities serve evidentiary cautionary and channeling function,

95
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.840
uh,
functions and that they can be good formalities while they seem like they're

96
00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:43.520
arid and arbitrary.

97
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.290
They can serve an evidentiary function because they provide others,
uh,

98
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.650
including courts with information about the party's intention.

99
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.090
They provide a cautionary function like form of warnings.

100
00:06:56.091 --> 00:07:01.091
Do you really want to reform at your hard drive by slowing down and inducing

101
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:05.630
more deliberation by the potential contractors?
And finally,

102
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.860
formalities might channel parties toward different types of accountability.

103
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.800
Friends might prefer non legal consequences.

104
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.820
Business partners might prefer legally enforceable contracts.

105
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:18.980
At common law,

106
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:24.070
the formality needed to establish a contract was the seal in early days.

107
00:07:24.351 --> 00:07:29.080
The seal was a wax substance attached to the document.
Later,
uh,

108
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:34.170
paper wafer was often used or simply written with the words under seal or Ls,

109
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:40.150
which was the Latin for locus sigale meaning in the place of the seal,

110
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.050
the writ of covenant,
which was used to enforce,
enforce certain agreements,

111
00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:48.980
conditioned enforcement on the existing of uh,
writing under seal.

112
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.120
The legal effect did not derive from the substance of the agreement whether it

113
00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:54.740
was bargained for exchange,

114
00:07:55.100 --> 00:08:00.100
but from the formal mode in which the promise was cast in the past at the common

115
00:08:01.041 --> 00:08:06.041
law and agreement under seal was binding without consideration if it was in

116
00:08:06.621 --> 00:08:11.621
writing and sealed and the document containing the promise was delivered.

117
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:16.640
And number three that the promise and the promise see were named in the document

118
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.050
during the early 20th century.

119
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:25.070
Many US states passed statutes that radically reduced the legal effect of a

120
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.870
sealed writing or reducing their legal enforceability.

121
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.440
Some states abolish the seal entirely.

122
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:38.950
This approach is reflected in the UCC two dash two oh three which makes it clear

123
00:08:40.371 --> 00:08:45.200
that every effect of the seal which relates to sealed instruments as such is

124
00:08:45.201 --> 00:08:49.550
wiped out in so far as contracts for sale of goods are concerned,

125
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.760
other state legislature's retain the seal,

126
00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:57.060
but provided that lack of consideration could remain a defense to sealed

127
00:08:57.061 --> 00:08:57.894
instruments.

128
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.250
This is what happened in the green case we discussed earlier.

129
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.820
Other states have adopted other modifications such as providing a longer statute

130
00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:12.480
of limitation for contracts under seal for the practitioner.

131
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:17.070
This means that it's crucial to know the effect of the seal and the jurisdiction

132
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:18.060
in which you're working.

133
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:24.500
The broad abolition of the seal or the enforceability of promises under seal has

134
00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:26.610
had its costs.

135
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.640
Many regard the seal as a useful device if for no other reason that it provided

136
00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:36.870
a convenient method of making legally binding gratuitous promises.

137
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.790
It was inevitable that attention would be given to filling this vacuum and it

138
00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:46.791
was most natural to turn to the most common form of formality,

139
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:52.640
which is the signed writing in 1925 largely at the instigation of of Williston,

140
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:59.930
the National Conference of Commissioners on uniform state laws approved a draft

141
00:10:00.631 --> 00:10:03.390
of the uniform written obligation act.

142
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.110
The recommended statute was a model of brevity.

143
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:11.480
It essentially stated that a written agreement shall not be invalidated for a

144
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:16.380
lack of consideration as long as the parties are explicit that they want to be

145
00:10:16.381 --> 00:10:20.730
legally bound.
Uh,
I'm a big fan of this act,

146
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:24.450
but the proposal has met with a singular lack of success.

147
00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.770
Only Pennsylvania has adopted and retained the act,

148
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.110
which means that in the Quaker state,

149
00:10:31.111 --> 00:10:35.820
consideration is not a mandatory mandatory requirement for enforcing promises.

150
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:41.730
The decline of seal has not meant the complete abandonment of legal formalities.

151
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:47.090
The a uniform commercial code provides three examples in which assigned writing

152
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.610
can serve as a substitute for consideration.

153
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:56.180
Section one three Oh six covers waver or renunciation of claims of right after

154
00:10:58.021 --> 00:11:02.790
breach and it provides that any claim or right arising out of an alleged breach

155
00:11:02.791 --> 00:11:07.560
can be discharged without consideration by a written waiver or renunciation.

156
00:11:07.561 --> 00:11:09.810
Signed and delivered by the aggrieved party.

157
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:15.350
Section two Dash Two oh five discusses a firm offer which are offers that cannot

158
00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:20.841
be revoked before acceptance and it gives conditions under which a firm offer

159
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:25.470
can be enforced even without consideration.
And finally,

160
00:11:25.471 --> 00:11:30.471
section two two oh nine says that an agreement modifying a contract needs no

161
00:11:30.811 --> 00:11:32.460
consideration to be binding.

162
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:39.010
Here are some tips for making sure that your contracts pass the consideration

163
00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:41.670
test
first.

164
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:46.680
You can explicitly have your contracts say that the parties intend to be this

165
00:11:46.681 --> 00:11:51.030
contract to be legally enforceable and you might even try to say that it's going

166
00:11:51.031 --> 00:11:53.130
to be governed by the law of Pennsylvania,

167
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.950
which is adopted this a written obligation act.

168
00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.293
Secondly,

169
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:02.920
you can include in the contract a return promise that is hard to value.

170
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:08.460
Instead of saying that $1 is the valuable consideration,

171
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:14.220
have the promise he promised to as in return paint or sing something that is

172
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:20.000
hard to value.
And finally,
as a tip,
you might have,
uh,

173
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:25.230
increased the values of both sides while a hundred to one disparity in value

174
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:27.160
might not be enforced.

175
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:32.460
Attend to one disparity can be created by increasing the promises on both sides.

176
00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:40.050
So instead of promising an iPhone in exchange for a peppercorn promise,

177
00:12:40.271 --> 00:12:45.271
an I phone plus a week of groceries in exchange for $200 in a personal portrait.

178
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.300
In this module,

179
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.170
we have examined the concept of nominal consideration.

180
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:56.830
Nominal consideration can be viewed as a formality.

181
00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:01.920
Under common law contract was once binding as long as it has a seal on it.

182
00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.060
That was the old common law.

183
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:09.550
Regardless of whether there was consideration under the legal detriment,

184
00:13:09.551 --> 00:13:11.140
conception of consideration,

185
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:14.830
even a peppercorn would be sufficient consideration.

186
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:20.670
One contemporary attempt at replicating the effect of the seal has been the

187
00:13:21.191 --> 00:13:23.140
modern written obligation act,

188
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.470
but it's been only passed in Pennsylvania.

189
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:32.110
Most contemporary jurisdictions apply the rule that nominal consideration is

190
00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:35.390
insufficient for a contract because it's not bargained for.

191
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.300
It's just the pretense of a bargain.
