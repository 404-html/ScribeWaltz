00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.080
Today we're going to discuss the puzzling case of Dan Cohen versus Kohl's media

2
00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:07.464
company,

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.590
which deals with the question of when it is necessary for parties to intend that

4
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:17.580
an agreement with consideration the legally binding in order for them to be

5
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:19.890
legally bound by that agreement.

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.270
The setting for the case is the 1982 election for governor of the state of

7
00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:29.670
Minnesota independent Republican candidate.

8
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.030
We lock Whitney was running against democratic farmer Labor candidate Rudy

9
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.590
Perpich,

10
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.210
who had served as governor for several years in the 1970s in the middle of the

11
00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:44.160
election,
Dan Cohen,

12
00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:48.570
who was a well known republican businessman called up reporters for two major

13
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:53.310
newspapers from the twin cities,
the St Paul Pioneer press dispatch,

14
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.620
and the Minneapolis Star Tribune.

15
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.690
He told them that he had information about a candidate in the election and

16
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:05.691
offered to give it to them if they agreed not to identify him in their reporting

17
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.070
or to ask him about his source.

18
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.940
That information turned out to be the records from cases that had been brought a

19
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.780
decade earlier against Marlene Johnson Purpitch his running mate.

20
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.610
When there reporters went to the courthouse to check the records were correct.

21
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.820
They discovered that column Cohen himself had sent someone to dig them up.

22
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.040
The editor's not the reporters,

23
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:37.041
but the editors at the newspapers decided that that this was an important part

24
00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:38.904
of the story.

25
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.090
And the editors decided to include Cohen's identity in the articles in spite of

26
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:49.770
the reporters explicit promises.
And over there the reporters objections.

27
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.920
When Cohen's saw the newspapers the next day,

28
00:01:52.921 --> 00:01:56.280
he was outraged to see his name in the articles.

29
00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.360
He also lost his job because of these,
uh,

30
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.710
his name being mentioned.

31
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:06.630
And so we decided to take the newspaper publishers to court since the

32
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:10.740
information that had been published was true.
Uh,

33
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.260
he couldn't sue for defamation.
Instead,

34
00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:18.261
he sued for fraudulent misrepresentation and for breach of contract at trial,

35
00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:19.710
he won big.

36
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.710
The jury awarded him $200,000 in compensatory damages and a quarter of a million

37
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.370
dollars in punitive damages,
giving him the victory on both claims.

38
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.450
The court of appeals then reversed the misrepresentation claim.

39
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.130
We're going to read the Minnesota Supreme Court's decision from 1,990 which

40
00:02:38.131 --> 00:02:40.920
ruled for the newspapers on both of these points

41
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.630
just as Symonette,
uh,

42
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.160
deals very quickly with the misrepresentation claims.
Uh,

43
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.300
he wrote a representation as to future acts does not support an action for fraud

44
00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.320
merely because the represented act did not happen unless the promise or did not

45
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:04.690
intend to perform at the time the promise was made.

46
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.760
There was plenty of evidence that the reporters did intend to keep their sources

47
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:12.580
identity a secret when they made the promise.

48
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.170
One of them even refuse to have her name in the articles byline because she was

49
00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:19.390
so offended by what her editors had done.

50
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.620
This misrepresentation rule means that mere failure to perform what one has

51
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:28.120
promised doesn't amount to fraud.

52
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.880
We don't want to characterize everyone who doesn't succeed at fulfilling all

53
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.770
their promises as a fraudster.
Instead,

54
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.490
when someone fails to follow through on a promise for which there was

55
00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:44.380
consideration,
parties generally should pursue a suit for breach of contract.

56
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.300
We limit what is called promissory fraud actions to circumstances.

57
00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:53.410
When the promissor at the time of promising didn't intend to perform.

58
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:58.411
The promise just disseminate then moves to the question of whether Cohen has a

59
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:03.430
valid claim for breach of contract.
On first glance,

60
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.240
his agreements with the reporters definitely look like contracts.

61
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:12.100
The reporter promises were given exchange for consideration in the form of the

62
00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:16.420
documents that Cohen handed over.
There was consideration.

63
00:04:16.421 --> 00:04:18.100
There was quid pro quo.

64
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:23.460
The newspapers then proceeded to break their promises about keeping his identity

65
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:24.754
secret,

66
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.070
but while Simondet certainly thinks that the reporters were ethically obliged

67
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:32.080
not to disclose Cohen's identity,

68
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.070
he's reluctant to make their agreements legally enforceable.

69
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.970
Moral and legal obligations do not always coincide.

70
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.600
Ultimately the judge is quote,

71
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.660
not persuaded that in the special milk idea of media news gathering a source and

72
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:54.910
a reporter ordinarily believe they are engaged in making a legally binding

73
00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:55.744
contract.

74
00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.310
They are not thinking in terms of offer and acceptance in any commercial or

75
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:05.311
business sense unquote and so the judge decides not to quote,

76
00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:10.651
superimpose a legal obligation on a moral and ethical obligation unquote.

77
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.920
The case therefore suggests that at least in the context of reporters and their

78
00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:17.794
sources,

79
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.250
there needs to be explicit evidence that the parties wanted to be legally bound

80
00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:25.990
in order for their agreement to be legally binding.

81
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.890
I'm troubled by the justices conclusion that the sources don't think that

82
00:05:32.021 --> 00:05:35.890
reporters are making legally binding commitments when they promised not to use

83
00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:36.724
their name.

84
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.110
This rule is very odd because it's the opposite of the ordinary rule,

85
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.670
which is summarized in section 21 of the second restatement of contracts.

86
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.270
That section says neither real nor impairment intention that a promise be

87
00:05:51.281 --> 00:05:54.760
legally binding is essential to the formation of a contract,

88
00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.110
but a manifestation of intention that a promise shall not affect legal relations

89
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:03.980
may prevent the formation of a contract.
In other words,

90
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.090
the default is that when the parties make an agreement involving all of the

91
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:12.170
necessary components of offer and acceptance and consideration,

92
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.300
that agreement is legally binding.

93
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.270
Even if it doesn't say that the parties intend for it to be legally barred it

94
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:23.290
binding parties can choose explicitly not to make their agreements legally

95
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:26.930
binding,
but they need to go to extra effort to do so.

96
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.620
That's why you sometimes see the statement quote,

97
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.860
this is not a legally enforceable agreement included in written documents.

98
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.180
This is called a Tina Leah provision based on the abbreviation for this is not a

99
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:45.020
legally enforceable agreement.
In this case,

100
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.650
justice Symonette turns the principal on its head.

101
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:53.840
The parties don't have a legally binding contract because there's no explicit

102
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:57.530
evidence that they wanted that they intended it to be legally binding.

103
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.420
This is the general rule in many other countries including England and

104
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:03.860
continental Europe countries,

105
00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:08.060
but not in the United States side from a few exceptions.
For example,

106
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.950
judge Simonett mentions that the rule that promises within families are

107
00:07:12.951 --> 00:07:17.951
generally unenforceable without extra evidence that the family members intended

108
00:07:18.111 --> 00:07:19.610
them to be legally bound.

109
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.940
Here the court seems to be motivated to make a new exception out,
uh,

110
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.980
out of the concern that legal liability in cases like these would interfere with

111
00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:32.930
the important work of reporters.
And newspaper editors.

112
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.440
We saw a similar sort of concern for the effect of Law on particular professions

113
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:44.231
in Sullivan versus O'connor earlier when where the court was worried about

114
00:07:44.241 --> 00:07:49.241
enforcing physicians promises of cures and that whether such enforcement would

115
00:07:50.091 --> 00:07:54.980
interfere with the ability to to advise and a care for their patients.

116
00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:00.340
It's not clear though that justice Symonette's concern about the news industry

117
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.150
industry is a valid one.

118
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.480
Sources might be more willing to give information to reporters if they knew that

119
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:11.960
the promises of confidentiality would be a legally enforceable.

120
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:17.510
It's also important to note that the United States Supreme Court ended up ruling

121
00:08:17.511 --> 00:08:18.860
for the plaintiff in this case,

122
00:08:18.861 --> 00:08:23.861
finding that generally applicable laws applied to the press in spite of the

123
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.430
incidental effects of the ability to gather and support the news.

124
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:33.170
The U S Supreme Court said that there still could be an action in a under

125
00:08:33.171 --> 00:08:35.890
promissory Estoppel.
All right,

126
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:40.900
and so let's go to a quiz here in Eric agrees to give Maria one of his cats new

127
00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:45.710
kittens if she helps him build a website at the time.

128
00:08:45.711 --> 00:08:50.210
Neither of them thinks that a casual agreement between friends is legally

129
00:08:50.211 --> 00:08:54.860
binding.
She helps him,
but he then refuses to give her the kitten.

130
00:08:55.170 --> 00:09:00.030
Could Maria enforce the agreement in court?
Well,
the answer is yes.

131
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.370
As we've seen from the restatement,

132
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:06.510
the default rule in American law is it when parties come to an agreement with

133
00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:10.470
consideration,
that agreement will be legally enforceable in court.

134
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.970
They can avoid the default only if they explicitly make their agreement non

135
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:18.480
enforceable with something such as a teen Aaliyah provision.

136
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.480
There are some exceptions to this rule.

137
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:26.910
The traditional ones are four agreements between family members and for social

138
00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:28.110
engagements.
Your,

139
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:33.270
your friend can't take you to court if you show up late to lunch as you've seen

140
00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:36.890
in the case of Cohen versus Kohl's media.
Uh,

141
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.470
courts occasionally find other exceptions as well.
Here,

142
00:09:40.471 --> 00:09:45.450
judge justice seminar thought that confidentiality agreements between sources

143
00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:49.770
and reporters were in a domain where parties would not expect legal consequences

144
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:54.420
to arise from their agreements.
And so he reversed the default rule.

145
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:55.800
Now,

146
00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:00.510
the Supreme Court of the United States in New York Times versus Sullivan found

147
00:10:00.511 --> 00:10:04.680
that under the first amendment of our Constitution,
uh,

148
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.920
a newspaper could not be liable for mere negligent misrepresentations concerning

149
00:10:11.461 --> 00:10:16.120
public figures.
But imagine that a newspaper,
let's call it Savannah,

150
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.640
uh,
on the front page of each issue,

151
00:10:19.641 --> 00:10:24.641
expressly promises to compensate any individual that it mentions who is injured

152
00:10:25.681 --> 00:10:29.190
by the newspapers,
negligent misrepresentation,

153
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.850
and secondly expressly represents that it did.

154
00:10:32.851 --> 00:10:36.150
Tends this promise to be legally enforceable.

155
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.160
The newspaper believes that it can sell more newspapers if it warrants the

156
00:10:41.161 --> 00:10:45.900
quality of it's a product putting aside consideration problems.

157
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.830

In essence,
is New York Times versus Sullivan,
uh,

159
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.410
merely a default rule?
If so,

160
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:03.330
could the legislate your flip the default and require newspapers who didn't want

161
00:11:03.331 --> 00:11:08.331
to stand behind the truthfulness of their statement to opt out of liability by

162
00:11:08.461 --> 00:11:12.510
including a short disclaimer somewhere in the publication that they intend not

163
00:11:12.511 --> 00:11:17.511
to be a responsible for the injury done by their negligent reporting.
