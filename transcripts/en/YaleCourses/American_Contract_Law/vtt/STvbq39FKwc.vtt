1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.340
Let's continue our discussion of the Alyeska case and now we're going to focus

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.990
on the question of whether extrinsic evidence can be admitted to supplement a

3
00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:11.070
written contract.

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.350
The Alyeska court adopted a three step test to make this determination.

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.330
The first step is the partial integration test.
Namely,

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.280
was the written agreement partially integrated with respect to the extrinsic

7
00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:29.040
evidence at issue?
In other words,

8
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.410
was the writing a final expression of some of the terms of the contract?

9
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.281
If not,

10
00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:40.110
the parole evidence rule does not apply and even inconsistent or contradictory.

11
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.100
Extrinsic evidence can be admitted.
In this case,

12
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:48.390
the court found that the December 11th writing was partially integrated,

13
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.840
meaning that the writing was a final expression of some,
uh,

14
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.720
have at least some of the terms.

15
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.890
The court doesn't say much about the standard for what determines whether

16
00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:00.750
writing was partially integrated,

17
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.700
and there have been academic debates about whether extrinsic evidence should be

18
00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:10.230
admitted,
determine whether the writing was a final expression of some,
some,

19
00:01:10.231 --> 00:01:13.410
or all of the,
of the,
of its terms with most courts.

20
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.180
Now considering extrinsic evidence in determining whether parties intended the

21
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.840
written contract to be a partial or complete integration.

22
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.840
The trial court's finding of partial integration is reviewed under the clearly

23
00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:30.210
erroneous standard as a question of fact.

24
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.190
The second test is the consistency test.

25
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.610
If a written agreement was partially integrated,

26
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.900
is the extrinsic evidence in consistent with the integrated portion?

27
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.160
If yes,
the extrinsic evidence cannot be admitted to supplement.

28
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:48.750
In this case,

29
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:52.860
the court found that the parole evidence was inconsistent with the written

30
00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:56.670
agreement in making this consideration.
The court rejected.

31
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.680
In making this determination,
the court rejected the hunt food standard.

32
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.610
The hunt food case held that to be inconsistent.

33
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.640
The extrinsic evidence must be offered for a term that contradicts and express

34
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.890
term of the writing.
This definition of consistency is too broad.

35
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.340
Hunt food would destroy much of the parol evidence rule by finding that a very

36
00:02:24.091 --> 00:02:28.770
broad class of extrinsic evidence was consistent and thus could be admitted

37
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.870
unless the writing was an exclusive integration.
For example,

38
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.140
if Laurel agreed to paint Hardy's house in in a written contract for $500,

39
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.870
the hunt food standard would allow hardy to argue that Laura also promised to

40
00:02:45.871 --> 00:02:50.871
sell his car is part of the contract because selling a car wouldn't contradict

41
00:02:51.991 --> 00:02:55.830
an expressed term of the written contract.
On the other hand,

42
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.190
it's possible to interpret consistent very narrowly the phrase additional

43
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:06.610
consistent terms sounds like an oxymoron.

44
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.800
The this other extreme interpretation is,
uh,

45
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:16.801
would say that all additional terms are inconsistent because any additional term

46
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.290
is inconsistent with the quid pro quo balance of promises that the parties

47
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:25.300
agreed to in the initial writing.

48
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.550
The court correctly feels that the hunt food standard is too broad,

49
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.760
but also wants to avoid the other extreme and define all additional terms to be

50
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.380
inconsistent.

51
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.720
The court compromises between these extreme standards by assessing,

52
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.140
assessing consistency,
uh,
uh,

53
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:52.141
under the Snyder definition of inconsistency as quote the absence of reasonable

54
00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:58.210
harmony unquote in the written and extrinsic terms.

55
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.850
Does this reasonable harmony standard help us at all?
Well,
not really.

56
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.500
Notice how the court uses overstatement to shore up a questionable conclusion.

57
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.800
Under this definition of inconsistency,

58
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.780
it is clear that the proffered parole evidence is inconsistent.

59
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.810
As you can probably tell though,

60
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:24.700
whether there is reasonable harmony or not is far from clear.

61
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.140
Is the inconsistency inquiry different from the May not be contradicted?

62
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.050
Inquiry of section two Dash Two oh two answer is no and inconsistent piece of

63
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:44.380
evidence is the same as a piece of evidence that contradicts the reasonable

64
00:04:44.381 --> 00:04:45.214
agreement.

65
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.400
The opinion suggests there's really no difference between an inconsistency query

66
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.030
and a quote may not be contradicted unquote inquiry.

67
00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.760
The third and final test might be called the exclusive statement or complete

68
00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:02.140
integration test.

69
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.890
If I written contract is not deemed to be the exclusive statement of the parties

70
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.570
than extrinsic evidence that is offered as evidence of a supplementary term that

71
00:05:13.571 --> 00:05:18.130
is consistent with the partially integrated terms will be admitted to supplement

72
00:05:18.131 --> 00:05:22.810
the agreement,
but if the written contract is a complete integration,

73
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.430
then the extrinsic evidence of this additional consistent term will not be

74
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:28.264
admitted.

75
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.680
If the court concludes that such additional consistent terms would quote

76
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.920
necessarily have been included in the writing unquote because the proffered

77
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.380
extrinsic evidence was found to be inconsistent.

78
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:45.280
The court didn't have to reach this third issue of whether the writing was a

79
00:05:45.281 --> 00:05:50.281
complete and exclusive statement under section two two oh two sub paragraph two.

80
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.370
The court defines this inquiry as whether the consistent term would necessarily

81
00:05:57.801 --> 00:05:59.450
have been included in the writing.

82
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.820
Various courts in describing the scope of the complete integration test have

83
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:09.620
deployed at least four different adverbs to think about whether the additional

84
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:14.060
terms would have been included in the original writing they have used

85
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.530
necessarily certainly or narrowly or naturally.

86
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.600
Again,
not a whole lot of guidance.
Think again,
uh,

87
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:28.601
about Laurel agreeing to paint Hardy's house for $500 but this time,

88
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.640
uh,

89
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.640
imagine that hardy wants to present evidence that Laurel also orally agreed to

90
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:38.270
paint Hardee's tool shed for an extra hundred dollars.

91
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.700
Imagine that the court finds the painting that painting the tool shed for $100.

92
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:48.701
Is it consistent additional term and that the written house painting contract is

93
00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:50.240
a complete integration?

94
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.340
Maybe because it has a merger clause saying that it is the complete and final

95
00:06:55.341 --> 00:07:00.341
agreement of the parties with the tool shed painting term be the kind that would

96
00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:05.510
necessarily be included in the house painting agreement.
Well,
I'd argue,

97
00:07:05.511 --> 00:07:08.990
no,
it might not necessarily be included.

98
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.620
And so under the Alyeska Standard,
it might be admitted,

99
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.750
but if this were a jurisdiction that used the ordinarily included standard or

100
00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:21.290
reasonable person might come to a different conclusion and find that the tool

101
00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:25.700
shed provision would ordinarily be included in the home painting contract and

102
00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:30.500
therefore refuse to admit the extrinsic evidence as to the tool shed deal.

103
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:36.470
If you're frustrated by how the UCC treats the parole evidence rule,

104
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.490
you're not alone.

105
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.650
The United States Convention on contracts for the international international

106
00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:47.651
sale of goods known as the CIS G is meant to act as an international version of

107
00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:52.820
the UCC applying by default to the international sale of goods.

108
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.140
Unless the parties include a choice of law provision saying that the contract

109
00:07:57.141 --> 00:08:00.380
will be governed by a,
say the law of New York,

110
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:05.550
the CIS g has a substantially different take on the parol evidence rule.
Uh,

111
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:10.580
take a moment to read article eight of the CIS G on this slide.

112
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.230
It basically says that this,

113
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:49.850
that statements made by parties are to be interpreted according to their intent

114
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.940
and in order to figure out a party's intent,

115
00:08:52.941 --> 00:08:57.660
considerations can be given to relevant circumstances of the negotiation.

116
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:03.170
So under the CIS g there is no parole evidence rule and extrinsic evidence may

117
00:09:03.661 --> 00:09:07.260
be admitted even with regard to contracts that are written.

118
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:11.850
Let's work through an example to see how the CIS g would treat an issue

119
00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:13.960
involving parole evidence.
Uh,

120
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:18.720
an Italian seller of ceramic tiles and an American buyer acting through agents

121
00:09:18.721 --> 00:09:23.721
negotiate an oral agreement of sale that contained agreement on price,

122
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.570
a quality,
quantity,
delivery and payment.

123
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.260
The parties then reduce the negotiated terms,
uh,

124
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:35.130
to riding on a form prepared by the seller on the front.

125
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.750
Over the signature line.

126
00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:40.800
There was language incorporating terms on the back of the riding into the

127
00:09:40.801 --> 00:09:41.491
contract.

128
00:09:41.491 --> 00:09:46.491
And one of these terms on the back was an additional term about a default and

129
00:09:46.771 --> 00:09:49.860
delay in payment.
The agent signed the contract,

130
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:53.970
but there was evidence confirmed by affidavits that at the time of signing

131
00:09:53.971 --> 00:09:58.470
neither agent intended that the terms on the back of the writing,

132
00:09:58.471 --> 00:09:59.820
we're part of the contract.

133
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:05.690
Later there was a dispute over late payment and the seller invoked the delay in

134
00:10:06.391 --> 00:10:08.670
payment term as a defense.

135
00:10:08.671 --> 00:10:13.170
The buyer introduced evidence that neither party intended the back to be part of

136
00:10:13.171 --> 00:10:14.010
the contract,

137
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.270
although language on the friend was not modified to make this intention clear.

138
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.890
The first question is,
is this,
is this evidence admissible under uh,

139
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:28.910
the CIS G to exclude the default in payment clause?

140
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:34.680
And the answer is probably yes because of the CIS,
Geez,

141
00:10:34.681 --> 00:10:39.210
very permissive approach toward admitting extrinsic evidence.
Uh,

142
00:10:39.211 --> 00:10:43.700
these affidavits would probably be admitted.
Now the second question,
uh,

143
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:48.790
suppose the contract was formed between US citizens so that the UCC would apply

144
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:55.520
with the evidence be admissible under a UCC to two oh two under two,

145
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.530
two oh two.
If a partial integration was inferred,

146
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:01.410
extrinsic evidence of an oral agreement,

147
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.530
which is inconsistent with the written term,

148
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.160
would not be admitted in general.
However,

149
00:11:08.161 --> 00:11:12.630
section 20 of the restatement would permit the evidence to be admitted.

150
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:17.850
That section allows cases where both parties have the same intention to control

151
00:11:17.851 --> 00:11:19.440
the enforcement of a contract,

152
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.520
but the parole evidence rule that gets in the way of uh,

153
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:26.640
can get in the way of the application of this restatement rule.

154
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:32.820
It's often helpful to create a flowchart to map out how the various aspects,

155
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:37.380
the various tests of UCC to two oh two interrelate.

156
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:42.660
Uh,
this slide shows a flow chart created by professor Keith rally.

157
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:48.200
The Alyeska decision suggests another flow chart that changes the order in which

158
00:11:48.241 --> 00:11:51.840
the questions are asked.
You might do well to write your own.

159
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.090
In summary,
the parole evidence rule.

160
00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:00.300
See Cs two dash two oh two determines when extrinsic evidence can be used to

161
00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:04.390
explain or supplement the terms in a written contract.

162
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:09.840
The parole evidence rule only applies to integrated writings that is riding a

163
00:12:10.451 --> 00:12:14.740
riding that is final expression of some or all of the terms of the agreement.

164
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:20.470
The court in this case adopted a three step test to determine if extrinsic

165
00:12:20.471 --> 00:12:23.560
evidence is allowed to supplement.
First,

166
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:28.000
is the writing partially integrated with regard to the extrinsic evidence at

167
00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:32.730
issue?
If no,
then the extrinsic evidence is allowed even if,
uh,

168
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:37.090
uh,
the evidence is inconsistent or contradictory.
Second,

169
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.370
if the writing is partially integrated,

170
00:12:39.371 --> 00:12:44.320
is the ex external evidence inconsistent or contradictory to the written terms?

171
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:46.900
If it is inconsistent or contradictory,

172
00:12:46.901 --> 00:12:51.040
then the parole evidence rule applies and the extrinsic evidence cannot be

173
00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:55.210
included.
Third is the complete integration test.

174
00:12:55.211 --> 00:12:59.140
If the contract is a complete integration than extrinsic evidence of even

175
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.020
consistent additional terms will not be admitted.

176
00:13:02.021 --> 00:13:06.310
If the court finds that those additional terms would necessarily have been

177
00:13:06.311 --> 00:13:09.470
included in the writing.
Finally,
uh,
uh,

178
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:13.690
potential fourth desks might ask whether the extrinsic evidence is merely

179
00:13:13.691 --> 00:13:16.960
interpreting existing ambiguous terms.

180
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.610
If it's just interpreting terms,
then it can,
uh,

181
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:25.710
can be admitted if the integrated but ambiguous term is reasonably susceptible

182
00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:28.720
to the proffered interpretation.

183
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:34.800
The CIS g avoids this mess of the UCC is parol evidence rule by generally

184
00:13:36.101 --> 00:13:39.010
considering,
uh,
all extrinsic evidence.
