1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.030
Today we're going to learn about a case where starting the performance of a

2
00:00:06.031 --> 00:00:09.720
contract constituted acceptance.
As you already know,

3
00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:14.721
it's possible to accept a contract without verbally saying I accept or signing

4
00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:16.740
your name on a dotted line.

5
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.570
We have already encountered this when we discussed implied in fact contracts

6
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:22.650
because performance,

7
00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:27.651
say a restaurant server bringing you your food is one way to show that uh,

8
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.360
a restaurant was agreeing to the deal more generally.

9
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.420
Explicit offers by default can be accepted by any reasonable means and an offer

10
00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:40.501
he is.

11
00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:45.501
Performance is one important way that an offeree can accept an offer

12
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.840
ever tight roofing corporation versus green was decided by the Court of Appeals

13
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.750
in Louisiana in 1955.

14
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.940
You might've noticed that a judge with the last name airs wrote the opinion in

15
00:01:01.941 --> 00:01:04.580
case you're wondering,
he has no relation to me.

16
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.750
The defendant appellee green wanted someone to reroof his house and green

17
00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:17.060
offered to hire the plaintiff and the appellant ever tight.
Uh,

18
00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:22.061
the agreement was to become binding only upon acceptance or signature by an

19
00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:27.761
officer of the plaintiff or by the plaintiffs commencement of the work.

20
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.790
After receiving a satisfactory credit report,

21
00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:36.380
the plaintiff loaded it's truck and drove to the defendant's house to begin the

22
00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:38.570
work.
To his surprise,

23
00:01:38.571 --> 00:01:43.571
the plaintiff found that another company has already started doing the repair

24
00:01:43.731 --> 00:01:47.360
work and the defendant told the plaintiff to go home and not to perform the

25
00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:48.194
contract.

26
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.550
The plaintiff sued and the trial court found for the defendant,

27
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.100
but the instinct court reversed.

28
00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.100
So let's begin simply in this case.

29
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.730
Who is the relevant offer or and who is the offeree?

30
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.220
Well,

31
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.220
the defendant green is surprisingly the offer or the plaintiff ever tight is the

32
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.700
offeree.
Yeah.

33
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.180
You might've noticed that ever tight supplied the standard form,
uh,

34
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.940
on which green made the offer.
Uh,

35
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.970
the ever tight salesmen filled out the form and green by signing it became the

36
00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:29.880
offer or don't get confused by this fact.

37
00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:32.100
It's possible to be the offer war,

38
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.310
but not the drafter of the contractual offer.

39
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.620
This happens whenever the offer or uses a form prepared by the offeree.

40
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.430
Before we get to the holding of the case,

41
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.340
let's take a moment to understand the terms of the offer.

42
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Greens offer specified that it could be accepted by a home officer's signature.

43
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.650
Instead of empowering the salesperson to accept the offer,

44
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.020
this mode of acceptance gave the Home Office time to check the credit or to give

45
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:08.380
the plaintiff a chance to make sure that the price offered by the salesman for

46
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:11.290
the work was sufficiently remunerative.

47
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.040
Another big benefit of delaying acceptance until,
uh,

48
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.110
the Greens offer was brought back to the Home Office is that it avoids the

49
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:24.910
possibility that 10 salespeople will enter into conflicting contracts at the

50
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:25.744
same time.

51
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.290
But Greens offer again drafted by the plaintiff also stated that the offer could

52
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:37.171
be accepted by plaintiff ever tight quote commencing work on quote.

53
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.290
This is largely done because mistakes sometimes get made a of the procedural

54
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:48.691
kind that sometimes the Home Office officers screw up and forget to sign the

55
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:50.404
offers.

56
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.590
And the plaintiff wanted to be sure that it didn't ever start work on a

57
00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.130
construction contract without a valid contract in place.

58
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.790
There are two major issues raised by this case.

59
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.030
The first is whether the defendant's offer terminated due to the passage of

60
00:04:09.101 --> 00:04:09.934
time.

61
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.290
And the second is whether the plaintiff's action constituted sufficient

62
00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:16.930
performance to accept the agreement.

63
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.420
Let's take a look at each of these questions.

64
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.890
So you'll recall from the case that the plaintiffs showed up about eight or nine

65
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:29.920
days after he heard the offer from green.

66
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.230
Was the offer still good by the time the plaintiff showed up?
Well,

67
00:04:35.231 --> 00:04:39.250
the court held that yes,
Greens offer was still good.

68
00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:41.510
It was still operative.
Uh,

69
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.100
when the plaintiff loaded his truck.

70
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.780
There are two ways to determine when an offer has terminated.
First,

71
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.570
the contract can specify a time.
For instance,

72
00:04:52.571 --> 00:04:56.290
it can say this offer will expire in five days.

73
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.740
Most residential real estate offers include this kind of drop dead provision.

74
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.800
Second,
if no time is specified,

75
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.690
then the offer ends after a reasonable time.
In this case,

76
00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:13.740
defendant knew that some delay would inch,
uh,

77
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.620
would ensue before commencement of the work and the court held that the

78
00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:20.590
plaintiff's action occurred within a reasonable time.

79
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.200
So with regard to the first issue,

80
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.880
the offer was still effective at the time the plaintiff loaded it's truck

81
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.360
section 36 of the second restatement,
uh,

82
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.090
notes for different events that can terminate and offer ease,

83
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.510
power of acceptance,
uh,
in,

84
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.030
in a sense for different things that can blow up the effectiveness of an offer.

85
00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.550
An offer is terminated if the offeree makes a counteroffer.
Uh,

86
00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:55.990
the reasonable time limitation protects offerings from having their offers

87
00:05:55.991 --> 00:05:56.824
hanging out there.

88
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:03.070
The offer could also revoke the offer and of course the offer expires if the

89
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:08.510
offer war of the offeree dies or becomes incapacitated.
In some ways,

90
00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:13.511
the most interesting rule is that an offer is terminated if the offer makes a

91
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:14.690
counteroffer.

92
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.050
This also helps limit the number of outstanding offers in an negotiation in the

93
00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:25.220
midst of bargaining where each side makes a series of counteroffers and an

94
00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:29.420
acceptance,
uh,
then occurs.
It's a,

95
00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:30.740
as a matter of accounting,

96
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:35.720
the acceptance only applies to the last offer from the other side because each

97
00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:39.440
counter offer blows up all previous offers.

98
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.890
So let's turn to this,
uh,
to the second issue.

99
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:51.190
Did the plaintiff's action of loading it's truck with materials constitute

100
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:55.880
sufficient performance to accept the agreement?
The court held that yes,

101
00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:01.090
the plaintiff did enough to accept the agreement performance began when the

102
00:07:01.101 --> 00:07:03.290
trucks were loaded.
At this point,

103
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.330
plaintiff commenced work and this constituted a promise.
Uh,

104
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.520
this,
uh,
this constituted a sufficient performance to accept the offer.

105
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.250
As you can probably imagine,

106
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:20.510
allowing the plaintiff to accept by performance creates a lot of ambiguity.

107
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.740
For one thing,
it's debatable when work really starts.

108
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:30.250
Comment F to section 45 of the restatement notes that beginning per,

109
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.710
uh,
preparations is not enough as PR,
uh,

110
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.090
as perform of performance to accept an offer.

111
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.620
The plaintiff argues his work started when he loaded the trucks,

112
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:47.120
but the defendants argued that the work really wouldn't have begun until after

113
00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:50.810
the trucks arrived at the defendant's property.
At that point,

114
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:55.990
green clearly revoked his offer by telling the plaintiff to go home and that

115
00:07:56.361 --> 00:08:01.190
revocation under section 36 would have ended the plaintiff's power of
acceptance.

116
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.100
So you can see that timing is crucial here.

117
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.740
You can also imagine that the court's ruling that work began back at the office

118
00:08:09.741 --> 00:08:14.630
might make it harder for the defendant off roar to know what's happening when

119
00:08:14.631 --> 00:08:15.950
his offer was accepted.

120
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.990
The plaintiff in this case drafted the contract and can keep the defendant in

121
00:08:20.991 --> 00:08:25.991
the dark by not accepting a and can commence the work without prompt.

122
00:08:26.121 --> 00:08:26.954
Notice.

123
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:31.850
If a promissory acceptance by conduct commencing performance is invited,

124
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:36.440
there may be some obligation to communicate that fact,
uh,

125
00:08:36.441 --> 00:08:38.510
to the offer or in a reasonable time.

126
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:43.250
So let's explore the implications of the court reasoning further.

127
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.820
Suppose that back at the factory ever tight loads the truck and starts driving

128
00:08:50.271 --> 00:08:51.200
toward the Greens,

129
00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:55.410
but on the way ever tight suddenly decides that it would prefer to go fishing.

130
00:08:55.590 --> 00:09:00.180
Under the court's reasoning ever tight would be breaching the contract,

131
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.830
but it would be hard for green devore know this because it never found out that

132
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:06.390
the truck had ever been loaded.

133
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:12.320
It's important to note that the offer in this contract in this case could be

134
00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:18.930
accepted by either promise or performance.

135
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:23.610
In this case because the offer gave ever tight the option of accepting by

136
00:09:23.611 --> 00:09:25.560
promise or performance,

137
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.780
the beginning of performance is interpreted as a promise to complete.

138
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:36.060
Uh,
in other words,
once ever tight started performing,

139
00:09:36.061 --> 00:09:38.040
once it loaded the truck,

140
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:43.000
it was making a promise to finish the project.
Uh,
you,

141
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.500
that's why under the earlier going fishing hypothetical,

142
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:50.430
loading the truck and then changing your mind would constitute a breach.

143
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:55.820
You can see this effect in section 62 of the restatement when offer invites an

144
00:09:57.421 --> 00:10:02.421
offeree to choose between acceptance by promise and acceptance by performance.

145
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:07.970
The tender or beginning of the invited performance is an acceptance by

146
00:10:08.251 --> 00:10:09.084
performance.

147
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:10.790
<v 1>Okay.</v>

148
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:11.810
<v 0>On the other hand,</v>

149
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.860
if the contract said that acceptance could only be by performance,

150
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:21.310
beginning performance would have only created an option contract giving ever

151
00:10:21.531 --> 00:10:26.531
tight the option to dis discontinue performance without breaching a contract.

152
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:32.900
Again,
if the contract had said that ever tight,
could only perform,

153
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.990
could only accept by performance,

154
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:41.530
then if ever tied it changed its mind after loading the truck and uh,

155
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.670
decided to go fishing,
that would not have been a breach.

156
00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:51.940
Section 45 makes clear for offers that can only be accepted by performance.

157
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:56.220
That beginning of performance takes away the offers,

158
00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.220
right to revoke the offer,

159
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:02.630
but per preserves the offer he writes to reject the offer.

160
00:11:02.631 --> 00:11:05.690
Roar section 45 says,

161
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:10.930
when an offer invites an offeree to accept by rendering a performance and does

162
00:11:11.631 --> 00:11:16.631
not invite a promissory acceptance and option contract is created when the offer

163
00:11:17.751 --> 00:11:22.220
tenders or begins the invited performance or tenders of beginning of it.

164
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:24.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

165
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:29.270
<v 0>By including the option of acceptance by performance or a signature return</v>

166
00:11:29.611 --> 00:11:34.380
promise ever tight actually wrote a contract that was friendlier to the
customer.

167
00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:39.660
Then the contract had said that acceptance had to be made only by a tendering

168
00:11:41.971 --> 00:11:42.804
performance.

169
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:44.930
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

170
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.930
<v 0>So what were the damages in this case?</v>

171
00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:52.670
The answer is expectation.
For breach of a bilateral contract.

172
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.700
The plaintiff was awarded the,
uh,
profit lost on the job,

173
00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:01.540
plus reliance expenditures,
expenses in loading the trucks.

174
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:07.480
So today we have examined a case that touched on two important issues.

175
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:12.540
First and offer expires at the time specified in the contract,

176
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.730
and if no time has specified,

177
00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:21.060
then by default the offer expires after a reasonable amount of time has elapsed.

178
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:22.330
Second,

179
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:27.330
offers can invite acceptance by the beginning of performance to be valid

180
00:12:28.901 --> 00:12:33.550
acceptance.
The performance usually has to be more than mere preparation,

181
00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.910
but it has to be at least a beginning of performance.
