1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,280
We're now going to look at a pair
of cases, CAS v CAS from New York,

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,060
an AC versus Bz from Massachusetts.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,890
In both of these cases,

4
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:15,891
courts had to decide what could happen
with cryogenically frozen embryos left

5
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:20,610
over from infertility treatments
after a couple had gotten divorced.

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,590
The basic story is the same in both cases.
In each case,

7
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:30,540
a couple suffered from infertility and
decided to use in vitro fertilization in

8
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:33,750
order to try to have children.
Before we go any further,

9
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:38,751
it's worth having a basic understanding
how in vitro fertilization or IVF works.

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,500
First doctors collect sperm from the man
in eggs from a woman in the latter case

11
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:47,160
with a minor surgery.

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,380
Physicians then combine the eggs and
sperm forming what the courts in these

13
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:57,381
opinions call pre embryos or
pre zygotes several days later,

14
00:00:57,421 --> 00:01:02,421
some of those pre zygotes
or then implanted into a
woman's uterus in hopes of a

15
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:03,960
successful pregnancy,

16
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,600
the woman receiving the implant can be
the same woman as the egg donor or a

17
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:11,730
surrogate.
In our cases,

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,030
the woman receiving the pre
zygotes was the egg donor.

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,650
One of the intended parents,

20
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,070
any pre zygotes that are leftover can
be cryogenically frozen for later use

21
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,200
before any of this took place.

22
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:30,201
The two couples in our two cases filled
out consent forms where they specified

23
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,380
what should happen to any cryogenically
frozen embryos should various events

24
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:37,770
occur.
For example,

25
00:01:37,771 --> 00:01:42,510
if the couple's decided they no longer
wanted children or if the couple is

26
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:44,700
passed away.
In particular,

27
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,950
these forums specified what should
happen if they separated or got divorced.

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,400
The cast is said that the zygotes should
be used for scientific research while

29
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:00,650
AC and busies consent forms specified
that Bz should get control of

30
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:06,330
cryogenically frozen zygotes.
In each case,

31
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:10,650
the ex wife wishes to use the
frozen embryos after the divorce,

32
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,040
while the ex husband does not wish to
become a father in the cast as case from

33
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:16,884
New York.

34
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:22,010
This goes against the couple's wishes as
expressed on their consent form and in

35
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:25,350
an agreement they wrote up
at the time of their divorce,

36
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,530
which affirmed that the zygotes where to
go to scientific research in AAC versus

37
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,400
Bz case.

38
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:37,670
This seems to accord with the wishes that
the couples indicated that the couple

39
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:42,741
indicated on their medical consent form
and there is no ladder documentation in

40
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:45,420
both cases.

41
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:50,340
The question is can one parent and forced
the medical consent forms against the

42
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:53,190
other in cast versus cast?

43
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:57,240
Steven CAS is attempting to enforce
their agreement that the embryos would go

44
00:02:57,241 --> 00:03:02,241
for scientific research against his ex
wife Maureen cass who wishes to try and

45
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:07,090
have them implanted in AC versus Bz.

46
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:12,210
Bz wishes to enforce the consent forms
against her ex husband a z in order to

47
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:15,670
get control of the
cryogenically frozen vials

48
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,510
in her opinion and cast versus cast.

49
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,530
Chief Justice k looks at the case like
a typical contract case in which the

50
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:29,440
court's goal is to ascertain what the
parties agreed to and then to enforce

51
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:30,274
their agreement.

52
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,710
Just because they involve a sensitive
subject does not mean they should not

53
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,310
quote generally be presumed valid and
binding unquote just as other similar

54
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:43,720
agreements are.
In fact,

55
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,930
the chief justice things
that these sort of quote,

56
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:51,610
advanced directives unquote are especially
important in emotionally sensitive

57
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:56,611
domains such as personal matters of
reproductive choice involved in this case

58
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,750
since they can prevent
litigation by making it clear
what the individuals wanted

59
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:03,640
before the conflict emerged.

60
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:09,030
Written agreements make it possible for
courts to seek to honor the parties.

61
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:13,930
Expressions of choice made
before disputes erupt.

62
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,750
The court of Appeals For New York
therefore ruled for the ex husband and

63
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:24,751
prevented the ex wife from attempting
to become pregnant using the frozen

64
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:29,260
embryos against the couple's agreement
that the embryos would go to research

65
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:30,850
should they get divorced.

66
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Justice Cowan writing for the Supreme
Judicial Court of Massachusetts in AC

67
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,360
versus BZ starts out in the same vein
looking at this as just an ordinary

68
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:43,654
contract.

69
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,810
She recites five different reasons why
the consent forms are likely unenforcable

70
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,670
as a against the ex husband.

71
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,130
The consent form was an agreement
between the couple and the clinic,

72
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,820
but did not say it was meant to form an
agreement between the two members. Uh,

73
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,960
of the couple that consent form do not
indicate for how long a period of time

74
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:08,830
they are intended to apply.

75
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:14,500
There is no definition of the term
separated in the consent form,

76
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,710
so it is not clear when it applies and
on all occasions except the first the

77
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:22,870
husband's signed the consent form,

78
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:27,871
what was still blank and then the wife
filled in all the details including the

79
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:31,630
instruction that she was to get
control of the frozen embryos.

80
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,370
The consent form is also
not a separation agreement,

81
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:40,150
so it is not enforceable between
the ex husband and the ex wife,

82
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,570
but this is not justice
Collins main argument.

83
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,070
Even if this agreement
were perfectly executed,

84
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,250
it would not be enforceable
as against public policy.

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,530
The justice is quote,

86
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:58,531
would not enforce an agreement that would
compel one to become a parent against

87
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:03,821
his or her will unquote just as Cowan
reads other aspects of Massachusetts

88
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:09,731
family law to indicate a general policy
by the state legislature that quote,

89
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,950
individuals should not be
bound by certain agreements,

90
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,160
binding them to enter or not enter
into familial relationships unquote.

91
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,570
She sees this principle at work in the
fact that parents cannot contract and

92
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:28,571
advanced to give their children up for
adoption in courts reluctance to enforce

93
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:33,320
agreements that for surrogate mothers to
give up their children they bear and in

94
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:37,700
their refusal to enforce contracts
requiring an individual to a band in a

95
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:38,534
marriage.

96
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,280
Justice Cowan here is announcing
more than a default rule,

97
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:48,170
an individual cannot by contract wave
for later decision whether to become a

98
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:49,004
parent.

99
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,800
The justice then applies the
broad principle that quote
individuals shall not be

100
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:59,420
compelled to enter into an intimate family
relationships and that the law shall

101
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:04,220
not be used as a mechanism for forcing
such relationships when they're not

102
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:09,221
desired unquote to the case at hand and
finds that the ex wife cannot use the

103
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:15,701
frozen vials since that would force her
ex husband to become a father coat over

104
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:18,320
his president.
Objections unquote.

105
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,810
The big difference between how the two
cases come out therefore appears to be

106
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,490
that in cast versus cas,

107
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:30,440
the agreement would have prevented
parenthood while an AC versus Bz.

108
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,560
The agreement would have
forced parenthood on one party,

109
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,420
but we can easily imagine arguments for
applying the general principle of cast

110
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,730
to ac and BC as well.

111
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:46,010
And he's Enbz may have thought through
very carefully at the time exactly what

112
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:50,960
they wanted and decided ex ante that
the best option was for BZ to keep the

113
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:51,770
vials.

114
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:56,770
There's an asymmetry here where courts
will protect parties from themselves when

115
00:07:56,961 --> 00:08:00,290
they have been agreed in advance.
Not to become parents,

116
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,150
but not when they have given.

117
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:07,160
When they have agreed in advance that
one we'll have a right to force a

118
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:08,360
parenthood on the other.

119
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,330
Okay,

120
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,100
so let's go to a quiz.

121
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,110
A couple began IVF several years
ago and there are several vials of

122
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:20,720
cryogenically frozen embryos leftover.

123
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,610
The couple initially specified in their
consent form that the husband would get

124
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:28,280
control of the vials if they got divorced.

125
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:33,320
Now the couple has divorced and the ex
husband wants to have the frozen embryos

126
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:37,250
implanted in a surrogate mother.
The X, Y Sue's to stop him.

127
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,800
For whom? What a Massachusetts court
rule. The ex husband or the ex wife.

128
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,330
Okay.

129
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:44,691
Well,

130
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:49,490
a Massachusetts court following a z
versus BZ would rule for the ex wife.

131
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:54,491
In this case the ex husbands action would
make her apparent against her will and

132
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:59,700
so the forms they claim to give him
the right to do this are unenforceable.

133
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,680
Surrogacy contracts race similar,
thorny,

134
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,170
ethical and public policy questions.

135
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,510
These contracts attempt to govern the
procreative choices of the surrogate after

136
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,470
implantation.

137
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:19,190
Surrogacy provisions routinely give
intended parents the right to force

138
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,470
surrogates to terminate pregnancies.

139
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:27,830
If quote a fetus suffers from a serious
birth defect or if a multiple pregnancy

140
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:34,320
occurs where the fetal reduction may be
recommended to improve the outcomes for

141
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:38,880
the remaining fetuses and
the surrogacy contracts.

142
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,590
Also routinely container related clause
that restricts the surrogate's ability

143
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:48,591
to terminate the pregnancy without the
intended parents consent unless you faces

144
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,780
substantial harm from
continuing the pregnancy.

145
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:57,450
Should these promises to terminate
or not terminate pregnancies ever be

146
00:09:57,451 --> 00:09:58,284
enforceable?

147
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,750
Should promise is determinate be
accorded more weight than promises not to

148
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:08,751
terminate for reasons suggested by the
casts and AC decisions should enforce it.

149
00:10:10,121 --> 00:10:14,610
Borough should enforce the ability turn
on whether the surrogate or intended

150
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:17,340
parents would be biological.
Parents.

151
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:23,180
Few scholars think that a court would
ever order specific performance of the

152
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:24,600
surrogate's promises,

153
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,910
but the possibility of damages
is subject to differing views.

154
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,420
We have seen two different approaches
to frozen embryo cases in the two cases

155
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,710
we've discussed.

156
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,100
Cast versus casts treated agreements
about embryos is ordinary contracts where

157
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:48,681
courts should go along with the party's
expressed ex ante wishes a z versus BZ

158
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:50,521
on the other hand,

159
00:10:50,521 --> 00:10:55,521
suggested that courts will not enforce
all agreements that commit parties to

160
00:10:55,711 --> 00:11:00,510
future family relations because
these are against public policy.
