1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,330
As we've previously discussed,

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:08,420
the AME and awarding expectation damages
as to put the injured party in as good

3
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:12,990
a position as she would have been
in had the contract been performed.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,390
This can be difficult when the injured
party possibly has a subjective value in

5
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:23,391
the other side's performance that exceeds
the economic value of performance.

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:29,030
And this is illustrated in a 1962 Oklahoma
case called PV house versus Garland

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:32,933
Coal Company,

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,940
the Pv House cases incredibly famous and
it provokes a passionate responses in

9
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:43,620
generations of law.
Students in the Pvs case,

10
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:47,430
the PV houses signed a contract
allowing the defendant,

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,520
garland coal and mining company to strip
mine a portion of their property in

12
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:55,500
exchange for royalties on the proceeds,

13
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,740
a contractual covenant specified however,

14
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,350
that the defendant was required
to restore the property. Uh,

15
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,360
after the completion of the mining,
uh,

16
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,480
after the mining was completed,
completed,

17
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,590
garland refused to restore the
land as specified in the contract.

18
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,790
And the plaintiff sued
for $25,000 in damages,

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
slightly less than the $29,000
cost of performance at trial.

20
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,180
The jury awarded the plaintiff's $5,000
far less than the cost of performance,

21
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,930
but more than the
dimunition in market value.

22
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,640
As a result of the breach,

23
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,670
which was found to be only $300 plaintiffs
and defendants both appealed the

24
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:45,960
damage award claiming respectively
that the damage award was inadequate or

25
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:50,730
excessive. The instant court
ruled in favor of the defendant.

26
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,120
The central issue is this is
the measure of contract damages,

27
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,240
the cost of performance or the dimunition
in market value as a result of the

28
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:03,144
breach.

29
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,520
The court held that when the cost of
performance is disproportionately greater

30
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,300
than the economic value of
performance as it was in this case,

31
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,540
damages are limited to the dimunition
in value caused by the breach to reach

32
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:21,780
this result.
The court relied on Oklahoma statutes,

33
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,960
which according to the court limit the
damages recoverable to a reasonable

34
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:31,710
amount, not contrary to
substantial justice and quote,

35
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,930
prevent plaintiffs from
recovering a greater amount
in damages for the breach of

36
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:41,160
an obligation than they would have
gained by the full performance thereof.

37
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,090
The court then awarded $300 the dimunition
in value resulting to the premises

38
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,520
because of nonperformance of the remedial
work under the most liberal view of

39
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:54,354
the evidence,

40
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,220
this holding was accompanied by
a sharp dissent by Justice Irwin.

41
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,080
The descent noted that the defendant
had knowledge when it prevailed upon the

42
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:07,330
plaintiffs to execute the lease,

43
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,070
that the cost of performance might be
disproportionate to the value or benefits

44
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,150
received by plaintiff for the
performance and that quote,

45
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,950
there were several negotiations between
the plaintiff and defendant before the

46
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,320
contract was executed.
Therefore,

47
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:27,760
the th the descent would award damages
equal to the cost of performance.

48
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,680
So let's take a short
detour to answer a pop quiz.

49
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,630
A construction company contracts to
build a summer home for a property owner.

50
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,040
The contract specifies that all
plumbing must use readying pipe.

51
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:47,610
The company unintentionally installs
some pipe by another manufacturer.

52
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,690
After the building is complete,

53
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,720
the property owner refuses to pay the
3,500 balance due on a $77,000 contract

54
00:03:57,311 --> 00:04:02,311
price and sues for the cost to replace
the pipes because most of the plumbing is

55
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:07,300
encased in walls. The cost to replace
the plumbing would be very high.

56
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,250
The value of the property would only
slightly increase if at all with writing

57
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:17,170
pipes. What result under
the PV house decision? Well,

58
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:18,640
under the PV house rule,

59
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:22,840
the property owner would only be entitled
to damages equal to the dimunition in

60
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:27,790
value of the property, uh, due
to noncompliant performance.

61
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,830
Since the dimunition in values much lower
because the dimunition in value is so

62
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:35,170
much lower than that cost to performance,

63
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,750
you should remember that this hypothetical
is based on Jacob and Young's versus

64
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:44,740
Kent, which we already studied at
the very beginning of this course.

65
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,360
If you didn't remember it,

66
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,950
you might consider stopping and
reviewing the course more generally.

67
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,740
The Jacob and Young's case is a good
application of the economic waste doctrine

68
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,260
referenced by the majority in Pv House.

69
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,160
The court points to section
three 46 subparagraph one
a of the first restatement

70
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,940
which concerns damages for defective run,

71
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:14,950
finished construction available for
a breach by one who has contracted to

72
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:20,310
construct this a specified product.
According to that section, the promise,

73
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:25,030
he is entitled to the reasonable cost
of construction completion in accordance

74
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:25,930
with the contract.

75
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:31,230
If this is possible and does not involve
unreasonable economic waste or the

76
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:36,580
difference between the value of that the
product contracted for would have had

77
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:41,560
and the value of the performance that
has been received by the plaintiff if

78
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:45,550
construction and completion in accordance
with the contract would involve

79
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,030
unreasonable economic waste.
However,

80
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:53,200
the court notes that the restatement
makes it clear that the economic waste

81
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:58,201
referred to consists of the destruction
of a substantially completed building or

82
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:03,551
other structure and that
no such destruction was
involved in the PV house case.

83
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,030
So the provision is it most
persuasive as an analogy,

84
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:14,260
if the change in the value of the land
from nonperformance was so much lower

85
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,240
than the cost of restoration,
why?

86
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,300
Why might the contract have included
this seemingly irrational provision of a

87
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,570
requiring a restoration of the land,

88
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,200
while perhaps the PV house has had a
very high subjective value for their land

89
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,320
that was considerably greater
than the market value.

90
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,090
If the PV has his subjective value,
exceeded the cost of restoration,

91
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,870
but was less than the value
of the contract to Garland,

92
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,210
then the restoration provision was a
value adding addition to the contract.

93
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,490
There are other possibilities.
However,

94
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:57,350
the cost of performance may have
just become unexpectedly high.

95
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,390
As a result, Garlin preferred to breach
and pay damages rather than to perform.

96
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:08,260
Another possibility which comes closer
to promissory fraud is that garland in

97
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:12,500
making the promise to restore,
never intended to perform.

98
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:17,950
Perhaps garland knew the value of the
land to the PV houses was less than the

99
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:23,861
entire Lee than the expected cost of
restoration of $29,000 but the garland

100
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:29,570
never anticipated performing
the restoration clause.

101
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,780
It expected that a court,
if push comes to shove,

102
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,200
would only award a damages that were
equal to this dimunition in value.

103
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,500
Jude,
Judith,

104
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:46,530
Mao Tej has unearthed additional facts
surrounding the PV house dispute.

105
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,700
In her historical analysis,

106
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:54,701
she learned that the PV houses apparently
waived the right to receive $3,000 in

107
00:07:56,481 --> 00:08:01,481
cash upon executing their
lease in exchange for the
special promise from Garland

108
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:06,680
to repair the property.
In other words,

109
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:11,890
the remedial work garland agreed to was
priced into the contract that garland

110
00:08:12,681 --> 00:08:17,681
was then able to breach without repaying
at least the $3,000 originally waived

111
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:23,201
by the PV houses suggests that the coal
company received a windfall under the

112
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:24,254
holding.

113
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:30,130
The PV has his case has been criticized
on the ground that the diminished value

114
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,020
award undercut both the land orders,

115
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:38,260
landowners subjective value in having
his or her land reclaimed and a broader

116
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:42,230
public interest in
achieving the same result.

117
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,770
In 1967 the Oklahoma legislature and
posted duty upon mine operators to reclaim

118
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:54,290
the land after work was done
and authorized the state
to contract for the work

119
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:58,920
to be done. If operator
defaulted a procedural side note,

120
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,260
the PV houses may have strategically
chosen not to present any evidence of

121
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:09,261
subjective value so as to leave the jury
with an all or nothing choice of costs

122
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:13,020
or performance damages or nothing.

123
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,210
Hoping that the jury would pick the
larger amount may be the land did have

124
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:21,120
sentimental value to the
plaintiffs because, oh,

125
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:23,250
they were engaged to be married there,

126
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:28,230
but sometimes it might strategically
being the plaintiff's interest to withhold

127
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,660
evidence of certain types of damage.

128
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,410
If credible subjective value
evidence were introduced,

129
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,160
a dimunition in value
award might include it.

130
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:44,070
Finally, you might ask yourself whether
the PV house rule is merely a default.

131
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:49,440
The language of the opinion seems to
be couched as a mandatory limitation on

132
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:50,274
damages,

133
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:55,050
but if future parties made clear
that because of subjective value,

134
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,690
they wanted cost or performance or
even specific performance of the,

135
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,560
of the restoration promise,

136
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,740
there's at least some chance
that courts would enforce it.

137
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:09,540
Not withstanding a substantially
smaller dimunition in market value.

138
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,860
Let's review today we've considered a
case in which a court awarded the economic

139
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:21,021
dimunition in market value in the
plaintiff's property due to a defendant's

140
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:26,391
breach because the dimunition in value
measure was considerably less than the

141
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:29,670
cost or performance damaged measure.

142
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,650
But just maybe this outcome
is merely a default rule.
