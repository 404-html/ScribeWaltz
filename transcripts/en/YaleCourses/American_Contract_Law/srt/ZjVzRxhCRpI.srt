1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,450
In this lecture I'm going to discuss
liquidated damages and agreed remedies and

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,940
then we'll look at the cell
phone termination fee cases
from California in 2011

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,350
one underlying principle we have seen
throughout this course is a strong

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,560
preference in contract law to compensate
the plaintiff instead of to punish the

5
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:27,650
defendant. That's why, uh,

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,250
there are severe limitations on
punitive damages in contract cases.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,200
It's also why we've seen the courts are
reluctant to enforce conditions that

8
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:39,360
work forfeitures on defendants.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,080
The same tendency can be seen when a
contract involves liquidated damages.

10
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,410
That is when a contract
contains a provision setting
out what the damages should

11
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:54,600
be for particular types of breaches.

12
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,110
If liquidated damages serve as a
quote penalty or forfeiture clause,

13
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:06,110
courts will not enforce them considering
them to be unconscionable or against

14
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:07,200
public policy.

15
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:13,370
A clause which liquidates damages at an
unreasonably high amount is sometimes

16
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:16,740
referred to as an interim clause.

17
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,130
These pound of flesh provisions are not
enforced because they placed the promise

18
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:28,631
or in terror or fear that she may not be
able to perform a standard formulation

19
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:32,430
of the rule.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Concerning enforceability appears in
judge Kaufman's opinion from a case called

21
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,840
leasing services
corporation versus justice,

22
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,830
which found that liquidated
damages are enforceable.

23
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,150
Only quote,

24
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,480
if the amount liquidated
bears a reasonable proportion
to the probable loss and

25
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:59,061
the amount of actual loss is incapable
or difficult of precise estimation.

26
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:06,110
These liquidated damage provisions
will not be enforced if they are quote

27
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,400
plainly or grossly disproportionate
to the probable loss unquote.

28
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,090
These criteria are often met in situations
where a company has many individual

29
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:22,080
contracts of the same type and it
knows it's average loss per breach,

30
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,380
but it's hard for the company to
determine the exact number of lost dollars

31
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:30,510
corresponding to each
particular breach of contract.

32
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,650
Section two seven 18 of the uniform
commercial code incorporates these same

33
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:39,660
principles.
As you can see,

34
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,610
the amount of the damage has to be
quote reasonable in the light of the

35
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:47,040
anticipated or actual harm.

36
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,830
They can not be unreasonably large.

37
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,160
They also must be justified
by the difficulties of
proof of loss corresponding

38
00:02:56,041 --> 00:03:00,640
to the idea that the actual loss from
the breach of a particular contract must

39
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:01,990
be difficult to calculate.

40
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,000
The second restatement section on
liquidated damages is quite similar.

41
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,080
The economists have severely critiqued
the doctrine on liquidated damages.

42
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:17,110
The doctrine refusing to enforce
many of these provisions.

43
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,800
The economists arguments fall
into three main categories.

44
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,640
The first argument is that
parties are rational, uh,

45
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:26,620
in bargaining for a contract.

46
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:30,610
They negotiate many provisions but
ultimately signed the contract.

47
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:35,260
If it's to their advantage, if parties
sign a liquidated damage provision,

48
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,730
they must've gotten something else
at least as valuable and exchange.

49
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,400
And so we should generally,
uh,

50
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:46,330
enforce contracts that will
tend to make parties better off.

51
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,080
The next and related argument is that
the parties know more about the value of

52
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:56,020
losses they incur. If there's
a breach, then the court does,

53
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,940
they should be allowed to set and
liquidated damages based on that private

54
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:05,470
knowledge without the court coming in
later to second guess their decision.

55
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,240
And finally,

56
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,190
the doctrine on liquidated damages
prevent the parties from shifting risk.

57
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,053
For example,

58
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:18,270
if parties set liquidated damages for
a seller's breach to be more than the

59
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,340
buyer's cost for covering transaction,

60
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:25,870
that prevents the seller from getting
all of the upside risk of a better

61
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:27,490
opportunity.
Coming along.

62
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:33,030
The liquidated damages clause gives the
buyer a bargaining chip to negotiate for

63
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:36,160
part of the game.
Under the current doctrine.

64
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,630
It would be much more difficult to
shift any upside risk to the buyer.

65
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,850
For these reasons,

66
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:47,530
economists have suggested that courts
should simply enforce liquidated damage

67
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:51,220
provisions as written unless there's
a procedural reason to think that the

68
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:52,630
parties did not consent.

69
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,590
You might still strike down clauses
that were procedurally as well as

70
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:58,120
substantively unconscionable,

71
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:03,010
but you wouldn't strike them down merely
because courts felt one side was buying

72
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:03,461
too much.

73
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:08,461
Insurance state courts have varied in
the extent to which they've engaged with

74
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:12,970
these economic arguments with some
being more willing to enforce liquidated

75
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:14,650
damage provisions than others.

76
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,170
This should not give you the sense that
parties have no ability to contract

77
00:05:20,171 --> 00:05:24,790
about the results of the suit for
breach of contract parties may generally

78
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,090
specify what sorts of
remedies will be available.

79
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,480
Section two seven 19 of the UCC sets
out one version of of this kind of

80
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:34,991
regulation.

81
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:39,430
It allows parties to set out
additional remedies beyond those.

82
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:44,431
The UCC generally makes available or to
substitute their own preferred remedies.

83
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,520
For the UCC is remedies under sub
section three of this prevention which is

84
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:55,750
emitted from this slide. They can
even disallow consequential damages.

85
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,130
Subsection two however,

86
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,370
ensures that the non breaching party will
always have enough effective remedy if

87
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:07,700
the substitute remedy quote
fails of its essential purpose,

88
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:13,060
the general UCC remedies spring back
into life and are available as a fallback

89
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:13,964
option.

90
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,840
Let's look at one case dealing with a
kind of liquidated damage provision,

91
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,750
a kind that to which many of you have
been subject the cell phone termination

92
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:31,571
fee cases from California in 2011 dealt
with early termination fees charged by

93
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:38,891
sprint to customers who end their cell
phone service contract before the term is

94
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:40,934
up.

95
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,830
These pictures should give you a quick
reminder of what cell phones looked like

96
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,960
back when this case was decided

97
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:54,820
back in the 1990 sprint found that it
had excessive churn and it's cell phone

98
00:06:55,821 --> 00:06:56,654
customers.

99
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,580
That means too many customers were backing
out of their contracts and going with

100
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:02,570
other providers.

101
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,050
In 2000 it introduced an early termination
fee of $150 and saw a significant

102
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:15,041
decrease in churn in 2005 it increased
the termination fees to $200 over the

103
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,970
period covered by this case,

104
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,960
which is a class action on behalf
of California sprint customers.

105
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:29,290
It managed to collect nearly $74 million
in early termination fees from just

106
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,360
it's California customers.

107
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:38,350
The trial court found the
early termination fee to be
an unlawful penalty and so

108
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:43,451
it enjoined sprint from continuing to
collect it and awarded damages of the full

109
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:44,750
amount collected.

110
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,490
But the jury had also found that
the actual damages to sprint,

111
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,760
we're more than $225 million equal to
the amount of unpaid early termination

112
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:56,840
fees,

113
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,520
which indicated that they had
misunderstood the question
and the testimony and

114
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:06,521
so the court ordered a partial new trial
on the question on that question and on

115
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:10,520
how to set off those damages
against the amount collected.

116
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,200
Both parties appealed.

117
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:18,340
We are now reading justice a brony
errors opinion from the first district

118
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,690
California Court of Appeals. He considered
the question of whether sprints,

119
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:28,691
early termination fees acted
as invalid liquidated damages.

120
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,860
The court applied a two part test to
determine whether the early termination

121
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:37,820
fees served as a penalty and
was therefore unenforceable.

122
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,740
These this two part test is similar to
the statement we saw earlier by Judge

123
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:47,480
Kaufman but is not quite identical.
The first part should look familiar.

124
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:52,510
It must be impracticable or extremely
difficult to determine the amount of

125
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:54,210
damages here.

126
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,110
The trial court had found that it was
very difficult to calculate sprints,

127
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:03,111
avoidable costs from any
given a termination and so
sprint pass this first test

128
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:09,780
and the plaintiffs didn't dispute
that sprint failed. The second prong.

129
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:10,614
However,

130
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,850
this required not merely as
judge Kaufman and the UCC had it,

131
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,140
that liquidated damages be reasonable.
Rather,

132
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:23,180
the amount of the damages must have
been set by a reasonable endeavor to

133
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:27,990
determine what is fair
compensation for the loss.

134
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,840
It's not enough that the
amount be reasonable,

135
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:35,790
but the process to reach that amount
must have been based on an estimation of

136
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,640
actual damages.
Here sprint failed.

137
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,500
It's set the amount with an eye toward
reducing churn by imposing penalties on

138
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:44,670
customers who left,

139
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:49,560
not with an eye toward compensating
it itself or their loss business.

140
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,070
This result doesn't seem entirely fair.

141
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,250
Based on the court's
discussion of the facts,

142
00:09:56,251 --> 00:09:58,500
it seems quite likely that sprints,

143
00:09:58,501 --> 00:10:02,730
actual losses may have been larger
than the amount of assessed in early

144
00:10:02,731 --> 00:10:07,731
termination fees should it
really be prevented from
recouping it's actual losses

145
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:12,741
because it used an improper process to
set liquidated damages that turned out to

146
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:16,710
be too low. In any event,
that is how the court rule

147
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,230
sprint tried to argue that it's fees.
We're not a penalty,

148
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,760
but rather an alternative
mode of performance. Uh,

149
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:27,990
under sprints theory,

150
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,820
customers may fulfill their obligation
either by sticking with their phone plan

151
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:36,210
or by paying the fee as an
alternative performance,

152
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,520
but the court didn't buy this argument.

153
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,710
They found that the contract allowed
sprint to impose the fee in voluntarily on

154
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:48,711
customers to pay the fee when sprint
decided to terminate their contracts,

155
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,870
when the customer's
failed to pay their bills,

156
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,260
which meant that the feed
behaved much more like a penalty.

157
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:00,330
Then an alternative performance that
the customers themselves could choose

158
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:01,740
justice.

159
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,740
Bruni air would not allow sprint to
quote indirectly accomplish in this way

160
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:10,260
something that the legislature
intended to prohibit.

161
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,100
Okay.

162
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,780
All right. Well, let's go to a quiz.

163
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:19,020
Sheila runs a rental car company and
customers often return cars late,

164
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,490
which often hurts her business because
she has no car available for the next

165
00:11:24,491 --> 00:11:25,324
customer.

166
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:30,570
She knows that these losses loses her on
average $100,000 per year and that 500

167
00:11:32,951 --> 00:11:35,110
cars are returned late each year.

168
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:40,210
What would be an acceptable amount for
liquidated damages for a late return?

169
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:47,980
Well, Sheila can probably
set liquidated damages, uh,

170
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,370
of at $200 and have them be enforced.

171
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:56,680
This is a situation where it is hard to
estimate exactly what the cost is for

172
00:11:56,681 --> 00:12:01,120
many given late car because
of the individual rental
cars aren't associated with

173
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:03,190
particular customers in advance.

174
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,820
$200 quote bear is a reasonable proportion
to the probable loss unquote because

175
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:15,871
it's equal to the aggregate
loss of $100,000 divided
by the number of incidents

176
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,100
that contribute to that loss,

177
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:23,101
which is 500 that is a late
return on average cost Sheila,

178
00:12:24,071 --> 00:12:28,900
$200 but it's difficult to say which
late returns because precisely what

179
00:12:28,901 --> 00:12:32,140
proportion of those
losses in this lecture,

180
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:37,120
we've seen that liquidated damages clauses
set the amount of damages for breach

181
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:42,150
in advance and an explicit provision of
the contract courts will enforce them

182
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,730
when they satisfy two main criteria.
First,

183
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:49,030
they must be reasonably related
to the amount of actual losses.

184
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:54,310
And in California they must actually
be set based on such a calculation.

185
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:59,230
Second, it must be difficult
to calculate the actual losses.

186
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:03,970
So the setting of liquidated damages
in advance serves a useful function.

187
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,470
But also keep in mind the
economic critiques we saw,

188
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:13,360
which suggests that even penalties
should be enforced as long as they are

189
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,770
adequately disclosed.
