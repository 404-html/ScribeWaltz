1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,480
Today we will continue our discussion
of pre contractual reliance based

2
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:06,384
liability.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,820
You might remember from our last class
discussing the Hoffman v Red Owl case.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,120
That liability may be appropriate if
one party repeatedly Bates and switches

5
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:21,870
during negotiation and the other
party relies to its detriment.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,560
Today we will see a more modern
application of this idea in Dixon,

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,820
the wells Fargo Bank.
Despite being a fairly recent case,

8
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:36,960
Judge Young's opinion includes one of
the most careful discussions of the

9
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:41,400
development of promissory Estoppel
and the literature on pre contractual

10
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:44,520
negotiations.
Before we start,

11
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,430
let's take a moment to understand
the basics of a mortgage.

12
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,250
A mortgage or a mortgage loan is
used by home buyers to purchase the,

13
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,520
to purchase homes.

14
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,860
The lender is usually a bank credit
union or other financial institution.

15
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,210
These loans are usually secured on the,
uh,

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,730
with the security security
being the borrower's property.

17
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,770
This means that if the borrower
defaults or is unable to pay, uh,

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,200
the loan as it comes due,

19
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:16,170
the lender can start
foreclosure proceedings,

20
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,380
which ultimately can lead to a foreclosure
sale where the proceeds from the sale

21
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:26,310
or first used to pay off the debt
and only the remainder if any.

22
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,850
Uh, it goes to the debtor. By the way,

23
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:34,200
the homeowner is the one mortgaging
the property and so it was called the

24
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:37,710
mortgage or,
and then bank is the mortgagee.

25
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,270
A mortgage is a contract with a set of
terms that binds both the lender and the

26
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:48,750
borrower. The terms of the
contractor sometimes modified.

27
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,790
This process is known as a
loan modification, sometimes
as a debt restructuring.

28
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:54,960
Of course,

29
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,610
both the lender and the borrower have
to agree to the modification for the

30
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:04,611
modification to be effective while
people modify their loans for a number of

31
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:06,540
reasons.

32
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,190
One common reason is for a change
in the borrower's ability to pay.

33
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:15,390
For instance, if someone loses
their job or a spouse becomes sick,

34
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,520
a borrower might want to modify the loan
terms to make sure he or she doesn't

35
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:23,250
default.
As you can imagine,

36
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,750
a home purchase is often quite expensive
and most people did not have enough

37
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:30,530
cash on hand to pay the whole
price of the home. That's,

38
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,950
that's why they borrow money.

39
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,290
Mortgages are therefore very common
and many of you may already have one or

40
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:41,100
we'll have one soon.
When functioning properly,

41
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,840
mortgages are essential to the wellbeing
of the economy and the real estate

42
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:47,100
market.
However,

43
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:51,270
things sometimes go awry during
the subprime mortgage crisis,

44
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:56,271
which contributed to the US and world
recession from 2007 through 2009 a decline

45
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:05,071
in home prices caused a large number of
homeowners to default and led to massive

46
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:07,390
mortgage foreclosures.

47
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,750
The effects rattled the U S and world
economies and we're still still feeling

48
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,060
some of those effects today. The, uh,

49
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:21,061
events in the Dixon case happen during
this turbulent time in the u s economy in

50
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:24,100
June,
2009,

51
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,340
the plaintiff's Dixon's orally agreed
with the defendant's well Fargo to take

52
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:34,120
steps to enter in to a mortgage
loan modification negotiations,

53
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,660
including stopping payments
on their mortgage and
submitting requested financial

54
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:45,010
information. The plaintiff's
perform these, perform these steps.

55
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,250
But the defendants failed to enter the
modification negotiations in December,

56
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,250
2010 plaintiffs received notice that
defendant was foreclosing based on the

57
00:03:57,251 --> 00:04:02,251
borrower's failure to make
mortgage payments even
though the borrower failed to

58
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:07,741
make payments be at the request of wells
Fargo as a precondition of going into a

59
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,590
modification negotiation.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,450
Yeah,

61
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:18,070
the plaintiffs initiated suit in
state court seeking number one,

62
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:22,450
an injunction prohibiting defendant from
foreclosing on their home and number

63
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:27,451
two specific performance of
an oral agreement to enter
into loan modifications.

64
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:33,250
And number three, seeking damages.
The defendant, Wells Fargo,

65
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:37,840
removed the case to federal
court and then move to dismiss.

66
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,150
How can you make an argument
that promissory Estoppel
liability as appropriate

67
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:47,810
under these alleged facts?
Well,

68
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:53,140
promissory Estoppel again allows for
enforcing the promise even if made without

69
00:04:53,391 --> 00:04:54,800
formal consideration.

70
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:59,870
When the promise see relies on the
promise to her detriment. In this case,

71
00:04:59,871 --> 00:05:01,730
the promise,
the promise.

72
00:05:01,731 --> 00:05:06,050
See was the borrower who relied on
the bank's promise to enter in to

73
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:07,940
modification negotiations.

74
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,710
If the borrowers would stop
making their monthly payments,

75
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,380
the borrower's reliance was to their
detriment because the bank subsequently

76
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:19,730
foreclosed on their home.

77
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:20,940
Yeah.

78
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,940
The main issue in this case is whether
promissory representations in preliminary

79
00:05:26,101 --> 00:05:31,101
negotiations give rise to pre contractual
liability when the promise he acts in

80
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:37,581
reasonable Lee foreseeable reliance upon
those representations or promises to

81
00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:40,554
their detriment.

82
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:41,930
Okay,

83
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,930
let's break it down to
make sure we understand the
promises or the problem story

84
00:05:47,271 --> 00:05:51,560
representation in this case is the
banks offer to enter into a loan

85
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:52,580
modifications.

86
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,470
The negotiations are preliminary because
they're not negotiating the of the

87
00:05:57,471 --> 00:06:02,090
modification. The liability in
this case would be pre contractual.

88
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:06,350
Since we can consider the modified
loan to be a new contract,

89
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,590
the liability is for the borrowers
reliance made prior to any actual loan

90
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:13,900
modification.
The promise.

91
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,920
See in this case the borrower's relied
on the banks promissory representation by

92
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:23,830
stopping, uh, uh, making payments and,

93
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,930
and by submitting the requested
financial information,

94
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,930
this was to their detriment because again,

95
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:34,460
the bank turned around and foreclosed on
their home for failure to make payments.

96
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:39,800
Thus, another way to frame this issue
is simply whether promissory Estoppel is

97
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:44,240
available for pre contractual promises.
In this case,

98
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:45,590
the court held that yes,

99
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:50,210
promissory Estoppel is available for
pre contractual promises. This is true.

100
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:53,570
Even though all the other
elements of contractual liability,

101
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,500
we're not made out such as
sufficient definiteness.

102
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,740
Is this case a new red l?
Well,

103
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:04,520
in our last lesson we learned
about the holding and red owl,

104
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:09,440
which will also allowed for pre
contractual reliance spaced liability.

105
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,570
When read Al was decided there was
thought there was a thought that it was an

106
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:19,571
application of promissory Estoppel in
the pre contractual setting that might

107
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:25,390
point the way toward a more
general obligation of good
faith in pre contractual

108
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:26,510
negotiations.

109
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,080
That potential was not realized as
red owl has not had a broad effect.

110
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,800
In some ways the Dixon case though
shows that Red Al is not dead yet.

111
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:45,130
It can still have important implications
in certain current circumstances.

112
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,710
Also recall teachers insurance, uh, uh,

113
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,670
by Judge Laval that we
discussed in the last case. Uh,

114
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:59,030
and it's line of
preliminary agreement cases,

115
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:04,510
the teachers insurance case adopted and
intent based test for when parties have

116
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:08,540
entered into a preliminary
agreement to negotiate.

117
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,850
The key inquiry query was whether the
parties intended for their commitment to

118
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:15,380
negotiate to be binding.

119
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:21,190
Judge young was clearly aware of the
teachers case and that line of cases.

120
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,700
Is there a reason he did not apply
them to the Dixon case itself? Well,

121
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:33,701
one reason may be that the intent based
inquiry would not generate the result of

122
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:39,230
liability that judge young wanted.
Uh,

123
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:44,290
this intent based inquiry created a
strong presumption against finding binding

124
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,870
obligations in agreements to negotiate.

125
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,710
It might make more sense for sophisticated
parties who understand what the law

126
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:56,040
is and understand the each other.

127
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,460
Here the bank has a lot more information
than the plaintiff borrowers who are

128
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,590
are struggling to understand
the terms of the loan.

129
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,930
This might be one reason for why judge
young opted for promissory Estoppel in

130
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:14,700
this case.
This example also might be a,

131
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,060
an example of crisis law.

132
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,710
During Times of war or
economic or political crisis,

133
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,920
courts might decide cases differently
than they would during non crisis times.

134
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,940
What law is being applied in this case,
state or federal?

135
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:38,850
The answer is State Law.
Notice that while this is a federal court,

136
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,330
most of the citations are
to Massachusetts cases.

137
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,150
Much contemporary law
regarding pre contractual
liability has been developed by

138
00:09:48,151 --> 00:09:49,140
federal courts,

139
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:53,510
by federal judges applying
state law teachers.

140
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:57,510
Insurance is especially
noteworthy in this regard. First,

141
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,890
it ran against the spirit
of New York state law cases,

142
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,370
uh,
cases decided by New York state courts,

143
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,320
which schlock sharply limited pre
contractual liability. And second,

144
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,270
the broad ranging factual inquiry into
the party's intent differed from the

145
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:20,271
tendency of New York courts to put
greater weight on the written word in the

146
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:21,810
United States.

147
00:10:21,811 --> 00:10:26,811
A federal court can pose a certified
question for an opinion on a question of

148
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:30,660
state law to assist or state court.

149
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,520
Not every state permits federal
courts to certify questions,

150
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,040
uh,
to their state courts.

151
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:43,070
But Massachusetts does in Dixon judge
young discuss this possibility but

152
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:48,381
ultimately decided not to certify the
question whether the Dixons allegations

153
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:53,810
are sufficient to state a claim for
promissory Estoppel to the judicial court,

154
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,960
which is the highest
court in Massachusetts.

155
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,680
Though the judge leaves
open the possibility for
certification if wells Fargo or

156
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,840
the Dixon files a motion for him to do so.

157
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:12,890
Whether federal courts should be more
willing to certify undecided state law

158
00:11:12,931 --> 00:11:17,280
questions to state courts
is an interesting problem.

159
00:11:17,281 --> 00:11:18,150
On the one hand,

160
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:23,420
certification might reduce inconsistency
in application of state law and give

161
00:11:23,911 --> 00:11:28,050
states better control
over what their law is.

162
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,680
On the other hand,
it might slow the wheels of justice.

163
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:36,240
Today we examine Dixon versus wells Fargo,

164
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,480
a case that held promissory
representations in pre
contractual note negotiations

165
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,110
can be enough to establish
reliance based liability.

166
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,620
It is a modern application of red owl,

167
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,500
which we learned in just the last class.

168
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,990
The case also stands for the proposition
that reliance based liability rather

169
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:05,220
than the more exacting intent-based
inquiry inquiry and teachers assurance is

170
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:10,540
sometimes going to be chosen,
at least during times of crisis.
