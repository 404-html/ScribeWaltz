1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:02,290
For most of this course,

2
00:00:02,291 --> 00:00:07,291
we have focused on economic or peculiarity
damages such as compensating an

3
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:10,450
aggrieved party for the
value of lost property,

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,210
future earnings or cost of repair.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,080
But in this lesson we will
learn about contract loss,

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,180
treatment of other types of damages,

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,240
especially emotional damages and
punitive damages will examine two cases.

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:30,450
Bo Hawk versus department of Agriculture
and rite aid corporation versus lake

9
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:31,750
shore investors.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,710
Let's start with the bow hot case
which is about non pecuniary emotional

11
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:38,544
damages.

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,940
The plaintiff appellant in this case
Janice Bow Hawk is a research geneticist

13
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,480
who was removed from her position
with the Department of Agriculture.

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,070
Plaintiff claimed that her removal
was a violation of the whistle blower

15
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:58,071
protection act and sued for $14,000 for
Picayune Arie losses and $150,000 for

16
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:05,070
non peculiarity damages as a
result of her wrongful termination.

17
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,890
Just so we're on the same page,

18
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,130
pecuniary means of relating
to or consisting of money
and be Cuny Arie damages

19
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:19,590
or losses that can be easily
quantified in monetary terms.

20
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,810
Non pecuniary damages are not
readily quantified in monetary terms.

21
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:25,644
For example,

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,680
a plaintiff medical bills are pecuniary
losses whereas her emotional distress

23
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:34,500
and pain and suffering
are non pecuniary losses.

24
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,930
After her removal,

25
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,850
plaintiff filed a motion for damages with
the Merit System Protection Board and

26
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:46,620
Administrative Law Judge for the board
granted her motion for pecuniary damages

27
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,980
but rejected her claim
for non pecuniary damages.

28
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,280
Holding that non pecuniary damages do
not constitute consequential damages.

29
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,510
Plaintiff then petition for review
of the decision by the full board.

30
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,370
The petition was rejected.

31
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:06,870
The plaintiff then appealed to the instant
court and the instinct court affirmed

32
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:08,100
the board's decisions.

33
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,410
Okay,

34
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,700
so here's a quiz.

35
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,790
Why was the focus of the court's inquiry
on consequential damages as opposed to

36
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,540
compensatory damages?

37
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:20,540
Okay,

38
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,110
well,

39
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:26,110
Congress apparently intended to protect
whistleblowing federal employees from

40
00:02:26,721 --> 00:02:31,721
discharge by incorporating the common
law meaning of consequential damages into

41
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:34,760
the act.
As you may have noticed,

42
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:39,920
the bowl hot court suggested that it's
decision might have been different if

43
00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:44,921
compensatory rather than consequential
damages was intended by the whistle

44
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:46,700
blower protection act.

45
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,340
Okay.

46
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,960
The main issue in this case is whether
non pecuniary damages are considered

47
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,790
consequential damages.

48
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:00,390
You should recall from our lesson on
Hadley vs Baxendale that a breaching party

49
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:03,010
is liable for consequential damages.

50
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,810
That is for losses that the contracting
parties should have foreseen.

51
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,400
In other words,

52
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,560
the issue in Bo Hawk is
whether [inaudible] damages
are foreseeable according to

53
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:19,000
the rule of Hadley feedbacks and Dale
consequential damages are easiest for

54
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:21,970
courts to see when the
breaching party as a seller.

55
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,250
Here are the breaching party is a buyer,

56
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,610
the employer who is buying
the plaintiff's employment.

57
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,250
In this case the court held that no non
pecuniary damages are not sufficiently

58
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:35,260
foreseeable to be awarded.

59
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,360
Non Peculiarity damages are generally
unforeseeable when the contract is signed.

60
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,830
As a result, consequential damages
are limited to pecuniary damages.

61
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,890
The second restatement states that mental
anguish is recoverable in a contract

62
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:55,051
breach when the quote breach is of
such a kind that serious emotional

63
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,310
disturbance was a particularly
likely result unquote,

64
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,310
or if the breach also caused bodily harm.

65
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,160
The prevailing view is that emotional
distress damages are not available for

66
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:11,860
breach of an employment contract.
For instance,

67
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:17,070
one case emphasize that
employment contracts do not
have elements of personality

68
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,800
and that parties did not agree to protect
those types of losses even though an

69
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:26,890
ordinary employment contract
and might be excluded.

70
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:32,170
The fact that the discharge employee is
a whistle blower and is discharged for

71
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:36,250
that fact brings the likelihood of
emotional disturbance into play.

72
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,680
The focus for the second restatement
is the likelihood of d of emotional

73
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:45,580
disturbance at the time of breach,
not the time of contracting,

74
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,190
but one can ask whether this presumption
against awarding employees damages for

75
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:54,070
emotional distress is
merely a default rule.

76
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,640
If the initial contract had called for
such damages or otherwise indicated that

77
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:02,920
serious emotional distress is likely,

78
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,900
would courts be willing to enforce that
kind of promise? Well, it's not clear.

79
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:11,680
There's a lot of judicial reluctance
to expand damages in this way.

80
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:12,971
Then again,

81
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:17,350
if the parties contract says so
explicitly that they wanted it,

82
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,330
it's a,
it might happen.

83
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,240
Claims for mental anguish or emotional
distress damages are on the borderline

84
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:29,080
between contract and tort.

85
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,280
The emotional disturbance results
from a breach of contract,

86
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,200
say a wrongful termination,

87
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:40,201
but the injury is to what might be
called a tort rather than a contractual

88
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:45,700
interest. Uh, in addition to
losing the value of the bargain,

89
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,690
the plaintiff is worse off
physically than before the contract.

90
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,640
In one Hawaii case,

91
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:56,641
the court rejected awarding damages for
tortious breach of contract because such

92
00:05:56,891 --> 00:06:01,891
a would blur the theories of recovery
relevant to tort and contract.

93
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,360
They held that emotional distress damages
will only be awarded where parties

94
00:06:06,361 --> 00:06:11,361
specifically provide for
them in the contract or were
or were clearly within the

95
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:15,740
contemplation of the parties.
So at least in Hawaii,

96
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:20,741
the presumption against a war II awarding
emotional distress damages is just a

97
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:25,850
default. It can be contracted round
in the initial contract itself.

98
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,180
Okay,

99
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,900
let's switch gears and take a
look at another type of damages.

100
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:36,140
Punitive damages in rite aid
corporation versus lake shore investors.

101
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,600
The plaintiff Appellee Lake shore sued
the defendant rite aid for falsely

102
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:46,550
claiming that a valid lease agreement
existed between the two. Uh,

103
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,780
the two of them when it did not.

104
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,900
Lake shore also sued rite aid for
interference with another contract because

105
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:59,001
rite aid refused to provide a release
allowing a third party purchaser to

106
00:06:59,341 --> 00:07:04,341
withdraw from its deal with lake shore
if the rite aid claim over the property

107
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:05,700
became an issue.

108
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,220
Okay.

109
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:14,220
The trial court did not
distinguish between these
two separate causes of action

110
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,640
and it also refuse to
award punitive damages.

111
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,060
Plaintiff appealed and the
Court of special appeals
reversed and held that lake

112
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:29,471
shore should have been able to prove
damages that would quote reasonably flow

113
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:32,050
from a tortious contractual interference.

114
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,190
Defendant appealed and the instinct
court affirmed and remanded.

115
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,420
The main issue we are interested in is
whether punitive damages can be recovered

116
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,170
for an action of tortious
interference with the contract.

117
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,190
The court answered yes
allowing punitive damages.

118
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:55,630
The holding is consistent
with the interpretation of
the second restatement of

119
00:07:55,631 --> 00:08:00,631
torts which states that a person injured
by tortious interference with the

120
00:08:01,391 --> 00:08:06,391
contract can recover punitive damages
where appropriate in order for punitive

121
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:11,920
damages to be appropriate to
conditions must be met. First,

122
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,700
there must be an award of
compensatory damages and second,

123
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,920
there must be actual malice.

124
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,600
The court in this case remanded to
the trial court to apply this test.

125
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:29,460
The tort of intentional interference
with the contract is explained in section

126
00:08:29,461 --> 00:08:33,210
seven 66 of the second
restatement of torts.

127
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,370
It applies to cases where
a party intentionally and
improperly interferes with

128
00:08:38,371 --> 00:08:43,371
the performance of a contract or induces
a third person not to perform the

129
00:08:43,711 --> 00:08:44,544
contract.

130
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,900
In addition to intentional
interference with existing contracts,

131
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,800
courts have also found tort
liability for third parties,

132
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:57,801
intentional interference with prospective
and even negligent interference.

133
00:08:58,970 --> 00:08:59,090
Well,

134
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:03,540
I've heard that Columbia law school once
threatened to sue Yale Law School for

135
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,280
poaching on law applicants who
had put in deposits with Columbia.

136
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,620
Columbia claimed that making a competitive
offer was intentionally interfering

137
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,360
with Columbia's contracts

138
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:22,010
as rite aid versus lake shore
demonstrates most states follow the second

139
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:27,830
restatement of torts and permit
an intentional interference
plaintiff to recover

140
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,610
inappropriate cases for emotional
distress, for harm to reputation,

141
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:37,611
and even punitive damages measures that
would not be available in an action for

142
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:39,300
contractual breach.

143
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,550
Some scholars have analogize the
toward of intentional interference with

144
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:49,551
contracts to rules that protect property
owners against theft such as the tort

145
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:50,464
of conversion.

146
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,410
Having a tort against
interference increases promises,

147
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:59,790
chances of realizing the benefits of
having secured the promise of performance.

148
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:05,220
But courts have been fickle about when
exactly and interferences improper.

149
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:07,970
Okay.

150
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,440
Does awarding punitive damages for the
tort of intentional interference with a

151
00:10:12,441 --> 00:10:15,380
contract undermine the
goals of contract law?

152
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,620
The law of intentional interference
is inconsistent with contract laws.

153
00:10:22,931 --> 00:10:26,170
Strong preference for
only compensatory damages.

154
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:31,390
Some have argued that allowing the tort
of intentional interference runs counter

155
00:10:31,391 --> 00:10:35,740
to the theory of efficient breach
contract rules are designed to facilitate

156
00:10:35,741 --> 00:10:39,100
breach where efficiency
gains were will result,

157
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:44,580
but the interference liability rule
might reduce the number of such breaches.

158
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,930
It's also possible for a breach of an
implied covenant of good faith and fair

159
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:56,730
dealing to constitute a tort for
which punitive damages may be awarded.

160
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,620
California courts have long held
that in insurance contracts,

161
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:05,850
the insurer's refusal to settle with,
uh,

162
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,970
within the terms of an insurance policy
or to pay an undisputed claim of a,

163
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,790
uh,
to an insured may be bad.

164
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:18,430
Faith may be a bad faith
toward for which the, uh,

165
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,680
insured can recover damages for mental
anguish and even punitive damages.

166
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,840
In the 1984 Siemens case,

167
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:32,870
the California Supreme Court held that
tort liability for a bad faith breach can

168
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:36,570
be opposed beyond insurance contracts.

169
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:41,571
Other kinds of promises can be tagged
with punitive damages for a bad faith

170
00:11:42,811 --> 00:11:43,644
breach,

171
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,150
but only if certain
qualifications are met in Siemens.

172
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:53,140
The court emphasized tort remedies may
be appropriate when a party seeks to

173
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:57,430
shield itself from liability by
denying that the contract exists.

174
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,800
The court explained that tort remedies
are appropriate where a contracting party

175
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:06,820
seeks to avoid all liability on
a meritorious contract claim.

176
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,310
By adopting a stonewall position,

177
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:14,311
we'll have see you in court with no
belief in the that it has a valid defense.

178
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:18,760
The court went on to explain these cases.
Uh,

179
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,850
go beyond the mere breach of contract
making tort liability permissible.

180
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,280
The Siemens rule is controversial.

181
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:32,550
Judge Alex Kosinski criticize the rule
for being in the cloud cuckoo land of

182
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:39,721
modern tort theory and
subordinary voluntary contractual
arrangements to judge's

183
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:45,250
own sense of public policy. On
the other hand, Gregory class,

184
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,170
my coauthor has defended the seam and
rule arguing that punitive damages are

185
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:55,040
needed because compensatory damages
do not sufficiently deter the source,

186
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,330
the source of stonewalling
observed in Siemens.

187
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,993
In summary,

188
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:06,150
there are many hurdles for recovering
non pecuniary and or punitive damages for

189
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:08,260
a contractual breach.

190
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,180
As the Bow Hawk case
demonstrates non peculiarity,

191
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,070
emotional damages are
generally not recoverable.

192
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:20,530
The restatement states that mental anguish
is only recoverable when the breach

193
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:25,180
is likely to result in serious
emotional disturbance. Even then,

194
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,160
ordinary employment contracts normally
do not award this kind of damages.

195
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:35,790
Rite aid stands for the principle that
punitive damages may be possible for an

196
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:40,600
intentional interference with the
contractual relationship. However,

197
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:42,520
for punitive damages to apply,

198
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:47,700
there must be an award of compensatory
damages and there must be actual malice

199
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,490
present.
