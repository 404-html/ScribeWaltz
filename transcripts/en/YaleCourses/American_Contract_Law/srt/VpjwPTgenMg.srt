1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:05,640
The next case,
American standard versus Szuchman again,

2
00:00:05,641 --> 00:00:08,430
deals with a case of
incomplete performance,

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,990
but it comes to exactly the
opposite conclusion from Pv House,

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,300
which we saw in the last lecture
and Jacob and Young's versus Kent,

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,560
which we saw in the
beginning of the course.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,740
The plaintiff in this
case as American standard,

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,980
which ran a pig iron manufacturing plant
on the Niagara River at the western end

8
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:32,670
of New York state.
When they decided to close the plant,

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,190
they contracted with Harold Shechtman,

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,460
a demolition and excavating contractor
who paid $275,000 to buy the buildings

11
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:48,270
and other structures and most of the
equipment in exchange for these Shechtman.

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,600
Also promise quote to
remove the equipment,

13
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,750
demolish the structures and grade the
property as specified in preparation for

14
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:01,800
American standards. Sale of
the property. As it turns out,

15
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,760
Shechtman did not comply with
these contractual requirements.

16
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:06,990
There was quote,

17
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:11,991
a substantial deviation from the required
grade lines unquote and there were

18
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:17,430
still walls, foundations and other
structures jutting out from the ground,

19
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,370
but the time,
by the time of trial,

20
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:24,030
American standard had nevertheless
succeeded in selling the property.

21
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,030
For $183,000 which Shechtman contended
was only $3,000 less than its fair market

22
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:33,240
value at trial.

23
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:38,040
The judge instructed the jury that the
proper measure of damages was the cost of

24
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:42,180
completion, not the dimunition
in the property's value.

25
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,540
The jury went on to award
American Standard $90,000
in damages rather than the

26
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:50,910
$3,000 the check man argued for.

27
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,280
We are reading the decision from the
appellate division of the Supreme Court of

28
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:56,851
New York.

29
00:01:56,851 --> 00:02:01,851
Recall that New York confusingly uses
the term supreme court for its lowest

30
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:03,420
level of courts.

31
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,990
The question on appeal was whether the
plaintiff was entitled only to difference

32
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:12,420
in value damages rather
than cost of completion.

33
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,210
Justice Hancock ruled for the plaintiffs,

34
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,180
but his opinion is not
entirely satisfying.

35
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,200
Just as Hancock reasoning takes cost
of completion as the default rule.

36
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,630
In the usual case quote,

37
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:31,790
where the contractor's performance
has been defective, were in complete,

38
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,750
the reasonable cost of replacement
or completion is the measure unquote.

39
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,520
His task is to figure out
whether precedents like
Jacob and young versus Kent

40
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,730
require him to deviate
from this general rule.

41
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:50,070
Jacob and Young's as a decision of the
court of appeals of New York was binding

42
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:52,780
precedent for this case.
As you'll recall,

43
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,960
the rule there was that when the cost of
completion was grossly and unfairly out

44
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:02,350
of proportion to the good to be attained,

45
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,620
the court would calculate damages based
on diminution in value rather than cost

46
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:09,850
of completion.
In that case,

47
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,880
judge Cardosa found that requiring a
contractor to replace an inadvertent

48
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:20,790
substitution of an equally good pipe with
the contracted brand would be grossly

49
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:26,791
disproportionate and so Cardoza awarded
only the minimal diminution in value

50
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,120
just as Hancock makes three arguments
for distinguishing American standard and

51
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:37,330
check man versus Shechtman
from Jacob and Young's.

52
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:43,770
The first argument rests
on the distinction between
unintentional good faith

53
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:46,180
emissions and intentional ones.

54
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,480
He relies on Judge Cardozo statement
in Jacob and Young's that quote it

55
00:03:51,601 --> 00:03:56,601
contractor who would ask the court to
apply the diminution in value measure as

56
00:03:56,891 --> 00:04:01,891
an instrument of justice must not have
breached the contract intentionally and

57
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:06,430
must show substantial performance
made in good faith. In this case,

58
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:11,140
the contractor denied that the contract
even required him to do the grading.

59
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:14,080
He was now being sued for failing to do.

60
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,150
It clearly wasn't an oversight.

61
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:21,151
He intended not to grade a the property
as the court found the contract

62
00:04:21,731 --> 00:04:22,564
required.

63
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:28,050
Academics have supported this distinction
as a test for what type of damages to

64
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,420
award.
In the 1982 article,

65
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:36,510
Patricia Marshall argued that the key
factor is whether the breach was willful

66
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:40,480
or non willful,
the highest possible damages,

67
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,250
usually cost of completion should be
awarded where the breaching party is

68
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:48,250
willful in order to deter
such willful breaches.

69
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:53,680
One thing that made puzzle you about
this argument though is that the mining

70
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:58,540
company and Pv House seems to have behaved
even more egregiously, more willfully,

71
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:03,541
and yet the PV houses received
only damages equal to the
dimunition in value of

72
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:06,850
their property.
We will see that the courts,

73
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,480
other arguments are similarly
out of alignment with Pv House.

74
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,200
The court's second main argument is
about what counts as economic waste for

75
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:20,020
purposes of Jacob and Young's.
In this case,

76
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:25,050
the court tells us that disparity in
relative economic benefits is not the

77
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:27,010
equivalent of economic waste,

78
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,060
which was invoked in Jacob
and young versus Kent,

79
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,380
but it doesn't really give us a
satisfying substitute rule. Instead,

80
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:40,150
it it counters with the principal
from Chamberlain versus Parker that a

81
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:45,151
landowner is allowed to build a quote
monument to his caprice or folly and that

82
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:50,680
the court will still enforce a contract
even where performance of the contract

83
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,980
would diminish the value
of of the owner's land,

84
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:56,260
at least the market value
of the owner's land.

85
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,360
It a line of cases where like here,

86
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:04,070
plaintiff sought and received cost of
completion damages far exceeding any

87
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:06,290
increase in the lands market value.

88
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,670
The problem with this line of
argument is that it proves too much.

89
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:15,671
Why wasn't Kent's desire for reading pipe
a monument to his caprice or folly and

90
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:19,640
therefore deserving of
cost of completion damages.

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The court attempts to argue that's a
key distinction of economic waste is

92
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:30,700
defects in construction
which are irremediable
irremediable or which may not be

93
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:36,050
repaired without a substantial tearing
down of the structure as in Jacob and

94
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:36,884
Young's,

95
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,950
but pvs did not involve any tearing down
of structures or irremediable defects

96
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:43,461
there.

97
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:48,461
The mining company simply
failed to fulfill its
obligation to remediate and yet

98
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,860
it only had to pay for
dimunition of value.

99
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,640
Timothy and purists has argued that the
way to distinguish monuments to one's

100
00:06:57,741 --> 00:07:02,741
own folly from cases like this one is
to look at subjective versus objective

101
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:04,910
value.
In PB house,

102
00:07:04,911 --> 00:07:09,080
the owners intended to keep the property
and the main purpose of the restoration

103
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:12,080
was to improve their subjective
enjoyment of the property.

104
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,710
The same goes for monument to folly cases.

105
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,580
Mirror suggests that in these cases
the correct measure is cost of per

106
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,490
completion since the plane is truly
want the end result of completion.

107
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,800
On the other hand, in this case,
American standard, uh, in this case,

108
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:35,630
American standard sold the
property immediately and so
we can conclude that it's

109
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:39,530
only real interest in the
land was its market value.

110
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,740
In cases such as this one muris argues
the dimunition in value of the property

111
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:49,670
is the proper measure of damages.
The third distinction,

112
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:54,290
the court attempts to draw is between
the main purpose of the contract and

113
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,730
incidental purposes.

114
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Just just Handcock argues that the Pv
House court gave only dimunition of value

115
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:06,581
damages because the failure to restore
the land was only incidental to the

116
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:11,300
contract whose main purpose was to
extract coal. On the other hand,

117
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,950
he views the grading work as central
to the purpose of the contract between

118
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:17,750
American standard versus Shechtman.

119
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,680
Rather than provide arguments
for these positions,

120
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:26,681
just as Hancock merely says that the
grading quote cannot be said to be

121
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:31,370
incidental.
He claims without justification.

122
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:36,371
That Shechtman quote can hardly assert
that what he left unfinished was of

123
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,500
trivial or an appreciable importance,

124
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,670
but we very much could dispute that.
The courts assertion,

125
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,140
remember who was pain,

126
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:50,141
whom here Shechtman paid American
standard more than a quarter of a million

127
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,390
dollars to purchase it's old equipment.
From that perspective.

128
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:58,290
The agreement to grade the property seems
incidental or no less incidental than

129
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:02,550
the bargain Ford contract provisions
the PV houses had with the garland coal

130
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:03,384
company.

131
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,040
Both the cost of performance
and definition and value
damage measures can be

132
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:11,274
see.

133
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:16,310
They can be seen as ways of implementing
expectation damages but they do so

134
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:21,420
under different assumptions about what
the plaintiff will do with the damage.

135
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:22,254
Money.

136
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:27,060
Cost of performance implicitly assumes
that the plaintiff will take the damages

137
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,700
and use it to actually
purchase performance.

138
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,980
Cost of performance accordingly puts
the plaintiff in the position she would

139
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:39,960
have been in if the defendant
had performed by giving
the plaintiff's sufficient

140
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:44,460
funds to buy substitute
performance dimunition in value.

141
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:49,461
Damages on the other hand implicitly
assume that plaintiff is not interested in

142
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:55,680
using the money to buy substitute
performance and instead tries to put the

143
00:09:55,681 --> 00:10:00,681
plaintiff in the same economic position
as if performance had occurred by giving

144
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:07,011
her sufficient funds to compensate for
any dimunition in value caused by the

145
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:08,730
plaintiffs breach.

146
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,710
What's particularly perverse about
the [inaudible] decision is that the

147
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:18,711
plaintiff has no opportunity to use the
money to purchase substitute performance

148
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:21,420
because American standard is already sold.

149
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,420
The property giving costs it performance
in such a situation can overcompensate

150
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,720
providing uh,
the plaintiff with the kind of windfall.

151
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,800
One idea for how to improve this legal
mess is to allow plaintiffs to choose

152
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:42,381
between damages for dimunition in value
or specific performance but not damages

153
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:45,990
for cost of completion.

154
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,550
We're playing this really do want to
wrecked monuments to their own folly.

155
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,910
They can insist on specific
performance by the defendant,

156
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:58,710
but American standard wouldn't really
have wanted specific performance since it

157
00:10:58,711 --> 00:11:03,270
didn't have any remaining
interest in having the property
graded proper properly.

158
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:05,130
Now that the property had been sold,

159
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,150
all it lost was the value of the property.

160
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,820
And so it would settle with
Szuchman for anything over $3,000.

161
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,110
Of course plaintiffs like American
standard could still sue for specific

162
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:23,430
performance and then use
that or court order, uh,

163
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:27,810
in order to bargain for significant
side payments from the defendants who

164
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:32,280
otherwise would have to pay the
entire cost of completing the contract

165
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:35,850
themselves.
And now let's look at this quiz.

166
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,720
Imagine that mark hires a contractor to
build an incredibly ugly building on his

167
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:44,220
property.
If built the building,

168
00:11:44,221 --> 00:11:48,810
we'll actually blight the view and
reduced the value of Mark's property,

169
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,440
the contractor poor as a foundation,
but then fails to complete the project.

170
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,360
In which of the following situations is
it more appropriate to calculate damages

171
00:11:58,361 --> 00:12:00,040
based on cost of completion?

172
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,810
A mark is planning to live on the
property for the rest of his life.

173
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:10,110
The building has been designed by his
favorite modernist architect or B.

174
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:15,280
Mark is misguided is a misguided real
estate developer hoping to flip the

175
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:19,540
property. He thinks the building,
we'll get him a better price for it.

176
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:21,961
Well,

177
00:12:21,961 --> 00:12:26,430
you should see that cost of completion
damages are more appropriate in situation

178
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:31,170
a here mark seeks to get the
subjective value of the building,

179
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,710
which he appreciates
even if no one else does.

180
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:39,750
In professor [inaudible] view
cases involving subjective value,

181
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:44,751
just justify damages based on cost of
completion in situation be the only value

182
00:12:46,231 --> 00:12:50,430
of the building to mark isn't its ability
to make the property more valuable

183
00:12:50,431 --> 00:12:53,550
when sold.
This is a matter of objective value.

184
00:12:53,551 --> 00:12:58,410
And so courts should award damages
based on the dimunition in market value,

185
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:02,340
which in this case is likely
to be very small or even zero.

186
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,440
We have seen great inconsistency and the
case is about when the proper measure

187
00:13:09,691 --> 00:13:13,710
of damages is dimunition of value
as opposed to cost of completion.

188
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,330
You should be aware that
some considerations that
courts take into account when

189
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:21,630
deciding which type of
damages to allow our,

190
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,410
whether the nonconformity
was willful or accidental,

191
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:30,650
whether the case involves subjective or
objective value and the centrality of

192
00:13:31,441 --> 00:13:33,420
the admission to the original agreement.

193
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,550
But keep in mind that the default
rule remains cost of completion.
