1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,100
In the last lecture we talked about
consideration and how courts look for a

2
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:09,990
bargain for exchange to determine
whether a promise creates an enforceable

3
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:10,824
contract.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:16,140
Today we're going to introduce another
basis for enforcing promises known as

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,730
promissory Estoppel.

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,300
The doctrine of promissory Estoppel
has its roots in the 1898 Nebraska case

7
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:29,421
called rickets versus Ska Thorn in
which there was no bargain for exchange,

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,190
but the courts found a legally
enforceable promise. Anyway,

9
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,070
the facts are these. The plaintiff in
the Ricketts case, Katie Scott Thorn,

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,520
received a written promise
from our grandfather,

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,670
John c records that he would pay her
quote on demand $2,000 to be at 6% per

12
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:56,100
annum.
When he made the promise,

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,180
the grandfather told Ms Ska Thorn,
that quote,

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,250
I have fixed out something that you
have not got to work anymore unquote,

15
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,510
and that none of my grandchildren
work and you don't have to.

16
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,920
A year later with the consent and
assistance of her grandfather,

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,830
she got a new job.
Two years later,

18
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:21,780
the grandfather died having paid one
year's interest on the note and having

19
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:25,290
expressed regret that he had not
been able to pay the balance.

20
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,670
Ms Cawthorne then sued the executor
of the grandfather's estate,

21
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,370
Andrew Directorates for the balance.

22
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,490
So was there consideration in this case?
No,

23
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,780
not in this case.

24
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,070
The grandfather promised to give
his granddaughter the money,

25
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,520
but uh,
he did not ask for anything in return,

26
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,460
nor did she promise anything in return.

27
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,740
Although she quit her job after he
implied that she would not need to work

28
00:01:55,741 --> 00:02:00,741
anymore or grandfather did not condition
the money on her quitting her job.

29
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,820
In the words of the court,

30
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,850
the plaintiff's grandfather gave her
the note as a gratuity and asked for

31
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:10,230
nothing in return.

32
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,450
And the abandonment by Miss Goth orn
ever position as a bookkeeper was all

33
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:18,150
together voluntary.
Therefore,

34
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,300
the note was not given in consideration
of the plaintiff pursuing or green to

35
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:26,580
pursue any particular line of conduct.

36
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,590
The trial court found for the plaintiff
and the instant court affirmed not

37
00:02:32,591 --> 00:02:35,760
withstanding the lack of of consideration.

38
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,210
So the central issue on appeal is this,

39
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,610
despite the lack of consideration,

40
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,110
is the grandfather's promise
still legally enforceable?

41
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,180
As we just discussed, the court found
there was no consideration in this case.

42
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:55,770
Therefore, if consideration is absolutely
necessary for a binding promise,

43
00:02:55,771 --> 00:03:00,610
the grandfather's promise
would not be legally. However,

44
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,970
there have always been traces of an
easiness respecting a strong consideration

45
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:07,414
requirement.

46
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,660
Much of the dissatisfaction relates to
transactions such as those involved in

47
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:18,361
rickets where a promise
induces substantial and
bargained for reliance on the

48
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:21,850
part of the promise.
See,

49
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,840
do you think it would be fair if the
grandfather or in this case his estate

50
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,240
could later fail to perform his promise
after his granddaughter relied on that

51
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:37,750
promise and quit her job,
the court didn't think it would be fair.

52
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,930
The court reason that the grandfather
intentionally influenced the plaintiff to

53
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:48,091
alter her position for the worst on the
faith of the note being paid when due so

54
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:54,271
it would be grossly inequitable to permit
the maker or his executor to resist

55
00:03:55,631 --> 00:04:00,631
payment on the ground that the promise
was given without consideration to get

56
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:02,890
around the consideration requirement,

57
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,220
the court invoke the doctrine
of equitable Estoppel.

58
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:11,440
The court can see did that the promise
quote being given without any valuable

59
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:16,441
consideration was nothing more than a
promise to make a gift in the future and

60
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:21,040
that ordinarily such promises
are not enforceable. However,

61
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:25,300
the court held that a promise
or who promises to make a gift,

62
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,540
maybe a stopped that is stopped or
barred from denying the existence of the

63
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:37,060
consideration if the promise see
changes her position in reliance on the

64
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:39,490
promise.
In other words,

65
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:44,170
even though the grandfather's promise to
his granddaughter was not supported by

66
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:45,160
consideration,

67
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:50,340
the executor of the estate was estopped
from arguing that the promise lacked

68
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:52,990
consideration because,
uh,

69
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:57,370
his granddaughter had quit her
job in reliance on that promise.

70
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,650
The court supported it's
positioned with precedent pass.

71
00:05:01,651 --> 00:05:03,420
Courts had held that quote,

72
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:08,430
an action on a note given to a church
college or other like institution upon the

73
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:14,170
faith of which money has been expended
or obligations incurred could not be

74
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:18,010
successfully defended on the
ground of a want of consideration.

75
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,360
But those courts found an enforceable
promise for a different reason.

76
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,270
Those courts held that quote.

77
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:30,130
The expenditure of money or assumption
of liability by the Doni on the faith of

78
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:34,090
the promise constitutes a valuable
and sufficient consideration.

79
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,950
The court in Ricketts on the other hand
held that there was no consideration but

80
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,250
it stopped the defendant
from raising that defense.

81
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,630
This use of Estoppel was
unusual for two reasons. First,

82
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,840
equitable equitable estoppel traditionally
only applied to representations of

83
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:56,680
facts. If you represent it to a
patient that you are a specialist,

84
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,960
you can be estopped from later denying
it in court even if you in fact are not a

85
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:03,980
specialist.
Second,

86
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,660
the doctrine of equitable Estoppel is
commonly understood to provide a shield,

87
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:13,280
not a sword. Estoppel is a
defense that prevents another, uh,

88
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,200
from denying certain facts.
In rickets.

89
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,780
The doctrine is applied as a sword to
support a new cause of action that would

90
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,130
otherwise not exist.

91
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:27,470
Was the Ricketts courts simply confused
about the meaning of equitable Estoppel?

92
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,430
Well,

93
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:33,430
one might instead read the opinion
as a good example of judicial craft.

94
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,880
Under the common law,
the court observed a form of injustice.

95
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,900
It the court observed a form of injustice
that the law might remedy finding no

96
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:48,380
clear legal grounds at hand
and facing the bar, uh,

97
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:52,550
of the, uh, against enforcement
under the doctrine of consideration.

98
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,790
It took a neighboring legal category,

99
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,600
Estoppel and stretched
it a bit to do new work.

100
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,080
This is the process of
creative destruction where
courts sometimes do injury to

101
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:09,620
an existing concept to help
redeploy it in another context.

102
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,830
It's only later that courts
feel comfortable giving.

103
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:15,230
The new creation is separate and new name.

104
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:21,190
The modern term promissory Estoppel dates
from Samuel [inaudible] 1920 previous

105
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:28,241
on contract law will Astin carefully
studied cases and convinced himself that

106
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:34,961
the consideration doctrine could not
explain all the case see outcomes and his

107
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,531
treatise.

108
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:41,531
Wilson collected a number
of cases including rickets
in which reliance seem to

109
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:44,720
be doing the job of consideration.

110
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:49,721
It was a substitute for consideration
recognizing the differences between the

111
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:55,031
well established doctrine of equitable
stopple and the doctrine invoked by this

112
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:56,450
collection of cases.

113
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,720
Wilson suggested a new name for the
ladder promissory Estoppel Wilston later

114
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:08,630
served as the reporter on the first
restatement of contracts and included a

115
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:10,910
section,
a new section,

116
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:14,060
section 94 promissory Estoppel.

117
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,560
The sections number remained the
same in the second restatement,

118
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:23,590
which now reads a promise
which the promissor should
reasonably expect to induce

119
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:28,661
action or forbearance on the part of
the primacy or a third person and which

120
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:34,151
does induce such action or forbearance
is binding if injustice can be avoided

121
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,910
only by enforcement of the promise.

122
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,360
The remedy granted for breach may be
limited as justice requires section 90 is

123
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:48,410
one of the few sections of the restatement
that you should commit to memory as

124
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:51,170
synonymous with promissory Estoppel.

125
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,480
You can see that it has three elements,

126
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:57,630
the promise or should have her
promise to induce reliance.

127
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:03,050
The promise must actually
and must actually induce
reliance and injustice can be

128
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:07,290
avoided only by the promises enforcement.

129
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,490
If the plaintiff in rickets versus Scott
Thorn had not quit her job after her

130
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:19,491
grandfather promised her $2,000 plus
interest with the promise had been binding

131
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:24,390
under the theory of promissory Estoppel.
Nope.

132
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,740
If Miss Goth Thorn did not rely
on the promise to her detriment,

133
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,750
she would not satisfy one
of the requirements for
promissory Estoppel so the

134
00:09:33,751 --> 00:09:36,690
promise would not be
binding under that doctrine.

135
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:42,650
The court awarded Miss Goth or in the
$2,000 face amount of the promissory note

136
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:44,280
plus interest.

137
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,560
This put Ms. Scott Orn in the position
she would have been in if the promise had

138
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:51,990
been performed.
When a court does this,

139
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:56,970
we say that the court awards expectation
damages cause the court puts the

140
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:01,971
plaintiff in the position she would
expect to be in when the promise was made.

141
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,640
But section 90 permits courts to limit
the remedy has justice requires relying

142
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:13,170
on her grandfather's promise.
Ms. Scott Thorn quit her job,

143
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:17,910
which paid $10 a week for a
year before taking another job.

144
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,830
In other words,

145
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,860
she sacrificed at most $520
when she relied on the promise.

146
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,101
Therefore,

147
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:31,101
wouldn't justice be served if damages
were limited to $520 if the court did so,

148
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,540
we would say that the court
awarded reliance damages,

149
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,820
reliance damages seek to make the promise
the whole by compensating her for the

150
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:46,821
cost she incurred in relying
on the promise instead of
putting the promising and

151
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:51,540
the position she would have been in
had the promise been fully performed.

152
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:57,590
Grant Gilmore famously predicted in
a book called death of contracts that

153
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:03,291
section 90 would swallow contracts
pro that promises would use promissory

154
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:08,781
Estoppel claims under section 90 instead
of breach of contract claims to enforce

155
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:13,920
their promises. But Gilmore's
prediction has not come true.

156
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,220
Promises routinely opt to sue for breach
of contract because it's a more certain

157
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:21,120
basis for liability.

158
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:26,010
Avoiding all these considerations
of what justice requires and without

159
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:30,750
potentially having limited damages.
So let's recap.

160
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,070
Sometimes consideration is not
needed to enforce a promise.

161
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:40,430
If a promise he reasonably relies on
a promise and changes are positioned

162
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,970
accordingly, the promise may be
binding even without consideration.

163
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,270
If justice so requires,
however,

164
00:11:48,271 --> 00:11:53,040
the remedy granted for the breach may
be limited to compensate the primacy for

165
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:58,041
her reliance and the court need not
award the full value of the promise.
