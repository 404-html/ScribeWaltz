1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,880
In the last two classes we've had judges
tell us that good faith means different

2
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:11,131
things in termination cases then in
formation cases or in cases where there is

3
00:00:12,131 --> 00:00:15,430
discretion in the midst of
a contracts performance.

4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,000
Well today we're going to be
looking at a termination case.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,300
We're looking at a 1980 Massachusetts
case entitled Zapata Versus Dairy Mart

6
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:30,310
where the court considered how the duty
of good faith applied to an at-will

7
00:00:30,311 --> 00:00:33,790
termination clause in
a franchise agreement.

8
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,350
Yeah.

9
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,650
In this case, the Patho purchased a
franchise from the defendant dairy mart,

10
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,670
an operator of a chain of franchise
convenience stores as Epatha relied on the

11
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:50,020
representations by dairy mart that the
franchise business would be his own

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,610
stable and secure.

13
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:57,090
The franchise agreement allowed either
party to terminate without cause on 90

14
00:00:57,401 --> 00:01:02,401
days written notice when plaintiff refused
to sign a new agreement modifying the

15
00:01:02,411 --> 00:01:07,411
terms of the franchise defendant sent
written notice that the franchise was

16
00:01:07,631 --> 00:01:09,310
terminating support.

17
00:01:09,311 --> 00:01:14,311
The sued claiming the
dairy marts termination was
dishonest and in bad faith the

18
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:18,910
trial court found for the Zapata
but the instant court reversed.

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,080
The central issue is this was dairy marts
arbitrary termination of its franchise

20
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:29,200
agreement with the Zapata in
valid because of bad faith.

21
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:30,720
Okay.

22
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,100
And the court answered?
No.

23
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,900
The court found that the franchise
agreement was not terminated in bad faith.

24
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,100
The court turned to the UCC
as adopted by Massachusetts,

25
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,510
which says that good faith
requires among merchants quote,

26
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,540
honesty in fact and the observance of
reasonable commercial standards of fair

27
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:54,510
dealing and the trade unquote the honesty.

28
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:59,511
In fact a requirement of good faith
is a bit redundant with fraud.

29
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,140
So most of the action in these cases
will be about whether there was an

30
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:08,010
observance of reasonable commercial
standards, a fair dealing.

31
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,760
The court held that quote,

32
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:15,450
there was no evidence that dairy mart
failed to observe reasonable commercial

33
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:19,650
standards of fair dealing in the
trade in terminating the agreement.

34
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:25,070
And it also found that the termination
may have been arbitrary but it was not

35
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:27,210
dishonest.
Next,

36
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:31,560
the court pointed out that although the
legislature had limited the rights of

37
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:35,970
certain franchise doors to terminate
franchise agreements without cause,

38
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,190
it quote has not adopted limitations
on the right to terminate all franchise

39
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:44,070
agreements in general.
Finally,

40
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:49,071
the court declined to rule that all
at-will termination clauses are invariably

41
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,480
prohibited and accordingly ruled that
dairy mart lawfully terminated the

42
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:59,020
franchise agreement
in another part of the,

43
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,670
the court considered the plaintiff's
additional claim that the termination

44
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:08,470
clause was unconscionable. We talked
about unconscionability and pass classes.

45
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,840
What's the difference between procedural
and substantive unconscionability? Well,

46
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:15,280
you should remember that procedure.

47
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:20,281
Lung conscionability concerns
the how of of the contract,

48
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,330
how the contract was negotiated and
whether the bargaining disparities allowed

49
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:28,480
one party to take advantage
of a more vulnerable party.

50
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,070
Substantive unconscionability
concerns the what of the contract,

51
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,970
whether the resulting terms
were substantively unfair.

52
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:41,971
One side at the court in Zapata Hell that
the contract was neither procedurally

53
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,710
nor substantively unconscionable.

54
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:50,190
The plaintiff was specifically shown the
termination clause prior to signing and

55
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:55,030
later testified that it was quote
straightforward unquote and the plaintiff

56
00:03:55,031 --> 00:03:59,440
failed to show that the clause allocated
the risks and benefits of termination

57
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:04,330
in an unreasonably disproportionate
way or that the clause was unreasonably

58
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:09,331
related to legitimate commercial needs
in Zapata dairy mart reserved broad power

59
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:15,871
to terminate the franchise without cause
and followed the clause to the letter

60
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,890
in exercising that power.

61
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,540
The court looked at whether dairy mart
acted in good faith when exercising that

62
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:23,350
power,

63
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,350
but if terminating because the franchisee
refuses to modify the franchise in

64
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:31,780
terms more favorable to the
franchisor is not a bad faith.

65
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,200
What is well suppose that the franchise
or discriminated against a minority

66
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,330
franchisee or suppose that the
termination was in retaliation because the

67
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:48,331
Franchisee had reported salmonella in
the ice cream to state health authorities

68
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,120
or suppose the purpose of the termination
was to capture a thriving franchise

69
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:56,740
for the benefit of the
president's brother in law.

70
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,880
Any of these reasons
might have been bad faith.

71
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:07,350
Federal and state statutes
have increasingly regulated
the power to terminate a

72
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:08,800
franchise relationship.

73
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,180
One example is the automobile
dealers day in court act,

74
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,890
which provides that a dealer may sue
an automobile manufacturer for damages,

75
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,220
quote by reason of the failure of set
automobile manufactured act in good faith

76
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:24,100
and terminating,

77
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,240
canceling or not renewing the
franchise with said dealer.

78
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,380
Good faith, however, is
narrowly defined as quote,

79
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:37,090
the duty of each party to guarantee
freedom from coercion, intimidation,

80
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:40,300
or threat of coercion or
intimidation from the other party.

81
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:46,110
Termination clauses are relevant not
only for franchisees but also for at-will

82
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,590
employees.
For more than a century,

83
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:55,510
American courts firmly adhere to the
view that an employment contract of no

84
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:58,460
fixed duration was terminable at will.

85
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,500
This means that an employee could
quit or be fired for any reason,

86
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:08,360
good or bad, or even no reason
at all. In recent years,

87
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:12,920
both judges and legislatures have
significantly limited employers powers to

88
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:14,270
discharge employees.

89
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,100
Legislatures have adopted
statutory protections and
judges have developed common

90
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:24,020
law. Limitations on the ability of
employers to fire employees at will,

91
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,680
especially limiting the
ability to fire for bad reason.

92
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,990
An employer will be liable if the
employee terminates for a variety of bad

93
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:36,080
reasons,
including race and gender discrimination.

94
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,560
Tort law allows a cause of action for
wrongful discharge based on making the

95
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:46,250
employee making public policy
claims from being a whistleblower.

96
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,700
And in 1991 the national conference
of Commissioners on uniform state laws

97
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,520
formally approved the model
employment termination act.

98
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,940
Although as of now,
no state has yet adopted it.

99
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,003
Let's review.

100
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,160
Today we've considered an at-will
termination clause and in a franchise

101
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:07,304
agreement,

102
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,400
and looked at a case where a court
held that an honest Albay it arbitrary

103
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:17,411
termination of a franchise agreement in
accord with the contract terms was valid

104
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,940
and not in bad faith.

105
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,070
We also discussed the trend
away from at will employment,

106
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,400
at least in the sense giving the
employer the right to terminate for bad

107
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:31,760
reasons.
