1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,130
Today we're going to begin in depth
exploration of a topic we've already come

2
00:00:05,131 --> 00:00:08,010
across a few times.
The duty of good faith.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,020
We're going to start by discussing sent
tronics corporation versus Gen Acom

4
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:13,854
Corporation.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,190
A case decided by the Supreme Court of
New Hampshire in 1989 the case concerned

6
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:24,300
a rather complicated transaction
for financial assets.

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:29,690
Spintronics agreed to sell and Jen Acom
agreed to purchase certain business

8
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:30,534
assets.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,980
The parties agreed that the purchase
price of the assets would be pegged to the

10
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:39,420
assets value at closing
because of the price. Uh,

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,320
value couldn't be known at the
time that the contract was formed.

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,580
The parties agreed that disputes over
there the ultimate purchase price would be

13
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:50,640
referred to an accounting
firm for arbitration.

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,370
The parties also agreed that pending
finding final valuation of the assets,

15
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,530
Jen Acom would deposit a portion
of the purchase price into escrow.

16
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,300
The parties did indeed disagree about
the value of the assets at closing and so

17
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:09,570
began arbitration.

18
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,040
The arbitration process apparently
was taking longer than the parties

19
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:17,250
anticipated and while
arbitration was still ongoing,

20
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:21,630
Sin Tronics requested that Jen ECOM
released from escrow the portion of the

21
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:24,000
funds that were not in dispute.

22
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,130
Jen and calm refused to do so and send
tronic sued arguing that [inaudible] had

23
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,710
breached an implied
obligation of good faith.

24
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,230
Jen ECOM moved for summary Judgment,

25
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:39,231
which the trial court granted the New
Hampshire Supreme Court in an opinion by

26
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:44,331
then judge and now former Supreme Court
justice David Souter affirmed Sutor did

27
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:51,861
not deny that an obligation of good faith
existed rather his opinion focused on

28
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:54,060
what good faith requires.

29
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,540
Seutter outlined three categories of
cases in which good faith disputes might

30
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:01,074
arise,

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,700
cases dealing with standards of
conduct and contract formation.

32
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,260
That's the first category.

33
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,560
The second is cases concerning at-will
termination of employment contracts and

34
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:18,720
the third is limits on discretion
in contractual performance.

35
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,430
These three categories corresponds to
three different times of the contracts

36
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:26,640
existence. It's formation,
it's termination,

37
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,820
and what happens in between the good
faith requirement can always be seen as

38
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:34,800
limiting discretionary behavior.

39
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,480
Seutter saw that the limits on discretion
though differ depending on whether

40
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:41,220
we're talking about a contractor,

41
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:46,221
his discretion in forming or terminating
a contract or an exercising discretion

42
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,330
during the contract.

43
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,930
That is how to perform a contract when
there is some discretion granted one side

44
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:59,410
or the other under category one
concerning good faith in formation.

45
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,040
Good faith is tantamount to the
traditional duties of care to refrain for

46
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:09,041
misrepresentation and to
correct subsequently discovered
error in so far as any

47
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,740
representation is intended to induce
and his material to another party's

48
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:19,360
decision to enter into a contract
in justifiable reliance upon it.

49
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,140
Basically suitor is saying
that you have to be honest,

50
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:28,141
both explicitly and implicitly when
dealing at arm's length in negotiating the

51
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:33,271
possible formation of a contract
under category two concerning at-will

52
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:35,260
termination of a contract,

53
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,650
the good faith obligation
limits and employers power
to fire an at will employee

54
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:46,470
good faith is violated when employer
fires and that will employ quote out of

55
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:52,231
malice or bad faith in retaliation for
action taken or refused by the employee

56
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,440
in consonance with public policy
unquote combing through precedent.

57
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:03,790
The court determined that good faith in
the third category of cases into which

58
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:08,791
the instant dispute fell requires quote
and implied obligation of good faith to

59
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:15,121
observe reasonable limits in exercising
that discretion consistent with the

60
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:21,091
parties purpose or purposes
in contracting unquote.

61
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,880
The court further broke down the
analysis required for category three

62
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,290
discretionary performance cases
into four questions. First,

63
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,520
whether the contracting question
aloud or conferred upon the defendant,

64
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:41,230
a degree of discretion in performance
that was tantamount to a power to deprive

65
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:45,460
the plaintiff has of a substantial
proportion of the agreements value.

66
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,930
Second,
if it did,

67
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,740
whether the evidence suggested that
the parties intended to make a legally

68
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:53,770
enforceable contract. Third, if so,

69
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:58,330
whether the defendant exercise exercise
of discretion exceeded the limits of

70
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,260
reasonableness.

71
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,180
A question that required identifying
the purpose of the contract and forth,

72
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:08,560
whether the damage complained of resulted
from events beyond the control of

73
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:09,394
either party.

74
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,680
But the court didn't need to run through
each of these four questions because it

75
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,720
determined in,
uh,

76
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,760
the decision in answering the very
first question that the contract did,

77
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:26,761
it found did not confer discretion upon
Gen ECOM to deprive send tronics have a

78
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:30,040
substantial proportion
of the agreements value.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,500
The court examined the contractual
provisions governing release of the funds

80
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,334
from escrow.

81
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,500
The escrow agreement provided that quote
in accordance with section 2.07 of the

82
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:42,460
purchase agreement.

83
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,880
The escrow agent shall hold the escrow
funds in its possession until instructed

84
00:05:48,851 --> 00:05:53,851
in writing unquote by the parties lawyers
quote to distribute the same or same

85
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:59,550
portion thereof to send tronics or Jen
Acom as the case may be section 2.07 of

86
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:06,710
the purchase agreement and titled Final
Payment of purchase price stated quote,

87
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:11,711
final settlement and payment
of the purchase price shall
be made not later than

88
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:16,721
10 days after determination of the closing
value and computation of the purchase

89
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:21,860
price, whether by agreement of the
parties or decision of the arbitrator.

90
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,990
These provisions were in the court's
words, express and unequivocal.

91
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,210
They gave Jen and no discretion
to withhold payout for approved,

92
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:32,750
uh,

93
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,750
for approval beyond that time or to affect
the timing of the arbitration itself.

94
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:39,981
Because of this,

95
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:44,300
the court concluded the gender Khan was
not given discretion such that it could

96
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:48,890
deprive and tronics indefinitely of a
portion of the greed consideration for the

97
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:50,990
business assets previously transferred.

98
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,700
The court addressed discretion beyond
the timeline specified in the agreement.

99
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,380
What about before that timeline?

100
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,450
Does Jen ECOM have discretion to
release the funds before 10 days after

101
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:07,310
determination of closing value?

102
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,190
The court believed the text of the
agreement supported the claim that the

103
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:18,191
parties intended the escrow agent to
leave the fund intact until the point of

104
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:21,680
final payment,
if any,

105
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:26,180
that would be due to send tronics 10
days after the final price determination.

106
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:31,670
Good faith did not require Jen come to
do something in consistent with the terms

107
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:36,671
of the agreement and here I'm quoting
what send tronics claims to be Jenna comes

108
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:42,701
discretion over the timing of distribution
is in reality a power that each party

109
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:48,641
may exercise but only jointly with the
other two agree to remove some or all of

110
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:54,701
the escrowed funds from the ambit of
the otherwise mandatory payout provision

111
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,853
unquote.

112
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:01,330
The opinion further agreed with the trial
court that it wasn't the judges duty

113
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:06,710
to quote insert a provision in the
contract for partial payments were such

114
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:08,210
provision does not exist.

115
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:13,190
The court will not renegotiate
the contract between the
parties to obtain this

116
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:17,960
result. In determining how to
approach the good faith question.

117
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:22,580
Suitor discussed two scholars,
Summers and Burton,

118
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,150
and there are differing understandings
of the meaning of good faith.

119
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,470
Summers adheres to an excluder analysis.

120
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:35,750
He defines good faith as
anything that isn't bad faith.

121
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:40,990
He denied that certain words or phrases
have a general positive meaning of their

122
00:08:41,211 --> 00:08:41,511
own,

123
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:46,511
but instead quote function to rule out
various things according to context

124
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:47,414
unquote.

125
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,590
One example he offered is the
word voluntary in criminal law.

126
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,860
Quoting a philosopher summers argued that
when we say someone acted voluntarily,

127
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,430
the word serves to exclude a heterogeneous
range of cases such as physical

128
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:06,500
compulsion, coercion by
by threats, accidents,

129
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,250
mistakes,
et cetera.

130
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,390
Voluntary itself didn't designate
a specific mental state.

131
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,870
Summers believes that
good faith is similar.

132
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,820
It functions as an excluder to rule out
a wide range of heterogeneous forms of

133
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:21,654
bad faith.

134
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:27,230
Such forms of bad faith include evading
the spirit of bargain and abusive of a

135
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:30,150
power to define specific terms.

136
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,190
Burton by contrast advocates
what he calls a recapture theory.

137
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,540
He explained that parties give up certain
opportunities at the time that they

138
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,374
contract.

139
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,730
He termed this the expected
cost of performance,

140
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,210
a party acted in bath,
bad faith burden,

141
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:53,211
argued quote precisely when discretion
is used to recapture opportunities for

142
00:09:54,441 --> 00:09:55,830
gone,
uh,

143
00:09:55,831 --> 00:10:00,831
upon contracting when the discretion
exercising party refuses to pay the

144
00:10:01,441 --> 00:10:06,441
expected cost of performance for the
purposes of analyzing good faith and

145
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:12,060
discretion during contract
performance of this third category,

146
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,800
Seutter said that he found
summer's analysis more in
line with the New Hampshire

147
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:19,080
press precedent.
Nevertheless,

148
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:21,930
the four question test he set out reads,

149
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:25,440
especially with its emphasis
on con contracts, purpose,

150
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:29,220
somewhat like an implementation
of Burton's recapture theory.

151
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,840
In any case,

152
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,900
sooner explicitly attempted to analyze
the case in recapture terms and

153
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:38,820
determined that even by those terms,

154
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:41,850
Jenny comms actions wouldn't
constitute bad faith.

155
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,920
This was because first Gen McCombs
refusal to consent to distribution from

156
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:47,754
escrow.

157
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,940
Quote neither recaptures nor gains Jen
and calm anything in and of itself.

158
00:10:53,851 --> 00:10:58,290
The refusal removes no issue from the
contingencies of arbitration and gives Jen

159
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:03,291
and Cobb no present or future rights to
the money it wishes to obtain unquote

160
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,040
more significantly.

161
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:10,041
The court emphasized that to Burton's
parties expected costs depend upon

162
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:15,930
objective analysis of the
party's expectation as they
may be inferred from the

163
00:11:15,931 --> 00:11:17,520
express contract terms.

164
00:11:17,521 --> 00:11:21,390
In light of the ordinary course of
business and customary practice,

165
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,980
the courts objective analysis found
that the parties expected the escrow to

166
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:28,620
remain intact during the arbitration.

167
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,720
The parties us quote never bargained
away the right of either of them to

168
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:38,721
condition any distribution on completing
the arbitration of any disputes.

169
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:44,370
Jen income by insisting arbitration be
completed before releasing escrow funds

170
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:48,360
then was not trying to recapture
a foregone opportunity.

171
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,310
I'm not as sure that Jen Acom had not
by default bargain away the right to

172
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:56,500
resist releasing escrow bounds,

173
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:01,890
not at risk would rational parties give
Jen and calm this power of insistence it

174
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:09,390
it gives Jen and calm bargaining power
to possibly get sent tronics to agree to

175
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:12,250
less than the arbitrator
would ultimately give.

176
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,580
Judge shooter seems to think
this bargaining power was
what sen tronic signed up

177
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:22,960
for. So Jen Acom wasn't using its
progression to get anything extra,

178
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,510
but a contrary ruling that was
explicitly a default might not have been

179
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:32,620
contracted around by many parties.
Then again,

180
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,680
this bargaining power might have also
affected the initial price sale price that

181
00:12:38,531 --> 00:12:43,390
was offered knowing that there would be
a difficulty negotiating in its shadow.

182
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,250
More generally,

183
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:50,370
how should a court think about a use
of discretion that gives defendant very

184
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:53,230
little and costs,
uh,

185
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,980
the plaintiff Alot if
choosing x instead of, uh,

186
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,830
instead of y gains the defendant a penny,

187
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,230
but cost the plaintiff $100,

188
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,580
is that bad faith if it
gains the defendant $99,

189
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:14,110
but costs the plaintiff 100, is
that small inefficiency, bad faith?

190
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,410
If it gains the defendant $100,

191
00:13:17,411 --> 00:13:21,730
but costs the plaintiff $100
and is just a transfer of, well,

192
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,710
can that ever be bad faith?

193
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,160
I'd be attracted to saying
that using discretion,

194
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:32,200
even discretion and refusing to modify
a contract should be bad faith if it

195
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:34,090
creates massive inefficiency.

196
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,240
Imagine though that Jen and [inaudible]
were found to have acted in bad faith

197
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:44,410
and performing the contract.
Is that a separate cause of action?

198
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:45,520
Well,

199
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,520
some jurisdictions do recognize a
separate cause of action for failure to

200
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:55,780
perform or enforce and in good faith,
but most do not.

201
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:56,621
Instead,

202
00:13:56,621 --> 00:14:01,180
construing the failure to perform specific
contractual terms in good faith as a

203
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:03,520
breach of contract restatement.

204
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:08,521
Section two oh five says
that the appropriate remedies
in breach of good faith

205
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:11,680
cases can vary according to context.

206
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,990
Sin Tronics is a pretty packed case.
There's a lot to take away from it.

207
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,430
The primary takeaway,

208
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:23,410
the one most relevant to the dispute
between San Tronics and Jen accom was that

209
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:28,240
good faith and contractual performance
arises only in the context of the party's

210
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:31,120
exercise of discretion.
But beyond that,

211
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:36,121
we talked about suitors classification
of different good faith scenarios and

212
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:40,390
corresponding understandings of
what could good faith entails.

213
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,830
We also discussed too influential and
very different understandings of good

214
00:14:44,831 --> 00:14:45,610
faith.

215
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:50,610
The excluder theory espoused by summers
and the expected cost or recapture

216
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:53,680
theory, uh, ex championed by Burton.

217
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,550
Think about which of these
you find more persuasive.
