1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,190
Today we're going to introduce
the concepts of material
breach and substantial

2
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:09,420
performance by exploring
Jacob and Young's versus Kent.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,380
The opinion was written by
Benjamin Cardozo while he
was a judge on the New York

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,630
State Court of Appeals.
As some of you may know,

5
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:23,631
Cardozo went on to become a supreme court
justice and like justices Scalia and

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,650
Marshall Cardozo has a law
school named after him. Uh,

7
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:33,651
he also wrote the famous torts decision
in Paul's graph versus long island

8
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:34,584
railroad.

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,650
The plaintiff in this case is a
building company, Jacob and Young's,

10
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,890
which contracted to build a summer home
for the defendant to homeowner George

11
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:47,520
Kent.

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,520
The contract specified that all rot iron
pipe must be of Redding manufacturer.

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,850
The building company,
however,

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,210
ended up installing some pipe
made by other manufacturers.

15
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,820
After building was completed,
the defendant,

16
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:07,380
George Kent discovered the error and
demanded that the plumbing be redone

17
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,060
because most of the plumbing was
at that point in case in the walls.

18
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,950
The cost to the building
company of replacing the
plumbing would have been quite

19
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:21,060
high.
So they refuse to do the replacement.

20
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,770
Kent responded by
refusing to pay, uh, 3000,

21
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:29,010
$483 balance.

22
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:33,550
That was to do a out of $77,000,
uh,

23
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,080
for the overall construction contract.
Uh,

24
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,400
the procedural at the history,
a history of the case was like this.

25
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:46,080
The plaintiff builder's
sued for this $3,400.

26
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:48,300
Some odd, a balance. Uh,

27
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:53,301
the trial judge excluded evidence that
the pipe used was the same in quality,

28
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:58,761
appearance and market value and cost as
the Redding pipe that had been promised.

29
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,300
And the court directed a
verdict for the defendant.

30
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,960
The appellate court reversed and granted
a new trial and the instinct court

31
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,080
affirmed the appellate court and
again found for the plaintiff.

32
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:19,290
This case is often taught in introductory
contracts courses because it touches

33
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:24,030
on several important issues.
There are two main issues in the case.

34
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,600
Number one was the
installation of Redding pipe,

35
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,520
a constructive condition,
uh,

36
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,250
a condition precedent to the owner's
duty to pay the last installment.

37
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,100
And, uh, if it is a condition
precedent, then the defendant,

38
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:45,480
uh, uh, would have, uh,
no duty to pay any money.

39
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,600
I'm, the second issue is, is the measure
of damages for breach by the builder,

40
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,560
uh, of promising to put in Redding
pipe and not putting it in.

41
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,820
Should that measure damages be the cost
of performance or merely dimunition in

42
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:03,640
value?
In essence,

43
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,410
judge Cardoza helps determine both
the extent of the buyer is defensive,

44
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:13,411
right to lawfully withhold payment as
well as the extent of the buyers off

45
00:03:14,451 --> 00:03:16,420
pensive,
right to sue for damages,

46
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:22,170
a party to a contract can help secure
her right to the other side's performance

47
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,780
by either withholding her own performance
or by affirmatively suing the other

48
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:29,500
side for damages.

49
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,920
These are the core defensive and offensive
protections that of contract law.

50
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,160
Let's examine examine these two issues.
In turn,

51
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,710
the first,

52
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,330
the defensive protection issue that
the court considered was whether the

53
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:51,331
installation of Redding pipe
is a constructive condition
to the owner's duty to

54
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:56,440
pay the last installment.
In other words,

55
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:01,270
can the defendant withhold payment just
because the pipe was not from the right

56
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:02,200
manufacturer?

57
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,750
The defendant argued that the installation
of Redding pipe and only reading pipe,

58
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,870
uh, it was a condition that
must be satisfied before, uh,

59
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,890
the buyer had a contractual duty to pay.
In essence,

60
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:22,690
the defendant wanted the court to apply
what's called the perfect tender rule.

61
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,230
If the perfect tender
rule had been applied,

62
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:28,690
the buyer would have
no duty to pay in less.

63
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:33,691
The builder's performance was perfect
Kardos or rejected the perfect tender

64
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:37,560
rule. Uh, in part because, uh, uh,

65
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:42,570
he wanted to avoid builder forfeiture
for innocent or trivial construction

66
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:47,840
breaches. If a builder even
makes a minuscule breach,

67
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,330
a minuscule mistake in construction
under the perfect tender rule,

68
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,900
the buyer can refuse to
pay for any of the work.

69
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:02,100
And the alternative to the perfect tender
rule is the independent promises rule.

70
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:08,610
If the buyer's promise to pay is deemed
to be an independent promise of the

71
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:11,230
builders promise to build,

72
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,920
then the buyer has an unconditional
contractual duty to pay regardless of the

73
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:19,210
builders performance.

74
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,820
The Independent promise rule eliminates
the buyer's defensive protection,

75
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,270
especially under the very old common law.

76
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:33,160
If a buyer had agreed to buy a
cart for a certain amount of money,

77
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,220
the buyer might have an obligation to pay,

78
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,250
even if the seller didn't show up
with the cart at the designated time.

79
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,230
Under the independent promises rule,

80
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:49,231
the buyers only legal recourse for seller
breach would be to affirmatively sue

81
00:05:49,371 --> 00:05:50,740
the seller for damages.

82
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,680
So how do we decide if promises
are independent or dependent?

83
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,960
The opinion is somewhat
vague on this question.

84
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:04,961
Cardozo does tell us that some promises
are so plainly independent that they can

85
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,740
never be fairly, can uh, uh,

86
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,790
can never buy fair construction,

87
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:15,791
be conditioned on one and either
Cardozo refuses to apply the independent

88
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:17,150
promises rule,

89
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:21,770
possibly because it would encourage
builders to commit gross breaches.

90
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,410
You could, uh, uh,

91
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,940
not build the house well and still
the person would have to pay you.

92
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,230
Uh, uh, and their only recourse
would be going to court,

93
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:35,450
which a lot of buyers don't want to do.

94
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:41,230
So instead of applying either the
perfect tender rule or the independent

95
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:46,190
promises, rural Cardozo Crafts
and intermediate standard,

96
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:51,850
he tells us that some promises quote
though dependent and thus conditions when

97
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:58,031
there is a departure in point of substance
will be viewed as independent and

98
00:06:58,221 --> 00:07:01,430
collateral when departure
is insignificant.

99
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,080
So here's a quiz was the defendant's
right to Redding pipe protected by a

100
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:13,781
defensive right not to pay and often
sieve right to sue for damages or both?

101
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,200
Well, apparently only inoffensive, right?

102
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,600
The court wrote and a emission,

103
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:27,601
both trivial and innocent will sometimes
be a tone for by allowance of the

104
00:07:28,811 --> 00:07:33,811
resulting damage and will not always be
the breach of a condition to be followed

105
00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:35,530
by a forfeiture.

106
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:40,930
This is a statement of what is called
the substantial performance role.

107
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,050
This substantial performance
rule has two prongs, can't,

108
00:07:46,051 --> 00:07:51,051
has no duty to pay if there is a
willful breach or if there is less than

109
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:54,910
substantial performance.
In this case,

110
00:07:54,911 --> 00:07:59,200
the court found that the plaintiff
substantially performed its side of the

111
00:07:59,201 --> 00:08:04,201
contract by installing another pipe of
Brant pipe brand that was similar in

112
00:08:05,411 --> 00:08:08,320
quality, uh, uh,

113
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,570
where a breach is trivial and innocent.

114
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,890
A breach may be a tone for by
allowance of just resulting damages.

115
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,610
What counts as substantial performance.

116
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,400
It is determined by considerations,

117
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:24,430
partly of justice and partly
of presumed intention.

118
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,410
The factors listed by the courts are
reflected in section two 41 of the

119
00:08:29,411 --> 00:08:30,550
restatement.
Second,

120
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,110
they go to the issue of whether the
breach is sufficiently material such as

121
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:39,220
whether the injured party will be
deprived of the benefit which he or she

122
00:08:39,221 --> 00:08:40,600
reasonably expected,

123
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,640
and the extent to which the behavior of
the party failing to perform or to offer

124
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:50,170
to perform comports with standards
of good faith and fair dealing.

125
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:55,210
Note that the substantial performance
rule is a middle ground between perfect

126
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,820
and unconditional, uh, duties to perform,

127
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,320
minimizing both seller
and buyer opportunism.

128
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:10,070
The willful breach prong helps assure
that the builder will not intentionally

129
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:12,840
Chisel on her promise to build.

130
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:18,180
While the substantial performance prong
helps assure that the buyer will not

131
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,450
refuse to pay for trivial,
uh, build their breaches.

132
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,540
The rule established in the case.

133
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:29,630
The substantial performance rule is an
outcome that is likely to be preferred by

134
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,180
both future sellers and future buyers.

135
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:38,690
Future sellers are aware of the myriad
of small breaches that are bound to occur

136
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:41,670
in a complex construction contract.

137
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,970
Future buyers realize the defendant
victory would cause future sellers to take

138
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,800
dramatic,
inefficient precautions,

139
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,650
creating time and expense
and raise the price, uh,

140
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,780
unreasonably or the sellers
might demand payment in advance,

141
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,000
uh,
to sure against loss and a similar suit.

142
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,730
Here's another quiz.

143
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:09,600
Can Future parties contract around
the substantial performance rule?

144
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,040
You Bet, yes, they can contract around it.

145
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:19,370
The court says that intense not otherwise
revealed may be presumed to hold in

146
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:24,180
contemplation of the reasonable
and probable. In other words,

147
00:10:24,181 --> 00:10:29,181
a buyer with idiocy in idiosyncratic
preferences who really wants readying pipe

148
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:35,450
because grandparents say started the
company can request perfect tender by

149
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:39,960
revealing their preference
explicitly in the contract.

150
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,520
Putting the onus on the buyer makes sense
from an economic perspective because

151
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:47,520
the idiosyncratic buyer
is the least cost avoider.

152
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,620
It's cheaper for the buyer to speak up
then for the seller to speculate about

153
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:55,290
all of the possible idiosyncrasies.

154
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,630
This substantial performance rule resolves
the defense of rights issue in favor

155
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:04,170
of the builder, but what about
the offensive rights question?

156
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:08,460
The second question is what kind of
remedies are appropriate for the builders

157
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:09,294
breach?

158
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,490
The court held that when breaches not
willful and the cost to replace the pipe

159
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:15,324
is high.

160
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,040
The defendant is only entitled
to dimunition in Value Damages,

161
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,840
which in this case is nothing.

162
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:27,090
Recall that the dimunition in value
is nothing because the pipes actually

163
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:32,091
installed are equal in quality and value
to the Redding pipe that was promised.

164
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,330
So in this case,

165
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:40,650
with the cost of performing damages mean
the construction company would have had

166
00:11:40,651 --> 00:11:43,590
to tear out the wall
and replace the pipes.

167
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,140
No.

168
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:51,140
The construction company can pay the
buyer money to be led out of its duty to

169
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:56,571
perform the incentive to modify the
contract and the presence of costs or

170
00:11:57,121 --> 00:12:01,260
performance. Damages is an
example of Cosia and bargaining.

171
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:06,090
The Coase theorem is a highly
influential legal and economic theory.

172
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,480
It states that were transaction costs
are low and efficient allocation of

173
00:12:11,821 --> 00:12:16,800
resources will take place regardless
of how entitlements are allocated here,

174
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:21,950
there's a cozy and incentive for the
seller to buy her way out of her duty to

175
00:12:22,621 --> 00:12:25,530
sell to the original buyer.

176
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:32,710
So there's also an interesting issue in
this case involving the architect and

177
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,050
what's called the
certificate of completion.

178
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:41,480
The contract explicitly said that
the final payment was only do after

179
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:46,750
plaintiff's architect gave a certificate
of completed completion certifying that

180
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:52,271
the work had been done except for noting
that the architect failed to notice the

181
00:12:52,341 --> 00:12:55,610
discrepancy in the pipe until
after the house was completed.

182
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:00,530
The court did not consider the effect
of substantial performance upon the

183
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:05,531
express condition that the issuance of
a of the certificate was to proceed the

184
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:06,800
duty to pay.

185
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,300
One reason for this may be the
case of Nolan versus Whitney,

186
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,650
where the court held that when a
contractor has substantially performed the

187
00:13:15,651 --> 00:13:16,520
contract,

188
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:21,850
the architect is bound to issue a
certificate and unreasonable and wrongful

189
00:13:22,341 --> 00:13:26,480
refusal excuses the necessity
that the certificate be issued.

190
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,130
Most dates,
however,

191
00:13:28,131 --> 00:13:32,270
have followed the principle of review set
forth in section three Oh three of the

192
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:33,470
first restatement,

193
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:38,890
which excuses the certificate of an
architect as an condition precedent to the

194
00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:45,101
duty of immediate payment only in limited
cir circumstances such as the death of

195
00:13:45,531 --> 00:13:49,790
the architect or failure of the
architect to properly examine the work.

196
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,070
And assumption here is that the architect
as a professional should have more

197
00:13:55,071 --> 00:14:00,071
room for the exercise of honest
judgment that has permitted if that,

198
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:01,340
uh,

199
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,960
then that permitted if the decision
were reviewable under standards of

200
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:07,790
reasonableness.
Reasonableness.

201
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:12,860
A second interesting issue
is the seller's duty to sell.

202
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,100
As we just discussed outside the UCC,

203
00:14:16,101 --> 00:14:20,060
a buyer's duty to pay is nominally
conditioned on the seller.

204
00:14:20,061 --> 00:14:23,780
Substantial performance. On
the other hand, a seller,

205
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:27,760
his duty to sell is normally
conditioned on perfect tender,

206
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:31,100
a full payment should there
be exceptions to this?

207
00:14:31,101 --> 00:14:35,630
Perfect tender rule where the buyer
is a day late or a dollar short.

208
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,600
Okay.

209
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,520
The Jacob and Young's case illustrates
many important principles in contract law.

210
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,210
It touches on important issues
such as material breach,

211
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,850
substantial performance and remedies.
The court adopted,

212
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,560
adopted a substantial performance rule
regarding a buyer's duty to pay instead

213
00:14:57,111 --> 00:15:01,040
of a perfect tender rule or
an independent promises rule.

214
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:06,890
Because the plaintiff install the pipe
equal in price and quality to Redding

215
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:07,610
pipe,

216
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:11,540
the court found that the plaintiff's
substantially performed his side of the

217
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:16,070
contract and was not in material breach.
As for damages,

218
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,990
the defendant is only entitled to
dimunition in value and not the cost of

219
00:15:20,991 --> 00:15:21,770
performance.
