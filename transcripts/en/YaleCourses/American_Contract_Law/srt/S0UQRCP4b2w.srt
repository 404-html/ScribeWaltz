1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,730
Many of you have probably gotten mail
at one point or another telling you the

2
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:09,240
terms and conditions of
your cell phone contract,

3
00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:14,100
your Internet service or credit card,
uh, that these terms have changed.

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,000
Maybe some, some of you have
diligently examine these changes,

5
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:19,560
but I'm guessing most of you haven't.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,110
Today we're going to look at beneficial
national bank versus Ob Peyton,

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,370
uh, 2001 case out of the
southern district of Mississippi,

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,760
which will help us figure out whether
and why you might be contractually bound

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,090
by these change of terms even
if you've never read them.

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,540
We'll also discuss arbitration clauses
and increasingly important element of the

11
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:47,460
contracts we consumers often sign.

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,330
So Ob Peyton,

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,360
the defendant bought a home satellite
system in 1995 he paid for that purchase

14
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:59,640
during his credit,
uh,

15
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,240
using his credit card account
with beneficial national bank,

16
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,740
the cardholder agreement
and disclosure statement,

17
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:12,741
which accompanied Peyton's credit card
agreement with the bank read in part by

18
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:18,780
applying for an account or signing
the application or using this account.

19
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:23,430
You agree to the terms and conditions
contained in this agreement and the terms

20
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,700
and conditions contained
in the application which
you and we agree as part of

21
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:33,810
this agreement, but it also
included a provision which read,

22
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:39,050
we may change the terms of this agreement
with respect to both existing balances

23
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:42,120
and future purchases.

24
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,990
A year later beneficial national bank
sent a notice to Payton and all its other

25
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,650
cardholders advising of changes
to the cardholder agreement.

26
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,220
The notice added an arbitration clause
to the agreement stating any claim,

27
00:01:58,321 --> 00:02:01,110
dispute or controversy,
controversy,

28
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:06,111
whether in contract toward or otherwise
arising from or relating to this

29
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:11,370
agreement or the relationships which
result from this agreement including the

30
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:16,371
validity or enforceability of this
arbitration clause or the entire agreement

31
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,790
shall be resolved upon the election of
you or us by binding arbitration pursuant

32
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:29,331
to this arbitration provision and
the code of procedure of the National

33
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Arbitration Forum.
In effect at the time the claim is filed.

34
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,380
The notice also provided that cardholders
have the option to notify us before

35
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:44,850
the aforesaid 30 day period has elapsed
that you do not agree to accept these

36
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:49,800
changes by writing to us. In the
absence of your giving us such notice,

37
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,950
you will be deemed to consent to
the changes a couple of years later.

38
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,310
Beneficial Bank assigned Peyton's
credit card account to another financial

39
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:01,960
institution household bank.

40
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:07,390
The notification of this assignment also
included in arbitration clause like the

41
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:08,470
beneficial bank,

42
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,920
a modification that was introduced in
1996 in 2001 Peyton sued the bank and the

43
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:22,771
state court alleging fraudulent
misrepresentations and
other wrongful conduct in

44
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:27,280
response to the bank's filed a
federal action to compel arbitration.

45
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,590
They argued that Peyton suit in
state court was governed by Arbor,

46
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,360
the arbitration clause and Peyton's
cardholder agreement and so Peyton had no

47
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:41,710
choice but to resolve his allegations
against the bank through an arbitration

48
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:42,544
process.

49
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,180
The district court ruled for the banks
agreeing that Peyton would have to bring

50
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,370
his claims against them to arbitration.

51
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,840
Peyton offered three primary arguments
for why the arbitration clause should not

52
00:03:57,941 --> 00:03:59,560
bind him.
First,

53
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:04,330
he argued that the change of terms
provision in the original agreement only

54
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:07,150
contemplated changes to existing terms,

55
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:12,190
not the introduction of entirely new ones,
like an arbitration clause.

56
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,440
Second, he argued that his silence
is mere failure to reject the change.

57
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,610
Terms of the contract did not
constitute acceptance of those terms.

58
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:22,923
And third,

59
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:28,050
he claimed that the arbitration clause
did not apply retroactively and that the

60
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:33,130
wrongful conduct he alleged had taken
place before the addition of the

61
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:35,020
arbitration clause to the agreement.

62
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,340
The trial judge rejected
all three arguments,

63
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,730
but the second argument is the
one we're going to focus on today.

64
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,120
Peyton relied on a California case long
versus fidelity water systems for the

65
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:52,240
notion that his failure
to reject the terms, uh,

66
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:55,330
amounted to acceptance of them at issue.

67
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:00,100
In that case was an arbitration clause
in a credit card account agreement with

68
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:05,101
household bank that like the clause
in this case was added to an original

69
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:10,300
agreement that agree original agreement
reserve the right to change certain

70
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:11,134
terms.

71
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,580
The arbitration clause similarly permitted
the cardholder to decline the new

72
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:19,600
terms.
The court in long found quote,

73
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,950
defendant never obtained any affirmative
consent from the plaintiff regarding

74
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,300
incorporation of the arbitration clause
is part of the existing contract.

75
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,830
Rather defendant's required the plaintiff
to take affirmative action if he

76
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:37,780
wished to reject the incorporation
of the unilateral arbitration clause.

77
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:42,670
The ninth circuit has held that before
a party to a lawsuit can be ordered to

78
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:46,240
arbitrate and thus be
deprived of a day in court.

79
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,860
There should be an express
unequivocal agreement to that effect.

80
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,180
But the court relied instead in this
ob Peyton case on a different decision,

81
00:05:58,311 --> 00:06:03,311
a different precedent bank one versus
coats another case out of the southern

82
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:07,940
district of Mississippi and opinion,
which Tom Lee,

83
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,350
uh, the very same judge as in
this beneficial bank case. Uh,

84
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,910
he had written the opinion that case
emphasize that when determining whether

85
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:20,630
parties had actually agreed
to arbitrate a dispute,

86
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,900
the court had to look to
federal arbitration law,

87
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:29,020
which addressed the question with quote
a healthy regard for the federal policy

88
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:30,410
favoring arbitration.

89
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,160
The intention of the party should be
generously construed as to the issues of

90
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:38,390
arbitrability of court,

91
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,570
could grant relief to the
party opposing arbitration.

92
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,780
But the standards for doing so were high
when he or she presented well supported

93
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:50,990
claims that the agreement to arbitrate
resulted from the sort of fraud or

94
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:55,991
overwhelming economic power that would
provide grounds for the revocation of any

95
00:06:56,031 --> 00:07:00,290
contract.
Applying the principles set out.

96
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,570
In that case,
the court ruled for the banks.

97
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,800
The banks relied on
section four of the FAA,

98
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:11,300
the Federal Arbitration Act in bringing
their motion to compel arbitration.

99
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,670
This section provides that a party
aggrieved by the alleged failure,

100
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:21,080
neglect or refusal of another to
arbitrate under a written agreement for

101
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:24,920
arbitration may petition the
United States District Court,

102
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:30,100
which save for such agreement would
have jurisdiction for an order directing

103
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:35,561
such arbitration to proceed in the
manner provided for in such agreement

104
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,380
the Federal Arbitration Act.

105
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:44,380
The FAA was an acted in 1925 but it wasn't
until the 1990s as in this case that

106
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:50,270
the arbitration clauses came to be used
widely and contracts between businesses

107
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,200
and consumers.

108
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:56,000
Can you think of some of the reasons
companies might prefer private arbitration

109
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:59,690
to contesting allegations in court?
Well,

110
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,490
some possible reasons are that the
arbitration process generally is in public

111
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:09,290
and the parties involved often by
agreement may not disclose the results.

112
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:14,740
Arbitration decisions usually aren't
appealable and the process is cheaper for

113
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:16,394
the company.

114
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,050
There's also the lingering concern that
arbitrators are less likely than jurors

115
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:26,051
to render a verdict verdicts
favorable to consumers or employees.

116
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:31,580
There's been a lot of recent focus on
how arbitration agreements also allow

117
00:08:31,581 --> 00:08:34,280
companies to avoid class action lawsuits.

118
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,720
This case gives us a good opportunity
to talk about mandatory rules versus

119
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:43,520
default rules.
As we've discussed before.

120
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:48,500
A mandatory rule in contract
law is just what it sounds like.

121
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,500
It's a rule that parties cannot
contract around the UCC notes.

122
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,270
Some mandatory,
it contains some mandatory rules.

123
00:08:57,271 --> 00:09:01,410
Parties cannot contract out of the
requirement of good faith. For instance,

124
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,671
by contrast,

125
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:06,660
the default rule is a rule that governs
a contract if the parties haven't

126
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:09,450
specified some thought,
something contrary.

127
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,700
Default rules can be contracted around
and altering rules are the rules that say

128
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,760
that specify the conditions
for contracting around
parties if they explicitly

129
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:26,061
include an altering rule can deviate
from the default in their own contracts.

130
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,960
With that mine,

131
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,670
think of what the default rule
for acceptances in this case.

132
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,930
Well, to begin with, by default,

133
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:41,931
silence is not a way to
accept a contractual offer.

134
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:46,800
Indeed even though an offer
or is master of her offer.

135
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:50,880
And Ken accordingly in the offer
define the ways it might be accepted.

136
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:56,570
The rule that offeree silence cannot
operate as acceptance is somewhat

137
00:09:56,671 --> 00:10:00,990
mandatory. I can walk up to
someone on the street and say,

138
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:05,991
I offered a buy your coat for 10
cents and your silence will operate as

139
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:07,134
acceptance.

140
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:12,020
That would allow offers
done reasonably impose on,

141
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,740
on the stranger offerings,
time and attention. And so,

142
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,320
uh,
at common law,

143
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,800
a silence as by default does not operate
as acceptance even if the offer offers,

144
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,540
uh,
tries to make it so.

145
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,500
But as we mentioned in the last class,

146
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,920
restatement 69 does provide for three
exceptions where silence can operate as

147
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:40,710
acceptance.
Let's review them again.

148
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,860
The first exception isn't
really an exception.

149
00:10:43,861 --> 00:10:48,861
It says if the offeree after having a
reasonable opportunity to reject the offer

150
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,090
takes the benefit offered. There's
an acceptance, but in this instance,

151
00:10:54,091 --> 00:10:58,410
the offerings conduct creates
a contract implied. In fact,

152
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,420
there really is in silence.

153
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:06,090
The second exception is perverse because
it's seemingly requires the court to

154
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:10,070
adopt a subjectivist approach
toward offeree intent.

155
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,280
Remember normally contract
log goes by externals.

156
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,470
How would the reasonable observer,

157
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:21,660
the reasonable listener interpret
the other person's words or conduct,

158
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:27,050
but section 69 instead says silence can
operate as acceptance if the offer re in

159
00:11:27,781 --> 00:11:30,780
remaining silent intends
to accept the offer,

160
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:36,170
but how has the court to determine this
intent from externals if the offeree is

161
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,100
silent and inactive.

162
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:44,060
The third and final exception is closest
to the Peyton case and where most of

163
00:11:45,061 --> 00:11:46,080
the action is.

164
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:51,380
It says that silence can
operate as acceptance if
previous dealing or something

165
00:11:51,601 --> 00:11:56,601
else makes it reasonable that the offeree
should notify the offer or if he or

166
00:11:56,681 --> 00:12:01,420
she does not intend to
accept the change of terms.

167
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:06,421
Provision in the initial contract
might call qualify as just this kind of

168
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:08,290
previous dealings,

169
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,360
but the provision is a bit opaque
or one might even say misleading.

170
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:18,990
The provision remember says we may
change the terms of this agreement with

171
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:22,870
respect to both existing
balances and future purchases,

172
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:28,530
but the parties to any contract may
always change the terms of a contract by

173
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:32,050
subsequently both agreeing
to modify the contract.

174
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:37,770
The real effect of these change of terms
clauses seems to be to allow customer

175
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:41,920
silence to operate as a scent.

176
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,520
After the bank unilaterally sends a
notice of modified terms where this notice

177
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:51,460
is formerly an offer to
modify the initial contract.

178
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:57,060
The initial change of terms provision
might be at attacked a bit like Williams

179
00:12:57,101 --> 00:13:02,101
versus Walker Thomas Furniture for not
making clear what exactly turns on the

180
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:08,020
provision, but that's not the
conclusion of the court. Instead,

181
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:13,021
the court finds that Peyton silence
operates as acceptance or to put it in

182
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:18,511
default terminology by default customers
except all modification offers the

183
00:13:21,341 --> 00:13:26,341
default legal consequences are what Simon
and Garfunkel might call the sound of

184
00:13:26,711 --> 00:13:30,190
silence.
And hear silence means acceptance.

185
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:34,660
Not explicitly rejecting terms
indicates acceptance of them.

186
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,430
But in the long case from
California, we, that we excerpted,

187
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,650
the court did not apply the same default
in that case. It instead required,

188
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,510
uh,
express a scent,

189
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:51,630
meaning that the default meaning of
silence was rejection of the modification

190
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:55,560
offer.
So what are the downsides of a,

191
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,640
each of these default rules?

192
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,930
A default of rejection certainly
increases transaction costs,

193
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,620
but a default of acceptance
which the court in Peyton, uh,

194
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,090
applied may also,
uh,

195
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,890
increased unfairness binding consumers.

196
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:16,030
Two terms which they never
agreed to or even knew about.

197
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:22,020
Several jurisdictions have past versions
of the uniform consumer credit code.

198
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,790
This is different than the UCC.

199
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:29,791
It's the you CCC and Section Three Point
Two oh five make silence as acceptance.

200
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:37,000
The default with regard to
a consumer credit contracts.

201
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:42,570
Indeed it's language may even go further
than the cases we've discussed here it

202
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:47,440
says whether or not a change is
authorized by prior agreement,

203
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,680
a creditor may change the terms of an
open end credit account applying to any

204
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:56,810
balance incurred before or after
the effective date of the change.

205
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,560
This statutory language suggests creditors
can unilaterally modify the contracts

206
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,320
even when there is no express change of
terms provision in the initial credit

207
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:13,721
agreement or even cancel their
contracts if the consumer's object.

208
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,450
The comment to,

209
00:15:15,451 --> 00:15:20,451
to the uniform provision argues that
in insurmountable difficulties would

210
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:26,531
confront such creditors where it necessary
for them to obtain from each consumer

211
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,960
his or her signed consent to a change.

212
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:34,961
In terms because experience indicates
that only a minority of customers take the

213
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:40,481
trouble to return and express
approval or disapproval of a change.

214
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:41,444
In terms.

215
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Think of all the mail you get that you
probably think is junk and don't look at

216
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,440
precisely because you're not
expected to look at such male.

217
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,260
You may become bound by its terms.

218
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,890
So what have we learned from this case?

219
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,310
We have learned that in
consumer credit contracts,

220
00:16:01,311 --> 00:16:06,311
unilateral modifications to the contract
often will be accepted by silence.

221
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,840
And we've discussed some pros and cons
about that policy, about that default.

222
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,190
We've learned a bit about
arbitration clauses, and finally,

223
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,120
we've learned that you probably would
be wise to read your mail carefully.
