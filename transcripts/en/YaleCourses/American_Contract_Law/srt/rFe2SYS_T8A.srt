1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:06,040
Today, we're going to talk about a
staple of the contract law. Canon,

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:11,440
the famous chestnut of
Hadley vs Baxendale.

3
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,480
In some respects, this may be the
case furthest removed from us today.

4
00:00:16,481 --> 00:00:21,481
It was decided more than a century
and a half ago in 1854 in England.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,800
Uh,

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,800
but the Hadley rule concerning recovery
for foreseeable consequential damages is

7
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:33,880
with us today and largely unchanged form.

8
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:35,850
Yeah.

9
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,850
The brothers of Joseph and Jonah Hadley
owned the city flour mills in cloud

10
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:42,390
Chester,
England.

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,020
The crank shaft in the steam engine
used to power the mill broke holding the

12
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:50,250
mills operation.

13
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,950
The Hadley's needed to get the broken
crank shaft to the steam engines

14
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,980
manufacturer in Greenwich so that the
manufacturer could provide a replacement.

15
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,820
The Hadley send an employee to
the defendant's offices, uh,

16
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:10,821
of Pickford and sons to have
them transport the crank
shaft to the manufacturer.

17
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,930
The Hadley employee and Pickford and sons
agreed that the delivery would be made

18
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:22,470
the following day for a cost of
two pounds and four shillings.

19
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,100
The employee did not explain that the
mill was inoperable due to this broken a

20
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,663
shaft,

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,230
but then because of some neglect unquote,

22
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,540
the delivery was delayed and so the
mill couldn't run for several more days.

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,790
The plaintiff sued arguing contractual
breach and seeking damages,

24
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:48,840
not only for the amount they
paid for the shipping service,

25
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,230
but also for their lost profits
of having the mill closed.

26
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,940
The judge quote left the
case generally to the jury,

27
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:02,330
which awarded a verdict of
25 pounds damages taking
into account the plaintiff's

28
00:02:02,701 --> 00:02:05,460
lost profits for the days
the mill couldn't run.

29
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,273
Okay.

30
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,720
Does the some neglect on the part of
the company that the opinion discusses

31
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:17,220
matter in this action?
Not really.

32
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,220
There's a strict liability for
breach of contractual promises. Uh,

33
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,690
whether it was intentional,
whether it was negligent,

34
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,730
even if it was not negligent. If you
don't perform, you're promises, uh,

35
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,720
you have to compensate.
The other side.

36
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,540
The Hadley Court awarded a new trial
on the ground that the judge hadn't

37
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,310
properly instructed the jury,

38
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,180
barren Adelson and
influential judge agreed.

39
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:47,181
He announced the rule that parties to
contract are only liable for damages that

40
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:51,030
were foreseeable at the
time of contract formation.

41
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,900
The court found that damages for breach
of contract should be such as may fairly

42
00:02:57,211 --> 00:03:02,211
and reasonably be considered either
arising naturally from breach of contract

43
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:07,921
itself or such as may reasonably be
supposed to have been in the contemplation

44
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:13,321
of both parties at the time they made the
contract as the probable result of the

45
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:15,454
breach of it.

46
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,580
Did this necessarily mean that the
jury's verdict of 25 pound damages was

47
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:23,590
incorrect?
Not Quite.

48
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,920
The court explained that parties could
inform each other of unique circumstances

49
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:32,710
that could make the damages
of a breach more significant,

50
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,390
more foreseeable then they'd be in
an ordinary case if they did so.

51
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:42,630
These more significant damages would still
have to be foreseeable if the special

52
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:49,770
circumstances were communicated by the
plaintiff to the defendant and thus known

53
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:51,040
to both parties.

54
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,360
The damages resulting from the breach
of such a contract which they would

55
00:03:55,361 --> 00:04:00,361
reasonably contemplate would be the amount
of injury which would ordinarily flow

56
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:04,150
from a breach of contract under
these special cir circumstances.

57
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,880
So known and communicated.

58
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,150
It's important to understand that the
error the court found was not that the

59
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:15,940
jury award was necessarily too big.

60
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,540
It was that the judge had
failed to explain to the
jury that it's ward had to be

61
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:23,740
limited to foreseeable damages.

62
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,570
The court did not rule that a properly
instructed jury could not have returned

63
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:32,170
the same damage award.
On that note,

64
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,320
let's make clear that we understand
the difference between direct and

65
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:38,890
consequential damages.

66
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,520
One way to differentiate between these
damages is to distinguish the damages

67
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:49,360
that are needed to choir substitute
goods or services or their equivalent,

68
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,300
which is we just saw,
uh,

69
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,830
last time might be captured by cost
or performance or dimunition in value

70
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:57,664
damages.

71
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,730
So we want to distinguish those damages
from the damages flowing from the loss

72
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:07,690
incurred as a consequence or a result
of the plaintiff not having the promised

73
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:08,920
goods or services,

74
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:14,280
which in this case is the plaintiff's
lost profit from not having the mill. Uh,

75
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:15,114
operable

76
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,990
a rule that says non foreseeable lost
profits like Hadley are nonrecoverable may

77
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:24,730
seem unfair.

78
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,130
Can you think of any reasons why
courts might impose this limitation?

79
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,900
Well, veterans Adelson's
opinion explained quote,

80
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:38,050
had the special
circumstance has been known.

81
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:43,230
The parties might have specialty provided
for breach of contract by special

82
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:47,560
terms as to the damages in this
case and have this advantage.

83
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,940
It would be very unjust to deprive them.
You see,

84
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:56,200
if parties are aware of
special circumstances that
will expose them to greater

85
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:57,034
liability,

86
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,120
they likely will take more care to make
sure they perform and charge more for

87
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:03,980
their services.
Similarly,

88
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:08,090
if parties know that courts will
hold them responsible for damages,

89
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:09,410
they could not foresee,

90
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,860
they will raise their prices generally
to take into account this greater chance

91
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:18,740
that they're going to be
tagged for high damages.

92
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,540
They'll not be able to tailor their
care to customers who need it the most.

93
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,760
As a result, customers who only
have typical foreseeable damages,

94
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:33,020
we'll have to pay more to help ensure
customers with atypical damages.

95
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:34,980
Okay.

96
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,350
Federal Express you, Fedex, uh,

97
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,560
provides that when
shipping packages quote,

98
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:46,100
unless a higher value is declared and
paid for our liability for each package is

99
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:50,220
limited to $100,
uh,

100
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,050
for each package exceeding a hundred
dollars in declared value and additional

101
00:06:55,051 --> 00:06:58,040
amounts will be charged unquote.
That's,

102
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,830
that's from the Fedex contract
on every FedEx package.

103
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,460
Why might this be a better policy for
customers than if Fedex did not limit

104
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:13,230
liability for valuable items over $100?
Well,

105
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:16,140
it's for exactly the same
reason we've just discussed.

106
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:21,470
It makes more sense to require those who
might incur substantial consequential

107
00:07:21,571 --> 00:07:26,571
losses if their packages are lost or
damages to be more to insure them than to

108
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:32,181
have all those who use FedEx services
to foot the bill for others valuable

109
00:07:32,221 --> 00:07:37,221
shipments and it lets FedEx know when
it needs to take special care to get a

110
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:41,550
package through.
As we noted at the outset,

111
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,760
this was an English case,
not in an American case,

112
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,540
but courts in the United States
typically follow the Hadley rule.

113
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,980
The Supreme Court at the turn of the
century suggested a different path.

114
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:58,430
Justice Holmes asserted in globe refining
versus Landa cotton oil company that

115
00:08:00,121 --> 00:08:05,121
quote mere notice to a seller of some
interest or probable action of the buyer

116
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:10,320
is not enough necessarily and as a
matter of law to charge the seller with

117
00:08:10,321 --> 00:08:12,510
special damages on that account.

118
00:08:12,511 --> 00:08:15,570
If he fails to deliver the goods unquote,

119
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,810
the defendants had to have
at least tacitly agreed to
be liable for these extra

120
00:08:21,271 --> 00:08:26,070
losses at issue,
but most courts reject this test.

121
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:31,100
It is enough that the defendant for saw
or had reason to foresee the plaintiff's

122
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,420
losses that are being claimed.

123
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,900
This is reflected in the restatement
of contracts section three 51 which

124
00:08:39,691 --> 00:08:43,200
provides damages are not
recoverable for loss,

125
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:48,530
that the party and breach did not have
reason to foresee as a probable result of

126
00:08:48,901 --> 00:08:51,390
the breach when the contract was made.

127
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Loss may be foreseeable as a probable
of a breach because it follows from the

128
00:08:57,931 --> 00:09:02,931
breach in the ordinary course of
events or be as a result of special

129
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:08,691
circumstances beyond the ordinary course
of events that the party and breach has

130
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:10,110
reason to know.

131
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:16,910
So is the handily rule a default
rule or a mandatory rule?

132
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,940
Now it's a default rule.

133
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,200
Parties can contract around it by
giving sufficient notice of special

134
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:26,160
circumstances.

135
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,540
Parties can also contract out of
the rule in the other direction.

136
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,100
They can explicitly exclude all
liability for consequential damages.

137
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:40,790
There's usually a a term
excluding liability for
consequential damages and most,

138
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,160
uh,
consumer electronics contracts.

139
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:49,210
But Rob Gertner and I have categorized
a Hadley vs Baxendale doctrine as an

140
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:58,290
example of a penalty default or
an information forcing default.

141
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:04,020
The court's refusal to
award unforeseeable damages,

142
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:09,240
uh, uh, is a refusal, not because
those damages aren't real,

143
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:14,780
but the dot Hadley doctrine gives promises
and incentive to reveal information

144
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:22,230
to the promise sores about what otherwise
would be unusual consequential damages.

145
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,400
One way to think about cases like Hadley
where breach occurred because of some

146
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:32,940
neglect is through a
torts lens where the law,

147
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:37,520
among other things should be trying
to induce optimal promissory procop

148
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,363
precaution.

149
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,240
The risk of nonperformance can be
thought of as the probability of

150
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:45,480
nonperformance.

151
00:10:45,481 --> 00:10:50,430
The probability of breach multiplied
by the loss to the promise. See,

152
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,290
including consequential damages that
will result from nonperformance.

153
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,873
That's the,

154
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:01,410
the risk can be thought of as
the probability times the loss.

155
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,970
A standard move in law and economics is
to place the risk of loss on the better

156
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:09,774
risk bear.

157
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:15,580
A good risk bear will tend
to have information and
control information about the

158
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:19,720
size of the risk and,

159
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,510
and the control or ability to
take action to change that size.

160
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,640
And here's the structural problem
with regard to contractual risks.

161
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:35,150
Promissors tend to have better knowledge
and control about the probability of

162
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:37,740
breach,
but promise sees,

163
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:42,870
tend to have better knowledge and control
about the size of loss that will occur

164
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:47,580
that will result if breach occurs.
The shipping company.

165
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:52,610
Pickford knew more about the probability
that the ship would be delivered and

166
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:59,290
it's better place to take action to affect
that probability say by strapping on

167
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:03,820
more horses to the carriage, to to make
sure that the shipment goes through,

168
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:05,740
even if one of the horses goes lane,

169
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:11,730
the Hadley's on the other hand knew
more about the size of loss if there,

170
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,210
uh,

171
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:18,210
if their factory had to close down and
they were better able to control the size

172
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:22,000
of the loss, say by keeping
spare crank shafts in stock.

173
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,310
So at first glance, it seems difficult
to decide whether the promise or,

174
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:30,160
or the promise prophecy
is the better risk bearer,

175
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:35,970
the promise or has better knowledge and
control of one variable p the promise he

176
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:40,720
has better knowledge and
control of the other variable l.

177
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:46,690
But the genius of the Hadley rule is
that by using an information forcing

178
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:51,780
default contract law can tip the scales
and make the promise or the better risk

179
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:57,961
bear by inducing promises to disclose
the size of their loss to the promise or

180
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,860
the Heather Headley rule makes the
promise or now better place to bear this

181
00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:06,304
loss.

182
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:11,260
Armed with better information about both
the probability of breach and now also

183
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:13,900
the size of the preach.
Moreover,

184
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:17,440
as we could see from the FedEx example,

185
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:22,860
since promissory are going to respond to
Hadley information by charging a higher

186
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:28,720
price, uh, when performing
for a high damage primacy,

187
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:33,310
the Hadley rule even indirectly
gives promises, incentives,

188
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,270
uh,

189
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:39,270
to exercise their control over the
size of the loss to mitigate damages.

190
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:46,060
Some Fedex shippers will find it cheaper
to keep extra crank shafts in stock

191
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:51,061
rather than pay the extra insurance that
will be required if high prospective

192
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:52,840
damages are disclosed.

193
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:59,860
We have discussed the influence of the
Hadley rule in the United States and the

194
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:04,810
policy concerns that underlay it.
We should note another less obvious way.

195
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:06,430
Hadley proved influential.

196
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:11,200
Recall where the court in Hadley
placed the error that occurred.

197
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,920
The jury was not at fault for a warning.
Excessive damages.

198
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,090
Rather the judge improperly,
uh,

199
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,820
instructed the jury as
the court explained quote,

200
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:26,821
we deem it to be expedient and necessary
to state explicitly the rule which the

201
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:30,430
judge that the next trial
ought in our opinion,

202
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,760
to direct the jury to be governed by
when they estimate the damages unquote

203
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:41,790
Hadley was decided in an era in which
English courts increasingly reformulated

204
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:47,290
questions of fact that had been left
previously to the jury's discretion.

205
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,500
Like damages as matters
of law to be judging,

206
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,780
to be decided by judges,

207
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,000
by making a rule that consequential
damages can only be awarded if damages are

208
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:03,530
foreseeable, the court's dramatically
limited. The jury's power.

209
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:08,900
This form of jury control became common
in the United States as well as in

210
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:09,260
England.
