00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:01,411
Today,

2
00:00:01,411 --> 00:00:05,550
we turned to one of two introductory
cases where promise service who entered

3
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:10,551
into seemingly valid contracts attempt
to avoid liability for not following

4
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:14,340
through on their promises.
Today's case,

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,550
Bolin farm's versus American cotton
shippers association involves a futures

6
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:21,600
contract for the sale of cotton.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,260
In the first few months of 1973 11
cotton farmers in western Louisiana.

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,041
Among them,

9
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:34,041
Bolin farm's signed contracts
with American cotton
shippers to sell cotton grown

10
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:38,010
on their farms at harvest time that year.

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,030
Those contracts locked in prices between
29 and 41 cents per pound while the

12
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:50,631
market price of cotton at that time
range between 28 and 32 cents per pound,

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,500
but commodity markets
can change quite rapidly.

14
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,310
By the time the farmers were
harvesting their cotton in September,

15
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,320
cotton prices had more than doubled
to around 80 cents per pound.

16
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,190
The deals they had gotten before of up
to 41 cents per pound no longer seem so

17
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:11,700
good,

18
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,700
and the f so the farmers
sued for a declaration that
the contracts are null and

19
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:22,311
void unquote so that they could sell for
a better price than they bargained for.

20
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,750
The suit came before the Federal District
Court for the western district of

21
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:32,670
Louisiana and the court had to decide
whether a future contracts remain valid

22
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,540
even when the market price becomes
very different from the contract price.

23
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,260
Common law court opinions have
changed over time about whether change

24
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,020
circumstances can affect a party's
obligations under a contract.

25
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,440
The old rule is that packed as soon
Servon de agreements are to be honored.

26
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,950
Most famously,

27
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:57,951
the English Court of Kings Bench said
in Paradine v Jane in 1647 that when the

28
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:05,391
party by his own contract creates
a duty or charge upon himself,

29
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,880
he's bound to make it good if he may not
withstanding any accident by inevitable

30
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:15,780
necessity because he might have
provoked against it by his contract.

31
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,660
That is no matter how circumstances have
changed since the contract was signed.

32
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,210
If a party cannot fulfill her promise,

33
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,240
she must compensate the
other party to the contract.

34
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,530
The rules have become somewhat
more lenient over time.

35
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,560
One typical approach is found in section
two six 15 of the uniform commercial

36
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:41,691
code which says nondelivery by a seller
is not a breach of his duty under a

37
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:47,721
contract for sale if performance is
agreed has been made impracticable by the

38
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:50,790
occurrence of a contingency.

39
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,500
The non occurrence of which was a basic
assumption on which the contract was

40
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:56,334
made.

41
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,660
If the parties made their agreement
based on an assumption about the world,

42
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,460
that turns out to be false.

43
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,720
That could relieve a party of the
responsibility to follow through on the

44
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:08,554
promise,

45
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,030
but possible changes in the world that
parties were aware of when they formed

46
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:15,580
the contract will not
invalidate the contract.

47
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,830
Note that the uniform commercial code
itself does not apply in this case,

48
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,430
Louisiana,
Louisiana is one of the states is the,

49
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:29,410
is the one state that has not
adopted a article two of the UCC.

50
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,580
Generally,

51
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,170
Louisiana laws often different from
that of other states because it retains

52
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:40,120
elements of the French Civil Code Law
from when it was a French colony before

53
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:45,121
the Louisiana purchase of 1803 in the
case of Bolin farm's judge hunter found it

54
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:50,320
quite easy to determine
that the contract is valid.

55
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:55,750
The entire purpose of a futures contract
is to hedge against possible future

56
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:59,890
changes in the price of the
underlying good or commodity.

57
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:05,080
The farmers entered into the contract
knowing that if the price of cotton fell,

58
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:09,280
they would make money on the contract
because they could sell it the agreed upon

59
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,770
future price instead of the market price.

60
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,530
They also knew that if
the price of cotton rows,

61
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,800
they would miss out on a higher market
price or spot price at harvest time in

62
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:21,100
signing the contract,

63
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:26,050
they locked in a particular future
price for going both the possible future

64
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:27,790
gains and future losses.

65
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,770
They cannot now abrogate their agreement
simply because it turns out to be less

66
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:36,550
favorable than selling that
the higher spot market price.

67
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,410
They would not have wanted the American
cotton shippers association to do that

68
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:42,790
if the prices had fallen.

69
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:48,340
I've included this case to show you that
not all contract disputes are difficult.

70
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,900
The result in Bolton farm chords
with most people's common sense.

71
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,990
So here's a quiz. Suppose that instead
of rising to 80 cents per pound,

72
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:01,600
the price of continent
fallen to 10 cents per pound.

73
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,910
Now the American copper cotton shippers
association wants to have the contract

74
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:10,540
declared void so they can
buy cheaper cotton elsewhere.

75
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,080
How will the court rule?
Well,

76
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,250
just as the farmer could not evade their
obligation to sell the contract to sell

77
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:24,730
there their cotton at the agreed upon
price. When the market price rose,

78
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,650
the American copper cotton shippers
association cannot evade its obligation to

79
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:34,651
buy the farmers cotton at the agreed
upon price when the market price falls.

80
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,020
So the contract will be held to be valid.

81
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:42,820
The parties are mutually bound
to this, uh, reciprocal bargain.

82
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:47,830
But this kind of price mutuality is
not a mandatory part of all contracts.

83
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,300
Option contracts explicitly
give the option holder, uh,

84
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:57,320
price protection, but the
option of trading at a more
favorable spot price. Thus,

85
00:05:57,321 --> 00:06:02,150
the farmers might have merely purchased
put options to sell their cotton at

86
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:04,340
particular forward prices,

87
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,580
but they would have had to pay for that
asymmetric option from Bolin farm's we

88
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:15,851
have learned about the impact change
circumstances can have on a contract.

89
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,990
We'll come back to this when we study
in practicum impracticability again,

90
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,860
the general rule remains the
same as it's been for centuries.

91
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:29,861
Parties to a contract are responsible for
filling their promises or compensating

92
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:32,090
the other side if they,
if they breach.

93
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:37,690
We saw that this has been
loosened somewhat by the
UCC section two six 15 which

94
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:43,631
allows parties to evade their promises
if fundamental assumptions underlying the

95
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:48,140
contract turned out to be impracticable.
However,

96
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,610
since losing money on a futures
contract as happens in Bolin,

97
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:57,440
farm's is certainly not the kind of
thing that is enough to invalidate the

98
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:59,930
farmer is obligation.
By the way,

99
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:04,910
the farmers also raised a question about
whether they were somehow victims of

100
00:07:04,911 --> 00:07:08,570
buyer insider information,
superior information.

101
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,840
The court rejected the allegation.
As a factual matter,

102
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,070
cotton buyers don't have much opportunity
to learn about weather or the boll

103
00:07:16,071 --> 00:07:18,230
weevil infestations ahead of time,

104
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,000
but we'll be returning to the question
of whether buyers or sellers have a duty

105
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:27,860
to disclose a superior
information later in the course,

106
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,720
especially when we discuss the
supreme court's decision in Laidlaw.
