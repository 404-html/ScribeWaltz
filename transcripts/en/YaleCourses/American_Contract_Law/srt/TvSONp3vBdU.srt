1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,250
Our next case,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,310
Bernstein versus Niemeyer involves the
lawsuit that emerged from a complicated

3
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:12,381
investment arrangement in 1983 Niemeyer
and several others formed the CMC

4
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:20,031
southwest limited partnership in order
to purchase and renovate two apartment

5
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:23,520
complexes in Houston,
Texas.

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,210
In 1984 they persuaded Bernstein and
other plaintiffs to invest $1,050,000 in

7
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:33,054
the partnership.

8
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,510
In part because the defendants made
a negative cash flow guarantee.

9
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,830
Niemeyer and the Cheshire management
company agreed to lend money to the

10
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:48,831
partnership each year as part of this
negative cashflow guarantee to cover for

11
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:50,430
any loss.

12
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,910
That is they would lend any amount by
which the operating costs exceeded income

13
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:57,324
from rent.

14
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,720
The loans would be repaid from future
years' income or from the gains realized

15
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:08,451
when the buildings were sold and Niemeyer
and the guarantors claims were to be

16
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:14,091
paid on the negative guarantee loans
before any claims of bursting or the other

17
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:16,884
investors,

18
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,570
instead of gaining value as
the partnership had hope,

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,600
the apartment complexes in fact
declined in value along with the rest of

20
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:29,820
Houston's real estate.
As you can see in this graph.

21
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,150
By late 1985 the defendants had made
loans of $3 million under their negative

22
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:38,820
cashflow guarantee.

23
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,080
They stopped pain in an effort
to renegotiate the mortgage,

24
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:47,310
but the property ended up in foreclosure
and the whole partnership lost its

25
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,450
entire investment.

26
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:53,970
Bernstein and other limited partners
then sued the general partners for

27
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:57,510
rescission of the contract and
restitution of their investment.

28
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,580
The trial court ruled for the defendants
finding that the defendant's breach was

29
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,680
not material in that quote,

30
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:08,850
the plaintiff's losses resulted from a
bad market rather than the defendant's

31
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:09,684
breach.

32
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,940
We are reading the decision on appeal
at the Supreme Court of Connecticut

33
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,790
written by Chief Justice Ellen Peters.

34
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,930
Justice Peters used to teach contracts
at yell and I often look up at her

35
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:23,280
portrait when I'm teaching.

36
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,420
She found that the defendant's breach
was material. The defendant's breach.

37
00:02:28,421 --> 00:02:32,310
Their promise to keep a lending money
to cover any negative cash flows,

38
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,510
not lending money that you promise
to lend is pretty material.

39
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,590
So Justice Peters went on to look
at whether the plaintiffs could get

40
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:41,424
restitution.

41
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,030
The question was can a plaintiff obtain
restitution when the breaching defendant

42
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:51,180
got no benefit from the contract?
First,

43
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,890
let's review the different measures
of the plaintiffs possible recovery.

44
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:01,130
We have mostly been concerned in this
course with damages add reliance damages

45
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,170
as you'll recall from
Sullivan versus O'Connor.

46
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,820
Expectation damages seek to
put the non breaching party,

47
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:14,821
usually the plaintiff in as good a
position as he or she would be in if the

48
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:16,780
other party hadn't breached.

49
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,090
In this case the defendants would have
kept making negative cashflow loans,

50
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,920
but remember the loans had to be paid off
before the plaintiff's Scott, anything.

51
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,750
The underlying property was going to
decline in value either way and so the

52
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:35,800
plane is probably wouldn't have benefited
from the defendant's pouring good

53
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:38,380
money after bad.
In other words,

54
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:43,381
expectation damages would be zero or at
least very small because the plaintiffs

55
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:48,430
couldn't expect to be to receive any of
the money back if the defendant's kept

56
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,680
making first priority loans.

57
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,890
Reliance damages on the other hand
tried to put the plaintiff in as good a

58
00:03:56,891 --> 00:04:01,891
position as she would have been in
had the contract never been made here.

59
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,080
That would mean that Bernstein would
get the whole original investment, uh,

60
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,710
uh, the plaintiffs would get back
their billion dollar and $50,000.

61
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,430
Both of these calculations for damages
take the situation or the position of the

62
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,390
plaintiff as their focus,

63
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,100
but the plaintiffs didn't choose to go
for either of these because plaintiffs

64
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:29,101
are usually limited to the lesser
of reliance and expectation damages.

65
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,940
More specifically if a plaintiff elects
to pursue reliance damages courts or

66
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:39,760
will reduce them to the expectation about
if the defendant's persuade the court

67
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,260
that expectation damages would be smaller.
Instead,

68
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:48,670
the plaintiff in this case sued for
restitution for which the calculation of

69
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:53,290
damages focuses on the defendant,
the defendant's position or situation.

70
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,980
The goal of restitution damages is to
prevent the defendants from being unjustly

71
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:01,270
enriched by their breach of contract.

72
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,720
That is restitution tries to put the
party in breach back in the position he

73
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:10,750
would have been in if the
contract had not been made.

74
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:16,260
The damages take back the benefit that
preaching party got from being in the

75
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:17,824
contract.

76
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,490
Section three 71 of the second
restatement sets out to different ways of

77
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:26,050
calculating restitution damages.

78
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:31,470
The first and subsection a says that a
plaintiff can get the fair market value

79
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,570
of whatever goods or services
she gave the defendant.

80
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,610
The second calculation in subsection
B says the plaintiff can get whatever

81
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,380
increase in value to the defendant
of those goods or services.

82
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,780
In analyzing this case,

83
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:51,130
chief justice Peters first looked at
whether the plaintiffs had done what they

84
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:54,560
needed to do in order to earn restitution.
It is quote,

85
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,640
a condition of rescission and restitution
that the plaintiff offer as nearly as

86
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:04,460
possible to place the other party in
the same situation that existed prior to

87
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:09,290
the execution of the contract and quote,
before you can sue for restitution,

88
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,760
you must have already given back
anything you got from the contract here.

89
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,440
There was no evidence that Bernstein
and his fellow plaintiffs had done so in

90
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:22,370
part because their shares in the
partnership are already worthless when the

91
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,361
breach occurred.

92
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:27,530
And so giving back their partnership
interest would have been meaningless,

93
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:32,780
but it's even more problematic for the
plaintiff's claim that there doesn't seem

94
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:34,490
to have been unjust enrichment.

95
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,880
Instead of the defendant's suffered a
great loss of their own about $3 million.

96
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,200
Even if each additional investor conferred
a marginal benefit to the defendant's

97
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:49,640
putting the defendant's back in their ex
ante position would require giving them,

98
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,790
giving them money,
not taking it away from the defendants.

99
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:58,010
Restitution isn't really meant for so
called losing contracts like this one

100
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,250
where all the parties ended up worse
off so nobody has the has gains here for

101
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:08,120
restitution to claw back.
Stepping back,

102
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,270
we can see how this decision helps teach
us about the shifting burdens in the

103
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,190
election of remedies at common law,

104
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,960
the plaintiff initially gets to choose
among any of the three classic measures

105
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,970
for damages,
expectation,

106
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:27,920
reliance or restitution and the plaintiff
has the burden of proving the amount

107
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,780
of the elected damage measure.

108
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,840
If the plaintiff chooses reliance or
restitution and meets her burden approving

109
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:35,780
these damages,

110
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:41,140
the burden then shifts to the defendant
to show that expectation damages would

111
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:42,344
be smaller.

112
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,110
A defendant who shows that expectation
damages would be smaller than reliance

113
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,330
is.
It is a is.

114
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:54,800
It's fairly well established that that
defendant will be able to reduce the

115
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:57,140
damages down to the expectation amount.

116
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,630
This case shows a similar effect with
regard to restitution because the same

117
00:08:02,631 --> 00:08:07,631
losses that reduced the expectation
measures effectively down to zero are the

118
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:10,940
same. The losses that reduced
the restitution measure.

119
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:16,390
But you should also know that restitution
is decidedly more of an equitable

120
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:21,521
remedy and many courts are much less
clear than justice Peters in deciding what

121
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:24,530
justice requires.

122
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,880
So here's the quiz.

123
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:34,390
A homeowner hires a Gardner to landscape
her front and back yards for $25,000

124
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:41,020
the homeowner breaches when the Gardiner
is finished with the front yard,

125
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,980
assume it costs the
gardener $8,000 to do that.

126
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,600
The front yard that the market price
for the completed work on the front yard

127
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:55,601
was $10,000 and it increased the home's
value by $12,000 the whole job would

128
00:08:58,141 --> 00:08:58,730
have costs.

129
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,730
The gardener $16,000 match the dollar
values in the left hand column to the

130
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:11,241
types of damages that the gardener might
get under these different theories of

131
00:09:11,671 --> 00:09:14,820
damages.
Well,

132
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:18,210
the $8,000 figure is for reliance damage.

133
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,100
This is how much worse off the Gardiner
is for having entered into the contract.

134
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:27,570
He already spent $8,000,
uh, in doing the front yard.

135
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,290
The $10,000 figure is for the first type
of restitution from section three 71 a

136
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:40,170
in which the plaintiff gets back the
market price of the services the defendant

137
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:41,004
received.

138
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:46,550
The $12,000 figure is for the second type
of restitution from section three 71 B

139
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,660
in which the plaintiff gets back the
value that those services provided to the

140
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:57,540
defendant.
Their effect on the property's value here,

141
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,990
this is the increase in value of the home.
Finally,

142
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,280
the $17,000 figure is
for expectation damages.

143
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,130
This is the full $25,000.

144
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:13,280
The homeowner was supposed to pay the
Gardner minus the $8,000 that the gardener

145
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:17,240
Sade by not landscaping the backyard.

146
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,870
We have seen that restitution damages
seek to take back the unjust enrichment of

147
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:28,680
the defendants by putting them back in
the position they were in before they

148
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:29,730
entered the contract.

149
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,130
It does this by forcing them to pay back
the value of what they received from

150
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:39,360
the contract. Unfortunately, in
situations like the one in Bernstein,

151
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:43,050
this means that we're defendants
lost money due to the contract.

152
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,260
Plaintiffs cannot recover any restitution.
