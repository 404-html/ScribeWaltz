1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,820
In today's lesson,
we will learn more about a promises,

2
00:00:05,821 --> 00:00:10,821
right to suspend performance before a
promissory is breach by examining the case

3
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:16,911
of AMF versus Mcdonald's corporation
will take the opportunity to better

4
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:22,221
understand sections two six oh nine and
two six 10 of the uniform commercial

5
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:26,940
code, which concerns party's
right to adequate assurance,

6
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:30,960
a performance and cases of
anticipatory repudiation.

7
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,930
First,
let,

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,210
let's review the two relevant sections
of the UCC two six oh nine states that if

9
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:44,310
a promise he has reasonable grounds
for insecurity. In other words,

10
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,580
if it has reasonable doubts that the
other party will will perform her promise,

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,540
the promise see can demand
adequate assurance of performance.

12
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,410
This request must be made
in writing the promise.

13
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,420
See if commercially reasonable may
suspend her own performance until she

14
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:08,100
receives adequate assurance and if
the promise or doesn't give adequate

15
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:12,330
assurance within a reasonable
time not to exceed 30 days,

16
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,630
it's considered a repudiation of the
contract and the promise he can cancel.

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,600
UCC section two six 10 governs what
happens for a repudiation of the contract.

18
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,020
When one party repudiates the contract,

19
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,760
the aggrieved party can await performance
for a reasonable amount of time or

20
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:35,580
resort to any remedy for breach,

21
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,880
regardless of which option
the aggrieved party chooses.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,130
It can suspend its own performance.

23
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,890
Keep these two provisions in
mind as we explore this case.

24
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,800
So here are the facts of uh,
AMF versus Mcdonald's.

25
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,630
Mcdonald's, the defendant
appellee in this case paid AMF.

26
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,820
The plaintiff appellant some
$20,000 for a prototype,

27
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,970
a computerized cash register.

28
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,980
Mcdonald's installed the cash
register in it's elk grove store.

29
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,600
Four months later,
Mcdonald's ordered 16 more such registers.

30
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,830
Five months later,
Mcdonald's franchisees ordered seven more.

31
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,750
The first registered was to
be delivered in February,

32
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,320
1969 with the others delivered
during the first half of that year.

33
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,030
In February, 1969, the
registers never arrived in AMF.

34
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,160
Moved the delivery's back to July,
1969 on top of this,

35
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,030
the first test unit didn't
test satisfactorily.

36
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,561
At this point,

37
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:48,561
Mcdonald's was starting to
get concerned at a March 18th,

38
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,020
1969 meeting between AMF and Mcdonald's.

39
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,430
Mcdonald's requested that production
of the registers be stopped until the

40
00:02:56,431 --> 00:03:00,670
parties negotiated performance. And
reliability standards for the machines.

41
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,780
The parties were unable
to agree on the standards.

42
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,850
In April,

43
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:11,850
1969 the AMF prototype was removed
from the elks Grove Mcdonald's for poor

44
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:16,360
performance.
On July 29th,

45
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,360
1969 Mcdonald's canceled AMF then
sued for wrongful cancellation,

46
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:22,690
McDonald's,

47
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,690
Sudei IMF to recover the purchase
price of $20,385 the cases were tried

48
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:34,000
together. The trial court held
for the defendant. In both cases,

49
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:38,110
AMF then appealed and the
instant court affirmed.

50
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,360
The question is,

51
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:45,450
did McDonald's rightfully terminate the
contract per se pursuant to UCC sections

52
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,980
two six oh nine and two six
10 the court held that yes,

53
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,620
Mcdonald's was right to
terminate the contract,

54
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,170
but it took several steps to get there.

55
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,970
Let's go through the court's rationale
by looking at each step of the analysis.

56
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,400
Let's start with UCC.

57
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:08,401
Section two six oh nine the court found
that Mcdonald's clearly had reasonable

58
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:14,311
grounds for insecurity in titling it to
demand adequate assurance of performance

59
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,040
under two six oh nine in other words,

60
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:23,041
Mcdonald's had reason to
believe AMF wasn't going to
perform what conduct should

61
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:27,280
constitute reasonable
grounds for insecurity.

62
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,250
This is a bit of an open ended question,

63
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,260
but in addition to the failure to
deliver on an individual installment,

64
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,360
a merchants in solvency or even rumors
of bankruptcy might be sufficient,

65
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:46,650
but what about the UCC section two
six o' nine's requirement of a written

66
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:47,614
demand?

67
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,330
You'll recall that Mcdonald's never
issued a written demand for assurance of

68
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:54,370
performance for this.

69
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,380
The court excuses Mcdonald's from the
requirement of a written demand by noting

70
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:04,381
that the UCC is to be liberally construed
and declaring that Mcdonald's requests

71
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:09,751
for further negotiation led to a quote
of clear understanding that Mcdonald's

72
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:15,040
had suspended performance until it
should receive adequate assurance of do

73
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,190
performance from AMF unquote.

74
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,060
Mcdonald's is clearly sophisticated
enough to read the UCC,

75
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,330
so why does the court
have the power to waive?

76
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:30,331
The UCC is writing requirement by what
right does this activist judge contravene

77
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:33,250
legislative supremacy?

78
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,760
This decision is not a conventional
application of UCC is two six oh nine

79
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:44,170
explicit requirement that the
the man be in writing. Moreover,

80
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,220
there was nothing in the opinion that
indicates there was even a formal oral

81
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:49,600
demand.
Instead,

82
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:54,601
the court applied to 609 to the parties
routine negotiation behavior and gave it

83
00:05:55,391 --> 00:06:00,391
legal consequence to 609 is already
a section that is replete with fuzzy

84
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:04,570
standards.
What are ground when,

85
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,450
when our grounds for
insecurity reasonable.

86
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,740
What is uh,
an assurance that is adequate?

87
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,000
When is suspending performance
commercially reasonable?

88
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,650
When his failure to provide adequate
assurance, not within a reasonable time.

89
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,110
The requirement of a demand in
writing was one of the few rural like

90
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:32,030
requirements and this case dare
to fuzz up this element as well.

91
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,620
On the other hand,

92
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:38,090
a realist might claim that this is
a victory of substance over form,

93
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,020
especially where the lack
of form was not prejudicial.

94
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:48,310
The court then concluded that AMF never
provided the assurance that had been

95
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:54,611
demanded and this failure amounted to
a repudiation under two six oh nine sub

96
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,340
paragraph four.
Thus,

97
00:06:58,341 --> 00:07:03,050
Mcdonald's rightfully canceled
pursuant to two six 10.

98
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,280
Uh,
sub paragraph B ams to behavior.

99
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:11,360
In this case it was clear it never
gave assurance it was going to perform,

100
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,830
but what kind of conduct should
constitute adequate assurance?

101
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,450
Mere words might at times be adequate,
but in other cases,

102
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,480
adequate assurance might also require
additional forms of consideration from the

103
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:30,140
promise or such as a bond
or a letter of credit.

104
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,540
Many contractors would be surprised to
learn that by promising they were taking

105
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:40,541
on an obligation to provide adequate
assurance if reasonable insecurity arises

106
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:46,090
much less that the adequate adequate
assurance might include taking substantive

107
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:50,090
action to assure the primacy
of your ability to perform.

108
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,080
Okay.

109
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,140
What was the last step
of the court's analysis?

110
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,890
The answer is UCC section two seven 11.

111
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:04,891
The sub paragraph one that section lays
out the buyer's remedies when the seller

112
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,500
repudiates the contract,

113
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,710
which includes canceling the contract.

114
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:12,540
Okay.

115
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,500
Demanding adequate assurance
can be a risky strategy. Uh,

116
00:08:16,501 --> 00:08:18,180
promises right to demand.

117
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:23,181
Adequate assurance at first seems
to importantly enhance the promises.

118
00:08:23,221 --> 00:08:28,221
Defensive right to assure the
promise doors performance after all,

119
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:33,410
two six oh nine allows promises to suspend
their own performance even before a

120
00:08:34,171 --> 00:08:39,000
promise or breaches or
repudiates the contract.

121
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:44,001
And it allows a promise see to force
the promise or into anticipatorily

122
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:48,690
repudiating their promises if they
can't give an adequate assurance.

123
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,060
But the right to demand adequate
assurance carries considerable risk.

124
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,080
The privacy,

125
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,080
who wants to suspend their own performance
under UCC section two six oh nine

126
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,880
Mustang have reasonable grounds for
insecurity and they must make a demand in

127
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:07,620
writing,
uh,

128
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,700
demanding adequate assurance and they
must show that they have not received an

129
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,140
adequate assurance from the promise or
if a promissory suspends performance.

130
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:23,280
And of course subsequently finds that one
of these requirements was not present,

131
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:29,030
the promises attempted defensive action
will constitute a breach of contract by

132
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:30,690
the promise see herself.

133
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:35,070
What starts off as a legitimate concern
about whether the other side will

134
00:09:35,071 --> 00:09:35,904
perform,

135
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:40,710
can ultimately become a finding that
the promise see herself breached by

136
00:09:40,711 --> 00:09:45,330
mistakenly exercising her two
six oh nine defensive rights.

137
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,400
In other words,

138
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:52,580
suspending performance or treating a
contract as repudiated for failure to give

139
00:09:52,711 --> 00:09:57,690
adequate assurance might backfire on
the promise. See, making the demand,

140
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:03,870
maybe the fuzzy likes standards of two
six oh nine are a feature and not a bug

141
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,630
of this section.

142
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:12,230
The possibility that either side might
end up being held liable after a promise.

143
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:13,650
He invokes the,

144
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:18,970
the section might help drive both
parties to negotiate a compromise and it

145
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:24,201
dampens the likelihood that promises
would overuse the two six oh nine option,

146
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,840
the right to demand adequate
assurance also exists in common law.

147
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,590
Remember that the UCC only
applies to a sale of goods.

148
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:39,950
So we care about the common law rule
for service contracts and non good

149
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,693
contracting.

150
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,760
Section two 51 of the second
restatement purports, uh,

151
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,070
to state the common law
rule on adequate assurance.

152
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,970
Though it isn't not followed by
all the states. For instance,

153
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:58,920
New York has not embraced the adequate
assurance doctor and outside of the UCC

154
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,900
article two, but sometimes
we'll apply it to non UCC cases.

155
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,040
For instance, in One New York case
about an electricity contract,

156
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,660
the court was asked whether a party has
the right to demand adequate assurance

157
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,860
of future performance in a
contract not governed by the UCC.

158
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:22,490
That New York court answered the question
in the affirmative by extending UCC

159
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:28,200
two six oh nine two the contract by
analogy concluding that the sale of

160
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:33,201
electricity was sufficiently similar to
a sale of goods and that parties to a

161
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,700
longterm commercial contract,

162
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,710
which is complex and not
reasonably susceptible of
all securities features being

163
00:11:40,711 --> 00:11:45,360
anticipated bargain for and incorporate
it into the original contract.

164
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,630
As a law student at Yale,

165
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:53,690
I used section two 51 in a lawsuit
against Gel itself during a disruptive 10

166
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:57,610
week strike in the fall semester.

167
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,910
I helped organize a group of students to
place their spring semester tuition in

168
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:08,020
escrow,
suspending their performance,

169
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:13,110
their a promise of pain spring semester
tuition after sending the university a

170
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:19,801
letter in writing saying that
we had reasonable grounds
for insecurity about the

171
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:23,830
university's ability to perform its
promises in the spring semester.

172
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,840
The right to suspend your performance
when you have reasonable grounds for

173
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:32,680
insecurity has a hidden
gem of contract law.

174
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,380
In summary,

175
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,560
let's review the steps in the UCC that
the court used to reach the final result.

176
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:46,830
First it determined under two six oh
nine one that Mcdonald's had reasonable

177
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:51,760
grounds for insecurity to make a demand
of adequate assurance of performance.

178
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:52,661
Second,

179
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:57,661
it determined that Mcdonald's is excused
from two six o' nine's requirement of a

180
00:12:57,731 --> 00:12:59,980
written demand.
Third,

181
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:04,690
it determined that AMF failed to
provide assurance, adequate assurance,

182
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:09,870
and that it's behavior
amounted to repudiation under
two six oh nine four under

183
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:16,441
two six 10 be repudiation by the seller
in titles to the buyer to remedies.

184
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,260
And finally,

185
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:25,350
UCC section two seven 11 one shows that
one of such remedies available to the

186
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:29,770
buyer is cancellation of the contract.

187
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,770
Among everything we learned today,

188
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,800
the key takeaway from this case is that
non written demand for assurance can

189
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:41,830
satisfy UCC.
Section two six oh nine.
