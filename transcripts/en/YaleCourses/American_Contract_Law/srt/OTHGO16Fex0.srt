00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,730
Today we continue our discussion of
when contracts are unenforceable because

2
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:07,410
they violate public policy.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,950
We will look at it in 1987 Wisconsin
case called watt versus Watt,

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,720
where the court considered whether an
unmarried couples cohabitation agreement

5
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:23,190
is enforceable in what the watt,
the plaintiffs.

6
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:27,090
Sue Ann lived for 12 years
with defendant James.

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,340
The couple held themselves out to the
public as husband and wife and had two

8
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:37,080
children together but never actually
married. When the couple split up,

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,310
plaintiff sued under several theories
for a share of their property,

10
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:46,311
including the theory that she and the
defendant had a contract to equally share

11
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:50,310
all of the property accumulated
during their relationship.

12
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,800
The trial court dismissed the complaint
and the instant court reversed and

13
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:56,634
remanded.

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,430
The central issue is a contract
between the parties to share property

15
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,540
accumulated during their relationship
void as against public policy.

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,150
The Supreme Court of Wisconsin held that
enforcing such a contract would not be

17
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:13,860
void as against public policy.

18
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,610
The court began by observing
that non-marital cohabitation
does not render every

19
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:23,130
agreement between the
co-habiting parties illegal,

20
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,780
but the court also acknowledged that
a contract will not be enforced.

21
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:29,490
If it violates public policy.

22
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,060
Thus the defendant argued among other
things that the party's relationship was

23
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:41,091
immoral and illegal and
that any recognition of a
contract between the parties

24
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:45,900
or plaintiff's claim for a share of
the property accumulated during the

25
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:50,901
cohabitation contravenes public policy
contracts quote for which the soul

26
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:58,431
couldn't consideration is sexual
relations unquote are unenforceable,

27
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,330
but according to the court,

28
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,960
a bargain between two people is not
illegal merely because there is an illicit

29
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:07,890
relationship between the two.

30
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,870
So long as the bargain is independent
of the illicit relationship and the

31
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:16,880
illicit relationship does not
constitute any part of the concern.

32
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,330
Consideration bargained for and
is not a condition of the bargain.

33
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:22,861
Further,

34
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:27,300
the court recognized that a refusal to
enforce a contract between the parties

35
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,640
because their relationship
involved immoral or illegal
sexual activity would be

36
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:37,641
inequitable and arbitrary in that it
would leave one party no less guilty than

37
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:42,951
the other with a greater
share of accumulated wealth
merely because he or she

38
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:46,290
held it prior to trial.
Hence,

39
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:50,520
the court concluded that the plaintiff
pleaded sufficient facts necessary to

40
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:55,521
state a claim even though the
parties being in Pari delicto.

41
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,210
With regard to an uh,

42
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,750
tempted bribe was sufficient to make a
court refused to give any order of relief

43
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:08,380
in sign are in the sign.
Our case in Perry here,

44
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:13,381
the parties being in Perry delicto with
regard to illicit sexual relationship

45
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:19,290
was not at least by 1987 sufficient to
categorically keep a court from giving

46
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:25,480
relief. So what are the elements
of an unjust enrichment claim?

47
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,440
The plaintiff also asserted
an unjust enrichment claim.

48
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:34,360
We talked about unjust enrichment in an
earlier module when we looked at a case

49
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:36,190
called daily versus West.

50
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,050
What are the elements of an
unjust enrichment claim? Well,

51
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:42,160
in Bailey v West,

52
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:47,020
we saw that three conditions must be
satisfied for unjust enrichment. One,

53
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:51,820
there must be a benefit conferred upon
the defendant to the defendant must

54
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,430
appreciate the benefit.
And three,

55
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:58,300
it would be an equitable for the defendant
to retain the benefit without making

56
00:03:58,301 --> 00:03:59,650
a payment to the plaintiff.

57
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,590
The court in watts versus watts considered
those same three conditions and held

58
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:10,360
that unmarried cohabitants may raise
claims based upon unjust enrichment

59
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,560
following the termination of their
relationship where one of the parties

60
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:19,090
attempts to retain an unreasonable amount
of the property acquired through the

61
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:21,610
efforts of both.
In other words,

62
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,540
even if the plaintiffs contract
claim failed on remand,

63
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,960
if she was able to satisfy the
elements of unjust enrichment,

64
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,730
she could still win the case.

65
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,900
Section one 78 subparagraph one of the
restatement of contracts provides that

66
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:38,380
quote,

67
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,090
a promise or other term of an agreement
is unenforceable on grounds of public

68
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:43,924
policy.

69
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,550
If legislation provides that it is
unenforceable or the interest in its

70
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:53,170
enforcement is clearly outweighed in
the circumstances by a public policy

71
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:58,030
against the enforcement of such
terms. Thus, if a constitution,

72
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:58,930
statute,

73
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,000
administrative regulation or local
ordinance preempts the enforceability

74
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:06,160
question by clear language,

75
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,730
the court's job is to implement
that legislative decision,

76
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,940
but if there's no clear
legislative mandate,

77
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,940
the promise or term is unenforceable.

78
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,060
If the interest in its enforcement is
clearly outweighed in the circumstances by

79
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:24,220
a public policy against the
enforcement of such terms.

80
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,450
This mirror is the approach the
court followed in watts versus watts.

81
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,130
The court first considered whether the
Wisconsin Family Code restricted the

82
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:38,131
court's resolution of property disputes
between cohabiting couples and it found

83
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,130
that it did not.

84
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,880
The court then enunciated a balancing
standard when it said quote a declaration

85
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:49,780
that the contract is against public policy
should be made to only after careful

86
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:54,130
balancing in the light of
all the circumstances of
the interest in enforcing a

87
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:57,100
particular promise
against the policy against

88
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,080
in its opinion,

89
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:05,081
the Wisconsin court is highly critical
of the Illinois Supreme Court's 1979

90
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,550
opinion and Hewitt versus Hewitt.

91
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,010
There the court held that quote allowing
such a contract claim would weaken the

92
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:18,011
sanctity of marriage unquote and violate
the policy of the Illinois Marriage and

93
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:19,940
Dissolution Act.

94
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,240
The court also emphasized legal
process stating that there are quote,

95
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,780
major public policy questions involved
in determining whether under what

96
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:34,490
circumstances and to what extent it's
desirable to cord some type of legal

97
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:38,270
status to claims arising from
cohabitation relationships.

98
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,040
The plaintiff argued that because of
changing social norms and attitude,

99
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,240
the court should abandon the traditional
rule that cohabitation agreements are

100
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:50,180
illegal,
but the Hewitt court responded,

101
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:55,210
quote the question whether change is
needed in the law governing the rights of

102
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:58,490
parties in this delicate area of marriage.

103
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:03,491
Like relationships involves evaluations
of sociological data and alternatives.

104
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:09,581
We believe best suited to the superior
investigative and fact finding facilities

105
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:14,450
of the legislative branch unquote.
In other words,

106
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:19,750
the court was reluctant to change the
law because of alleged changes in social

107
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:20,594
attitudes.

108
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,720
The court felt that legislators are
better position to verify broad social

109
00:07:26,421 --> 00:07:29,030
changes and adjust the law accordingly.

110
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:34,450
So besides thinking about whether a
cohabitation promise or some other rights

111
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:36,050
should be enforced,

112
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:41,270
the legal system also has to decide which
part of government gets to decide the

113
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:42,104
question.

114
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,330
Similar questions arose during the same
sex marriage debates where the right to

115
00:07:47,331 --> 00:07:52,220
marry with sometimes extended by courts
and sometimes by state legislatures

116
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,330
before the US Supreme Court mandated
that all states extend the right

117
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,810
changed social attitudes toward marriage
can be seen in how the treatment of

118
00:08:02,811 --> 00:08:07,811
premarital premarital agreements has
changed until the mid 1970s most American

119
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:14,900
courts held that premarital agreements
and other contracts made quote in

120
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:19,901
contemplation of divorce unquote were
unenforceable as against public policy.

121
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:25,510
Section one 90 sub paragraph two of
the second restatement of contracts

122
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:31,330
continues to declare that a promise that
tends unreasonably to encourage divorce

123
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:35,630
or separation is unenforceable
on grounds of public policy.

124
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,600
The vast majority of courts,
however,

125
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,560
now treat premarital
agreements as enforceable,

126
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,480
at least in some circumstances.
Let's recap. Today.

127
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:52,130
We talked about how a contract may be
unenforceable on grounds of public policy

128
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:57,370
if the interest in enforcement is clearly
outweighed in the circumstances by a

129
00:08:57,421 --> 00:09:00,720
public policy against the
enforcement of such terms.

130
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:06,170
We looked at a case that
held that cohabitation
agreements whereby an unmarried

131
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:11,751
couple allegedly agreed to share their
accumulated assets was not unenforceable

132
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,670
as against public policy.
