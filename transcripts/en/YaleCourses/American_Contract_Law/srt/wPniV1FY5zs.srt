1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,510
Today we're going to examine would
the Lucy Lady Duff Gordon from this

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,130
incredibly famous case,

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,160
we will discuss implied promises and the
use of those promises as consideration

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,270
in the process. We'll also talk
about exclusive dealing contracts.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,200
Lucy Lady Duff Gordon born Lucy Cristiana
Sutherland was a famous and innovative

6
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:31,770
British fashion designer
whose company Lucille Limited,

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,240
served an impressive array
of famous clients worldwide.

8
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,510
And Otis F would was a prominent New
York advertising agent by the way.

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,190
Uh, Lucy Lady Duff Gordon.
She was also rather notorious.

10
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:52,191
She's sailed on the titanic and
she and her husband Sir Cosmo,

11
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,990
were both saved by a lifeboat. Think of
her as kind of a car dash in a per day.

12
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,550
So in,
in 1915 wood and lady death,

13
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:07,551
Gordon signed a year long renewable
contract whereby would was given the

14
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:13,281
exclusive right to place lady
Duff Gordon's endorsement
on other designs and the

15
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:19,701
exclusive right to sell lady Duff Gordon's
own designs or licensed others to do

16
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:24,780
so. These rights, we're all subject
to a lady Duff Gordon's approval.

17
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,920
The contract provided that the
two parties would split equally.

18
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:32,520
All profits derive from this agreement.
However,

19
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:37,550
Lady Deaf Gordon then began listing
her products for sale in Sears Roebucks

20
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:42,690
catalog. And you can see one of
our advertisements right here

21
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:49,370
would allege that she did so without
informing them and withheld from him the

22
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:55,461
profits from the Sears Roebuck catalogs
and would then sued for his share of

23
00:01:56,371 --> 00:01:59,520
these profits.
So here's a quiz.

24
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,400
The plaintiff argued that lady death,

25
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:07,401
Gordon breached her contractual promise
to would have exclusive dealing of

26
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:12,630
exclusivity by endorsing products and
earning money there from without the

27
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:17,040
plaintiff's knowledge.
And from the recital facts you just heard.

28
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,340
What did would promise in return to the
plaintiff in exchange for this plaintiff

29
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:26,310
promise of exclusivity?
Well,

30
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,230
the agreement gave would the
exclusive right to do certain things,

31
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:36,231
to place deaf Gordon's endorsement on
other's designs and to market products and

32
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:38,550
to grant licenses and,

33
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,420
and prescribed woods conduct
when doing those things.

34
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,750
But it's not clear that the contractual
terms actually required woods to endorse

35
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:51,720
market or license anything.
It was just his option.

36
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:56,640
So it wasn't clear what he was promising
in exchange for lady Duff Gordon's

37
00:02:56,641 --> 00:02:58,200
promise of exclusivity.

38
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,250
That indeed was the basis of
Lady Duff Gordon's defense.

39
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,240
She argued that the party's agreement
did not constitute an enforceable

40
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:11,590
agreement because would did
not bind himself to anything.

41
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,750
The defendant argued, in other words,
that the contract lacked consideration.

42
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,420
The appellate division agreed reversing
a trial court judgment in favor of the

43
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:23,254
plaintiff.

44
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,500
Every promise on woods part that court
explained was dependent upon him actually

45
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:30,850
making endorsements,

46
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:36,090
Marketing Lady Duff Gordon's products or
granting licenses and quote nowhere in

47
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:41,020
the contract has he bound himself
to do any of these things.

48
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,390
The monumentally famous
judge Benjamin Cardozo,

49
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,480
who we already encountered
in Jacob and Young's v Kent,

50
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,810
wrote the opinion for the
New York Court of Appeals.

51
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,880
You get a sense from this opinion of his
ability to write memorable phrases such

52
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:02,560
as instinct with obligation
in this decision.

53
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:07,830
Cardoza seem to acknowledge that the
literal words of the party's agreement did

54
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:12,520
not convey any binding
obligation on woods part. Yet.

55
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:17,521
He asserted that the law has outgrown
its primitive stage of formalism when the

56
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:21,250
precise word was sovereigns Talus man,

57
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,360
and every slip fatal.
Even if a promise,

58
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,490
we're not explicit yet.

59
00:04:27,491 --> 00:04:32,491
The whole writing may be instinct with
an obligation in perfectly expressed.

60
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,300
Cardoza found this was the case in the
agreement between wood and Lady Duff

61
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,120
Gordon.

62
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,120
There was an imperfectly expressed
or implied promise by wood to quote,

63
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:50,581
use reasonable efforts to place the
defendant's endorsements and market her

64
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:51,514
design.

65
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,190
How did cars Cardozo discern
such an implied promise?

66
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,030
Well,

67
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:03,030
first the fact that the
right the defending granted
was exclusive combined with

68
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:08,560
the term of compensation set forth in
the agreement was extremely important.

69
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,930
Cardozo insisted quote,

70
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:15,370
we are not to suppose that one party
was to be placed in the mercy of another

71
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,380
unquote.
If Lady Death,

72
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:22,180
Gordon granted would the sole right to
endorse products and market her designs

73
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,270
and would had no obligation
to do anything in return.

74
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:30,190
Lady Duff Gordon could drive no profit
if would chose not to exercise his right.

75
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,290
Rather Cardozo argued,

76
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:37,530
the acceptance of an exclusive deal
agency was an assumption of its duties,

77
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,710
a duty to make reasonable efforts.
Additionally,

78
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:46,890
the other terms of the contract
illuminates the intention
of the parties and the

79
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:51,880
intention supported a conclusion that the
plaintiff also had an obligation under

80
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:52,714
the agreement.

81
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,500
Those terms included recognition that
woods was in the business of placing

82
00:05:57,501 --> 00:05:59,360
endorsements for quote.

83
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:03,740
The implication is that the plaintiff's
business organization will be used for

84
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:08,741
the purpose of for which it is adapted
unquote providing a monthly account of

85
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:13,160
all the money would received
and taking out all patents,

86
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:17,780
copyrights and trademarks as were
necessary to protect the rights and goods.

87
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:22,990
The agreement affected the implied
promise to use reasonable efforts to bring

88
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:26,450
profits and revenues into existence,

89
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:31,660
constituted consideration that created
an enforceable agreement and allowed the

90
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:34,940
plaintiff to recover.
For Lady Duff Gordon's breach.

91
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,990
The holding of this case is essentially
been codified as a default rule for

92
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:44,690
exclusive dealing contracts and
the uniform commercial code.

93
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:50,410
The UCC section two three Oh six two
reads a lawful agreement by either the

94
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:55,010
seller or the buyer for exclusive dealing.

95
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:00,100
The kind of goods concerned imposes
unless otherwise agreed and obligation by

96
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:06,551
the seller to use best efforts to supply
the goods and by the buyer to use best

97
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:08,360
efforts to promote their sale.

98
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,230
And the official comment
to this section says,

99
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,560
subsection two on exclusive dealing makes
explicit the commercial rule embodied

100
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:22,910
in this act under which parties to such
contracts are held to have impliedly

101
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:28,150
even when not expressly bound themselves
to use reasonable diligence as well as

102
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:31,130
good faith in their
performance of the contract.

103
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,470
The exclusive agent is required,

104
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:38,471
although no expressed commitment has been
made to use reasonable efforts and due

105
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:42,650
diligence in the expansion of the
market or the promotion of the product.

106
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,960
We've touched upon unconscionability
earlier in the course when we discussed

107
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:50,120
Williams versus Walker Thomas Furniture,

108
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:55,460
unconscionable contracts involved terms
that are unreasonably favorable to one

109
00:07:55,461 --> 00:07:57,680
party.
In that sense,

110
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:02,120
there is a similarity between them
and the sea and this contract,

111
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,500
if we read it literally a between
woods and Lady Duff Gordon.

112
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,070
But note the important difference.
Unconscionable contracts,

113
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:15,071
the one sided pre present
mutual obligations and courts
declined to enforce them

114
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:20,840
because they were forged through an unfair
procedure that led to unfair results

115
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,950
by contract.
The one sided contract at issue here.

116
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,250
In this case of Lady Duff Gordon,
uh,

117
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,260
appeared to lack mutuality,

118
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:35,470
but the court rendered the contract
less one sided by reading into it and

119
00:08:36,111 --> 00:08:38,720
implied obligation of reasonable effort.

120
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,160
Cardozo apparently felt the,

121
00:08:41,161 --> 00:08:45,560
the one sidedness was not a
product of procedural defect,

122
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,930
but merely an imperfect expression
of the actual exchange promises.

123
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,500
Reading these two different kinds of cases
together teaches that courts have two

124
00:08:57,241 --> 00:09:01,450
starkly different ways of
responding to one sidedness, uh,

125
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:06,590
either by refusing to enforce
them or by making them more once,

126
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:11,720
uh, by making them less one
sided by finding implied, uh,

127
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:12,330
uh,

128
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:17,160
returned promises as consideration
as we've already mentioned,

129
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:20,760
Cardozo's opinion reversed the
decision of the appellate division,

130
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,740
which unanimously agreed.

131
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,690
It quote quite apparent that the defendant
gives everything and the plaintiff

132
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:32,691
nothing and there's a lack of mutuality
and the contract indeed Cardoza his own

133
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:35,640
court was split four.
Three.

134
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:41,010
Why can't parties too exclusive dealing
contract simply include good faith or

135
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:45,600
reasonable effort clauses into their
agreements if they want to have them,

136
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,510
uh,
clothed with consideration.

137
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,530
Wouldn't that obviate the
need for implied promises?

138
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:58,220
Did Cardozo in this decision and
the UCC choose the best default.
