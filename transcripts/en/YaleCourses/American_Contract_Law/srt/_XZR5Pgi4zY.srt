1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,590
Today we learn about the difference
between warranties and conditions.

2
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:09,591
Proceeded in a contract by examining the
case of in Ray Carter's claim decided

3
00:00:11,161 --> 00:00:16,161
by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
1957 Carter's claim touches on many

4
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:21,690
concepts at the heart of important
modern contracts such as the concept of

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,140
material adverse changes
for merger agreements,

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,210
a promise. He has two ways to
protect herself in a contract.

7
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,930
Warranty protection and
condition protection.

8
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,530
Nonperformance of a warranty gives
rise to breach of contract damages.

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,140
Non Occurrence of condition allows a
prophecy to suspend its own performance.

10
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,930
Failure of a condition of Ford's,

11
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:53,930
a defensive weapon and excuse but
does not give an offensive weapon.

12
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:57,390
A claim for breach of
contract phrase differently.

13
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,630
A condition protection allows the privacy
to get out of his or her own promises,

14
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,540
whereas a warranty protection allows
the primacy to actively sue for damages.

15
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,950
Some of just described a condition
proceeding as a shield but not as sword.

16
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,120
It gives rise to only a
defense and protection and
the ability to withhold your

17
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:23,121
own performance can at times provide
stronger protections than the ability to

18
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:26,670
sue for damages.
Defensive protections can work.

19
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:31,671
Forfeitures when the other side is already
relied and defense protections don't

20
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:35,340
require the hassle of going to
court and winning a judgment.

21
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,380
Plaintiff, the plaintiff,
the buyer and appellant, uh,

22
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:45,410
Lester l Carden entered into a 25
page written contract to purchase a

23
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:50,961
Pennsylvania Corporation and five of
its subsidiaries including the defendant

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
appellee Edwin Jay shuttle company about
$187,000 of the purchase price was put

25
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:04,521
in escrow to indemnify the plaintiff
buyer against liabilities specified in the

26
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:09,540
agreement as we studied before and
send tronics versus Gen income.

27
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:15,260
Asgrows involve and arrangement where
part of the purchase price is held by a

28
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:20,961
third party to compensate the buyer
with effectively a reduced price if the

29
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:25,260
seller's assets turn out to
be worth less than expected

30
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,030
in the contract listed under the heading
of conditions proceeded was a term

31
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,120
paragraph nine that said the financial
condition of the defendant company shall

32
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:41,460
be no less favorable
at the time of closing.

33
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,820
Then on June 30th of 1954 which was
probably when the book's closed at the end

34
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,670
of the last financial year.
As you know,

35
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:55,671
the closing date refers to when the
sale actually occurs with title to the

36
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:58,230
assets transferring to the new buyer.

37
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,000
The plaintiff claimed that the financial
condition was less favorable at closing

38
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:09,001
and refused and requested
approximately $70,000 from the escrow.

39
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,220
The parties submitted this to arbitration.

40
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:17,221
The arbitrator awarded
$3,182 to the plaintiff.

41
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,860
Plaintiffs appealed to the court of
common pleas was denied and the instinct

42
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:25,540
court affirmed.

43
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,880
The main issue is whether the financial
condition in this case was actually a

44
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:34,330
warranty such that plaintiff
is entitled to damages.

45
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:39,280
The court held the agreement was
carefully drafted and is clear that the

46
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:43,780
provision in question is not a
warranty but a condition proceeded.

47
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,273
As such,

48
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,660
plaintiff had the right to refuse to
purchase because of the failure of this

49
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:54,580
condition, but that option to refuse
had to be made by the closing date.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,500
By accepting seller's performance
and going ahead with the closing,

51
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,610
plaintiff waived its right
under the condition proceeding.

52
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,600
The court explain the result in terms
of the plain meaning of the contract.

53
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,381
In this case,

54
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:16,381
the contract had the classic structure
distinguishing between two clearly

55
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:19,360
demarcated sets of provisions.

56
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,680
On the one hand there were representations
and warranties and on the other hand

57
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,750
there were conditions. The structure
is found in most corporate contracts.

58
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,060
A Re a result explained in terms of
plain meaning is justified where the

59
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:38,230
agreement has been drafted with
particular clarity and the other party has

60
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:42,460
failed to introduce evidence that the
words used are reasonably susceptible to

61
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:47,110
another meaning the buyer waived the
express conditioned by electing to go

62
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:49,270
forward with the purchase
at the closing date.

63
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,560
The agreement also contained a provision
Paragraph 5g concerning value in the

64
00:04:56,741 --> 00:05:01,741
representation and warranty section in
which the seller represented that between

65
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:05,860
June 30th and September 17th,

66
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,860
1954 there had not been any change
in companies or its subsidiaries,

67
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:13,120
financial condition,
assets,

68
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:18,121
liability or businesses other than changes
in the ordinary course of business,

69
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,250
none of which has been materially adverse.

70
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,300
The buyer warranted that
this representation was true.

71
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,180
How was the scope of this warranty
different than the scope of the condition

72
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:33,730
concerning value?
Well,

73
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:39,030
the warranty or promise of value was
limited to changes in materially,

74
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,000
uh,

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
that were material adverse quote other
than in the ordinary course of business

76
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,193
unquote.

77
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:52,300
So reductions in value from the ordinary
course of business would not constitute

78
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:53,620
a breach of the warranty,

79
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,980
but would be a failure of the condition
that the financial condition of the

80
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:01,010
company shall be no less favorable.

81
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:06,080
Reductions in value from the ordinary
course of the business would accordingly

82
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:10,400
give the buyer an option not
to buy at the closing date,

83
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:15,790
but not the right to sue for breach of
warranty damages after the closing date,

84
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:20,510
however,
things change and the buyer,

85
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:25,370
if she chooses to close his left solely
with the offensive remedy of suing for

86
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:27,200
breach under the limited warranty,

87
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:33,250
why would the parties write a contract
giving the buyer broader defensive

88
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:38,300
protections than authentic protections?
Well,

89
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,730
the parties might have x,
uh,

90
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,880
expanded the scope of the warranty to
allow breach of contract actions for any

91
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:51,161
reduction in value or they might have
decreased the scope of the condition for

92
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:55,250
only reductions outside of the
ordinary course of business.

93
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,080
Either of these changes would have
rendered the offensive and defensive

94
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,440
protections congruent,

95
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,850
making them both conditions
and warranty protections.

96
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,120
The parties might have chosen.
However,

97
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:13,121
for asymmetric protections to constrain
various types of buyer and seller

98
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:14,270
opportunism,

99
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:19,870
the parties might have realized that it
was going to be hard to prove to a court

100
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:23,450
whether the company experienced
a reduction in value.

101
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,840
The contract give the gave the
buyers abroad right not to buy,

102
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,600
but only allows the
buyers to sue for damages.

103
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:37,790
If the seller does something outside
of the ordinary course of business that

104
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,170
hurts the firm value.

105
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:44,770
So if a seller starts liquidating the
equipment that's outside the ordinary

106
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:49,730
course of business and the buyer can
bring suit for a reduction in value from

107
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:51,980
that stripping of of equipment.

108
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:57,140
But the ta contract gives the seller
strong incentive incentives not to do

109
00:07:57,141 --> 00:08:01,490
anything outside the ordinary course
of business so as to limit the buyers

110
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,830
offensive rights instead,

111
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:08,831
the contract in effect says if the
company's overall financial condition has

112
00:08:08,871 --> 00:08:11,660
worsened,
then don't buy it if you don't want to.

113
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,100
But if you still want the company,
don't try to sue for damages.

114
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,520
This form of asymmetric protection
strikes a balance between two types of

115
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:26,030
opportunism. You don't want the seller
to run the company into the ground,

116
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,840
but you don't want to allow the buyer
to hold up the sale at the last minute.

117
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,610
Although this case is over 50 years old,

118
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,820
the warranty conditions strategy is still
employed to allegate risk between the

119
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:44,540
date of contract and the date
of the closing. In particular,

120
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:49,460
buyers and sellers are worried about
negative changes in the value of what's

121
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:53,420
being exchanged between the contract
date and before. The closing.

122
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:58,890
The warranty only changes in values
that do not come from ordinary course of

123
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:03,030
business.
Condition covers changes from any cause.

124
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,080
The contractual regulation of material
adverse changes at the heart of in Ray

125
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,320
Carter's claim,

126
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,960
it has become one of the most hotly
negotiated in and litigated questions of

127
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:16,800
merger law.

128
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,160
Most friendly merger agreements contain
material adverse change clauses.

129
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:27,590
These are called Mac clauses or sometimes
material adverse effect may clauses

130
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:34,250
which make the buyers duty to by
conditional on there not being a material

131
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:39,270
adverse change in the seller's
financial condition. In recent years,

132
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,300
merger agreements tend to include the
traditional standard Mac or may terms,

133
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:50,270
but also explicitly negotiated carve outs
that limit the buyer's ability to exit

134
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:56,010
the Mac and may provisions in gender
substantial litigation because it's hard

135
00:09:56,011 --> 00:10:01,011
for litigants to predict
whether a particular negative
event will be considered

136
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:05,370
after the fact by a court
as materially adverse.

137
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:11,450
Sometimes contractual provisions are
unclear whether they are creating promises

138
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:13,410
or conditions.

139
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,740
It's an interpretation issue where if
in doubt the common law's preferences to

140
00:10:18,991 --> 00:10:22,860
interpret ambiguous
provisions merely as promises,

141
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,720
giving the promise, see a,
uh, an affirmative offensive,

142
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:29,370
right to sue for damages,

143
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,730
but not the defensive right to
withhold your own performance.

144
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:38,180
This is because of failure of a provision
can have a condition of a condition

145
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:43,371
can produce inequitable forfeitures where
one side refuses to perform after the

146
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:47,340
other side has substantially relied.
For example,

147
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,760
some contracts might include a provision
saying buyer shall notify seller of the

148
00:10:53,701 --> 00:10:57,180
place of delivery two weeks in
advance of the ship and date.

149
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,870
Is this provision a buyer promise giving
rise to a breach of contract action if

150
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:08,010
the notice is late or is it a condition
relieving seller of the duty to ship if

151
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:12,720
the buyer is a second late or is it
both the promise and it condition?

152
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,731
In one case,

153
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:19,731
a buyer who had contracted to buy rice
failed by 12 hours to give seller two

154
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:26,001
weeks notice because of the
price of rice was rising,

155
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:29,670
the seller treated the provision as
a condition and refuse to perform.

156
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:35,130
Courts will tend to treat
ambiguous provisions as a
promise and give the seller

157
00:11:35,131 --> 00:11:39,720
instead of breach of contract remedy
and not as a condition unless the

158
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:44,610
contractual provision is more
clearly conditional and its language.

159
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,920
This preference for interpretation
in favor of promises. However,

160
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:54,921
it does not apply to contracts quote
of a type under which only the Aba Gore

161
00:11:56,361 --> 00:12:01,180
generally undertakes duties unquote.
That's a quote from the restatement.

162
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:06,181
Second Section two 27 insurance
is regarded as a contract
of this type where the

163
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:13,291
usual interpretation is that the insured
has no enforceable duty to pay premiums

164
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,780
rather if the,

165
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:22,020
the risk the insurer if the
risk insured against occurs,

166
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,420
the insurance company's duty to pay under
the policy is merely conditioned upon

167
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:30,140
the,
uh,

168
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:35,190
earlier payment of premiums unless special
arrangements with third parties have

169
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:38,200
been made.
However,

170
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,500
the insured's failure to pay a premium
is a failure of a condition rather than a

171
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:47,590
breach of contract phrase differently.

172
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:52,950
The insured's promise to pay the premium
is treated as a condition precedent to

173
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:56,320
the insurer's duty to provide coverage.

174
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,680
Insurance is an odd kind of contract
where the insurers right to a premium is

175
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:08,041
solely protected by the defensive right
of the insurer to withhold performance

176
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,440
with no insurer offensive,

177
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:14,950
right to sue for a buyer's breach.

178
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:19,300
Stepping back,
we can see that promises,

179
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:24,330
promises right to a promise or his
performance is protected and starkly

180
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:27,380
different ways and insurers,

181
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,110
right to insurance premiums that
protected solely by defensive writes.

182
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:37,650
The buyers right in Carter was protected
before closing with larger defensive

183
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:42,310
rights than offensive rights.
But in Jacob and young versus Ken,

184
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,960
we learned that the substantial
performance rule protects
the buyer's right to

185
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:51,850
Redding price with broader offensive
rights than defensive rights.

186
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,770
Because if you remember,
in that case,

187
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:56,710
the buyer could sue offensively
for breach of promise,

188
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:01,900
but was not allowed to withhold
her own performance. In summary,

189
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:06,400
there are two ways for a promise
see to be protected in a contract.

190
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,700
Warranty protection gives rise to damages
and condition protection gives rise,

191
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:17,320
gives rise to a defense or protection.
The right to stop one zone performance.

192
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:21,730
In determining whether an event is
a warranty or condition proceedings,

193
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:26,140
courts will usually rely on the
plain meaning of the contract.

194
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,210
If the agreement is ambiguous,

195
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:33,630
the interpretation favors promises
instead of conditions in the interest of

196
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:35,200
avoiding forfeiture.
