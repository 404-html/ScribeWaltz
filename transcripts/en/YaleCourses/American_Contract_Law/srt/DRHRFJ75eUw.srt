1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,160
Our next case.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,190
Raffles v Wiggle House is famous and
memorable just about everyone who's ever

3
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:12,030
taken a common law contracts
class in the United States.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,500
Will remember the case about
the two ships named pure lists,

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,090
whose names, if you think about
it, certainly weren't accurate.

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,710
The case comes from Britain in 1864
during the height of the British Raj in

7
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:34,200
India and the industrial
revolution in Britain.

8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,890
The textile mills in northern England
needed a constant supply of raw materials.

9
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:45,771
And in 19 and an 1864 the American civil
war had shut down cotton exports from

10
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:49,440
the American south.

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,920
And so this case deals with a contract
for the sale of cotton shipped from

12
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:56,790
Bombay in India.

13
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,450
The defendant will call house agreed
to buy 125 bales of cotton from the

14
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:08,481
plaintiff raffles when it arrived in
Liverpool on the ship name to peerless.

15
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,450
Unfortunately there were two different
ships named peerless plying the route

16
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:23,481
between industrial Liverpool
and the capital of Britain's
largest largest colony

17
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,590
Winkle house.

18
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:30,591
Thought that they had agreed the cotton
would arrive on the peerless that sailed

19
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:32,820
from Bombay in October.

20
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,350
While Raffles thought they had agreed
on the pure lists that had sailed in

21
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:38,184
December.

22
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,360
You can see the October
peerless in this picture.

23
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,080
When the cotton actually arrived on the
December peerless wiggle house refused

24
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,940
to buy the cotton and so raffle sued.

25
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,490
It's likely that the underlying reason
for the dispute is that the two parties

26
00:01:56,491 --> 00:02:01,200
were speculating on the price of cotton
and that the price of cotton increased

27
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:04,380
over the months in question.
Therefore,

28
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:09,210
the parties were very concerned about
when the ship carrying the cotton would

29
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:13,080
depart at the time has in
the merchant of Venice,

30
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,060
there could be no guarantee of exactly
when or even whether ships traveling

31
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:20,340
across the seas would arrive.

32
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,920
This opinion is an English case and
so it looks a bit different from the

33
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:29,670
American decisions we've read
from around the same time period.

34
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,470
You'll notice that reporters,

35
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:36,510
that the reporters summary or report of
the case begins with the pleadings of

36
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:41,190
each of the parties followed by a summary
of the arguments that each barrister

37
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:44,160
made with interjections by the judges.

38
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,340
The actual decision by the court or to
use the Latin phrase per curiam comes at

39
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:53,580
the very end and just says
that the defendants won.

40
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,590
The court was faced with the question
of whether there was a contract at all

41
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,570
given that the two parties had
had different understandings
of which ship would

42
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:08,770
carry the cotton.
The court said there was not a contract.

43
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,820
The key concept in the case is typically
called the meeting of the minds in

44
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,480
American contract law.

45
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,810
This case and British law generally
call it consensus odd item,

46
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,690
which is Latin for
agreement on the same thing.

47
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,920
The idea is that in order for
two parties to form a contract,

48
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,400
they must be thinking the same thing.
When they make it,

49
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,410
their minds must meet.

50
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,600
Otherwise there hasn't really been an
agreement and so there's nothing for the

51
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:42,910
law to enforce.
In this case,

52
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:47,830
the two parties misunderstood each other
because of the ambiguity of the term.

53
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,720
Peerless note that the misunderstanding
is different from mistake,

54
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,700
which we'll discuss later in the course.

55
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,410
Misunderstanding means that there was
never a contract in the first place

56
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:00,910
because there was no agreement.

57
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,480
Mistake on the other hand involves false
beliefs about aspects of what is being

58
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:12,241
traded and often means that the
contract is not void but voidable by the

59
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:13,630
mistaken party.

60
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:20,430
This ruling has concerned
contract scholars over the
years because courts have a

61
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:25,651
very hard time looking inside the heads
of the parties to see what they were

62
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:29,890
thinking when they made their contracts.
In his book,

63
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:34,950
the Common Law later Supreme Court justice
Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr pointed out

64
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:41,490
that if the ships had had different names
and one of the parties had simply got

65
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:47,200
the name wrong, they would have been
bound by this ship name on the contract.

66
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Even though there had never in fact
been a meeting of the minds in his view

67
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:54,820
though for homes was
willing to go further.

68
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:59,821
He said the true ground of the decision
in Raffles was not that each party meant

69
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:05,740
a different thing from the other,
but that each said a different thing.

70
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,160
The plaintiff offered one thing.

71
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,950
The defendant expressed
his ascent to another.

72
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,200
The plaintiff and defendant
were essentially saying
different words that merely

73
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:19,690
sounded the same.
Frankly,

74
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:24,691
this seems to me like
philosophical sophistry to me
and most other commentators.

75
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,320
The party said the same thing I
said as a matter of objective, uh,

76
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,980
conduct.
It was just ambiguous.

77
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,590
Commentators have even pointed out
that the peerless doctrine may not be

78
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:42,670
necessary. Allan Farnsworth
argued that in cases like this,

79
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,630
neither party would be able to
sufficiently prove that the other had not

80
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:51,340
performed according to the contract and
so the contract would be unenforceable

81
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:53,590
anyway.
On a similar view,

82
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:58,520
we could say that there is insufficient
objective for a contract when the

83
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:01,850
objective manifestation is
ambiguous as it is here.

84
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:07,990
The doctrine about meeting of the minds
has been enshrined in section 20 of the

85
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:15,671
second restatement subsection one
deals with cases like fearless.

86
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,280
If there's an important ambiguous term
in the contract and neither party or each

87
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:26,960
party knows that it is ambiguous and the
other party is thinking of a different

88
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:31,520
meaning, then there is no mutual
assent and so there's no contract.

89
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,340
This can be thought of as the
peerless case. In another sense,

90
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,550
it's hard to find other examples of
pure symmetric misunderstandings.

91
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,820
Many commentators have tried to find
reasons why the buyer or the seller might

92
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:53,840
have been in fact in a better place
to avoid this misunderstanding.

93
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:58,130
These commentators have tried to
identify the party who in the words of

94
00:06:58,131 --> 00:07:00,740
subsection one had a better quote,

95
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:05,890
reason to know the meaning attached by
the other unquote subsection two deals

96
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:12,380
with the asymmetric version of the
situation where one party knows or should

97
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:17,150
have known the others meaning but
not vice versa. In these cases,

98
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:21,410
the meaning attributed by the party
that didn't know is the meaning of the

99
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:24,830
contract and the contract is valid.
In other words,

100
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,880
if a party knows what the other
party thought the contract meant,

101
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,710
that party has to abide by what he or
she knew the other party was thinking.

102
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:40,390
So suppose the same scenario happened
as in Raffles v Winkle House,

103
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:45,020
except that wicked house knew that raffles
was thinking of the December peerless

104
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,760
under the second restatement. Is there
a contract and who would win the case?

105
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,850
Well,
the answer is a,

106
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,660
as section 20 subsection two of the
restatement tells us in an asymmetric

107
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:00,980
information case like this,

108
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,910
the party who knows the other's
interpretation is bound to it.

109
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,980
That means that wiggle house as much
as he would like it to be the October

110
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:14,780
peerless is bound to buy cotton
from the December peerless raffles,

111
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,980
we'll win the case
in this lecture.

112
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:24,010
We have seen that when two parties don't
understand key terms of a contract in

113
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:25,310
the same way,

114
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,080
there is no contract because there
has been no meeting of the minds.

115
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,980
But when the situation is
asymmetric with one party,

116
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:37,190
knowing the other's
interpretation and not vice versa,

117
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,080
both parties are bound to
the interpretation that
both of them are aware of.
