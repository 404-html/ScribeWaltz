1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,930
Today we're going to discuss an incredibly
famous English case decided in 1893

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,790
called Carlisle versus
carbolic smoke ball law.

3
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:16,791
Students have been reading this case for
generations to learn about unilateral

4
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:19,230
contracts.
In that case,

5
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:24,231
the court considered an offer made
through a public advertisement and

6
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:29,271
contemplated whether accepting that offer
by performance also required notifying

7
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:34,470
the offer or
the defendant.

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,500
The carbolic smoke ball company ran a
newspaper ad offering 100 pounds to any

9
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:46,140
person who contracts the increasing
epidemic of influence. Uh,

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,440
after having used the carbolic smoke
ball three times daily for two weeks,

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,680
the ad elaborated that the company had
deposited 1000 pounds in a bank to show

12
00:00:58,171 --> 00:01:03,000
its sincerity.
The plaintiff Carlisle Bada Ball,

13
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,010
used it as directed for about four
weeks and then contracted the flu.

14
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:13,810
The trial court found for the plaintiff
and the instant court affirmed.

15
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,600
So the central issue is this,

16
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:19,580
did the carbolic smoke ball companies add,

17
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:24,581
constitute a contractual offer
accepted by plaintiffs performance.

18
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,070
At this point in the course,

19
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,300
we have long established that a valid
contract requires consideration.

20
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,030
So was there consideration in this case?

21
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,490
The answer is yes.

22
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,880
The carbolic smoke ball company argued
that the contract was a new DME,

23
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,040
packed him a promise
unclothed by consideration,

24
00:01:48,131 --> 00:01:51,670
unsupported by consideration
on the plaintiff's part.

25
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,860
But the three judges hearing the case,
each writing separately disagreed.

26
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,330
They concluded that the offer was,
was supported by consideration.

27
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,320
Remember,

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,760
consideration need not be a benefit
to the promise or a detriment,

29
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:08,530
illegal detriment to the promise.

30
00:02:08,531 --> 00:02:13,531
He can also be consideration and here
in convenience sustained by one party at

31
00:02:15,131 --> 00:02:19,180
the request of the other is
enough to create consideration.

32
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:24,550
Applying the carbolic smoke ball three
times a day for two weeks is such an

33
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:25,480
inconvenience.

34
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,650
This is a case where consideration
wasn't a return promise,

35
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,660
but was actual performance.

36
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,400
It's interesting that the court treated
Carlisle's payment in exchange for the

37
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:38,740
smoke ball to be a separate transaction.

38
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,500
Now with consideration established,

39
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,920
let's consider whether there was
an offer and an acceptance, uh,

40
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,670
which is really the subject of
this part of the course. First,

41
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:57,090
was the advertisement a serious offer or
was it like many advertisements mirror

42
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,510
hyperbole not meant to be taken seriously?

43
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:08,010
The court concluded that the advertisement
was not a mere puff but a serious

44
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:09,790
offer.

45
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,790
The court found that the
company was serious in the
advertisement itself in part

46
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:20,230
because the advertisement disclosed that
a thousand pounds had been deposited

47
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:25,210
with the alliance banks showing the
are sincere sincerity in the matter.

48
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,320
Next given that the advertisement was
an offer giving Carlyle the offeree,

49
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,010
the power of acceptance,

50
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,960
the court had to determine whether the
plaintiff adequately accepted the offer.

51
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,730
The carbolic smoke ball company argued
that the plaintiff never accepted the

52
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:47,731
offer because she failed to notify the
company that she had accepted the offer.

53
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,770
Under carbolic theory,

54
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,750
the plaintiff would have had to notify
the company before starting to use the

55
00:03:55,751 --> 00:04:00,751
smoke balls quote so that the defendant
might be at liberty to superintend the

56
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:03,340
experiment unquote.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The court acknowledged that as an
ordinary rule of law and acceptance of an

58
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:14,161
offer made ought to be notified to the
person who makes the offer in order that

59
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:18,700
the two minds come together.
However,

60
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:23,701
the court continued in a case of this
kine performance is an adequate form of

61
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:28,240
acceptance and no prior
notification is necessary.

62
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,080
One of the judges wrote code.

63
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,110
If the person making the offer expressly
or impliedly intimate in his offer that

64
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:41,830
it will be sufficient to
act on the proposal without
communicating acceptance of

65
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:44,320
it to the offer or to himself.

66
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,620
Performance of the condition
is a sufficient acceptance
without notification.

67
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,720
The opinion suggests that the duty of
timely notification is merely a default

68
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:56,554
rule,

69
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,560
but here the carbolic smoke ball company
impliedly intimated that performance

70
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:06,700
was assists sufficient form of acceptance,

71
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,140
thus waving the notification requirement.
However,

72
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:16,150
if the carbolic smoke ball company had
put explicit conditions on the form of

73
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:20,890
acceptance and required
formal notification prior
to plaintiff's performance,

74
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,240
presumably the court would have required
the plaintiff to notify the defendant.

75
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,190
According to the terms of the offer,

76
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,260
the restatement of contracts
endorses this approach.

77
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,440
Section 54 of the restatement states
where an offer invites and offeree to

78
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,750
accept by rendering a performance.

79
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,780
No notification is necessary to make such
an except it's effective and less the

80
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:49,000
offer requests such a notification,

81
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,330
although not used by the restatement.

82
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,660
The phrase unilateral contract refers
to a contract that is formed by an offer

83
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:04,160
that invites acceptance by performance
of the bargain for exchange and does not

84
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:06,110
invite acceptance by a promise.

85
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,040
The classic examples of a unilateral
contract include an offer to climb a

86
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:17,900
flagpole for a certain amount of money
or an offer to pay a reward if someone

87
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:22,901
can find the lost dog in effect
in a unilateral contract,

88
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,240
the promise or exchanges a promise in
exchange for a performance that operates

89
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,680
as acceptance and a bilateral contract,
the promise,

90
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:36,800
their exchanges a promise
for a return promise.

91
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:38,973
Okay,

92
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
so Alice tells Bob that she'll be out
of town for the week if he Moser lawn

93
00:06:45,601 --> 00:06:50,220
before she returns, she'll give him
$20 okay, no need to decide now,

94
00:06:50,221 --> 00:06:53,250
Alison Sis,
if the lawn is mowed when I return,

95
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,730
I'll give you $20 if not,
I'll just mow it myself.

96
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:01,560
Is this an offer for a unilateral
or a bilateral contract?

97
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,150
Well, this is a classic offer
for a unilateral contract.

98
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,480
Bob Can accept the contract by mowing
Alice's lawn and does not need to notify

99
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:17,470
Alice of his intent to ahead of time.
If on the other hand,

100
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,240
Alison said that she needs to know
before she leaves town so she can hire

101
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,130
someone else.
If Bob refuses,

102
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,250
this would be an offer
for a bilateral contract.

103
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:32,170
Bob would be exchanging a promise to mow
Alice's lawn and exchange for Allison's

104
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:37,180
promise to pay him $20 and Bob would
be bound by his promise if he accepted

105
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,760
in carbolic smoke ball.

106
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:46,410
The court also had to confront a
separate issue was the offer void for

107
00:07:46,411 --> 00:07:47,244
vagueness.

108
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,400
The advertisement did not specify a
timeline over which carbolic smoke ball

109
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:57,890
would protect against influenza after
the customers daily use for two weeks.

110
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,610
Absent explicit terms,
the court has two options.

111
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:07,910
Either declare the offer void for
vagueness or resolve the ambiguity.

112
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,020
In this case,

113
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:14,730
the court held that the offer was not
void for vagueness and instead elected to

114
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:19,410
fill in the terms to
resolve the ambiguity.

115
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,400
The Fort,

116
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,400
the court first considered
quote construing the offer
most strongly against the

117
00:08:25,801 --> 00:08:27,300
person who made it.

118
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:32,990
The court rejected this contra proferentem
approach saying that it would be

119
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:39,321
pushing the language of the advertisement
too far to construe it as meaning that

120
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,250
a person who used the smoke ball
three times a day for two weeks,

121
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,420
we'd be quote,

122
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:50,160
guaranteed against influenza for
the rest of that person's life.

123
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:55,670
No to this approach would be consistent
with a penalty default rule to encourage

124
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:58,890
more precise offers.
Instead,

125
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:03,390
the court chose to fill the gap with
two and possibly three reasonable

126
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:04,350
constructions.

127
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:08,970
Since the plaintiff had used the carbolic
smoke ball three times a day for two

128
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:13,971
weeks and continued to do so
until she contracted a influenza,

129
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,140
the court determined that under any
of the reasonable interpretations,

130
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,070
uh, the plaintiff had
stated a breach of contract.

131
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,230
So let's review.

132
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,470
Today we learned that if an offer invites
and offeree to accept by rendering

133
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:31,704
performance,

134
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:36,950
no additional notification is required
to form an acceptance unless otherwise

135
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:38,910
specified in the offer.

136
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:44,330
Contracts that are formed from such
offers are called unilateral contracts.
