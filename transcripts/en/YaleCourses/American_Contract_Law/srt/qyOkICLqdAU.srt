00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,200
Today we're going to talk
about Wallace versus Smith.

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,490
A case decided by the New Mexico Court
of Appeals in 2001 like cases we've been

3
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:11,730
discussing recently.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,030
Wallace versus Smith involves
the enforceability of
contract claims as well as

5
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:21,060
the viability of tort claims
in light of public policy.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,970
This case is an appeal from a dismissal
of the complaint for failure to state a

7
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:28,740
claim and so on.
Appeal.

8
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:32,730
The court assumes the allegations of the
complaint are true for the purposes of

9
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:37,110
determining whether the complaint
states a viable claim for relief.

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,840
The plaintiff,
Peter Wallace,

11
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:44,841
alleges that he and defendant Kelly Race
Smith were a couple engaged in a sexual

12
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:47,100
relationship.

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,050
Wallace made it clear that he did not
want to father a child and the two talked

14
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,480
about possible methods of contraception.

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,460
They agreed that Smith would use birth
control pills and that their sexual

16
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:03,240
intimacy would cease if Smith
stopped using birth control.

17
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,260
Wallace did not himself use
any form of contraception.

18
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,910
At some point, Smith decided
to stop taking birth control,

19
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,860
but she did not tell Wallace.

20
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:17,100
She had stopped and the two
continued their relationship.

21
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,790
Smith became pregnant and
gave birth to a daughter.

22
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,900
New Mexico law required Wallace to pay
child support for the first 18 years of

23
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:32,250
his child's life, while a sued for
compensatory and punitive damages.

24
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,310
Arguing that because of the child support
obligations created by Smith's failure

25
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:40,200
to tell him she had ceased
taking birth control pills,

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,970
he had suffered a substantial economic
injury. The trial court, however,

27
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,830
determine that public policy prohibited
Wallace from bringing those claims.

28
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,260
The court of appeals agreed.

29
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,210
Recall our previous discussions about the
factors that weigh in favor of finding

30
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:59,520
that a particular public policy exists.

31
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,020
One of the primary factors is what the
legislature has said on the subject.

32
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,530
The court emphasize that our legislature
has spoken to the public policy that

33
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:14,490
governs the economic consequences of
sexual relationships that produce children

34
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,080
and that policy is reflected in
New Mexico child support laws.

35
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,770
New Mexico had adopted
the uniform parentage act,

36
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,040
which quote imposes a form of strict
liability for child support without regard

37
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:33,060
to which parent bears the
greater responsibility for
the child's being unquote.

38
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,570
That in turn reflected a strong public
policy that makes paramount the interest

39
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:42,870
of the child genera generally in a,

40
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:47,250
it was in the child's best interest
to receive financial support from both

41
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:52,251
parents by seeking to recover for the
very financial loss caused him by the

42
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:54,870
statutory obligation to pay child support.

43
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,190
Wallace was attempting to circumvent is
support obligations and shift financial

44
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:03,310
responsibility for their
child entirely on to Smith.

45
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:08,260
The court of appeals determined this
contravene the state's public policy and

46
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:09,820
noted that tar knowledge,

47
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:14,821
no jurisdiction recognizes contraceptive
fraud or breach of promise to practice

48
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:20,320
birth control as a ground for Justin
and natural parent's obligation to pay

49
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:21,154
child support.

50
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,940
The court denied Wallaces
fraud claims noting quote,

51
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,940
not all misrepresentations are
actionable unquote judge Allred's.

52
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,970
Concurrence delved more deeply into the
misrepresentation argument explaining if

53
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:40,360
we recognize a claim based on
intentional misrepresentation,

54
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,590
we have started down the road toward
establishing standards of conduct and

55
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,150
reproductive relationships.

56
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,920
One of the most important and private
forms of interpersonal relations,

57
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,400
candor and reproductive matters should
be left to the ethics of the participants

58
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,900
unquote, whether expressed as
a contract or a tort claim.

59
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:07,060
The court of appeals was clear that
the economic injury caused by unwanted

60
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:09,460
fatherhood was not compensable.

61
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:10,660
Yeah.

62
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:15,660
The opinions recital of facts suggest
that Smith initially used birth control as

63
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:19,990
agreed and only later changed her mind.

64
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,360
But what if the facts were just did
slightly imagine that Smith never intended

65
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:30,361
to use birth control at all when
she promised Wallace that you would,

66
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,020
what kind of claim would
that possibly suggest?

67
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,630
Well,
it sounds like promissory fraud.

68
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,160
Could Wallace pursue a promissory
fraud claim? In theory,

69
00:04:43,161 --> 00:04:46,640
the arguments for promissory fraud
look strong, especially a Smith,

70
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,480
we're financially secure and could
provide for her child the loan,

71
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,850
but courts have not
entertained such claims and the
contraceptive fraud context,

72
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,650
perhaps the reality of intimate
relationships and the often imperfect

73
00:05:00,651 --> 00:05:05,600
understanding those in such relationships
have of one another's intentions.

74
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,260
Make that a good thing
to mind. Mind, however,

75
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:14,150
the court goes too far and is in
establishing an immutable rule against

76
00:05:14,151 --> 00:05:14,990
liability.

77
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,680
The court evidentiary concern could
be handled by only enforcing written

78
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:24,830
agreements of the kind that we've seen
in the frozen embryo cases and the

79
00:05:24,831 --> 00:05:29,300
court's concern about child support
could be handled by keeping the plaintiff

80
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,770
contingently on the hook for support
if the defendant failed to have enough

81
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:35,780
resources to pay for the child.

82
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:43,150
Imagine now that Wallace and Smith had
the same agreement to only have sex when

83
00:05:43,941 --> 00:05:45,440
contraceptives were used,

84
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,240
but that that it was Wallace who
would use a contraceptive if Wallace

85
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:55,130
intentionally ceased doing so and Smith
became pregnant when she has a better

86
00:05:55,131 --> 00:05:58,370
claim for damages.
And then did in this case,

87
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,470
notice that the court's opinion focuses
on the fact that Wallace sought recovery

88
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,050
purely for economic injury.
Indeed,

89
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:11,350
judge Alridge expressly declined to
address whether tortuously inflicted

90
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:15,920
physical harm to a sex
partner would be foreclosed.

91
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:17,120
In a similar case,

92
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,920
the fact that pregnancy would cause Smith
to cover physical trauma in addition

93
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:25,760
to economic harm might make
such a claim more plausible.

94
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,340
Would a broken promise by a man to use
contraceptive be more enforceable than a

95
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:36,440
broken promise by a woman?
Would promises not to use contraceptives?

96
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:41,441
Be More enforceable under
contractor toward fraudulently
inducing consent to sex

97
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:44,690
as a kind of assault,
isn't it?

98
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:51,490
Now let's move away from the procreation
promises and consider instead of very

99
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:56,861
different hypothetical that raises some
of the public policy concerns we've been

100
00:06:57,471 --> 00:06:58,304
discussing.

101
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:03,850
Imagine that a bunch of professors are
at a dinner together before the start of

102
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,120
the fall semester.

103
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,120
Professor a mentions that he's planning
to sell his used car once the incoming

104
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,440
students arrive on campus.

105
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:17,950
Professor B who has just arrived for the
year carless as a visiting lecture says

106
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,870
she herself might want to buy the car
and wants to know if she can have a

107
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:26,210
mechanic examine it before purchasing it.

108
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:32,050
Professor a agrees but only on the
condition that professor B not disclose

109
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:34,520
anything about what the mechanic fines.

110
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,970
Professor B agrees after the
mechanic looks at the car.

111
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:46,570
Professor B calls professor a to say she
does not want the car and begins to say

112
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,410
that the mechanic found a problem with it.

113
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,620
Professor a though cuts in says,

114
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:58,400
don't tell me professor B response,

115
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,410
but it's a safety problem and
professor a repeats. Don't tell me.

116
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,090
Professor a then sells the car
to an incoming graduate student.

117
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:13,630
A does not disclose his agreement
with Professor B and uh,

118
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,610
professor aid does not disclose that.

119
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:21,611
B had said there was a safety problem
with the car later the graduate students

120
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:26,891
suffers injuries in a car accident
caused by that very safety problem.

121
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:34,510
Should a should professor a
face any liability for the
students accident and did

122
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:40,961
professor be breached and enforceable
promise when professor B told professor

123
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:43,550
aid there was a safety
problem with the car.

124
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,760
As you probably sense
enforcing an agreement to
remain silent in the face of a

125
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:54,761
serious safety issue like
the one described in this
hypothetical would almost

126
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:59,370
surely be against public policy.
Though professor be breached,

127
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,740
the agreement to remain silent,

128
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,820
professor B would not be liable because
of the agreement would be found to be

129
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:07,200
against public policy.

130
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:13,190
And once professor a learned
via the breach that there
was a safety problem with

131
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:15,324
the car.

132
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:20,390
Professor a had a duty to disclose this
to the student professor A's failure to

133
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:24,120
do so would be a tort
and possibly criminal.

134
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,440
But are there potentially
negative consequences to
not enforcing this agreement

135
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:34,080
to remain silent?

136
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:40,070
If professor a knew that the agreement
with professor a two with Professor B to

137
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:43,560
remain silent,
we're not enforceable,

138
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,630
professor a probably wouldn't have let
professor be inspect the car at all.

139
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:54,590
This wouldn't give the student seeking
to buy the car any new safety information

140
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,300
because pref professor a would
have remained willfully ignorant.

141
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:06,110
One possible alternative would be to make
professor be liable for small damages

142
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,910
for contractual breach if she
disclosed adverse safety information.

143
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:16,830
But making professor be liable
for large damages in tort.

144
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:21,720
If she failed to disclose safety
information and a subsequent purchaser was

145
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:22,554
hurt,

146
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:28,370
the damages for breach would likely be
much smaller because they would only

147
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:34,941
represent the a reduction in price of
the car that would now have to be fixed,

148
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,040
that professor A's of the world would
still allow inspection and the professor

149
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:48,930
B's might be willing to enter this kind
of agreement because of the possibility

150
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:52,500
that no adverse safety information
would been terrilizer during such an

151
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:55,050
inspection.
Perversely,

152
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:58,290
by enforcing the silent promise,

153
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,410
the law might produce
more safety information.

154
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:07,410
So what have we learned from Wallace
and this agreement to remain silent?

155
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:09,780
Hypothetical from Wallace,

156
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:14,781
we know that courts generally will not
recognize contraception fall contra

157
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,781
contraception,

158
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:20,781
fraud claims based on economic injury
caused by an obligation to pay child

159
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:25,500
support and know the reasoning was
based on the best interest of the child.

160
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,360
The case echoes some of the concerns about
interfering with private and intimate

161
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:31,290
relationships.

162
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:36,470
We've touched on in previous cases from
the hypothetical about remaining silent.

163
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,310
We saw another example of an agreement
in a context that would almost

164
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:43,770
universally be considered unenforceable,

165
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:48,750
but we also considered the potential
negative implications of a policy against

166
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:52,560
enforcement and a possible
alternative policy.
