1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,720
Today we're going to talk about another
classic of the Contracts Law Cannan

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,250
Hoffman versus red owl stores.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,290
We've already discussed promissory
Estoppel several times in red owl.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,800
We will revisit this concept,
but in a different context.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,100
This case asks whether a plaintiff who
relies on a defendant's pre contractual

6
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:27,420
promises may recover.
Joseph Hoffman,

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,480
who together with his wife operated a
bakery and walk Toma what Wisconsin and he

8
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:36,870
wanted to expand his business
by opening a grocery store.

9
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,300
He contacted Red Owl,

10
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,410
a grocery store chain operating
throughout the Midwest.

11
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,570
Read Al Stores.
We're often operated as franchises.

12
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,530
Hoffman Bay began negotiating with,
uh,

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,760
I read al manager named Luca wits to
establish a red al franchise in Hoffman's

14
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:00,324
town.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Hoffman told the manager he only had
$18,000 to invest in the franchise and

16
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:09,330
Luca,
what's told them that was sufficient.

17
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,270
From here,

18
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,890
there began a series of moves by Hoffman
made on the belief that he'd soon be a

19
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:23,841
red owl franchisee in order to gain
experience in the grocery business.

20
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,950
He purchased a small grocery store
in La Toma and move that Luca,

21
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:33,330
what's approved, but several months
into its successful operation. Luca,

22
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:37,920
what's advised him to sell it though
Hoffman did not want to sacrifice the

23
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:41,520
profits the summer tourist
season would bring,

24
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,650
he was assured he'd be operating a
larger red I'll store by the fall.

25
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,391
In the fall,

26
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:53,391
the Red Alga manager suggested Hoffman
exercise an option to buy a lot in a

27
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:58,560
different town. Chilton, where he
would build his red al franchise.

28
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,980
Hoffman took the suggestion and it's
September of 1961 he put down $1,000 to

29
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:10,641
acquire an option to later purchased the
lot after Hoffman put down the thousand

30
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,600
dollars on this Chilton Lot.
Luca, what's indicated quote,

31
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,440
everything is ready to go.
We are set unquote.

32
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,240
But soon thereafter,

33
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:26,241
Luca Woods told Hoffman the only
remaining hitch in the plan was Hoffman's

34
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:32,010
bakery. He and his wife would have to
sell it and they did. So in November,

35
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,470
uh,
Hoffman sold the bakery.

36
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:39,300
He and his family moved to a different
town and he began working the night shift

37
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:42,960
in another bakery at the end of November.
Right.

38
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:44,400
Alan Ford Hoffman,

39
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:49,401
he'd need to invest $24,000 rather than
the $18,000 he originally anticipated.

40
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,240
This number was soon raised to $26,000
in order for Hoffman to meet these new

41
00:02:56,821 --> 00:02:57,654
amounts.

42
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:02,690
Hoffman's father-in-law
agreed to contribute $13,000
provided he'd be a partner

43
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:05,650
in the business though.

44
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,130
Read Al Originally told
Hoffman that this sounded fine.

45
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:14,370
Hoffman was informed in late January or
early February of 1962 that his father

46
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:19,930
in law would have to agree that the
$13,000 contribution was a gift,

47
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,000
right Al then increased the amount needed
from Hoffman and his father in law to

48
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:30,001
$34,000 and at that point
Hoffman broke off negotiations.

49
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,610
Hoffman sued Red Owl for expenses and
lost income and the jury awarded him

50
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:41,041
damages for the sale of the grocery store
sale of his bakery and the option on

51
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:45,130
the lot as well as incidental damages.
However,

52
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:49,780
the trial judge vacated the damages
awarded regarding the jury's award

53
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,420
concerning the sale of the grocery
and ordered a new trial, uh,

54
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,080
to be held to determine what the damages
on the sale of the grocery would be.

55
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,040
Both Hoffman and Radel appealed and the
Wisconsin Supreme Court in deciding this

56
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:12,310
case, first determined that it was
adopting section 90 of the restatement,

57
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,140
which we've talked about before.

58
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,250
So what are the elements of promissory
Estoppel contained in section 90 that

59
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:25,300
provision states that quote,

60
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,830
a promise which the promise or should
reasonably expect to induce action or

61
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:34,750
forbearance on the part of the primacy
or a third person and which doesn't do

62
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:39,751
such action or forbearance is binding
if injustice can be avoided only by

63
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:41,530
enforcement of the promise.

64
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,760
The court in red owl concluded that read
Al Gave Hoffman a number of promises

65
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:54,361
and assurances upon which plaintiffs
relied and acted upon to their detriment.

66
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:01,170
So what are some of the promises that
Red Al made the most prominent was the

67
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:05,980
promise that Hoffman's
$18,000 would be sufficient,

68
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,780
a sufficient investment.

69
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,740
This is certainly the promise that
proved most compelling to the court.

70
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:17,130
And certainly the record suggests that
red owl numerous times assured Hoffman he

71
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:19,210
would soon get the store.

72
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,580
But despite the number of promises
the court asserts existed,

73
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:29,850
it's actually somewhat difficult to pin
down specific promises that read Al made

74
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:32,170
to Hoffman rather read.

75
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:36,400
Al told Hoffman things like we're all
set and everything is ready to go.

76
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,330
These uh,
communications,

77
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:45,331
these utterances certainly wouldn't be
definite enough to constitute an offer to

78
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:47,890
form a binding contract.

79
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:52,360
This indeed was the thrust
of Red Alice defense.

80
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,020
It argued that quote again,

81
00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:00,030
agreement was never reached on factors
necessary to establish a contract.

82
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:06,430
The court had to determine whether
promissory Estoppel could apply when the

83
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:09,320
promise in question did not quote,

84
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:14,350
embrace all essential details
of her proposed transaction
between promissory and

85
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:15,200
promise.

86
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,940
See so as to be the equivalent of an
offer that would result in a binding

87
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:24,941
contract unquote in holding that
promissory Estoppel could apply in this

88
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:26,564
situation.

89
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,280
The court explained that it was wrong
to think of promissory Estoppel as the

90
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:33,530
equivalent of breach of contract.

91
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,590
The requirements of section 90 did not.

92
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,980
The court said indicate anything at all
about how detailed to given PR proposal

93
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:45,770
was or how close it was
to a binding contract.

94
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,740
Having concluded that promissory Estoppel
applied there remained the question of

95
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:52,574
damages.

96
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:57,910
The court explained where damages are
awarded in promissory Estoppel instead of

97
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:01,880
specifically enforcing
the promises promise.

98
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,230
They should be only such as in the opinion
of the quarter necessary to prevent

99
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:07,064
injustice.

100
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,630
Focusing on the primary
contested damage award,

101
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:15,560
the sale of the grocery store about
which the trial judge had ordered a new

102
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:16,394
trial,

103
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,440
the court responded to Hoffman's claim
that he was entitled to the profits he

104
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:26,060
would have had if he had continued to
operating the store during those summer

105
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:29,120
tourists month by emphasizing again,

106
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,060
this is not a breach of contract action.

107
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,990
We usually see lost profits award as part
of expectation damages where the goal

108
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:43,601
of expectation damages is to put the
plaintiff in the position he or she would

109
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:47,690
have been in if a contract
had actually been performed.

110
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,280
In this case,

111
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:54,310
the plaintiff recovered damages in
reliance the detriment Hoffman incurred by

112
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:58,880
relying on Red Alice representations
and issue and assurances.

113
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:04,510
Is there a way you could construe the
profits lost by the sale of the grocery

114
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:07,820
store as reliance damages?
Well,

115
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,040
absent read Alice assurances,

116
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,430
he'd have a bigger red owl
grocery store in the fall.

117
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,390
Hoffman wouldn't have sold the grocery.
On the other hand,

118
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,260
he may not have purchased the grocery
in the first place and would've had no

119
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:26,030
profits to gain their buy if he hadn't
initially began negotiating with red owl.

120
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,570
Usually courts will not award lost
profits when a plaintiff is pursuing a

121
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:34,130
promissory Estoppel theory.

122
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,090
But in Walter's v Marathon oil,

123
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:43,091
a seventh circuit case decided in 1981
which involved plaintiffs who purchased a

124
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:44,540
gas station from,

125
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,690
from marathon oil after the company
represented it would provide gasoline.

126
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,870
The court upheld the trial
court's award of loss profits,

127
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:59,170
quote in reliance upon
appellant's promised to supply
gasoline supplies to them

128
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,140
a pal Lee's purchase the station and
invested their funds and their time.

129
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,970
It's unreasonable to assume that they
did not anticipate a return of profits

130
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:13,590
from this investment, but in reliance
upon the appellant's promise,

131
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,310
they had forgotten the opportunity
to make the investment elsewhere.

132
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,160
Returning to this case.
In what other ways did Hoffman rely?

133
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,330
Well, he purchased the what?
Toma Grocery and later sold it.

134
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,660
He paid $1,000 to option a lot and Chilton
and he sold his bakery and move to a

135
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:34,404
new town.

136
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:39,310
Notice that the award doesn't give him
damages for purchasing the [inaudible]

137
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:44,450
grocery store that wasn't in reliance
on definite enough of a promise from red

138
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:49,530
owl or it was if it,
if it was reliance,

139
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:50,760
it wasn't reasonable.

140
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,760
At that early stage in the negotiation
and reliance damages for selling the Watt

141
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,140
Toma Grocery, we're going to be
limited down. The court said quote,

142
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:06,141
justice does not require that the damages
awarded him because of selling these

143
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:11,781
assets at the behest of the defendants
should exceed any actual loss sustained

144
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,890
measured by the difference between the
sale price and the fair market value

145
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,210
unquote.
This doesn't directly award lost profits,

146
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:26,390
but at least indirectly the fair market
value should reflect the expected

147
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:29,850
profits from the upcoming
summer tourist season.

148
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,680
So did red owl act in bad faith
in its negotiations with Hoffman?

149
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,570
The court concluded that it didn't.

150
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,010
There was no evidence read Al intended
not to keep any of its offers or its

151
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:47,850
promises,
but even if red al had acted in bad faith,

152
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,670
there probably wouldn't.
That probably wouldn't matter.

153
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:56,090
The uniform commercial code imposes a
duty of good faith as Amanda Tory part of

154
00:10:57,361 --> 00:11:02,130
all contracts, but while duties of
good faith arise under a contract,

155
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:07,610
negotiators typically don't owe
each other any such duty duty.

156
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,990
Then again,

157
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:15,410
the succession of increasing demand
certainly creates the appearance of a kind

158
00:11:16,471 --> 00:11:21,471
of bait and switch strategy that read
Al was stringing Hoffman along trying to

159
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:27,840
get more and more out of
this potential franchisee.

160
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,500
The law of promissory fraud can hold a
promise or liable for punitive damages if

161
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:40,011
the plaintiff can establish that the
promise or at the time of promising of

162
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:45,590
making assurances intends not to
perform a her promise red Al's repeated

163
00:11:48,031 --> 00:11:52,680
assurances probably aren't enough to
establish promissory fraud but they are

164
00:11:52,681 --> 00:11:57,681
moving in that direction and important
article by Professor Allan Farnsworth

165
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,270
provides a way of thinking about pre
contractual liability that offers some

166
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:08,050
insights into why reliance
damages are sometimes preferable.

167
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:13,720
Farnsworth distinguishes between
agreements to agree and agreements to

168
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:14,554
negotiate.

169
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,030
Unlike the former parties
agreeing to negotiate,

170
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:23,470
recognize that if they fail to reach
and ultimate agreement they will not be

171
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:28,471
bound because the agreement to negotiate
is not part of a larger agreement.

172
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,910
There is no possibility of a
claim for a lost expectation.

173
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:34,601
Indeed,

174
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:39,340
there's no way of knowing what the terms
of an ultimate agreement might've been

175
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,390
if one had ever been reached.
In such cases,

176
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:47,200
reliance is appropriate because
that is the only interest,

177
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:52,230
a party to an agreement to negotiate
reasonably expects should the other party

178
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:56,320
pull out of the negotiations.
The case teachers,

179
00:12:56,321 --> 00:13:01,321
insurance and Annuity Association
of America Versus Tribune Company.

180
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,960
A case decided the same year Farnsworth
article was published and which

181
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:12,450
concerned failed negotiations for a 14
year $76 million loan federal District

182
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:20,610
Court judge Pierre leval warning that
there was a strong presumption against

183
00:13:21,071 --> 00:13:26,071
finding binding obligation in agreements
to negotiate set out of five factor

184
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:33,091
test to determine whether the parties
had in fact entered in to such an

185
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:38,581
agreement to negotiate these factors
included the language of the agreement,

186
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:44,191
the context of the negotiation
with particular attention
to the parties motives,

187
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,990
the number of open terms,

188
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,670
the extent to which the agreement had
been performed and usage of trade.

189
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,540
Red Owl is considered an
incredibly influential case
which often decided as the

190
00:13:58,781 --> 00:14:03,781
catalyst in the expansion of promissory
Estoppel doctrine to the liability for

191
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:06,010
pre contractual reliance.

192
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,180
The implication indeed are profound read.

193
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:15,100
Alice suggests that parties must
be very careful in negotiations,

194
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,990
a realm in which representations are
often taken with a grain of salt because

195
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:24,991
reliance on such promises or
representations may result in damages,

196
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,350
but some argue that the result
of Red Al is in fact unusual.

197
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:34,470
Professor Alan Schwartz and Robert Scott
studied over a hundred cases from 1999

198
00:14:36,071 --> 00:14:41,071
to 2003 that directly presented the
issue of recovery for precontract or

199
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,603
alliance.

200
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:47,360
Their research showed that courts
consistently have denied recovery for pre

201
00:14:47,361 --> 00:14:49,960
contractual law reliance and less.

202
00:14:49,961 --> 00:14:54,961
The parties by agreeing
on something significant
indicated their intention to be

203
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:57,050
bound.
In a sense,

204
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:02,380
the default not withstanding red owl and
its progeny is that it's not reasonable

205
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:06,140
to rely on pre contractual promises.
