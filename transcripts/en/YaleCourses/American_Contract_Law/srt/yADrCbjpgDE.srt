1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,960
Today we discuss timing issues in
contract formation by examining an English

2
00:00:07,081 --> 00:00:11,250
contract case from the 19th
century Adams versus Lin.

3
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:16,200
Saul was decided by the
Court of Kings bench in 1818.

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,100
The Court of Kings bench or Queen's bench,
uh,

5
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:22,320
was an English court of common law.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,710
While this might seem like
an obsolete English case,

7
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:29,790
it created an important common law rule.
The mailbox rule.

8
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:31,020
That's what it stands for,

9
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:36,021
which teaches us when a mailed
acceptance acceptance forms of contract.

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,720
In this case,
the defendant Lynn Zelle,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,690
was a wool dealer looking to sell wool.

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,970
He sent a letter to the plaintiff
buyer Adams offering to sell.

13
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:55,971
We'll add a specified price
to be delivered at a light
Chester and to be paid

14
00:00:57,601 --> 00:01:01,830
for by two months. Bill
in two months. However,

15
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,400
the defendant miss directed this letter.
In other words,

16
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,960
he wrote down the wrong address and it
took longer than expected for the letter

17
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:11,160
to reach the plaintiff.

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,200
By the time the plaintiff got the
letter and sent back his acceptance,

19
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,700
it was two days after the
expected deadline for acceptance.

20
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,130
Unfortunately, by that time, the
defendant had already sold that wool.

21
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,450
The plaintiff sues the seller
for nondelivery of wool.

22
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,140
If you're still a bit confused,

23
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:38,280
let's quickly review the
chronology of events on Tuesday,

24
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:43,281
September 2nd the seller sends
the offer to the wrong address.

25
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,470
It takes a whole three days
before reaching the buyer.

26
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,280
The buyer sends the acceptance on Friday,

27
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:55,050
September 5th and it doesn't reach the
seller until the following Tuesday.

28
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,650
By that time,
the seller had already sold the wool.

29
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,150
The trial court found
for plaintiffs afterward,

30
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,420
defendant wins a rule Nisi order
that there is no binding contract.

31
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,890
A rule Nisi is an order in case you're
wondering that may or may not have forest

32
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:18,030
depending on whether a particular
condition is satisfied.

33
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,290
It's from the Latin word Nisi.

34
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,310
That means unless in this case the
condition is unless the plaintiff can show

35
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:26,244
cause.

36
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,670
The plaintiff's lawyers show cause and
trial judgment for plaintiff is affirmed.

37
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:38,940
The main issue in this case is whether
the plaintiff's acceptance is valid.

38
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,770
When uh, it was mailed,
the court held that yes,

39
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,130
the acceptance is valid
the moment it was mailed,

40
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,410
the court reasoned that if it opted for
the other rule that acceptance is valid.

41
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:56,820
When the offer offer roar receives it,
then the plaintiffs,

42
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:57,520
uh,

43
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,520
except doors ought not to be bound until
after they had received notification

44
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:06,640
that the defendant had received
their answer and the sent it to it.

45
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,790
And so it might go on Ad Infinitum,

46
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,100
the court reasons that would be a bad
result because it would lead to an

47
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:19,990
infinite chain of correspondence
confirming that the other person knew.

48
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:25,750
The court realize that when a
contract is formed at a distance,

49
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,840
either the offer or war or the acceptor
will not be able to know precisely when

50
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,780
the contract is formed.
In this case,

51
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,930
the defendant offer or was responsible
for the misdirected letter and hence for

52
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,500
the predicament of contracting
to sell the wool twice.

53
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,460
The so called mailbox rule
suggested by this case applies.

54
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:55,450
However, even when there is
no misdirected initial offer,

55
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,730
the rural can be found in
restatement of contract, uh, uh,

56
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:05,731
section 63 a that provision states that
acceptance occurs as soon as it leaves

57
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:10,900
the offer. Rees
possession. In other words,

58
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:15,901
the moment you put the acceptance in
the mail box and can't take it back,

59
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,370
the contract takes effect.
Uh,

60
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,930
there are a few justifications
for the mailbox rule.

61
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,350
A key reason is that the
rule is merely a default.

62
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,590
The offer war can always stipulate
that communication is required before a

63
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:34,000
contract formation.

64
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,660
You can see that from the first sentence
of section 63 a which specifies the

65
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:45,481
rule is binding unless the
offer provides otherwise

66
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:52,590
under the mailbox rule the offer or
is the last to know whether and when a

67
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:56,090
contract is formed.
Uh,

68
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,200
but any offer or who doesn't like the
result is free as master of her offer to

69
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:07,171
say that the offer will only be accepted
when notice of acceptance is received

70
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:12,871
by the offer or section 63 sets the
timing default against the party who is

71
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:15,700
empowered to alter it.

72
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:21,570
Another justification is that after
posting the seller is in the best position

73
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:26,911
to know of a delay and to inquire all
of this is aimed at protecting and offer

74
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:32,611
re who does what is reasonable to ascent
and assuming there is a contract relies

75
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:35,770
on it.
Furthermore,

76
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:38,920
requiring more confirmation
does not reduce mistake.

77
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,170
It just shifts the
burden to the other side.

78
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,650
The last person to confirm will always
be at an informational disadvantage

79
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:50,560
because she will not know whether
her confirmation got through.

80
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,920
Requiring more confirmations is
probably a waste of social resources.

81
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:02,140
The finding of contract at
time of dispatch that the
formation occurs when it's

82
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:07,481
sent means the offeree may safely rely
without inquiring as to whether there was

83
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:13,100
a dispatched but uncommunicated
revocation. Thus,

84
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:18,101
as long as the offeree selects a
reasonable method of communicating ascent,

85
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,240
he or she should be able to rely
on the formation of a contract.

86
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:29,840
Was the holding and Adams versus
Lynn Cell and exact iteration of the

87
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:34,190
justifications of the mailbox
rule? Well, not exactly,

88
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:37,630
although this case is
thought to be the origin, uh,

89
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,860
of the so called mailbox rule.

90
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,030
The holding seems to be that because
the seller misdirected the offer,

91
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,480
he should be bound by the acceptance
that would have arrived in due course of

92
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:50,960
post.
In short,

93
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:55,340
the seller expected to hear
from the buyer on September 7th,

94
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,420
so there was no need to discuss the
effect of the posting of the letter.

95
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,580
That question would be posed if
the offer had not been misdirected.

96
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,350
The buyer posted in acceptance and the
seller sells the wool to a third party

97
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:12,530
and then the acceptances arrived.
Let's,

98
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,400
let's take a look at the scope
of the mailbox rule first.

99
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,940
What if the offer acceptance
is never received?

100
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,260
Say it gets stolen or destroyed in
a tragic mail delivery van fire,

101
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,870
there's still a contract.
In that case,

102
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,730
the offer bares the risk of non delivery.

103
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,910
If the offer doesn't
want to bear that risk,

104
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:37,030
she can again contract around it and say
that the contract is only formed when

105
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:39,650
the acceptances received.
Finally,

106
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,040
what about other mediums of communication?

107
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,040
The mailbox rule has been
applied to telegrams,

108
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:49,610
faxes and and other mediums
of contractual communication.

109
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:54,380
It's when they're sent that the
acceptance becomes effective. Nowadays,

110
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:58,430
more and more contracting is done
by electronic transmissions where

111
00:07:58,431 --> 00:08:01,100
communication is virtually instantaneous.

112
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:06,101
The sending and receipt happens almost
simultaneously under such circumstances.

113
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:10,250
There's a good reason for holding that
an acceptance is only effective when

114
00:08:10,251 --> 00:08:12,230
received and not when transmitted.

115
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,760
The authors of an influential study
observed that an important premise upon

116
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:21,761
which the mailbox rule is predicated
is the notion of some delayed medium of

117
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:26,500
communication such as mailbox, uh, uh,

118
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,740
uh, writings and they do
not provide either party,

119
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,150
the ability to verify in a timely fashion
that receipt of a message has occurred

120
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,900
and that the message has
received is without error. Hence,

121
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,040
these authors have maintained
that electronic transmission
should be governed by

122
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:47,260
the same rules that apply when parties
are in each other's presence. Uh,

123
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,440
and the acceptance should
be deemed effective only
when received and confirmed.

124
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:58,020
Acceptance is not the only
act that causes timing issues,

125
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:03,030
offers counter offers and
revocations also post timing issues.

126
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,020
However,

127
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:09,020
every other formation act becomes
effective at the time it's received,

128
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,450
not at the time that it is sent.

129
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:18,030
Why our offers counteroffers and
revocations treated differently?

130
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:18,661
Well,

131
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:23,661
maybe because these rules
are also defaults that are
set against the person who

132
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:26,580
has a unilateral power to opt out.

133
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,080
What about from offers?
That is option contracts.

134
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,540
A restatement.

135
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:38,541
Section 63 provides that an acceptance
under an option contract is not effective

136
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:43,920
until received by the offer or
in the view of the drafters.

137
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,960
Since the option contract provides
for irrevocability of the offer.

138
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:53,580
The primary reason for the rule of
Adams versus Linzille and its progeny is

139
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:54,414
absent.

140
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,950
The position suggests that the mailbox
rule is employed to protect the

141
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,980
[inaudible] opportunity to make a
sound decision against an unexpected

142
00:10:04,111 --> 00:10:09,111
revocation in option contracts
and for a and from offers,

143
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,020
there's no threat of offer or revocation,

144
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,670
so the mailbox rule does not
make sense in those contexts.

145
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,270
So let's imagine this.

146
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,300
Robert offers to sell Sally a box of
jewelry for $10,000 Sally accepts by

147
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:33,210
sending a letter and putting it in the
mail while the letter is in the mail.

148
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:37,260
Robert Call Sally to tell
her the offer is revoked.

149
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,310
Is there a contract?
The answer is yes.

150
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:46,340
Under section 42 revocation is
not effective until the offer.

151
00:10:46,631 --> 00:10:51,631
He receives a manifestation of this
revocation from the offer or interestingly

152
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:57,990
that this may not even be a default,
might be a mandatory rule of timing.

153
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,560
The mailed acceptance creates the
contract and the revocation has no legal

154
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:09,051
consequence because it was not manifested
until after the acceptance became

155
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:14,280
effective and only uh, it has only
received after the contract was formed.

156
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,240
Also note that section 40 creates a
limited exception to the mailbox rule when

157
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,750
the sending of an acceptance is
proceeded by a previous sending of a

158
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:30,600
counteroffer or revocation.
Section.

159
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:35,601
40 in effect says a letter or telegram
of acceptance dispatched after the

160
00:11:37,651 --> 00:11:40,030
sending of another wise,
uh,

161
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:45,031
affective rejection or counter offer
only operates as an acceptance if the

162
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:50,691
acceptance is received by the offer or
before she receives the rejection or

163
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:54,610
counter offer.
Or to put it even more simply,

164
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:59,680
if an offeree has previously
sent a counteroffer or rejection,

165
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,340
the acceptance will only
take place if at all,

166
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:08,230
at the time of receipt to see how this
works. Imagine the following scenario.

167
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,830
On Day One B receives A's offer.

168
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:17,430
On Day two B sends a counteroffer and
then on day three B sends an acceptance.

169
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,840
Now if it weren't for section 40 there
would be an acceptance of an offer here

170
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:29,980
because the counter offer only becomes
effective when it's received and the

171
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:31,540
acceptance would have occurred here,

172
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:35,320
but section 40 a
complicates this analysis.

173
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:40,750
There are two possibilities about when
the counter offer and acceptance will be

174
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:41,584
received.

175
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,540
If a receives the acceptance
before the counter offer,

176
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:51,630
then there's going to be a
contract because acceptance
under this condition will

177
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:53,830
occur when it is received,

178
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,630
but under the second possibility
a receives the counteroffer first,

179
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,840
which blows up the offer and renders
ineffective the subsequent receipt of the

180
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:09,220
acceptance. And so under this second
possibility there would be no contract.

181
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:14,380
Finally, let's discuss what
constitutes reasonable acceptance.

182
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,970
As we discussed earlier,

183
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:20,290
the mailbox rule applies when the method
of acceptance is a reasonable response

184
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,640
under the circumstances.

185
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,380
The next example will help us see
what reasonable acceptance might mean.

186
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,760
So imagine in July,

187
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,760
1990 Carol was hired as a
special education teacher
by the Huron School district

188
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,160
for the 1990 [inaudible] 91 school year.

189
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,130
On August 15th,

190
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:47,130
1990 Carol handed to Ed her supervisor
a letter of resignation effective on

191
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,970
August 17th.

192
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,880
You should think of this
letter as an offer to uh,

193
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,210
enter employment.

194
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:00,490
In the letter she requested that her final
check be mailed to an address some 50

195
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:04,960
miles away which was her parents' home.
Ed gave the letter to Mary,

196
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:06,040
the superintendent,

197
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,960
the superintendent for the school
who had authority to hire and fire.

198
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,960
On August 20th that same day,

199
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:19,110
Mary prepared and mailed the letter
properly addressed to Carol at her parents

200
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,180
accepting the resignation.
The next day,

201
00:14:22,181 --> 00:14:26,770
Carol hand delivered a letter to
Mary withdrawing her resignation.

202
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:32,370
Mary told Carol that the resignation had
been accepted and handed her a copy of

203
00:14:32,951 --> 00:14:34,840
the letter mailed the day before.

204
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:39,670
That letter did not reach Carol's
parents home until August 24th.

205
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:45,040
Carol claims that the resignation had
been withdrawn in time because the

206
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,770
acceptance letter should
have been handed to her.

207
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:53,360
Let's first sink through some of strongest
arguments for the school district.

208
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,471
In other words,

209
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:59,000
arguments for why Carol resignation
offer was properly accepted.

210
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,280
The school district could argue that Carol
handed her written offer to resign to

211
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:09,080
a supervisor who forwarded to the person
with the power to accept and given the

212
00:15:09,081 --> 00:15:13,970
dates involve three days after when
Carol said her resignation was effective.

213
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,170
Uh,

214
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:19,790
and the assumption that Carol would be
at her parents posting the acceptance

215
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:24,940
would appear to be reasonable and the
mirror posting under the mailbox rule

216
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:29,350
should have been the
time where the, um, uh,

217
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,480
resignation offer was accepted.
Here.

218
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,440
The manner in which the offer is
communicated is not determinative.

219
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,470
Thus the resignation would be
effective at the time they posted,

220
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:46,520
uh, the letter. But what if
Carol had sent a telegram,

221
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:52,050
a of offering to resign and Mary had
merely sent a letter accepting that offer

222
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,950
before the letter arrived.
Carol revoked the resignation by email.

223
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,670
In that case,
Carol's initial manner of communication,

224
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,880
a telegram might signal what form
a reasonable response might take.

225
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Mary arguably should have known that
Carol was expecting a prompt apply.

226
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,810
Sending a letter on these facts was,
would not be reasonable.

227
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:22,910
They're reasonable response
was to telegraph or email
that the resignation was

228
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:24,890
accepted.
Finally,

229
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:30,380
what if Carol had telephone berry and
left the offer to resign on Mary's

230
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:34,550
voicemail?
And what if Carol had used a fax?

231
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:38,240
How should marry except in those cases?
Well,

232
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:42,980
the use of voicemail and Telefax is
common and suggests at least that Mary May

233
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:45,320
use the same mode for acceptance.

234
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,230
The response doesn't have to be faster,

235
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:52,280
but at least there's an argument
that the mode of acceptance, uh,

236
00:16:52,281 --> 00:16:56,780
shouldn't come through a
slower mode of communication.

237
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:02,350
It might mean that these attempts to
accept by a slower mode are not effective

238
00:17:04,431 --> 00:17:09,320
because they're not reasonable or
that they wouldn't be effective until

239
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:10,071
received.

240
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:15,071
So any overtaking revocation of the
offer would render the acceptance in

241
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:19,970
ineffective.
In summary,

242
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:25,060
the mailbox rule states that acceptance
takes effect when an acceptance is

243
00:17:26,091 --> 00:17:29,030
placed out of the offer.
Rees possession.

244
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,720
This is in contrast to offers revocations
and counter offers which only take

245
00:17:34,941 --> 00:17:38,000
effect at the time they are received.
However,

246
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:41,270
while the mailbox rule
has a fairly wide scope,

247
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:43,900
it does not apply in cases where the mess,

248
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:46,940
that method of acceptance
is not reasonable,

249
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:51,530
such as responding to an
email, uh, with snail mail.
