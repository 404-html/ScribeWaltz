00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,840
Today's case felled versus Henry s
Levian sons concerns breadcrumbs,

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,090
not the kind that fall off slice
of slices of bread as you eat it,

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,360
but rather industrial made machine
ground breadcrumbs Felds company,

4
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:23,421
the crushed toast company entered into
a contract with Levine and son's bakery

5
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:28,821
to buy all of the breadcrumbs they would
produce in the upcoming year with the

6
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:34,200
contract set to renew every year unless
one party gave the other six months

7
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:39,201
notice over the course of the year and
sons produced and sold more than 250 tons

8
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:42,390
of breadcrumbs,

9
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,860
but over that time they decided that 6
cents per pound they had agreed to and

10
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,070
the contract was too low.

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,400
They tried to get fell to agree to a
price of price increase of 7 cents per

12
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:57,630
pound,
but when he refused,

13
00:00:57,631 --> 00:01:02,130
they shut down their breadcrumb making
operation and dismantled all of the

14
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:03,360
machinery involved,

15
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,790
the stale loaves of bread that
they would have used making crumbs.

16
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,960
They instead sold for animal feed.
Once they did this,

17
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:17,961
they stopped selling any crumbs to the
crush toast company as their output was

18
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:22,320
now zero filled then sued.

19
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,230
Considering this to be a
breach of their contract.

20
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,110
We're looking at the decision from the
New York Court of Appeals on appeal from

21
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:35,730
denial of both parties motion for
summary Judgment and so the underlying

22
00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:39,780
procedural question is whether there is
a question of material fact for a jury

23
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:43,680
to decide in this case.
In order to answer this question,

24
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:48,681
Judge Cook looks at the substantive
legal question of whether the seller was

25
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:54,351
required to produce breadcrumbs or if
Levian sons could satisfy its obligation

26
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,140
by handing over the zero
breadcrumbs it produced.

27
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,820
Judge Cook relies on the
uniform commercial codes,

28
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,740
rules for output and
requirements contracts.

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,670
We've encountered these sort of
contracts before, for example,

30
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:10,890
in the sooner sand case,

31
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:16,130
but it's worth a quick refresher in an
output contract as we have in this case,

32
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,220
the buyer agrees to purchase all of a
given product that the seller makes in a

33
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:25,650
requirements contracts.
On the other hand,

34
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:30,651
the seller agrees to make as much of a
given product as the buyer requires or

35
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:35,340
needs. Note that in each of
these types of contracts,

36
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,520
one party has discretion over the quantity
of goods sold in output contracts.

37
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:45,390
It's the seller while in requirement
contracts, it's the buyer.

38
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,840
What we have in this case
is an output contract.

39
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,850
Since Levian son is obliged to sell
its entire output to the crushed toast

40
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:57,690
company, the agreement is only
exclusive in one direction.

41
00:02:57,691 --> 00:03:01,600
Though the crush toasts company is
allowed to buy crumbs from others.

42
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,770
The key provision of the UCC is section
two three Oh six subsection one and

43
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:12,610
Forbes us at the party with discretion
does not have unlimited discretion.

44
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,020
They must determine the quantity in good
faith in accordance with their actual

45
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:22,021
output or requirements and that quantity
cannot be unreasonably disproportionate

46
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,540
to what the party's estimated or expected.

47
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,370
Courts have generally prioritize the good
faith requirement over the prohibition

48
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:35,371
of unreasonably disproportionate
amounts output in requirement contracts.

49
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:40,921
Give us another context to learn what
the law demands in terms of good faith,

50
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:46,290
you should see these
discretionary quantity cases
that they generally fit into

51
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:51,631
the categories that judges suitor and
Posner called discretionary performance as

52
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:56,020
opposed to good faith in
formation or in termination.

53
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:01,380
But this particular case is more of a
good faith in termination since Levian

54
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:06,550
sons by choosing deceased production
is also an essence terminating the

55
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:07,384
contract.

56
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:12,460
Judge Cook looks at what the UCC
provision means for the case at hand.

57
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,920
He finds that under New York law,

58
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,870
good faith cessation of production
terminates any further obligations and

59
00:04:19,871 --> 00:04:21,580
excuses further performance,

60
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,140
so the simple fact that Levy and sons
cease producing breadcrumbs is not

61
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,060
sufficient for felled to win the case.

62
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,570
The question is whether the
seller acted in good faith.

63
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,810
Levian sons says that producing
breadcrumbs was economically not feasible,

64
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,930
but that's too vague and permissive.
A test for Judge Cook.

65
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:45,070
We need to look at the motives,
cook fines,

66
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:50,071
that it's not enough for a seller to
simply find that it is making less profit

67
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:51,130
than expected.

68
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,630
Rather continued production must
actually imperil the businesses continued

69
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:58,300
operation or or push it into bankruptcy.

70
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,560
Otherwise they are bound by the price
they agreed to when they formed the

71
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:07,060
contract even with judge cooks.
Clarification,

72
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:12,040
this rule is not obvious. It's not clear
why bankruptcy should be sufficient.

73
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,520
Leveraged Buyouts may leave businesses
with very little room for reduced

74
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:18,910
profitability,

75
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,470
but that shouldn't affect their
obligations to contractual partners.

76
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:29,130
One possible economically sensible
rule would be due excuse performance.

77
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:33,760
When the joint profits of the seller
and buyer combined are negative,

78
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,960
that's one of the parties losses
exceed the other party's gains from the

79
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:41,260
transaction. This case, however,

80
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,700
looks pretty clearly like bad faith that
at least on the facts that we have here,

81
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:51,030
the bakery only dismantled its machinery
after its attempts to extort a higher

82
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:53,230
price from the buyer were unsuccessful.

83
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:58,710
The court remands so that the ultimate
decision on this factual question will be

84
00:05:58,821 --> 00:05:59,960
made by the jury.

85
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,900
This decision is one of several areas
where courts have conditioned to

86
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:10,901
corporations legal duties on whether
fulfilling the duty would drive the firm

87
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,310
into bankruptcy.
For example,

88
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,780
if a set of disabled employees
request reasonable accommodation,

89
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,050
an employer is less likely to need to
grant the request if doing so would drive

90
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:24,920
the employer and the bankruptcy.

91
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,610
But in today's world of modern finance,

92
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,820
the risk of bankruptcy can be somewhat
under the firm's own control and in part

93
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:39,290
a function of how the choose the
firm chooses to finance itself.

94
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:44,710
Highly leveraged firms that are financed
more with debt than equity will be more

95
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:49,760
susceptible to bankruptcy, but
bankruptcy, and in that case,

96
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,950
in the case of a highly leveraged firm,

97
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,950
doesn't mean the firm
isn't viable economically.

98
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,370
It just means that the firm will have
to reorganize and the erstwhile bond

99
00:06:59,371 --> 00:07:04,371
holders will become the new shareholders
of the post bankrupt from imagine two

100
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:08,630
identical firms that produce widgets.

101
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,840
Both are wholly financed by equity or
stock and both are worth $100 million.

102
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,190
They'd have to lose a lot of money
before they hit the bankruptcy point.

103
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:24,730
But now imagine that one firm decides to
do a leverage buyout where it borrows a

104
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:30,251
bunch of money by issuing bonds and uses
this money to buy back almost all of

105
00:07:30,571 --> 00:07:34,220
its shares.
The firm is still worth 100 million,

106
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:39,221
but now it's possible that 99 million
of it will be owned by the bond holders

107
00:07:39,921 --> 00:07:44,921
and just 1 million by the remaining
shareholders after the leveraged buyout.

108
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,800
The second firm is much closer
to the point of bankruptcy,

109
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,720
but should the law allow the second
firm to have lower duties with regard to

110
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,500
output contracts and duties
of reasonable accommodation,

111
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,660
the economist would say no
and instead argue that viable,

112
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,260
the viability of the bread production
should turn more on the joint

113
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:09,860
profitability of production
for the buyers and the sellers.

114
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,240
Let's take a quick look at subsection
two of section two three Oh six as well.

115
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,900
This provision says that when the buyer
and seller have a contract with an

116
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:25,010
exclusive dealing provision,
they must unless otherwise agreed,

117
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:26,390
use best efforts.

118
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,990
The duty of making best efforts is usually
seen as a default duty to the other

119
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:35,450
side, uh, of a contract when the, uh,

120
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,980
when there is exclusive dealing
lady death. Gordon, for example,

121
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,420
promise to deal exclusively
with wood and wood in exchange,

122
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:49,421
implicitly promised to use best efforts
to promote her endorsements here.

123
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,260
Levy and sons agreed to
sell exclusively to Feld,

124
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,950
but we don't need Felds
promise of best efforts. Uh,

125
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:03,951
so we might think that filled would
promote the sale of breadcrumbs because

126
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,780
felled had already committed
to buy all of levies,

127
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:11,781
output and the parties and making an
output contract are not expecting the

128
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:16,260
seller to make best
efforts to supply the good,

129
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:19,830
just an effort to supply an
amount that is in good faith.

130
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,093
Okay,

131
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,330
so let's try a quiz.

132
00:09:23,331 --> 00:09:27,170
Imagine that we had the same
contract as in this case,

133
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:32,000
but as the year comes to an end and
Levian son realizes that this contract is

134
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:36,620
extremely profitable the following year,
instead of 250 tons,

135
00:09:36,621 --> 00:09:39,620
they produce 5,000 tons of breadcrumbs.

136
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:44,680
This felled of a suit for breach
of contract. Well, probably yes,

137
00:09:44,681 --> 00:09:47,740
felled would advocates in this scenario,

138
00:09:47,741 --> 00:09:52,330
Levy and sons produces 20 times the
amount of breadcrumbs he would have

139
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,480
expected, uh, based on the first year.

140
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,440
And the jury would likely conclude
that this amount is unreasonably

141
00:09:59,441 --> 00:10:04,441
disproportionate under subsection one
of two three Oh six so let's recap.

142
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,510
We have seen that when parties enter
and output or requirements contract,

143
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:16,210
the party that has discretion over the
quantity of goods sold must act in good

144
00:10:16,211 --> 00:10:21,211
faith and not impose a
quantity unreasonably
disproportionate to what the other

145
00:10:21,851 --> 00:10:26,851
party would expect either based on an
explicit estimate or based on past or

146
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:29,680
normal behavior.
