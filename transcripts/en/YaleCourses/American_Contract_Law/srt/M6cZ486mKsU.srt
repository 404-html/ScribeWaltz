1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,400
In today's lecture,

2
00:00:02,401 --> 00:00:07,401
we're going to look at a
1985 Massachusetts case
called American Mechanical

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,200
Corporation Versus Union of Lynn.
Using that case,

4
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:18,201
we'll look at how to calculate contractual
damages available to a seller when

5
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:20,250
the buyer breaches,

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,150
and we'll also talk about the
seller's duty to mitigate damages.

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,820
In American mechanical.

8
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:31,821
The plaintiff American contracted to sell
its real estate for $100,000 and it's

9
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:36,390
business equipment for
$35,000 to the defendant.

10
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:41,391
Union Union knew that American was in
financial difficulty and that it was

11
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:46,620
behind on his mortgage payments to
Sagas bank and that Saugus was pressing

12
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:48,630
American to sell its assets.

13
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,230
Union issued a $5,000 down payment
to be held in escrow until closing.

14
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,920
A couple of weeks later,
union repudiated the contract.

15
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,930
Sagas Bank took possession of both the
property and business equipment from

16
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:08,931
American and sold them for
$55,000 and $35,000 respectively.

17
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,110
The highest prices it was able to
obtain American sued union for breach of

18
00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:16,524
contract.

19
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,090
The trial court held for American
but awarded only nominal damages.

20
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,740
The instant court affirmed the judgment
in favor of American as the non

21
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:29,760
breaching seller but re
but reversed as to damages.

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,840
So this is the central issue
is the plaintiff entitled
to actual damages if the

23
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:39,720
damage is proved by the traditional
formula or insufficient.

24
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,710
The court held that it was an award
at American $45,000 plus interest.

25
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,090
The traditional rule for calculating
damages for breach of an agreement to sell

26
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:56,091
real estate is to award the difference
between the contract price and the market

27
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:58,380
price at the date of breach.

28
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,980
The trial court determine that the
$55,000 obtained for the property at four

29
00:02:04,151 --> 00:02:08,220
foreclosure at the foreclosure sale
which took place seven months after the

30
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:13,221
breach was not a fair estimate of the
market value on the date of breach and

31
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:16,980
then American had failed
to prove actual damages.

32
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,750
Therefore the court awarded
only nominal damages. However,

33
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,780
the appeals court held that
the traditional formula is
not a rigid one and that

34
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:31,851
the aim and measuring damages in the
event of a breach is to place the injured

35
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:36,510
party in as good a position as he
would have been had the contract been

36
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:38,310
performed.
This is uh,

37
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,430
is of course the standard for expectation
damages according to the court and

38
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:48,630
important aspect of this principle is
that if a party suing for breach of

39
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:53,631
contract has sustained a loss as a result
of a breach and the loss is such a ne

40
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:59,610
is of such a nature that it was
reasonably foreseeable by the parties or

41
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:04,210
actually within their contemplation at
the time the contract was entered into,

42
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,950
then that loss may be recovered
in an action for damages.

43
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,840
Since Union knew that if the sale
of the property did not go through,

44
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,790
the result would be that Sagas bank would
enforce it's right under the mortgage

45
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:23,791
and that a foreclosure sale was likely
the correct measure of damages on

46
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:28,840
traditional contract principles was
the full amount of the actual loss,

47
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,370
the contract price,

48
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,540
less the amount received for the
property at the foreclosure sale.

49
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:40,050
Therefore American was entitled to
$45,000 the difference between a hundred

50
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:45,570
thousand dollars the contract price
and the 55,000 foreclosure sale price.

51
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,630
At what time is the market value of real
estate relevant under the traditional

52
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:54,520
rule for calculating damages,

53
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,480
suppose that American provided evidence
that the market value was $75,000 at the

54
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:06,220
date of the breach and $70,000
at the date set for closing.

55
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,570
What result under the court's reasoning?
Well,

56
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:12,100
under the traditional rule,

57
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,360
damages are equal to the difference
between the contract price and the market

58
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:18,730
price.
At the date of the breach,

59
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,180
that would be a hundred thousand
minus 75,000 or $25,000 in this case,

60
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,330
neither the trial court nor the appellate
court applied the traditional formula.

61
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,920
The traditional formula
requires an estimate of the
market value of the property

62
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,220
at the date of breach.
Since this was unavailable,

63
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:44,221
the trial court held that damages
could not be calculated and awarded and

64
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:47,710
awarded only nominal damages.
The Appellate Court,

65
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:52,711
however hell that even though American
didn't prove are required element of the

66
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:54,250
market value formula,

67
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,490
it did prove a foreseeable loss and that
including this loss in the damage award

68
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:04,630
more closely resonates with the
medical of expost compensation.

69
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:10,380
Such reasonably foreseeable losses are
known as consequential damages and we'll

70
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:13,780
talk more about them in a later lecture.

71
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:18,781
When we cover case called Hadley
vs Baxendale consequential
damages are usually

72
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:25,261
though only awarded to a buyer when a
seller is breach causes a foreseeable lost

73
00:05:25,931 --> 00:05:30,490
to the buyer who is denied the
services flowing from the sailors.

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Failure to perform the UCC section two
seven 15 expressly limits consequential

75
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:43,471
damages that as those that are
resulting from a seller's breach.

76
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,590
But American mechanical is a case where
a buyer's breach causes foreseeable

77
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:51,040
consequential damages.

78
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:56,340
And while the UCC does not expressly
provide for a seller's consequential

79
00:05:56,411 --> 00:05:57,244
damages,

80
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,440
the uniform land transaction act
does provide for a seller's cons of

81
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,600
consequential damages that include quote
any loss the buyer knew or at the time

82
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:13,400
of contracting had reason to know would
result from the buyer's breach in which

83
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:16,370
reasonably could not be
avoided by the seller.

84
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,530
American mechanical also
touches on this last point,

85
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,270
the seller's duty to mitigate damages
in the event of a breach by the buyer.

86
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,390
The court noted that union would of course
be entitled to have Americans damages

87
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:36,230
reduced to the extent that American
could reasonably have avoided the loss.

88
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,460
In other words,
if once it knew of the breach,

89
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:43,790
American could reasonably have
sold the property to someone else,

90
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,780
it would be entitled to damages in an
amount no greater than the difference

91
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,560
between the contract price and the
price for which it could have sold the

92
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:52,394
property,

93
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,880
but the facts demonstrate that American
was unable to secure another purchaser

94
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,200
for the realty and the equipment.

95
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,900
The court also noted that the buyer
bore the burden to prove that the losses

96
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,610
could have been avoided
by reasonable effort.

97
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,950
Section three 50 of the restatement
describes the duty to mitigate.

98
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:17,480
It says that quote,
damages are not recoverable for loss,

99
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,310
that the injured party could have
avoided without undue risk burden or

100
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:23,180
humiliation,

101
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,810
but that the injured party is
not precluded from recovery
to the extent that he

102
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:32,720
has made reasonable but
unsuccessful efforts to avoid loss.

103
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,000
Let's look at the burden in American
mechanical and how it shifts.

104
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,240
First, the plaintiff has the
burden of proving damages,

105
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,320
but the defendant has the burden to
show that the plaintiff did not mitigate

106
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:46,880
damages.
Thus,

107
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:52,090
the court uses the mitigation rule to
shift the burden to prove the market value

108
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:57,341
of the property at the date of breach
from the plaintiff to the defendant at

109
00:07:57,921 --> 00:07:58,371
trial.

110
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:02,780
The defendant might not have known that
it had this burden because the law was

111
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:05,600
not well enough established.
Arguably,

112
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,530
it would have been more appropriate for
the appellate court to remand for a new

113
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:14,531
trial to see if union could establish
Americans failure to mitigate damages.

114
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,480
Let's review today.

115
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:22,430
We talked about how to calculate contract
damages when a buyer breaches under

116
00:08:22,431 --> 00:08:23,570
the traditional rule,

117
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,950
damages are calculated as the difference
between the contract price and the

118
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:30,020
market price at the time of the breach.

119
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,830
Damages may also include
consequential damages,

120
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:37,460
losses that are reasonably
foreseeable in the event of a breach,

121
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,720
although the seller has a duty
to mitigate those damages.
