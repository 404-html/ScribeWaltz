1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:05,690
In the last class we talked about
Sherwood v Walker and were introduced,

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,630
introduced to the concept
of mutual mistake.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:14,140
We learned the principle that mutual
mistake as to a basic assumption renders a

4
00:00:15,531 --> 00:00:17,090
contract unenforceable.

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:22,780
We're going back now to look at another
case Lenawee county board of health

6
00:00:23,061 --> 00:00:24,320
versus miserly.

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:29,750
Another case involving mutual mistake
decided by the Supreme Court of Michigan,

8
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:35,410
which the very same supreme court
which had the temerity to modernize the

9
00:00:36,081 --> 00:00:38,510
standard articulated in Sherwood.

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,510
Okay.

11
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,510
The case involved a 600 square foot tract
of land on which three unit apartment

12
00:00:47,261 --> 00:00:50,470
building also sat.
If you think about it,

13
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,620
600 square feet is an incredibly small
area on which to stack three apartments.

14
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,940
The case involves a number of sometimes
confusing conveyances concerning this

15
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:04,684
land.

16
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,760
A man named bloom once owned the land
and installed the septic tank on the

17
00:01:09,761 --> 00:01:13,330
property without a permit and
in violation of the lender.

18
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:18,331
We county health code bloom subsequently
sold the land and the apartment to the

19
00:01:19,631 --> 00:01:20,470
Messer Lee's.

20
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:26,070
The Mezzer is used the building on the
land as an income investment property,

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,970
but eventually they to sold the
land and building. This time.

22
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:35,971
The buyer was one James Barnes who also
used it primarily for income investment.

23
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,750
Barnes sold an acre of the property and
later offered the rest for sale when

24
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:46,030
they defaulted on their contract.

25
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,010
A husband and wife Mister and
missus pickles showed interest,

26
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:56,011
but we're not happy with the terms of
the contract between Barnes and messerly.

27
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,660
In order to allow the pickles instead to
contract directly with the Mezzer lays,

28
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,700
the barns is executed.

29
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:08,701
A quit claim conveying all in any of
their interests that they had in the

30
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:10,720
property back to the Mezzer Lee's

31
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,050
okay.

32
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,010
Ultimately,

33
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,100
the Mezzer Lee's and the pickles is
entered a $25,000 agreement for the land.

34
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:26,110
A provision of that contract
included a term that which said,

35
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:31,630
purchaser has examined this property
and agrees to accept the same in its

36
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:33,230
present condition.

37
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,060
There are no other and additional
written or oral understandings.

38
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,430
A few days later,

39
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,350
the new owners discovered raw
sewage seeping out of the ground.

40
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,340
The pickles found
themselves in a real pickle.

41
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:56,530
The Lenawee county board of health then
discovered this an adequate sewer system

42
00:02:57,381 --> 00:03:02,170
and condemned the property and a permanent
injunction against human habitation

43
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:07,171
of the property until it came into
conformance with the counties sanitation

44
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:08,464
code.

45
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,620
This injunction was granted and the
Lenawee county withdrew from the lawsuit.

46
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,040
The pickles is cece pain on their land
contract and the measures Lee's filed a

47
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:25,831
cross complaint seeking foreclosure
sale of the property and a deficiency

48
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:27,034
judgment.

49
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:32,190
The pickles is counterclaimed
for rescission and filed
a third party complaint

50
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,920
against the Barnes is the alleged
failure of consideration and willful

51
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:43,111
concealment and misrepresentation
where the basis of this a suit,

52
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,410
the trial court ruled that there was
no cause of action because there was no

53
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,000
misrep representation.

54
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,650
Neither of the previous owners had known
about the septic tank and the property

55
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:55,150
was purchased as is,

56
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:00,630
but the appellate court reversed the
ruling as to the claims against the Mezzer

57
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:05,950
Hurley's determining that there was
a mutual mistake that went to a basic

58
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,300
element of the contract. This
miss set this mistake, concern,

59
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:15,301
quote the income producing capacity of
the property in question and the property

60
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:21,121
was in an uninhabitable and therefore
unsuitable for residential use.

61
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,840
The instinct court agreed
that a mutual mistake existed,

62
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:32,140
but it declined to reason within the
framework of the precedents offered by the

63
00:04:32,451 --> 00:04:33,284
parties.

64
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,680
The Mezzer Lee's had argued that a case
a and m land development versus Miller

65
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,700
in 1959,

66
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:45,701
Michigan Supreme Court case dictated
that mistakes that went to the value or

67
00:04:45,771 --> 00:04:50,771
quality of real estate
sold were collateral to an
agreement and did not justify

68
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:54,830
rescission.
The pickles is by contrast,

69
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,850
argued following Sherwood
v Walker that uh,

70
00:05:00,261 --> 00:05:02,300
that a different result was dictated.

71
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,840
Precision was dictated and appropriate
when the parties are mistaken as to the

72
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:10,160
essence of the consideration.

73
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,230
Yeah.

74
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:17,120
So what kind of mistake is the
one in question in this case?

75
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,440
In this case, the mistake was about
the quality and value of the land,

76
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,830
but the court found it was also
simultaneously and materially affected,

77
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,430
uh,

78
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:36,430
the essence of the contractual
consideration according to the court.

79
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,730
Then quote,

80
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,530
the inexact and confusing distinction
between contractual mistakes running to

81
00:05:42,531 --> 00:05:43,364
value.

82
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,610
And those touching the substance of
consideration serves only as an impediment

83
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:53,950
to a clear and helpful analysis for the
equitable resolution of cases in which

84
00:05:54,171 --> 00:05:57,760
mistake is alleged and improving.
Accordingly.

85
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,830
The Holdings of a and m land development
and Shorewood with respect to material

86
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:08,051
or collateral nature of a mistake are
limited to the facts of those cases.

87
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,440
This is a polite way for the Michigan
Supreme Court to overrule Sherwood and am

88
00:06:15,671 --> 00:06:20,671
and land a and and land or at least
overruled with regard to future disputes.

89
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,060
Instead,

90
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:28,040
the court look to to provisions of the
restatement of contracts which will

91
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,020
already looked at in the last class.

92
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,080
Section one 52 of the restatement advises
that where our mistake of both parties

93
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:40,961
at the time a contract was made as to a
basic assumption on which the contract

94
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:46,421
was made has a material effect on
the agreed exchange of performances.

95
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,660
The contract is voidable by
the adversely affected party.

96
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:56,170
First note that just because an agreement
was voidable did not mean it was

97
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:57,680
automatically void.

98
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,790
The court emphasized rescission
is an equitable remedy,

99
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,390
which is granted only in the
sound discretion of the court.

100
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,750
So the court need not grant rescission
in every case that a mutual mistake fell

101
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:16,361
within the language of section one 52
here the court emphasize that both parties

102
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,820
were innocent but more importantly for
our purposes section one 52 contained an

103
00:07:23,031 --> 00:07:27,950
additional clause in less the
adversely affected party bears.

104
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:32,951
The risk of the mistake under the rule
stated in section one 54 and section one

105
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:39,611
54 provides that quote a party bears the
risk of mistake when among other things

106
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,780
the risk is allocated to him by agreement
of the parties had the sale agreement

107
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,630
allocated risk to one party.

108
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:56,050
The court determined it had it pointed
to the as is clause of the contract.

109
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,170
Purchaser has examined the property and
agrees to accept same in its present

110
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:08,150
condition. There are no other and
additional written or oral understandings.

111
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,480
This clause indicated the parties had
allocated risk regarding the present

112
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:19,361
condition of the land to the purchasers
because of this recision based on

113
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:23,540
mistake was not available
to the purchasers.

114
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:29,110
The pickles is we're stuck with a judgment
for the amount owed on their promise

115
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:33,740
to buy the contract to buy the land.

116
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,620
Before we finish our
discussion of mistake,

117
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,830
let me say a few words
about unilateral mistake.

118
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:45,550
Does contract law ever set aside
contracts if only one of the parties is

119
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:48,110
mistaken?
The answer is yes.

120
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,350
Section one 53 of the restatement makes
the contract voidable under the same

121
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,160
conditions required for voice
stability because of mutual mistake.

122
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:05,330
That is a mistake as do a basic assumption
that materially affects the agreed

123
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:10,671
upon exchange without that risk being
allocated to the mistaken party.

124
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,330
Those are the same kinds of conditions
that we have for mutual mistake,

125
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,460
but to qualify for void ability
in a unilateral mistake case,

126
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:25,710
a plaintiff must also show
one of two additional things.

127
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,040
Either that enforcement would be
unconscionable or that the other side had

128
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:34,500
reason to know about
the plaintiff's mistake.

129
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,860
There are a few important takeaways
from the Lenawee county case.

130
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:41,970
For starters,

131
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:47,180
we see the court expressly limit the
holding of Sherwood v Walker to the facts

132
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:52,110
of that case instead of
instead of following Sherwood,

133
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:57,290
the court adopted the restatements
standard for mutual mistake based on basic

134
00:09:58,321 --> 00:10:01,110
assumptions.
Next,

135
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:05,460
the court emphasizes discretion in
granting contractual rescission.

136
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,860
Rescission is an equitable remedy and
courts need not granted if if justice

137
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:11,880
doesn't demand it.

138
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,900
That's important to keep in mind
when reading some of these cases.

139
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,280
The fact that one,

140
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:22,570
a fact pattern resulted in contractual
rescission doesn't necessarily mean a

141
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:27,300
similar fact pattern also
will or should at least not.

142
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:30,630
If we take seriously the
requirement that the court way,

143
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:35,100
what would best avoid
injustice in a given case.

144
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,773
Finally,

145
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,250
we see the importance of the way
parties allocate risk in an agreement.

146
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,430
If the as is clause were absent,

147
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:48,510
it seems likely that equity would
have favored the pickles is.
