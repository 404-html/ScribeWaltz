1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,830
In today's lecture we continue
discussing formation defenses.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,660
While the defenses we've considered
to this point have focused on how the

3
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:10,890
contract was formed,

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:16,220
we now turn our attention to defenses
that focus as well on what the contracts

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,213
say.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,550
We begin by examining the
unconscionability doctrine
which in part inquires into

7
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:26,160
the fairness of the contracts terms.

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,260
As with our other formation
defenses of incapacity mistake,

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,060
fraud and undue influence,

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,300
you should be able to see that a finding
of unconscionability is consistent with

11
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:42,480
the goal of policing the
revealed preference inference.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,960
When courts are not confident
that a party's a manifestation
of ascent indicates

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,540
that the contract is value enhancing,

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,020
the courts are more likely to let
that party void the agreement.

15
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,140
We already introduced the
unconscionability defense
when we earlier discussed

16
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:06,270
Williams versus Walker Thomas Furniture.

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,200
The excerpt assigned for today's lecture
which comes from a 1989 case called

18
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:16,440
fleet versus us counts consumer council.

19
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,680
Dell's further into how courts apply
the unconscionability doctrine today

20
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,540
in fleet,

21
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,780
the defendant United States consumer
counsel represented that it would be able

22
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:35,931
to help consumers facing the loss of
their homes through four co closure.

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,553
In fact,

24
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,770
the USCC simply charge consumers for
referring them to attorneys when free

25
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:48,270
referrals were available
to these consumers through
their state bar associations.

26
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,080
The plaintiff fleet was a consumer who
had paid defendant for this service.

27
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,560
Fleet brought this consumer class action
suit against USCC in the instant court,

28
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,180
the Federal District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the

29
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:10,140
court found that u s CCS
practices were unconscionable.

30
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:17,270
So did USC sees practice of charging ill
informed consumers for a simple service

31
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,150
that could be freely obtained elsewhere,

32
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,270
violate New Jersey's unfair and deceptive
practices act well the the court held

33
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:32,571
that it did the court first notes that
unconscionability is hard to define but

34
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:38,241
states that its purpose is to
establish a broad business ethic.

35
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,320
Among other factors,

36
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,240
the court will consider whether the
price grossly exceeded the price at which

37
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:50,241
similar services were readily obtained
in similar transactions by light

38
00:02:50,611 --> 00:02:55,611
consumers and whether a professional
seller is seeking the trade of those most

39
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:59,920
subject texts.
Boyd station in this case,

40
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,250
the court found that USC sees practices
were fraudulent because quote goods sold

41
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:10,510
have little or no value to the consumer.

42
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:15,511
For the purposes for which
he was persuaded to buy
them and quote the consumers

43
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:21,070
who turn to USCC for help.
We're financially troubled and distraught.

44
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,920
The modern unconscionability
doctrine is only about 50 years old,

45
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,350
but has historical antecedents.

46
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,650
In 1750 the court of chancery describe
an unconscientious bargain as one such as

47
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:42,751
no man in his senses and not
under delusion would make
on the one hand and as no

48
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:46,390
honest and fair man would
accept on the other.

49
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,970
This quotation is suggestive of what I
earlier described as the upstairs Nian

50
00:03:51,971 --> 00:03:52,804
inversion.

51
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:58,050
Some bargains are so
substantively unconscionable
that there must have been some

52
00:03:58,181 --> 00:04:00,460
procedural defect in their formation.

53
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,940
One of the parties must have been not
in his senses are under delusion or

54
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:09,550
somehow tricked a into the contract.

55
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,230
This case and other similar earlier cases.
However,

56
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:19,410
we're not brought under a single clearly
established doc trinal umbrella until

57
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:21,730
the latter part of the 20th century.

58
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:27,270
Crucial in this process was
the publication and enactment
of the UCC section two

59
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:33,271
three Oh two which permitted courts to
deny enforcement with regard to contracts

60
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,870
for the sale of good,
where a contract is unconscionable.

61
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,900
At the time it was made this language
unconscionable at the time it was made

62
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:48,880
makes clear that the doctrine
is a formation defense to
be judged at the time of

63
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:53,881
a contracts formation as opposed to the
impracticability defense that will study

64
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:59,941
later that often concerns impracticability
or impossibility that arises after

65
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:01,750
the contract is formed.

66
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,960
While the consideration doctrine
does not inquire into the adequacy of

67
00:05:07,961 --> 00:05:12,640
consideration when courts
decide unconscionability cases,

68
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,260
they demand proof.

69
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,940
Not only that the contract
terms are substantively unfair,

70
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,210
but they also require some procedural
defect in the process through which the

71
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,150
parties arrived at the agreement.
In other words,

72
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,360
although the unconscionability doctrine
focuses on what the contract terms are,

73
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,910
this is substantive unconscionability.

74
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:42,210
Courts must also consider and fine some
degree of procedural unconscionability,

75
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:46,630
some defect in the
process of its formation.

76
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,620
The excerpt from fleet
illustrates this point.

77
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,040
The court considered factors other than
the simple disparity between the price

78
00:05:56,051 --> 00:05:59,420
paid and the market value of the services.

79
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,400
The court noted that unconscionability
is more likely to be applicable.

80
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,980
One a professional seller is seeking
to the trade of those most subject

81
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,330
exploitation,
the uneducated,

82
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:16,331
the inexperienced in people of low incomes
applying this asymmetry to the case

83
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:17,960
at hand.

84
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,580
The court observed the consumers
who turned to USCC for help.

85
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,230
We're financially troubled and distraught.
Some were unemployed or disabled.

86
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,620
Many were facing the loss of
their homes through foreclosure.

87
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,420
These factors were
indicative of imposition.

88
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,520
They had nothing to do with what the
contract said, that substantive terms,

89
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:44,300
but it helped explain how
these unfair terms came about.

90
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,590
So let's imagine the following quiz.

91
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,480
A large manufacturer enters into a routine
contract to purchase a large number

92
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,910
of widgets from one of its suppliers.

93
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,960
Also a large company after
signing the contract.

94
00:07:00,961 --> 00:07:02,610
But before accepting delivery,

95
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,030
the manufacturer learns at
several alternative suppliers,

96
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,050
would have provided the same
number of widgets for 30% less.

97
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:15,470
Can the manufacturer assert
an unconscionability defense
under fleet and get out

98
00:07:15,781 --> 00:07:18,660
of the contract?
No.

99
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,950
Even assuming that the manufacturer
could show the price was unfair.

100
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:28,250
This hypothetical is missing the
element of procedural unconscionability.

101
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,280
It's missing evidence that there
was a defect in the process.

102
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,200
The contracts in fleet.

103
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:39,780
We're between a professional
seller exploiting vulnerable,
vulnerable consumers.

104
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:45,110
The manufacturer in this example is a
large sophisticated company engaged in

105
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:47,190
routine business transactions.

106
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:54,010
Standard form contracts presented on
a take it or leave it basis or often

107
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:57,320
referred to as contracts of adhesion.

108
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:02,980
California courts have taken the lead in
holding that a contract of adhesion is

109
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,590
always procedurally unconscionable.

110
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:11,990
The unconscionability question in
California then boils down to whether the

111
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:16,991
bargain is sufficiently unconscionable
from a substantive standpoint to warrant

112
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,980
non-enforcement not withstanding
California's position.

113
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:26,870
However, contracts of adhesion
are generally enforceable. Thus,

114
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:31,871
while the phrase contract of
adhesion has a pejorative overtone,

115
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:37,810
it's important to keep in mind that most
adhesive contracts will be judicially

116
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,813
enforced.

117
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:44,050
Merely are to merely arguing that your
clients signed a standardized contract,

118
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,940
a contract of adhesion that was presented
on a take it or leave it basis will

119
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:54,680
not normally be sufficient to avoid the
finding of an enforceable agreement.

120
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,820
If this were not the case,

121
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
internet commerce would be dead because
virtually all internet purchases come

122
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,000
via click it or leave it.
Contract shall offers.

123
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,440
The unconscionability doctrine might
be conceptualized merely as a default.

124
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:17,990
If a seller cures the procedural defects
in formation and the consumer still

125
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:21,090
consents to a substantively
one sided contract,

126
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,560
the doctrine at least as a conceptual
matter would allow enforcement.

127
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,060
But to my mind,

128
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:31,890
a fair reading of the of these
unconscionability cases suggests that

129
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:35,010
unconscionability is
more of a mandatory rule.

130
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:40,490
While fine print procedural defects
can be remedy other defects concerning

131
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:45,930
consumers circumstances and the
party's relative bargaining power,

132
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,220
uh, are virtually impossible
to cure. So that the doctrine,

133
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,630
the doctrine substantive cap on one side,

134
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,670
sidedness represents a mandatory
restriction on freedom of contract.

135
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,250
Let's end with a hypothetical.

136
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:07,820
A pharmacist in a small town in a
mountain valley typically sells medicine x

137
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,750
over the counter for $5 and has
a good inventory for the winter.

138
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,410
There are no other drug
stores of violence.

139
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,680
No storm closes in the
valley with 30 foot dress.

140
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:25,040
And now outbreak of illness creates
a demand for this very medicine.

141
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:30,380
The pharmacist has enough in stock to
supply everyone who's ill but now charges

142
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,220
$25 per bottle on a take
it or leave it basis most.

143
00:10:35,221 --> 00:10:36,770
Take it two days later,

144
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:40,850
a cal helicopter lands
with enough medicine, uh,

145
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,630
for everyone at $5.

146
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,200
Those who took it demand their
money back should they get it.

147
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,820
And what about the nonlegal
sanctions against the pharmacist?

148
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,171
Well,

149
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:57,171
there are some statutes prohibiting price
gouging during a weather disruptions

150
00:10:57,451 --> 00:10:58,500
in the marketplace.

151
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:03,310
These statutes are inconsistent
with one type of, uh,

152
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:08,610
efficiency theory. If the blizzard
makes medicine more valuable,

153
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:11,460
it's efficient for a
pharmacist to raise the price,

154
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,210
even if the current
inventory was presumably, uh,

155
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:19,590
was purchased by the store at
a lower pre blizzard price.

156
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:25,220
Price Gouging gives the stores better
incentives to stock larger quantities and

157
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:29,730
make sure that the medicine ends up in
the hands of the highest value in users.

158
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:30,781
Instead,

159
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:35,310
the price gouging statutes tend to
randomly distribute the medicine or force

160
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:39,060
higher value users to waste
efforts racing to the stores.

161
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,710
This is not to say that the
price gouging statutes are wrong.

162
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:48,290
Sometimes equity, Trump's
efficiency concerns, uh, uh,

163
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,140
in the public consciousness
and in our laws. Well,

164
00:11:52,141 --> 00:11:53,680
let's review today.

165
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:58,270
We talked about the unconscionability
doctrine and under the unconscionability

166
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:03,271
doctrine and contract will not be enforced
if it's terms or seriously unfair to

167
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,790
one of the parties. However, such such,

168
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:11,200
such substantive unfairness is not
usually enough to set aside a contract.

169
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,390
The Complaining Party must
also demonstrate some flaw
in the bargaining process

170
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,240
that allowed the unfair terms to arise.
