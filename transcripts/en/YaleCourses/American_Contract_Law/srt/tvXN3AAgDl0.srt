1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,980
You've probably purchased something over
the phone or online at some point in

2
00:00:04,981 --> 00:00:05,814
your life.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,150
After giving your credit card information
and any and pain for the item it's

4
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:14,490
shipped to you.
Often that shipment contains,

5
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:18,900
in addition to whatever you
bought a document containing
terms and conditions of

6
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:19,734
the sale.

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,840
Such documents often include warranty
information and information about dispute

8
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:27,240
resolution such as an arbitration clause.

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,960
Are you bound by the
terms of that document?

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,900
Today we're going to compare two cases.

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,930
The first decided by the seventh circuit
in 1997 the second by the District

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,750
Court for Kansas three years later that
addressed this question but reached

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,390
opposite conclusions in both hill and Clo.

14
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:51,234
Check.

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,280
The plaintiffs purchase computers from
the defendant company over the phone and

16
00:00:56,281 --> 00:01:01,020
received shipments containing the products
that offered the shipments contained

17
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:03,930
as well.
A list of terms in hill.

18
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:08,790
Those terms gave the purchaser 30 days
in which to return the computer if they

19
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:12,600
didn't agree to the terms and
included in arbitration clause.

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,840
Enclosed check the terms declared that
the purchasers of retaining the computer

21
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:23,010
for more than five days after the date
of delivery constituted acceptance of the

22
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:27,270
terms and similarly included
an arbitration clause.

23
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,820
The plaintiffs in both cases sued gateway
after performance problems with the

24
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:34,950
computers.
In both cases,

25
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:39,900
the company claimed the plaintiffs were
bound by the arbitration clause in the

26
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:44,100
terms and conditions because
the plaintiffs kept their
computers for longer than

27
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:48,210
the time period set forth in
those terms and conditions.

28
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,770
Hill was decided by
judge Frank Easterbrook.

29
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,890
Easterbrook had previously issued an
influential opinion in pro CD versus

30
00:01:58,321 --> 00:01:59,250
Zeidenberg,

31
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,440
a case that presented similar issues
and which shaped the judge's opinion in

32
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:06,720
hill in pro CD.

33
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,840
Easterbrook held that terms inside a
shipment of software contractually bound

34
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:17,901
consumers who use the software after
they had an opportunity to read the terms

35
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,400
and reject them by returning the product.

36
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,760
The same logic applied Easterbrook said
in hill crucial to the decision was the

37
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:32,361
judge's understanding of when the contract
between Hill and gateway was actually

38
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:33,324
formed.

39
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,780
The judge denied that the contract was
formed when hill paid for the computer

40
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:40,140
and gateway delivered it,

41
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,980
which would mean that the terms were
not part of the original agreement.

42
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,370
Instead relying on the principal
derived from UCC to tool for that,

43
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:54,891
a vendor as master of the offer may invite
acceptance by conduct and may propose

44
00:02:55,321 --> 00:03:00,321
limitations on the kind of conduct that
constitutes acceptance a buyer make,

45
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:05,470
except by performing the acts the
vendor proposes to treat as acceptance.

46
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:11,130
Easterbrook concluded that gateway
invited a hill to accept by keeping the

47
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:17,200
computer after receiving
the terms and conditions.

48
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,590
The arbitration clause was thus part of
the contract and bound the plaintiffs.

49
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:27,010
It didn't matter that the plaintiffs
didn't read the terms because they had the

50
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:30,070
opportunity and responsibility to do so.

51
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,870
The District Court of Kansas disagreed
it explicitly rejected hill when it

52
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:39,370
decided clo check versus gateway.

53
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,360
The court in Kansas stated at the outset
of it's opinion that the fact that Clo

54
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:51,421
check paid gateway for a computer and
received that product from gateway quote

55
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:56,140
clearly demonstrates a contract
for the sale of a computer unquote.

56
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,530
It took issue with Eastern
Brooks categorization of
the defendant as the quote

57
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,290
master of the offer and his conclusion
that gateway conditioned acceptance on

58
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:11,890
the plaintiff's assent to the term
and conditions in the shipment.

59
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,340
The defendant had offered no evidence
that either of these things was the case

60
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,040
more significantly.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,650
The district court argued that the
seventh circuit had incorrectly concluded

62
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:31,540
that the UCC section two two oh
seven did not apply to these cases.

63
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,940
UCC Two two oh seven is the famous battle
of the forms provision that we just

64
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:41,941
spoke about in the last class as we
just discussed in this textile unlimited

65
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:42,814
case.

66
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,880
Two Two oh seven provides if a contract
is formed with a confirmation that

67
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:53,851
includes additional terms under
subsection one then that operates as an

68
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:54,814
acceptance.

69
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:00,210
The additional terms are to be construed
as proposals for a additions to the

70
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:03,430
contract unless both parties are merchants

71
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,950
as the opinion notes.
The plaintiff was not a merchant,

72
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:14,310
so under Kansas interpretation of the UCC
and this is the UCC section two two oh

73
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:19,450
seven, if either party is not a
merchant, the additional terms,

74
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:24,451
our proposals for additions to the
contract and do not become part of the

75
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:28,870
contract unless the original
offer war expressly agrees.

76
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,690
The court concluded that the fact,
uh,

77
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:37,790
the clo check kept the computer for
more than five days was not sufficient

78
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:41,050
evidence that he expressly
agreed to the additional terms.

79
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,040
And for that reason the plaintiff
was not bound by those terms,

80
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,170
including the arbitration clause.

81
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:53,850
Easterbrook provided policy justifications
for his holding asserting that

82
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:59,190
writing a provides benefits for both
sides of commercial transaction.

83
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,850
Customers as a group are better off
when vendors skip costly and ineffectual

84
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:06,950
steps such as telephone,

85
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:11,600
recitations and use instead a
simple approve or returned device.

86
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,220
It's probably true that consumers would
not want to sit through and over the

87
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:21,050
phone recitation of pages of terms
and conditions before completing the

88
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:25,610
purchase. But as Easter fair to
suggest, these are the only options.

89
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,510
A footnote and Khloe check
offered another possibility.

90
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,790
It said quote,

91
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,960
the court is mindful of the practical
considerations which are involved in

92
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:40,370
commercial transactions but it's not
unreasonable for a vendor to clearly

93
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:45,371
communicate to a buyer at the time of
sale either the complete terms of the sale

94
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:51,550
or the fact that the vendor will propose
additional terms as a condition of sale

95
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,540
if that be the case.

96
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:59,110
What if the gateway representative on
the phone and on the phone call at which

97
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:03,320
the purchase took place simply inform the
consumer that the forthcoming computer

98
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:08,210
shipment would contain important terms
and conditions that gateway considered a

99
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:09,440
part of the contract.

100
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,880
These cases provide a good introduction
to the concept of the rolling contract.

101
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:21,460
Such contracts are formed over time with
one party providing terms in batches,

102
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,360
some before a given item is
ordered and others later,

103
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:31,760
but often the latter batch of terms are
unlikely to be read and will be accepted

104
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,320
by conduct.

105
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:38,350
Is it fair to make increasing use of such
contracts when the offer war is aware?

106
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,050
The terms probably will
never be seen or understood

107
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,000
despite the disagreement
we see in these two cases.

108
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,300
The seventh circuit's ruling in
hill is no longer controlling,

109
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:54,950
at least over cases governed
by Illinois law. In 2006,

110
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:59,951
the Illinois Supreme Court decided in
razor versus Hyundai Motor that a warranty

111
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:03,800
containing a disclaimer
of consequential damages,

112
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,660
which is which was in the owner's manual
of a glove compartment of the car.

113
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,640
The plaintiff in the case had purchased,

114
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:15,020
was not part of the car sale contract
because it wasn't made available to the

115
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:18,440
purchaser at or before
the purchase of the car,

116
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,910
the district court for the
northern district of Illinois.

117
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:26,911
I recognize that the razor decision
was not was now controlling rather than

118
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:28,340
hill,
uh,

119
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:32,240
in a separate case to Hylo
versus apple computer.

120
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,120
So what have we learned?

121
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:40,390
We were introduced to rolling contracts
in particular to accept a return terms

122
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,820
that accompany customer ordered goods.

123
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:48,110
We saw two different cases laid
out opposite lines of reasoning,

124
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:52,190
the first enforcing the acceptor
or return terms, the latter,

125
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:57,050
rejecting them and exploring policy
arguments and potential compromises for

126
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,890
these kinds of transactions.
And once again,

127
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:05,570
we see that generally it's a good idea
to read carefully the documents that come

128
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,710
with your purchases.
