1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:06,590
Imagine that person x signs a contract
with person y whereby x agrees to pay.

2
00:00:07,861 --> 00:00:12,861
Why $10,000 and why agrees to shoot person
z if the parties failed to carry out

3
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:16,110
their promises,

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,160
you probably feel that
as an intuitive matter,

5
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:24,480
no court would enforce the party's
agreement in order damages for breach of

6
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:28,080
contract. That intuition
is correct, but why?

7
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,630
One important reason is because of the
negative externalities of the agreement

8
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:35,250
with regard to person Z.

9
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,030
I've said in the past that the formation
defenses can be seen as policing the

10
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:47,181
revealed preference inference to make
sure that the contract is value enhancing.

11
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,450
Formation defenses tend to render
contracts voidable when courts aren't

12
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:57,750
confident that the agreement really
is in the party's joint interest,

13
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:03,470
but illegality doctrine sets aside
contracts when the agreement may not be

14
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:08,520
welfare enhancing because of net
negative effects on people outside the

15
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:09,354
contract.

16
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,770
The illegality defense can thus set aside
contracts even when there is no defect

17
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:18,060
in the bargaining process.

18
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,130
Even if the parties manifests sufficient
ascent courts can set aside the

19
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:28,131
agreement if one of the promises exchanged
is illegal or violates public policy.

20
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,900
As we will see,

21
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:35,901
the circumstances in which questions of
illegality or public policy arise are

22
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:39,870
often much less clear cut than
the hired shooting example.

23
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:44,730
Above determining when an agreement is
illegal shouldn't prove too difficult,

24
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,200
but how should a court determine if
an agreement violates public policy?

25
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,260
To take one example,

26
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,580
consider a class of agreements known
as Allie [inaudible] contracts.

27
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,570
Aliya Tory comes from the Latin word for
die and Alia Tory promise is a promise,

28
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:09,180
the performance of which depends on
the occurrence of some fortuitous event

29
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:10,014
occurring.

30
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:15,050
Perhaps the most common example of of
of Aliya Tory promises are found in

31
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:18,180
insurance contracts.
If you have fire insurance,

32
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:21,480
your insurer does not
have to pay unless you,

33
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,120
unless and until your property burns.

34
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,790
Generally these agreements
are enforceable,

35
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,230
but common law has long viewed
gambling as against public policy.

36
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:36,710
The line between enforceable Aliya Tory
agreements and unenforceable wagers can

37
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:39,090
become blurry indeed.

38
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,650
Why does public policy prohibit
the ladder but not the former?

39
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,510
One possible explanation,

40
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:50,511
at least for these examples is that
buying insurance is usually a responsible

41
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,950
risk.
Mitigating decision.

42
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,120
Gambling by contracts
creates artificial risk.

43
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,020
Problem often hurts the
gambler's loved ones.

44
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,590
While we don't even have the
category of problem ensuring

45
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,440
historically courts typically took a
hard line against enforcing illegal

46
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:18,571
contracts according to the
first restatement of contracts
and it's section five

47
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:24,601
12 a bargain is illegal within the
meaning of the restatement if either it's

48
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:30,001
formation or its performance is criminal
tortious or otherwise opposed to public

49
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:31,174
policy.

50
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,450
As the comments to this section make clear
and agreement could be illegal either

51
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:42,050
because the statute specifically
prescribed the conduct
which was the agreement

52
00:03:42,051 --> 00:03:47,051
subject or because courts had determined
that such agreements were opposed to

53
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,040
public policy and common example of the
ladder comes with contracts in restraint

54
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:55,114
of marriage.

55
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,600
If John Doe agrees to pay Richard Rowe
a thousand dollars in return for Richard

56
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:03,640
agreeing not to Mary Jane,

57
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,320
Courts will not enforce that agreement
even if the prohibition against

58
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:12,760
contractual restraints on marriage had,
has not been codified.

59
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,630
It though it has in many jurisdictions.
Traditionally,

60
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:21,631
courts will not order either party to
an illegal agreement to make any payment

61
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,070
to a another.

62
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,640
If a bargain was illegal under five 12
and both parties were in Perry dialect to

63
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:36,871
that is equally blameworthy section
five 98 provided that a party to that

64
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:42,790
agreement could quote neither
recover damages for breach thereof,

65
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:47,820
nor by rescinding the bargain and recover
the performance that he has rendered

66
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,920
they're under or its value unquote.

67
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:56,550
If you pay a scalper for a ticket when
the sale is prohibited by law courts

68
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,070
under the re first restatement standard
would normally not force the scalper to

69
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:04,780
give you your money back.

70
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,270
It seems unfair that people like the
scalper would come away with a windfall,

71
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:15,040
but the comment provided adjustive
justification for this effect, it's,

72
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:20,070
it's at further deterrence according
to the comment denying the plaintiff's.

73
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:21,671
In such cases,

74
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:26,170
recovery quote tends to diminish
the number of illegal agreements.

75
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,550
Ticket purchasers may be less
likely to pay for tickets.

76
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,800
If the law says the scalper can take the
money and run the no restitution rule

77
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:41,260
helps support the maxim of there
being no honor among thieves.

78
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,333
In fact,

79
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:47,050
while most of the formation defenses
try to police certain types of sharp

80
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:52,051
dealing illegality is a circumstance
where the law is trying to facilitate and

81
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:58,591
foster opportunism in order to
drive out illegal contracting.

82
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:05,690
There are limited exceptions to this
no restitution rule. Section 600,

83
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:06,500
uh,

84
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,500
provided an exception for s when there
was slight illegality where no law

85
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:15,680
prohibited the agreement
and there was no quote,

86
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:19,160
serious moral turpitude involved.
Uh,

87
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:23,660
these are circumstances where the equity
seem to Trump the strategic impulse to

88
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:28,280
deter illegal contracting.
The second restatement,

89
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:28,800
however,

90
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,800
has introduced a more flexible balancing
test on enforcability of illegal

91
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:36,224
agreements.

92
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,500
According to section one 78 of the
second restatement subsection one,

93
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:46,460
a promise or other term of agreement
is unenforceable on grounds of public

94
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:47,294
policy.

95
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:52,390
If legislation provides
that is unenforceable or the
interest in its enforcement

96
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:58,481
is clearly outweighed in the circumstances
by a public policy against the

97
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:00,560
enforcement of its terms.

98
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:06,190
Subjection to offers factors in the
interest of enforcing an agreement,

99
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,850
terms that which include the parties,
justified expectations,

100
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:15,950
any forfeiture that would result if the
enforcement were denied and any specific

101
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:17,630
public interest in enforcement.

102
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,830
Subsection three list factors
weighing against enforcement,

103
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,780
which include the strength of the public
policy and question as manifested by

104
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,940
legislation or judicial decisions.

105
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,160
The likelihood that failing to enforce a
term would further the public policy in

106
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:34,994
question,

107
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:40,210
the seriousness and deliberateness of
any misconduct involved and the nature of

108
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:44,390
the connection between the
misconduct and the terms in question.

109
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:49,250
Under the second restatement courts
have significantly more discretion to

110
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:53,400
determine whether to enforce
an agreement even if it, uh,

111
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,220
may violate public policy.

112
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,650
Let's look now at a case that
raises some of these questions.

113
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,080
Sign our versus Laroy,

114
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:08,140
which was decided by the Supreme Court
of Washington in 1954 sign are a grocery

115
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:14,120
store owner applied to the Washington
state liquor control board for a license

116
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:19,050
to sell beer. But his application
was denied. He and le I,

117
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:24,070
a friend of his agreed that he would
pay laroy $450 so that Laroy could get a

118
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:30,020
city official. Leroy new to
secure our sign are a license.

119
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,330
If this was unsuccessful,

120
00:08:32,331 --> 00:08:36,800
the Roy would return the
$450 back to sign our sign.

121
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:39,530
Our did not get his license and the,

122
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,930
I did not return the bribe money.

123
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,620
The sign are sue to recover the funds
and at trial the Roy did not raise an

124
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:53,291
illegality defense and the trial court
found for sign are on appeal to the State

125
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,720
Supreme Court.
The Roy raise the defense of illegality.

126
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:03,140
And the first question before the court
was whether illegality as a procedural

127
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:06,510
matter could be raised for
the first time on appeal.

128
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,230
Usually parties are procedurally barred
from raising defenses on appeal that

129
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:15,570
we're not pled at the trial stage,

130
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,250
but the court held not only that Laurel,
I could raise it,

131
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,760
but also that the court could bring up
illegality on its own Sua sponte quote,

132
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,920
illegality if of a serious
nature need not be pleaded.

133
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,870
If it appears in the evidence,

134
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:37,920
the court of its own motion will
deny relief to the plaintiff.

135
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,900
The defendant cannot waive the
defense if he wishes to do so. Indeed,

136
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,970
if the court's suspects illegality,

137
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,010
it may examine witnesses and develop
facts not brought out by the parties and

138
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:54,240
thereby establish illegality that
precludes recovery by the plaintiff.

139
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:59,640
Why do you think that the court resolve
this issue where the court of its own

140
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:03,870
motion can raise the question and
decide the question of illegality?

141
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,891
Well,

142
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:09,450
probably it's because
illegality implicates the
public interest to a far greater

143
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:14,451
extent than other defenses that a
defendant might raise in a contractual

144
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:15,654
dispute.

145
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,960
The negative externalities of illegality
mean that courts shouldn't rely on

146
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:26,070
private incentives of the parties
to raise the, uh, the defense.

147
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,100
It was clear that there was in
fact illegality in this case.

148
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:37,860
So the next question became whether
that fact would bar the plaintiff from

149
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:38,694
recovery.

150
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:43,970
Not every instance of illegality the
court suggested would necessarily have the

151
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:50,070
result of barring a restitution.
If,

152
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:50,611
however,

153
00:10:50,611 --> 00:10:55,611
the illegality is not serious and
neither public policy nor statute clearly

154
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:57,660
requires denial of relief.

155
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,870
Courts refuse to give effect to facts
showing illegality unless those facts are

156
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:08,121
essential to establish a prime aphasia
right of recovery or a pleaded by the

157
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:13,440
defendant. This however was not
such a case. According to the court,

158
00:11:13,441 --> 00:11:18,441
the illegality at issue was of a serious
nature and concerned a matter which is

159
00:11:19,381 --> 00:11:23,430
exclusively within the realm
of public policy. Further,

160
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:28,431
the evidence suggested that the parties
planned on using only illegal means,

161
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,600
presumably bribery of a city
official to accomplish their aims.

162
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,531
Therefore,

163
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:39,360
the court asserted it would not knowingly
aid in the furtherance of an illegal

164
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:43,140
transaction, but we'll leave
the parties where it finds them.

165
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:49,190
Think about this result Laroy ends up
$450 richer than he was before signing on

166
00:11:51,431 --> 00:11:52,740
to this illegal agreement.

167
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,010
Given what we have discussed
from the restatements,

168
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:02,250
what do you think of the court's
reasoning is by not furthering an illegal

169
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:04,180
transaction,

170
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:09,330
the court hopes to deter such transactions
from being made in the first place.

171
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,360
This deterrence focused policy
reflects an ex ante efficiency concern,

172
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:21,040
or at least it's consistent with such
an ex ante concern at the expense of

173
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,530
expos.
Concerns about fairness.

174
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,320
This is a common tension in the law.

175
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:30,190
Think about which you find
more compelling in this case,

176
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,850
but by the way,
even from an ex ante perspective,

177
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:39,570
we'll this no restitution result really
reduced the number of illegal contracts.

178
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:45,520
If the rule is known, it should reduce
the willingness of bribers to bribe,

179
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,680
but it should also increase the
willingness of Bri bees to take bribes.

180
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:56,370
Imagine instead that we wanted to deter
employers from hiring undocumented

181
00:12:57,191 --> 00:12:58,024
workers.

182
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:03,160
The no restitution rule would mean that
employers could hire and then refuse to

183
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:04,990
pay undocumented workers.

184
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,890
That might lead to more
employment of workers.

185
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:15,270
We might deter undocumented hiring more
by requiring employers to pay employees

186
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:19,360
three times what they promised.
