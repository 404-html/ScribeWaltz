1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,170
Previously through the Lefkowitz case,

2
00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:07,400
we discussed advertisements that
constituted contractual offers.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,780
Today we're going to continue discussing
the advertisements this time by

4
00:00:11,781 --> 00:00:16,781
examining and exceptionally entertaining
case Leonard Versus Pepsico,

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:22,810
which was decided by the southern district
of New York in 1999 hopefully after

6
00:00:24,261 --> 00:00:26,420
having considered these two cases,

7
00:00:26,421 --> 00:00:31,370
you'll think a bit differently or at least
more critically when you see an ad or

8
00:00:31,371 --> 00:00:32,204
commercial.

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,310
In the 1990s Pepsico
conducted a promotion.

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,040
The company allowed
consumers of its products,

11
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:45,041
most notably Pepsi and Diet
Pepsi to a Mass Pepsi points.

12
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,180
By purchasing those products,

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,600
those consumers could then use the Pepsi
points to buy specified merchandise.

14
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:58,010
They could then fill out and submit an
order catalog listing available products

15
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:02,840
and the respect of points they were worth.
In furtherance of this promotion,

16
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,170
Pepsico aired the following
television commercial

17
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:18,610
[inaudible]

18
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,830
as you just saw certain items
appearing in the commercial.

19
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:45,130
We're priced via subtitles with
various Pepsi point values,

20
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,170
a t shirt at 75 points,

21
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,410
sunglasses at 175 points,

22
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,800
a leather jacket at 1,450 points and of
course the commercial culminates with a

23
00:01:59,061 --> 00:02:02,570
Harrier jet landing.
At the teenagers high school.

24
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,580
The jet is shown with the
subtitle 7 million Pepsi points.

25
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,460
The Pepsi Co Order Catalog did
not include the Harrier jet.

26
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,900
Nevertheless,

27
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:19,250
the plaintiff attempted to redeem the
Harrier jet after submitting a check to

28
00:02:19,251 --> 00:02:24,251
the defendant for an amount sufficient
to purchase 7 million Pepsi points.

29
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,810
The company's promotion also permitted
consumers to purchase points directly at

30
00:02:29,811 --> 00:02:34,640
10 cents per point. After Pepsico
rejected the plaintiff's effort,

31
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,670
the plaintiff sued the plaintiff argued
that the advertisement displaying as it

32
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:45,611
did a Pepsi point number seemingly as
the price for the jet constituted a valid

33
00:02:46,851 --> 00:02:50,240
offer that he accepted
by submitting his check.

34
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,190
The defendant counter
that the advertisement was
clearly a joke and did not

35
00:02:55,191 --> 00:02:56,450
constitute an offer.

36
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,090
The southern district of New York agreed
with the defendant granting summary

37
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:04,720
Judgment to Pepsico.
Typically,

38
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:07,180
advertisements do not constitute offers.

39
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:12,310
Section 26 of the restatement second
of contracts which explains that a

40
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:17,311
manifestation of one's willingness to
enter a bargain does not itself constitute

41
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:22,180
an offer includes an official
comment that specifically addresses

42
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:25,030
advertisements.
That comment says,

43
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,220
business enterprises commonly secured
general publicity for the goods or

44
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:33,250
services they supply or purchase.

45
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,280
Advertisements are not ordinarily
intended or understood as offers to sell.

46
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,210
The same is true of catalogs,
price lists and circulars.

47
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,400
Even though the terms of suggested
bargains may be stated in some detail,

48
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,990
it is of course possible to make an
offer by an advertisement directed to the

49
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:53,830
general public,

50
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:59,250
but there must ordinarily be some language
of commitment or some invitation to

51
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:02,350
take action without further communication

52
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,870
as the restatements suggests,
and as we saw in Lefkowitz,

53
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,280
there are exceptions to the general
rule that advertisements are not offers.

54
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,330
Lefkowitz said that when
the advertisement is clear,

55
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,020
definite and explicit and leaves
nothing open for negotiation,

56
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,670
it constitutes and offer that creates
a binding contract upon acceptance.

57
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:30,330
But the restatement comment said that
even adds with term stated in some detail

58
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,470
may not constitute offers.

59
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,350
Might an ad need to clearly state that
is intended to serve as an offer in order

60
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:42,730
to be effective? Well, the answer is
under the restatement is possibly yes.

61
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,600
The comment also said that advertisements
are not ordinarily intended or

62
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:50,620
understood as offers to sell,

63
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,450
but under the objectivist
conception of contract formation,

64
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:00,690
we don't care what about whether the
offer or ordinarily intends or not.

65
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,970
For the communication to be an offer,

66
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,310
we care only about whether a reasonable
listener would interpret the ad as an

67
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:10,420
offer to sell.

68
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,900
Is it really true that a
reasonable listener would
ordinarily not understand an

69
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:18,990
ad to be an offer to sell?
Uh,

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,740
empowering the consumer to accept at
least say while reasonable supplies.

71
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,760
Last one problem with the
reasonable listener inquiry
is that it can be somewhat

72
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:34,060
indogenous. The law is looking at
what reasonable listeners think,

73
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,010
but reasonable listeners are simultaneous
simultaneously looking at what the law

74
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:39,844
things.

75
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:45,060
When a case like Lefkowitz or Leonard
says that ads are not to be trusted,

76
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,450
then reasonable listeners are less
likely to think that they are offers.

77
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,280
So from what you've
heard of the commercial,

78
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,620
what would constitute
acceptance by the plaintiff?

79
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,870
Intuitively we'd think payment of the
points would constitute acceptance.

80
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:07,850
But how would the plaintiff pay the
Po those points and to whom that the

81
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:09,530
commercial does not give us?

82
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,620
The answer is a primary reason why the
court held that the commercial did not

83
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:18,590
constitute an offer. In
the court's words, quote,

84
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,480
the commercial was not definite because
it reserve details of the offer to a

85
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:28,370
separate writing the catalog and did not
explain the steps necessary to accept

86
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:29,204
the offer.

87
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,550
The catalog of course which actually
constituted the companies offer did not

88
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:39,551
list the jet recall as well that the
advertisement said issue in Lefkowitz said

89
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:41,750
first come first serve.

90
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,420
The Pepsi Co commercial had no similar
limiting language as to quantity,

91
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,050
which meant that on the plaintiff's
theory the company would have to provide a

92
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:56,051
jet to every individual who amassed or
purchase the requisite Pepsi points.

93
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,550
The lack of such language also made the
commercial to indefinite to constitute

94
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:05,600
an offer because viewers of the commercial
probably wouldn't believe Pepsico

95
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:09,920
would risk the possibility that more
people would accept and the company had

96
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:13,970
Harrier jets to provide.
Here's a question to consider though.

97
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,300
Imagine the leather jacket depicted in
the commercial for 1,450 points was not

98
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:22,010
listed in the catalog,

99
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:27,250
but the plaintiff wanted it and attempted
similar similarly to redeem a Pepsi

100
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:32,780
points to get that merchandise
with the result have been the same.

101
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,150
It's similarly indefinite,

102
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:39,710
but the lack of limiting language is
certainly less of an issue for an article

103
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,660
of easily produced clothing.

104
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,080
The fact that supposedly offer wouldn't
seem objectively unreasonable or joking

105
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,290
and we'll talk about
joking in a few minutes,

106
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,610
would probably weigh heavily
in the court's analysis. Now,

107
00:07:55,611 --> 00:08:00,140
Judge Cardozo might've reached a
different result in this case. Remember,

108
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:05,350
Justice Cardozo was the great
implied in Lucy Lady Duff Gordon,

109
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,550
and in the Allegheny college case,
would it really be so hard to imply,

110
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,040
uh,
uh,

111
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:17,070
a term that the offer was only good while
reasonable supplies last to avoid the

112
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,760
prospect of unlimited demand?

113
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,950
Implying additional terms could
resolve a lot of the indefiniteness,

114
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,160
uh, found in this commercial and this, um,

115
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,560
implying extra terms is already a standard
part of the law of offers which teach

116
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:40,910
us that offers can be accepted
by any reasonable means.

117
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,980
The plaintiff also argued and the court
rejected the theory that the commercial

118
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:53,231
represented the kind of reward offer that
we learned about in the carbolic smoke

119
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:59,130
ball case reward advertisements like
the one in carbolic are meant to induce

120
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:01,470
viewers to perform a specific action,

121
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:06,960
but the Pepsico advertisement did not
do this at most. The court found it.

122
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,580
It hurts viewers of Pepsico's commercial
to buy its products and accumulate

123
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:15,540
points and then look at the catalog
and figure out how to redeem them.

124
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,890
The Pepsico opinion also discuss joking
offers that we earlier discussed.

125
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,930
Uh,
with regard to Lucy versus Zimmer,

126
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:30,590
the Pepsico court indicated that an ad
or other communication is not an offer if

127
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:35,120
the party claiming an offer existed.
Uh,

128
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:39,360
if the party who claimed that an offer
existed had reason to know that the offer

129
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:42,120
was made in jest.
In other words,

130
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,860
whether something is an offer or a
joke is governed by an objective test,

131
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,100
would an objectively reasonable listener
believe the commercial constituted a

132
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,250
serious offer?

133
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,710
The court gave reasons why it found
the advertisement was clearly ingest.

134
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:04,070
These included that the teenager and the
commercial was a highly probable pilot.

135
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:09,650
That traveling to school in a jet is
an exaggerated adolescent fantasy.

136
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,560
And that given the Harrier jets military
uses depiction of such a jet of such a

137
00:10:15,601 --> 00:10:20,010
jet as a way to get to school in
the morning is clearly not serious.

138
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:20,971
And finally,

139
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:25,971
and perhaps most compellingly amassing
the requisite Pepsi points by drinking

140
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:31,701
Pepsi would require drinking about
190 Pepsi's a day for 100 years.

141
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,490
So what have we learned?
First,

142
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,880
we reiterated the rules articulated
when advertisements constitute offers.

143
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:46,110
They're only going to be offered as if
the advertisement specifies a clear,

144
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:50,700
definite and explicit means of
acceptance and has explicit terms,

145
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,840
uh, and maybe indicates that
it intends to be an offer.

146
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,600
Let's and let's consider for
a moment the policies, uh,

147
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,440
arguments supporting this
rule of definiteness.

148
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,390
Why don't we want all that [inaudible]
ties mints to Constitute Offers?

149
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,040
Well,
advertisements,

150
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:12,330
especially commercials are viewed by a
huge number of people combined with the

151
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:16,870
period of time between the display of
the ad and a viewer is acceptance. Uh,

152
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,850
construing ads as offers would
inspire tons of litigation's,

153
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:25,650
which in turn might produce a chilling
effect on advertisements. Then again,

154
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,680
ads are trying to induce consumers to act.

155
00:11:28,681 --> 00:11:33,681
It might not be so inefficient to put
the burden on the speaker to state when

156
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:37,520
ads, uh, with stated prices, uh,

157
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,410
are merely solicitations.
Second,

158
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:46,010
we revisited the joking offers question
and the idea of unilateral reward

159
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:53,061
contracts that we first studied in Zimmer
and the carbolic smoke balls case with

160
00:11:53,441 --> 00:11:54,910
regard to joking offers,

161
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,120
we learned from Pepsico that
the acceptance of an offer
made in jest will not be

162
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:01,114
binding.

163
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,240
If an objectively reasonable listener
would not have believed that the person or

164
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:12,121
entity making the supposed offer was not
being serious because of Leonard Versus

165
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:13,810
Pepsico.

166
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:18,810
Federal judges are now in the business
of telling us why a commercial is funny.
