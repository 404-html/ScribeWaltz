1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:01,711
Today,

2
00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:06,711
we will learn about noncompete clauses
by examining the case of data management

3
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:12,441
versus green noncompete clauses are
increasingly relevant in our economy.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,520
The extent to which they
should be enforced is the
subject of our lesson today.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,790
Before we turn to the facts of the case,

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,970
let's talk a bit about noncompete clauses.

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,540
A noncompete clause or a covenant not
to compete is a provision under which an

8
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:34,821
employee agrees not to enter into or
start a similar profession or trade in

9
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:39,330
competition against his or her employer.

10
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,790
Why might an employer want their
employee to sign a noncompete clause?

11
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,010
Well, the main reason is that employers
may be concerned that their employee,

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,700
uh,
might reveal confidential information,

13
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:57,420
trade secrets or marketing strategies.
Uh,

14
00:00:57,421 --> 00:01:02,040
employees of course sign non compete
clauses because it's a condition of

15
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,380
employment for at least some employers.

16
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,620
In cases where employees
have some leverage,

17
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:12,621
they might sign a noncompete clause in
exchange for a higher salary or benefits

18
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,120
of some kind from the employer.

19
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,550
Employees might be willing to give up the
freedom of working for a competitor in

20
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:24,330
order to get a good job that might
provide them with some extra chaining or

21
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:29,250
hands on experience.
But a noncompete clause that's too broad,

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,460
either in its temporal
or geographic scope,

23
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,800
might prevent an employee from finding
any alternative employment in their

24
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:38,760
chosen field.

25
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,780
The facts and data management versus
green or simple defendants and employees.

26
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:49,941
Green and Van Camp signed a covenant
not to compete against plaintiff and

27
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:55,101
employer data management in Alaska for
five years following their termination.

28
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,050
Shortly after their termination,

29
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,200
defendants began to compete with the
plaintiffs who sought injunctive relief.

30
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,700
The trial court granted a preliminary
injunction and then summary judgment in

31
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:10,050
favor of defendants.

32
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,760
The instinct court clarified the law
to be applied and remanded the case.

33
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,090
There are two main issues in this case.

34
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:22,140
The first is whether the covenant was
overbroad and therefore against public

35
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:22,974
policy.

36
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,220
The second is whether the covenant as a
result of its over breadth is completely

37
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,100
unenforceable.

38
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,960
On the first question of whether the
covenant was overbroad and therefore

39
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:36,720
against public policy.
The court answered yes.

40
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,220
Under English common law overbroad
covenants not to compete.

41
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:46,350
We're under unenforceable under the
public policy doctrine. In effect,

42
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,530
preventing covenants that are
overbroad sets a ceiling or a cap on,

43
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,680
uh,
on their length covenants not to compete,

44
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,880
must be reasonable with regard to both
their length and their geographic scope.

45
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,180
There's a mandatory ceiling on the,
on this scope.

46
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,670
In this diagram you can think of,
uh,

47
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,740
there being a mandatory a ceiling on
the maximum duration of the Covenant and

48
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,960
uh,
not to compete.

49
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:21,961
The court finds that the covenant not to
compete for five years goes beyond this

50
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:28,060
cap, uh, and goes into
the non contractable zone.

51
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,020
Okay.

52
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,970
This immutable ceiling is similar to
the treatment of unconscionably high

53
00:03:34,971 --> 00:03:39,971
markups and the treatment of
unconscionably high liquidated damages,

54
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,200
uh, amounts, uh,

55
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:45,710
that operate as penalties
in these other contexts.

56
00:03:45,711 --> 00:03:50,711
The law also places mandatory caps on the
markups or the price or on the size of

57
00:03:51,951 --> 00:03:53,300
liquidated damages.

58
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,670
But the default rules are very different
in these, in these different contexts.

59
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:03,860
The default duration of a covenant
not to compete is zero years.

60
00:04:03,861 --> 00:04:08,030
If you leave out a covenant,
then there is no duration nuts,

61
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,710
you can immediately compete,

62
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,640
but the default price
is a reasonable price,

63
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,930
not a zero price and a default
damages our expectation,

64
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:21,800
not zero damages.
So from these examples,

65
00:04:21,801 --> 00:04:25,130
you can see that contract law,
uh,

66
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,870
can not only decide
what I default rule is,

67
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,680
but it can also limit the
alternatives to the default,

68
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:38,630
which the parties can choose by putting
on ceilings or floors and or somehow

69
00:04:38,631 --> 00:04:41,690
limiting what other
options they they go for.

70
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,000
Why is the mandatory ceiling imposed here?
Well,

71
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:52,001
one reason is that restraints
against Labor Race 13th Amendment,

72
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,950
uh,
type concerns.

73
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:59,780
Recall that the 13th Amendment van
slavery and involuntary servitude in the

74
00:04:59,781 --> 00:05:00,710
United States.

75
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,750
One argument is that the covenant not to
compete are unconstitutional restraints

76
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:10,751
on people's ability to provide
their labor in an open marketplace.

77
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:15,830
We also don't want a former employee
to become a ward of the state.

78
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,040
If employees are laid off and can't find
another job because of the covenant not

79
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:22,274
to compete,

80
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:27,310
they might have to rely on social security
payments or welfare payments of one

81
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,880
type or another.

82
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,300
This means the rest of society
picks up the tab for the noncompete.

83
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,470
Generally, when you see a mandatory
limitation on freedom of contract,

84
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:43,190
you should ask whether the limitation
can be justified in terms of extra

85
00:05:43,191 --> 00:05:45,890
analogies or paternalism concerns.

86
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,650
You can argue that both are in play here.

87
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,713
Okay.

88
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,510
After the court has found
the covenant to be overbroad,

89
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,430
it must address the second question,
what to do with the contract.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,710
The court often to reasonably alter
the covenant to make it enforceable.

91
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,580
The court has three main approaches to a
covenant that is overly broad that goes

92
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:13,040
beyond the mandatory ceiling.
First,

93
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,100
the court can choose not to
enforce the contract at all.

94
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,700
This court does not like this approach
because it quote may produce unduly harsh

95
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:23,360
results on quote,

96
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,930
but you might argue that we want harsh
results for deterrence purposes to deter

97
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,230
employers from putting in overbroad
covenants, not to compete.

98
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,570
The court's tone reflects its attitude
about the nature of the employers and

99
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:40,640
maybe the employee's behavior.

100
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,620
This may be a context where employers
actually know the law and the risk of over

101
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:50,390
breath. Second, the court
can use the blue pencil test.

102
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,840
The Blue Pencil allows alterations only
by the deletion of specific words in the

103
00:06:57,531 --> 00:06:58,364
covenant.

104
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,500
The court rejects this approach because
it's too dependent on the language of

105
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:06,260
the parties that the
parties happened to use.

106
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,950
The Blue Pencil rule is
a very mechanical rule,

107
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:14,030
but because some courts rely on it,

108
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:19,540
a parties might consider fallback language
indicating that the covenant will be

109
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:23,450
enforced for the longest period possible.

110
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:28,480
So party might say a covenant might read
this covenant lasts for five years or

111
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:31,640
for the longest period allowed by law.

112
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:37,270
The Blue Pencil rule arose because courts
are disinclined to rewrite contracts

113
00:07:38,211 --> 00:07:41,930
to add in their own language into it.
With the Blue Pencil rule,

114
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,570
courts don't have to write any new words,

115
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:47,720
they just have to strike offending words.

116
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,150
Sometimes a crafty court might be able
to strike a word or even just a digit.

117
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:53,841
For instance,

118
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:58,841
a 10 year noncompete clause might
become a one year noncompete clause by

119
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:04,160
striking the number zero.
The last approach,

120
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:09,190
the one adopted by the court in Green is
the reformulation of the contract to a

121
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:15,020
reasonable breadth. In this case, the
court adopts this approach and uh,

122
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,530
unless the contract was
not drafted in good faith,

123
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,390
if it was drafted in bad faith, the
contract wouldn't be enforced altogether.

124
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,950
When parties violate a
mandatory limitation,

125
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:31,550
there are two generic legal responses.
First,

126
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:36,020
the law can substitute the provision
that comes closest to what the parties

127
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:41,021
contracted for for that result is depicted
in this slide by moving the parties

128
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,040
to a covenant just
below the mandatory Cap.

129
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,350
Alternatively,

130
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,420
the law can punish one or both of the
contractors for violating the mandatory

131
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:54,260
limitation.

132
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:59,770
That result is depicted in this slide
by moving the parties to a covenant with

133
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:04,380
zero duration. It's a poor length with
regard to an employer's preferences.

134
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:09,381
Then what the employer might have been
able to contract for non compete clauses

135
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,850
also appear in the sale of a business.
Well,

136
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:19,680
why would a buyer and seller of a
business want a noncompete clause?

137
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,950
Usually the vendor of a business will
promise not to compete with the purchaser

138
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:29,850
to ensure the value of the
business being sold. For instance,

139
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,540
suppose that Robert
Sells Sally his bakery,

140
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,720
Sally will likely demand that Robert
sign a noncompete to not open up a new

141
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:44,001
bakery next door because that would
undermine most of the value of the bakery

142
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,350
salary.
Sally just bought

143
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:52,910
the covenant not to compete has been the
source of prolific litigation and Ohio

144
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:58,431
Court once wrote that there is so much
authority on noncompete that it can be

145
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:03,420
compared to a c that will
drown the legal researcher.

146
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,280
US jurisdictions approach
noncompete clauses differently.

147
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,440
While the majority of us states
recognize and enforced various forms of

148
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,300
noncompete agreements,

149
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:20,190
a few such as California show great
hostility toward the enforcement of

150
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,300
covenants not to compete in general,

151
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,020
courts focus upon two
aspects of a covenant,

152
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,640
whether it protects some
legitimate interest of the promise,

153
00:10:31,641 --> 00:10:34,230
see and whether it's reasonable and scope.

154
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,960
When it comes to the sale of a business,

155
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:41,730
courts tend to be more favorably disposed
toward covenants that are ancillary to

156
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:43,080
the sale load business.

157
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,970
Then toward those that restrict and
employees competitive activities. Uh,

158
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,680
covenant ancillary to the sale of a
business is usually seen as protective of

159
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:57,681
the goodwill being sold with respect to
the employee's covenant where the Party

160
00:10:58,621 --> 00:11:01,350
does not have a special or unique skill.

161
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,570
The usual attempt is protect by
precluding the use of trade secrets,

162
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,440
confidential information,
customer lists, and the like.

163
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,220
The reasonableness test deals primarily
with the area and types of companies

164
00:11:17,671 --> 00:11:20,610
covered as well as the
duration of the covenant.

165
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:25,530
And it is here that efforts are
frequently made as in the instant case to

166
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:30,390
convince a court that the excessive
parts should be excised leaving and tack

167
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:32,130
that which is reasonable.

168
00:11:32,131 --> 00:11:37,131
Both as with regard to space and time
efforts are thus made to sever or divide

169
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:42,330
the legal portion from the
portion which is illegal.

170
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:47,820
The geographic scope is increasingly
problematic because in the internet age,

171
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:51,780
many manufacturers find
themselves competing, uh,

172
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:55,450
online with producers from
anywhere in the world.

173
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,783
In summary,

174
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:03,330
a noncompete clause or covenant not to
compete often appears in an employment

175
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:06,880
contract or a sale of a business.

176
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,240
Noncompete clauses cannot be overbroad
and against public policy if they are

177
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:17,290
overbroad at court may choose to
not enforce the clause entirely.

178
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:22,710
Delete certain provisions using the blue
pencil rule or reformulate the contract

179
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:27,820
to what would be reasonable reformulation
is often the preferred approach

180
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,630
because it's not overly
harsh and is very flexible.
