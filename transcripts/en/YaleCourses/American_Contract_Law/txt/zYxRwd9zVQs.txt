Speaker 1:          00:00          Today we're going to talk about another classic of the Contracts Law Cannan Hoffman versus red owl stores. We've already discussed promissory Estoppel several times in red owl. We will revisit this concept, but in a different context. This case asks whether a plaintiff who relies on a defendant's pre contractual promises may recover. Joseph Hoffman, who together with his wife operated a bakery and walk Toma what Wisconsin and he wanted to expand his business by opening a grocery store. He contacted Red Owl, a grocery store chain operating throughout the Midwest. Read Al Stores. We're often operated as franchises. Hoffman Bay began negotiating with, uh, I read al manager named Luca wits to establish a red al franchise in Hoffman's town. Hoffman told the manager he only had $18,000 to invest in the franchise and Luca, what's told them that was sufficient. From here, there began a series of moves by Hoffman made on the belief that he'd soon be a red owl franchisee in order to gain experience in the grocery business.

Speaker 1:          01:24          He purchased a small grocery store in La Toma and move that Luca, what's approved, but several months into its successful operation. Luca, what's advised him to sell it though Hoffman did not want to sacrifice the profits the summer tourist season would bring, he was assured he'd be operating a larger red I'll store by the fall. In the fall, the Red Alga manager suggested Hoffman exercise an option to buy a lot in a different town. Chilton, where he would build his red al franchise. Hoffman took the suggestion and it's September of 1961 he put down $1,000 to acquire an option to later purchased the lot after Hoffman put down the thousand dollars on this Chilton Lot. Luca, what's indicated quote, everything is ready to go. We are set unquote. But soon thereafter, Luca Woods told Hoffman the only remaining hitch in the plan was Hoffman's bakery. He and his wife would have to sell it and they did.

Speaker 1:          02:30          So in November, uh, Hoffman sold the bakery. He and his family moved to a different town and he began working the night shift in another bakery at the end of November. Right. Alan Ford Hoffman, he'd need to invest $24,000 rather than the $18,000 he originally anticipated. This number was soon raised to $26,000 in order for Hoffman to meet these new amounts. Hoffman's father-in-law agreed to contribute $13,000 provided he'd be a partner in the business though. Read Al Originally told Hoffman that this sounded fine. Hoffman was informed in late January or early February of 1962 that his father in law would have to agree that the $13,000 contribution was a gift, right Al then increased the amount needed from Hoffman and his father in law to $34,000 and at that point Hoffman broke off negotiations. Hoffman sued Red Owl for expenses and lost income and the jury awarded him damages for the sale of the grocery store sale of his bakery and the option on the lot as well as incidental damages.

Speaker 1:          03:44          However, the trial judge vacated the damages awarded regarding the jury's award concerning the sale of the grocery and ordered a new trial, uh, to be held to determine what the damages on the sale of the grocery would be. Both Hoffman and Radel appealed and the Wisconsin Supreme Court in deciding this case, first determined that it was adopting section 90 of the restatement, which we've talked about before. So what are the elements of promissory Estoppel contained in section 90 that provision states that quote, a promise which the promise or should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the primacy or a third person and which doesn't do such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. The court in red owl concluded that read Al Gave Hoffman a number of promises and assurances upon which plaintiffs relied and acted upon to their detriment.

Speaker 1:          04:56          So what are some of the promises that Red Al made the most prominent was the promise that Hoffman's $18,000 would be sufficient, a sufficient investment. This is certainly the promise that proved most compelling to the court. And certainly the record suggests that red owl numerous times assured Hoffman he would soon get the store. But despite the number of promises the court asserts existed, it's actually somewhat difficult to pin down specific promises that read Al made to Hoffman rather read. Al told Hoffman things like we're all set and everything is ready to go. These uh, communications, these utterances certainly wouldn't be definite enough to constitute an offer to form a binding contract. This indeed was the thrust of Red Alice defense. It argued that quote again, agreement was never reached on factors necessary to establish a contract. The court had to determine whether promissory Estoppel could apply when the promise in question did not quote, embrace all essential details of her proposed transaction between promissory and promise.

Speaker 1:          06:15          See so as to be the equivalent of an offer that would result in a binding contract unquote in holding that promissory Estoppel could apply in this situation. The court explained that it was wrong to think of promissory Estoppel as the equivalent of breach of contract. The requirements of section 90 did not. The court said indicate anything at all about how detailed to given PR proposal was or how close it was to a binding contract. Having concluded that promissory Estoppel applied there remained the question of damages. The court explained where damages are awarded in promissory Estoppel instead of specifically enforcing the promises promise. They should be only such as in the opinion of the quarter necessary to prevent injustice. Focusing on the primary contested damage award, the sale of the grocery store about which the trial judge had ordered a new trial, the court responded to Hoffman's claim that he was entitled to the profits he would have had if he had continued to operating the store during those summer tourists month by emphasizing again, this is not a breach of contract action.

Speaker 1:          07:32          We usually see lost profits award as part of expectation damages where the goal of expectation damages is to put the plaintiff in the position he or she would have been in if a contract had actually been performed. In this case, the plaintiff recovered damages in reliance the detriment Hoffman incurred by relying on Red Alice representations and issue and assurances. Is there a way you could construe the profits lost by the sale of the grocery store as reliance damages? Well, absent read Alice assurances, he'd have a bigger red owl grocery store in the fall. Hoffman wouldn't have sold the grocery. On the other hand, he may not have purchased the grocery in the first place and would've had no profits to gain their buy if he hadn't initially began negotiating with red owl. Usually courts will not award lost profits when a plaintiff is pursuing a promissory Estoppel theory.

Speaker 1:          08:34          But in Walter's v Marathon oil, a seventh circuit case decided in 1981 which involved plaintiffs who purchased a gas station from, from marathon oil after the company represented it would provide gasoline. The court upheld the trial court's award of loss profits, quote in reliance upon appellant's promised to supply gasoline supplies to them a pal Lee's purchase the station and invested their funds and their time. It's unreasonable to assume that they did not anticipate a return of profits from this investment, but in reliance upon the appellant's promise, they had forgotten the opportunity to make the investment elsewhere. Returning to this case. In what other ways did Hoffman rely? Well, he purchased the what? Toma Grocery and later sold it. He paid $1,000 to option a lot and Chilton and he sold his bakery and move to a new town. Notice that the award doesn't give him damages for purchasing the [inaudible] grocery store that wasn't in reliance on definite enough of a promise from red owl or it was if it, if it was reliance, it wasn't reasonable.

Speaker 1:          09:50          At that early stage in the negotiation and reliance damages for selling the Watt Toma Grocery, we're going to be limited down. The court said quote, justice does not require that the damages awarded him because of selling these assets at the behest of the defendants should exceed any actual loss sustained measured by the difference between the sale price and the fair market value unquote. This doesn't directly award lost profits, but at least indirectly the fair market value should reflect the expected profits from the upcoming summer tourist season. So did red owl act in bad faith in its negotiations with Hoffman? The court concluded that it didn't. There was no evidence read Al intended not to keep any of its offers or its promises, but even if red al had acted in bad faith, there probably wouldn't. That probably wouldn't matter. The uniform commercial code imposes a duty of good faith as Amanda Tory part of all contracts, but while duties of good faith arise under a contract, negotiators typically don't owe each other any such duty duty.

Speaker 1:          11:09          Then again, the succession of increasing demand certainly creates the appearance of a kind of bait and switch strategy that read Al was stringing Hoffman along trying to get more and more out of this potential franchisee. The law of promissory fraud can hold a promise or liable for punitive damages if the plaintiff can establish that the promise or at the time of promising of making assurances intends not to perform a her promise red Al's repeated assurances probably aren't enough to establish promissory fraud but they are moving in that direction and important article by Professor Allan Farnsworth provides a way of thinking about pre contractual liability that offers some insights into why reliance damages are sometimes preferable. Farnsworth distinguishes between agreements to agree and agreements to negotiate. Unlike the former parties agreeing to negotiate, recognize that if they fail to reach and ultimate agreement they will not be bound because the agreement to negotiate is not part of a larger agreement.

Speaker 1:          12:29          There is no possibility of a claim for a lost expectation. Indeed, there's no way of knowing what the terms of an ultimate agreement might've been if one had ever been reached. In such cases, reliance is appropriate because that is the only interest, a party to an agreement to negotiate reasonably expects should the other party pull out of the negotiations. The case teachers, insurance and Annuity Association of America Versus Tribune Company. A case decided the same year Farnsworth article was published and which concerned failed negotiations for a 14 year $76 million loan federal District Court judge Pierre leval warning that there was a strong presumption against finding binding obligation in agreements to negotiate set out of five factor test to determine whether the parties had in fact entered in to such an agreement to negotiate these factors included the language of the agreement, the context of the negotiation with particular attention to the parties motives, the number of open terms, the extent to which the agreement had been performed and usage of trade.

Speaker 1:          13:52          Red Owl is considered an incredibly influential case which often decided as the catalyst in the expansion of promissory Estoppel doctrine to the liability for pre contractual reliance. The implication indeed are profound read. Alice suggests that parties must be very careful in negotiations, a realm in which representations are often taken with a grain of salt because reliance on such promises or representations may result in damages, but some argue that the result of Red Al is in fact unusual. Professor Alan Schwartz and Robert Scott studied over a hundred cases from 1999 to 2003 that directly presented the issue of recovery for precontract or alliance. Their research showed that courts consistently have denied recovery for pre contractual law reliance and less. The parties by agreeing on something significant indicated their intention to be bound. In a sense, the default not withstanding red owl and its progeny is that it's not reasonable to rely on pre contractual promises.
