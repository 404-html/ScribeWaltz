Speaker 1:          00:00          Today we discuss timing issues in contract formation by examining an English contract case from the 19th century Adams versus Lin. Saul was decided by the Court of Kings bench in 1818. The Court of Kings bench or Queen's bench, uh, was an English court of common law. While this might seem like an obsolete English case, it created an important common law rule. The mailbox rule. That's what it stands for, which teaches us when a mailed acceptance acceptance forms of contract. In this case, the defendant Lynn Zelle, was a wool dealer looking to sell wool. He sent a letter to the plaintiff buyer Adams offering to sell. We'll add a specified price to be delivered at a light Chester and to be paid for by two months. Bill in two months. However, the defendant miss directed this letter. In other words, he wrote down the wrong address and it took longer than expected for the letter to reach the plaintiff.

Speaker 1:          01:11          By the time the plaintiff got the letter and sent back his acceptance, it was two days after the expected deadline for acceptance. Unfortunately, by that time, the defendant had already sold that wool. The plaintiff sues the seller for nondelivery of wool. If you're still a bit confused, let's quickly review the chronology of events on Tuesday, September 2nd the seller sends the offer to the wrong address. It takes a whole three days before reaching the buyer. The buyer sends the acceptance on Friday, September 5th and it doesn't reach the seller until the following Tuesday. By that time, the seller had already sold the wool. The trial court found for plaintiffs afterward, defendant wins a rule Nisi order that there is no binding contract. A rule Nisi is an order in case you're wondering that may or may not have forest depending on whether a particular condition is satisfied. It's from the Latin word Nisi.

Speaker 1:          02:20          That means unless in this case the condition is unless the plaintiff can show cause. The plaintiff's lawyers show cause and trial judgment for plaintiff is affirmed. The main issue in this case is whether the plaintiff's acceptance is valid. When uh, it was mailed, the court held that yes, the acceptance is valid the moment it was mailed, the court reasoned that if it opted for the other rule that acceptance is valid. When the offer offer roar receives it, then the plaintiffs, uh, except doors ought not to be bound until after they had received notification that the defendant had received their answer and the sent it to it. And so it might go on Ad Infinitum, the court reasons that would be a bad result because it would lead to an infinite chain of correspondence confirming that the other person knew. The court realize that when a contract is formed at a distance, either the offer or war or the acceptor will not be able to know precisely when the contract is formed. In this case, the defendant offer or was responsible for the misdirected letter and hence for the predicament of contracting to sell the wool twice.

Speaker 1:          03:46          The so called mailbox rule suggested by this case applies. However, even when there is no misdirected initial offer, the rural can be found in restatement of contract, uh, uh, section 63 a that provision states that acceptance occurs as soon as it leaves the offer. Rees possession. In other words, the moment you put the acceptance in the mail box and can't take it back, the contract takes effect. Uh, there are a few justifications for the mailbox rule. A key reason is that the rule is merely a default. The offer war can always stipulate that communication is required before a contract formation. You can see that from the first sentence of section 63 a which specifies the rule is binding unless the offer provides otherwise under the mailbox rule the offer or is the last to know whether and when a contract is formed. Uh, but any offer or who doesn't like the result is free as master of her offer to say that the offer will only be accepted when notice of acceptance is received by the offer or section 63 sets the timing default against the party who is empowered to alter it.

Speaker 1:          05:16          Another justification is that after posting the seller is in the best position to know of a delay and to inquire all of this is aimed at protecting and offer re who does what is reasonable to ascent and assuming there is a contract relies on it. Furthermore, requiring more confirmation does not reduce mistake. It just shifts the burden to the other side. The last person to confirm will always be at an informational disadvantage because she will not know whether her confirmation got through. Requiring more confirmations is probably a waste of social resources. The finding of contract at time of dispatch that the formation occurs when it's sent means the offeree may safely rely without inquiring as to whether there was a dispatched but uncommunicated revocation. Thus, as long as the offeree selects a reasonable method of communicating ascent, he or she should be able to rely on the formation of a contract.

Speaker 1:          06:24          Was the holding and Adams versus Lynn Cell and exact iteration of the justifications of the mailbox rule? Well, not exactly, although this case is thought to be the origin, uh, of the so called mailbox rule. The holding seems to be that because the seller misdirected the offer, he should be bound by the acceptance that would have arrived in due course of post. In short, the seller expected to hear from the buyer on September 7th, so there was no need to discuss the effect of the posting of the letter. That question would be posed if the offer had not been misdirected. The buyer posted in acceptance and the seller sells the wool to a third party and then the acceptances arrived. Let's, let's take a look at the scope of the mailbox rule first. What if the offer acceptance is never received? Say it gets stolen or destroyed in a tragic mail delivery van fire, there's still a contract.

Speaker 1:          07:26          In that case, the offer bares the risk of non delivery. If the offer doesn't want to bear that risk, she can again contract around it and say that the contract is only formed when the acceptances received. Finally, what about other mediums of communication? The mailbox rule has been applied to telegrams, faxes and and other mediums of contractual communication. It's when they're sent that the acceptance becomes effective. Nowadays, more and more contracting is done by electronic transmissions where communication is virtually instantaneous. The sending and receipt happens almost simultaneously under such circumstances. There's a good reason for holding that an acceptance is only effective when received and not when transmitted. The authors of an influential study observed that an important premise upon which the mailbox rule is predicated is the notion of some delayed medium of communication such as mailbox, uh, uh, uh, writings and they do not provide either party, the ability to verify in a timely fashion that receipt of a message has occurred and that the message has received is without error.

Speaker 1:          08:38          Hence, these authors have maintained that electronic transmission should be governed by the same rules that apply when parties are in each other's presence. Uh, and the acceptance should be deemed effective only when received and confirmed. Acceptance is not the only act that causes timing issues, offers counter offers and revocations also post timing issues. However, every other formation act becomes effective at the time it's received, not at the time that it is sent. Why our offers counteroffers and revocations treated differently? Well, maybe because these rules are also defaults that are set against the person who has a unilateral power to opt out. What about from offers? That is option contracts. A restatement. Section 63 provides that an acceptance under an option contract is not effective until received by the offer or in the view of the drafters. Since the option contract provides for irrevocability of the offer.

Speaker 1:          09:49          The primary reason for the rule of Adams versus Linzille and its progeny is absent. The position suggests that the mailbox rule is employed to protect the [inaudible] opportunity to make a sound decision against an unexpected revocation in option contracts and for a and from offers, there's no threat of offer or revocation, so the mailbox rule does not make sense in those contexts. So let's imagine this. Robert offers to sell Sally a box of jewelry for $10,000 Sally accepts by sending a letter and putting it in the mail while the letter is in the mail. Robert Call Sally to tell her the offer is revoked. Is there a contract? The answer is yes. Under section 42 revocation is not effective until the offer. He receives a manifestation of this revocation from the offer or interestingly that this may not even be a default, might be a mandatory rule of timing. The mailed acceptance creates the contract and the revocation has no legal consequence because it was not manifested until after the acceptance became effective and only uh, it has only received after the contract was formed.

Speaker 1:          11:15          Also note that section 40 creates a limited exception to the mailbox rule when the sending of an acceptance is proceeded by a previous sending of a counteroffer or revocation. Section. 40 in effect says a letter or telegram of acceptance dispatched after the sending of another wise, uh, affective rejection or counter offer only operates as an acceptance if the acceptance is received by the offer or before she receives the rejection or counter offer. Or to put it even more simply, if an offeree has previously sent a counteroffer or rejection, the acceptance will only take place if at all, at the time of receipt to see how this works. Imagine the following scenario. On Day One B receives A's offer. On Day two B sends a counteroffer and then on day three B sends an acceptance. Now if it weren't for section 40 there would be an acceptance of an offer here because the counter offer only becomes effective when it's received and the acceptance would have occurred here, but section 40 a complicates this analysis.

Speaker 1:          12:35          There are two possibilities about when the counter offer and acceptance will be received. If a receives the acceptance before the counter offer, then there's going to be a contract because acceptance under this condition will occur when it is received, but under the second possibility a receives the counteroffer first, which blows up the offer and renders ineffective the subsequent receipt of the acceptance. And so under this second possibility there would be no contract. Finally, let's discuss what constitutes reasonable acceptance. As we discussed earlier, the mailbox rule applies when the method of acceptance is a reasonable response under the circumstances. The next example will help us see what reasonable acceptance might mean. So imagine in July, 1990 Carol was hired as a special education teacher by the Huron School district for the 1990 [inaudible] 91 school year. On August 15th, 1990 Carol handed to Ed her supervisor a letter of resignation effective on August 17th.

Speaker 1:          13:49          You should think of this letter as an offer to uh, enter employment. In the letter she requested that her final check be mailed to an address some 50 miles away which was her parents' home. Ed gave the letter to Mary, the superintendent, the superintendent for the school who had authority to hire and fire. On August 20th that same day, Mary prepared and mailed the letter properly addressed to Carol at her parents accepting the resignation. The next day, Carol hand delivered a letter to Mary withdrawing her resignation. Mary told Carol that the resignation had been accepted and handed her a copy of the letter mailed the day before. That letter did not reach Carol's parents home until August 24th. Carol claims that the resignation had been withdrawn in time because the acceptance letter should have been handed to her. Let's first sink through some of strongest arguments for the school district. In other words, arguments for why Carol resignation offer was properly accepted.

Speaker 1:          14:59          The school district could argue that Carol handed her written offer to resign to a supervisor who forwarded to the person with the power to accept and given the dates involve three days after when Carol said her resignation was effective. Uh, and the assumption that Carol would be at her parents posting the acceptance would appear to be reasonable and the mirror posting under the mailbox rule should have been the time where the, um, uh, resignation offer was accepted. Here. The manner in which the offer is communicated is not determinative. Thus the resignation would be effective at the time they posted, uh, the letter. But what if Carol had sent a telegram, a of offering to resign and Mary had merely sent a letter accepting that offer before the letter arrived. Carol revoked the resignation by email. In that case, Carol's initial manner of communication, a telegram might signal what form a reasonable response might take.

Speaker 1:          16:08          Mary arguably should have known that Carol was expecting a prompt apply. Sending a letter on these facts was, would not be reasonable. They're reasonable response was to telegraph or email that the resignation was accepted. Finally, what if Carol had telephone berry and left the offer to resign on Mary's voicemail? And what if Carol had used a fax? How should marry except in those cases? Well, the use of voicemail and Telefax is common and suggests at least that Mary May use the same mode for acceptance. The response doesn't have to be faster, but at least there's an argument that the mode of acceptance, uh, shouldn't come through a slower mode of communication. It might mean that these attempts to accept by a slower mode are not effective because they're not reasonable or that they wouldn't be effective until received. So any overtaking revocation of the offer would render the acceptance in ineffective. In summary, the mailbox rule states that acceptance takes effect when an acceptance is placed out of the offer. Rees possession. This is in contrast to offers revocations and counter offers which only take effect at the time they are received. However, while the mailbox rule has a fairly wide scope, it does not apply in cases where the mess, that method of acceptance is not reasonable, such as responding to an email, uh, with snail mail.
