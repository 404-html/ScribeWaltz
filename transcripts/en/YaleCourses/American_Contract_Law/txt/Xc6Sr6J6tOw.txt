Speaker 1:          00:00          In the last lecture we talked about consideration and how courts look for a bargain for exchange to determine whether a promise creates an enforceable contract. Today we're going to introduce another basis for enforcing promises known as promissory Estoppel. The doctrine of promissory Estoppel has its roots in the 1898 Nebraska case called rickets versus Ska Thorn in which there was no bargain for exchange, but the courts found a legally enforceable promise. Anyway, the facts are these. The plaintiff in the Ricketts case, Katie Scott Thorn, received a written promise from our grandfather, John c records that he would pay her quote on demand $2,000 to be at 6% per annum. When he made the promise, the grandfather told Ms Ska Thorn, that quote, I have fixed out something that you have not got to work anymore unquote, and that none of my grandchildren work and you don't have to. A year later with the consent and assistance of her grandfather, she got a new job.

Speaker 1:          01:15          Two years later, the grandfather died having paid one year's interest on the note and having expressed regret that he had not been able to pay the balance. Ms Cawthorne then sued the executor of the grandfather's estate, Andrew Directorates for the balance. So was there consideration in this case? No, not in this case. The grandfather promised to give his granddaughter the money, but uh, he did not ask for anything in return, nor did she promise anything in return. Although she quit her job after he implied that she would not need to work anymore or grandfather did not condition the money on her quitting her job. In the words of the court, the plaintiff's grandfather gave her the note as a gratuity and asked for nothing in return. And the abandonment by Miss Goth orn ever position as a bookkeeper was all together voluntary. Therefore, the note was not given in consideration of the plaintiff pursuing or green to pursue any particular line of conduct.

Speaker 1:          02:27          The trial court found for the plaintiff and the instant court affirmed not withstanding the lack of of consideration. So the central issue on appeal is this, despite the lack of consideration, is the grandfather's promise still legally enforceable? As we just discussed, the court found there was no consideration in this case. Therefore, if consideration is absolutely necessary for a binding promise, the grandfather's promise would not be legally. However, there have always been traces of an easiness respecting a strong consideration requirement. Much of the dissatisfaction relates to transactions such as those involved in rickets where a promise induces substantial and bargained for reliance on the part of the promise. See, do you think it would be fair if the grandfather or in this case his estate could later fail to perform his promise after his granddaughter relied on that promise and quit her job, the court didn't think it would be fair.

Speaker 1:          03:37          The court reason that the grandfather intentionally influenced the plaintiff to alter her position for the worst on the faith of the note being paid when due so it would be grossly inequitable to permit the maker or his executor to resist payment on the ground that the promise was given without consideration to get around the consideration requirement, the court invoke the doctrine of equitable Estoppel. The court can see did that the promise quote being given without any valuable consideration was nothing more than a promise to make a gift in the future and that ordinarily such promises are not enforceable. However, the court held that a promise or who promises to make a gift, maybe a stopped that is stopped or barred from denying the existence of the consideration if the promise see changes her position in reliance on the promise. In other words, even though the grandfather's promise to his granddaughter was not supported by consideration, the executor of the estate was estopped from arguing that the promise lacked consideration because, uh, his granddaughter had quit her job in reliance on that promise.

Speaker 1:          04:58          The court supported it's positioned with precedent pass. Courts had held that quote, an action on a note given to a church college or other like institution upon the faith of which money has been expended or obligations incurred could not be successfully defended on the ground of a want of consideration. But those courts found an enforceable promise for a different reason. Those courts held that quote. The expenditure of money or assumption of liability by the Doni on the faith of the promise constitutes a valuable and sufficient consideration. The court in Ricketts on the other hand held that there was no consideration but it stopped the defendant from raising that defense. This use of Estoppel was unusual for two reasons. First, equitable equitable estoppel traditionally only applied to representations of facts. If you represent it to a patient that you are a specialist, you can be estopped from later denying it in court even if you in fact are not a specialist.

Speaker 1:          06:03          Second, the doctrine of equitable Estoppel is commonly understood to provide a shield, not a sword. Estoppel is a defense that prevents another, uh, from denying certain facts. In rickets. The doctrine is applied as a sword to support a new cause of action that would otherwise not exist. Was the Ricketts courts simply confused about the meaning of equitable Estoppel? Well, one might instead read the opinion as a good example of judicial craft. Under the common law, the court observed a form of injustice. It the court observed a form of injustice that the law might remedy finding no clear legal grounds at hand and facing the bar, uh, of the, uh, against enforcement under the doctrine of consideration. It took a neighboring legal category, Estoppel and stretched it a bit to do new work. This is the process of creative destruction where courts sometimes do injury to an existing concept to help redeploy it in another context.

Speaker 1:          07:09          It's only later that courts feel comfortable giving. The new creation is separate and new name. The modern term promissory Estoppel dates from Samuel [inaudible] 1920 previous on contract law will Astin carefully studied cases and convinced himself that the consideration doctrine could not explain all the case see outcomes and his treatise. Wilson collected a number of cases including rickets in which reliance seem to be doing the job of consideration. It was a substitute for consideration recognizing the differences between the well established doctrine of equitable stopple and the doctrine invoked by this collection of cases. Wilson suggested a new name for the ladder promissory Estoppel Wilston later served as the reporter on the first restatement of contracts and included a section, a new section, section 94 promissory Estoppel. The sections number remained the same in the second restatement, which now reads a promise which the promissor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the primacy or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. The remedy granted for breach may be limited as justice requires section 90 is one of the few sections of the restatement that you should commit to memory as synonymous with promissory Estoppel. You can see that it has three elements, the promise or should have her promise to induce reliance. The promise must actually and must actually induce reliance and injustice can be avoided only by the promises enforcement.

Speaker 1:          09:09          If the plaintiff in rickets versus Scott Thorn had not quit her job after her grandfather promised her $2,000 plus interest with the promise had been binding under the theory of promissory Estoppel. Nope. If Miss Goth Thorn did not rely on the promise to her detriment, she would not satisfy one of the requirements for promissory Estoppel so the promise would not be binding under that doctrine. The court awarded Miss Goth or in the $2,000 face amount of the promissory note plus interest. This put Ms. Scott Orn in the position she would have been in if the promise had been performed. When a court does this, we say that the court awards expectation damages cause the court puts the plaintiff in the position she would expect to be in when the promise was made. But section 90 permits courts to limit the remedy has justice requires relying on her grandfather's promise. Ms. Scott Thorn quit her job, which paid $10 a week for a year before taking another job.

Speaker 1:          10:18          In other words, she sacrificed at most $520 when she relied on the promise. Therefore, wouldn't justice be served if damages were limited to $520 if the court did so, we would say that the court awarded reliance damages, reliance damages seek to make the promise the whole by compensating her for the cost she incurred in relying on the promise instead of putting the promising and the position she would have been in had the promise been fully performed. Grant Gilmore famously predicted in a book called death of contracts that section 90 would swallow contracts pro that promises would use promissory Estoppel claims under section 90 instead of breach of contract claims to enforce their promises. But Gilmore's prediction has not come true. Promises routinely opt to sue for breach of contract because it's a more certain basis for liability. Avoiding all these considerations of what justice requires and without potentially having limited damages. So let's recap. Sometimes consideration is not needed to enforce a promise. If a promise he reasonably relies on a promise and changes are positioned accordingly, the promise may be binding even without consideration. If justice so requires, however, the remedy granted for the breach may be limited to compensate the primacy for her reliance and the court need not award the full value of the promise.
