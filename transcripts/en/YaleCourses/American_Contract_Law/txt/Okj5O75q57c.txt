Speaker 1:          00:01          For most of this course, we have focused on economic or peculiarity damages such as compensating an aggrieved party for the value of lost property, future earnings or cost of repair. But in this lesson we will learn about contract loss, treatment of other types of damages, especially emotional damages and punitive damages will examine two cases. Bo Hawk versus department of Agriculture and rite aid corporation versus lake shore investors.

Speaker 1:          00:32          Let's start with the bow hot case which is about non pecuniary emotional damages. The plaintiff appellant in this case Janice Bow Hawk is a research geneticist who was removed from her position with the Department of Agriculture. Plaintiff claimed that her removal was a violation of the whistle blower protection act and sued for $14,000 for Picayune Arie losses and $150,000 for non peculiarity damages as a result of her wrongful termination. Just so we're on the same page, pecuniary means of relating to or consisting of money and be Cuny Arie damages or losses that can be easily quantified in monetary terms. Non pecuniary damages are not readily quantified in monetary terms. For example, a plaintiff medical bills are pecuniary losses whereas her emotional distress and pain and suffering are non pecuniary losses. After her removal, plaintiff filed a motion for damages with the Merit System Protection Board and Administrative Law Judge for the board granted her motion for pecuniary damages but rejected her claim for non pecuniary damages. Holding that non pecuniary damages do not constitute consequential damages. Plaintiff then petition for review of the decision by the full board. The petition was rejected. The plaintiff then appealed to the instant court and the instinct court affirmed the board's decisions.

Speaker 2:          02:09          Okay,

Speaker 1:          02:10          so here's a quiz. Why was the focus of the court's inquiry on consequential damages as opposed to compensatory damages?

Speaker 2:          02:20          Okay,

Speaker 1:          02:20          well, Congress apparently intended to protect whistleblowing federal employees from discharge by incorporating the common law meaning of consequential damages into the act. As you may have noticed, the bowl hot court suggested that it's decision might have been different if compensatory rather than consequential damages was intended by the whistle blower protection act.

Speaker 2:          02:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:48          The main issue in this case is whether non pecuniary damages are considered consequential damages. You should recall from our lesson on Hadley vs Baxendale that a breaching party is liable for consequential damages. That is for losses that the contracting parties should have foreseen. In other words, the issue in Bo Hawk is whether [inaudible] damages are foreseeable according to the rule of Hadley feedbacks and Dale consequential damages are easiest for courts to see when the breaching party as a seller. Here are the breaching party is a buyer, the employer who is buying the plaintiff's employment. In this case the court held that no non pecuniary damages are not sufficiently foreseeable to be awarded. Non Peculiarity damages are generally unforeseeable when the contract is signed. As a result, consequential damages are limited to pecuniary damages. The second restatement states that mental anguish is recoverable in a contract breach when the quote breach is of such a kind that serious emotional disturbance was a particularly likely result unquote, or if the breach also caused bodily harm.

Speaker 1:          04:04          The prevailing view is that emotional distress damages are not available for breach of an employment contract. For instance, one case emphasize that employment contracts do not have elements of personality and that parties did not agree to protect those types of losses even though an ordinary employment contract and might be excluded. The fact that the discharge employee is a whistle blower and is discharged for that fact brings the likelihood of emotional disturbance into play. The focus for the second restatement is the likelihood of d of emotional disturbance at the time of breach, not the time of contracting, but one can ask whether this presumption against awarding employees damages for emotional distress is merely a default rule. If the initial contract had called for such damages or otherwise indicated that serious emotional distress is likely, would courts be willing to enforce that kind of promise? Well, it's not clear. There's a lot of judicial reluctance to expand damages in this way. Then again, if the parties contract says so explicitly that they wanted it, it's a, it might happen.

Speaker 1:          05:22          Claims for mental anguish or emotional distress damages are on the borderline between contract and tort. The emotional disturbance results from a breach of contract, say a wrongful termination, but the injury is to what might be called a tort rather than a contractual interest. Uh, in addition to losing the value of the bargain, the plaintiff is worse off physically than before the contract. In one Hawaii case, the court rejected awarding damages for tortious breach of contract because such a would blur the theories of recovery relevant to tort and contract. They held that emotional distress damages will only be awarded where parties specifically provide for them in the contract or were or were clearly within the contemplation of the parties. So at least in Hawaii, the presumption against a war II awarding emotional distress damages is just a default. It can be contracted round in the initial contract itself.

Speaker 2:          06:26          Okay,

Speaker 1:          06:27          let's switch gears and take a look at another type of damages. Punitive damages in rite aid corporation versus lake shore investors. The plaintiff Appellee Lake shore sued the defendant rite aid for falsely claiming that a valid lease agreement existed between the two. Uh, the two of them when it did not. Lake shore also sued rite aid for interference with another contract because rite aid refused to provide a release allowing a third party purchaser to withdraw from its deal with lake shore if the rite aid claim over the property became an issue.

Speaker 2:          07:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:09          The trial court did not distinguish between these two separate causes of action and it also refuse to award punitive damages. Plaintiff appealed and the Court of special appeals reversed and held that lake shore should have been able to prove damages that would quote reasonably flow from a tortious contractual interference. Defendant appealed and the instinct court affirmed and remanded.

Speaker 1:          07:38          The main issue we are interested in is whether punitive damages can be recovered for an action of tortious interference with the contract. The court answered yes allowing punitive damages. The holding is consistent with the interpretation of the second restatement of torts which states that a person injured by tortious interference with the contract can recover punitive damages where appropriate in order for punitive damages to be appropriate to conditions must be met. First, there must be an award of compensatory damages and second, there must be actual malice. The court in this case remanded to the trial court to apply this test.

Speaker 1:          08:24          The tort of intentional interference with the contract is explained in section seven 66 of the second restatement of torts. It applies to cases where a party intentionally and improperly interferes with the performance of a contract or induces a third person not to perform the contract. In addition to intentional interference with existing contracts, courts have also found tort liability for third parties, intentional interference with prospective and even negligent interference. Well, I've heard that Columbia law school once threatened to sue Yale Law School for poaching on law applicants who had put in deposits with Columbia. Columbia claimed that making a competitive offer was intentionally interfering with Columbia's contracts as rite aid versus lake shore demonstrates most states follow the second restatement of torts and permit an intentional interference plaintiff to recover inappropriate cases for emotional distress, for harm to reputation, and even punitive damages measures that would not be available in an action for contractual breach. Some scholars have analogize the toward of intentional interference with contracts to rules that protect property owners against theft such as the tort of conversion. Having a tort against interference increases promises, chances of realizing the benefits of having secured the promise of performance. But courts have been fickle about when exactly and interferences improper.

Speaker 2:          10:07          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:07          Does awarding punitive damages for the tort of intentional interference with a contract undermine the goals of contract law? The law of intentional interference is inconsistent with contract laws. Strong preference for only compensatory damages. Some have argued that allowing the tort of intentional interference runs counter to the theory of efficient breach contract rules are designed to facilitate breach where efficiency gains were will result, but the interference liability rule might reduce the number of such breaches.

Speaker 1:          10:47          It's also possible for a breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing to constitute a tort for which punitive damages may be awarded. California courts have long held that in insurance contracts, the insurer's refusal to settle with, uh, within the terms of an insurance policy or to pay an undisputed claim of a, uh, to an insured may be bad. Faith may be a bad faith toward for which the, uh, insured can recover damages for mental anguish and even punitive damages. In the 1984 Siemens case, the California Supreme Court held that tort liability for a bad faith breach can be opposed beyond insurance contracts. Other kinds of promises can be tagged with punitive damages for a bad faith breach, but only if certain qualifications are met in Siemens. The court emphasized tort remedies may be appropriate when a party seeks to shield itself from liability by denying that the contract exists.

Speaker 1:          11:57          The court explained that tort remedies are appropriate where a contracting party seeks to avoid all liability on a meritorious contract claim. By adopting a stonewall position, we'll have see you in court with no belief in the that it has a valid defense. The court went on to explain these cases. Uh, go beyond the mere breach of contract making tort liability permissible. The Siemens rule is controversial. Judge Alex Kosinski criticize the rule for being in the cloud cuckoo land of modern tort theory and subordinary voluntary contractual arrangements to judge's own sense of public policy. On the other hand, Gregory class, my coauthor has defended the seam and rule arguing that punitive damages are needed because compensatory damages do not sufficiently deter the source, the source of stonewalling observed in Siemens. In summary, there are many hurdles for recovering non pecuniary and or punitive damages for a contractual breach. As the Bow Hawk case demonstrates non peculiarity, emotional damages are generally not recoverable. The restatement states that mental anguish is only recoverable when the breach is likely to result in serious emotional disturbance. Even then, ordinary employment contracts normally do not award this kind of damages. Rite aid stands for the principle that punitive damages may be possible for an intentional interference with the contractual relationship. However, for punitive damages to apply, there must be an award of compensatory damages and there must be actual malice present.
