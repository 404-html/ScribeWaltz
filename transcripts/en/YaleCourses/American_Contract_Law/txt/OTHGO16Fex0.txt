Speaker 1:          00:01          Today we continue our discussion of when contracts are unenforceable because they violate public policy. We will look at it in 1987 Wisconsin case called watt versus Watt, where the court considered whether an unmarried couples cohabitation agreement is enforceable in what the watt, the plaintiffs. Sue Ann lived for 12 years with defendant James. The couple held themselves out to the public as husband and wife and had two children together but never actually married. When the couple split up, plaintiff sued under several theories for a share of their property, including the theory that she and the defendant had a contract to equally share all of the property accumulated during their relationship. The trial court dismissed the complaint and the instant court reversed and remanded. The central issue is a contract between the parties to share property accumulated during their relationship void as against public policy. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin held that enforcing such a contract would not be void as against public policy.

Speaker 1:          01:14          The court began by observing that non-marital cohabitation does not render every agreement between the co-habiting parties illegal, but the court also acknowledged that a contract will not be enforced. If it violates public policy. Thus the defendant argued among other things that the party's relationship was immoral and illegal and that any recognition of a contract between the parties or plaintiff's claim for a share of the property accumulated during the cohabitation contravenes public policy contracts quote for which the soul couldn't consideration is sexual relations unquote are unenforceable, but according to the court, a bargain between two people is not illegal merely because there is an illicit relationship between the two. So long as the bargain is independent of the illicit relationship and the illicit relationship does not constitute any part of the concern. Consideration bargained for and is not a condition of the bargain. Further, the court recognized that a refusal to enforce a contract between the parties because their relationship involved immoral or illegal sexual activity would be inequitable and arbitrary in that it would leave one party no less guilty than the other with a greater share of accumulated wealth merely because he or she held it prior to trial.

Speaker 1:          02:45          Hence, the court concluded that the plaintiff pleaded sufficient facts necessary to state a claim even though the parties being in Pari delicto. With regard to an uh, tempted bribe was sufficient to make a court refused to give any order of relief in sign are in the sign. Our case in Perry here, the parties being in Perry delicto with regard to illicit sexual relationship was not at least by 1987 sufficient to categorically keep a court from giving relief. So what are the elements of an unjust enrichment claim? The plaintiff also asserted an unjust enrichment claim. We talked about unjust enrichment in an earlier module when we looked at a case called daily versus West. What are the elements of an unjust enrichment claim? Well, in Bailey v West, we saw that three conditions must be satisfied for unjust enrichment. One, there must be a benefit conferred upon the defendant to the defendant must appreciate the benefit.

Speaker 1:          03:53          And three, it would be an equitable for the defendant to retain the benefit without making a payment to the plaintiff. The court in watts versus watts considered those same three conditions and held that unmarried cohabitants may raise claims based upon unjust enrichment following the termination of their relationship where one of the parties attempts to retain an unreasonable amount of the property acquired through the efforts of both. In other words, even if the plaintiffs contract claim failed on remand, if she was able to satisfy the elements of unjust enrichment, she could still win the case. Section one 78 subparagraph one of the restatement of contracts provides that quote, a promise or other term of an agreement is unenforceable on grounds of public policy. If legislation provides that it is unenforceable or the interest in its enforcement is clearly outweighed in the circumstances by a public policy against the enforcement of such terms.

Speaker 1:          04:56          Thus, if a constitution, statute, administrative regulation or local ordinance preempts the enforceability question by clear language, the court's job is to implement that legislative decision, but if there's no clear legislative mandate, the promise or term is unenforceable. If the interest in its enforcement is clearly outweighed in the circumstances by a public policy against the enforcement of such terms. This mirror is the approach the court followed in watts versus watts. The court first considered whether the Wisconsin Family Code restricted the court's resolution of property disputes between cohabiting couples and it found that it did not. The court then enunciated a balancing standard when it said quote a declaration that the contract is against public policy should be made to only after careful balancing in the light of all the circumstances of the interest in enforcing a particular promise against the policy against in its opinion, the Wisconsin court is highly critical of the Illinois Supreme Court's 1979 opinion and Hewitt versus Hewitt.

Speaker 1:          06:08          There the court held that quote allowing such a contract claim would weaken the sanctity of marriage unquote and violate the policy of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution Act. The court also emphasized legal process stating that there are quote, major public policy questions involved in determining whether under what circumstances and to what extent it's desirable to cord some type of legal status to claims arising from cohabitation relationships. The plaintiff argued that because of changing social norms and attitude, the court should abandon the traditional rule that cohabitation agreements are illegal, but the Hewitt court responded, quote the question whether change is needed in the law governing the rights of parties in this delicate area of marriage. Like relationships involves evaluations of sociological data and alternatives. We believe best suited to the superior investigative and fact finding facilities of the legislative branch unquote. In other words, the court was reluctant to change the law because of alleged changes in social attitudes.

Speaker 1:          07:20          The court felt that legislators are better position to verify broad social changes and adjust the law accordingly. So besides thinking about whether a cohabitation promise or some other rights should be enforced, the legal system also has to decide which part of government gets to decide the question. Similar questions arose during the same sex marriage debates where the right to marry with sometimes extended by courts and sometimes by state legislatures before the US Supreme Court mandated that all states extend the right changed social attitudes toward marriage can be seen in how the treatment of premarital premarital agreements has changed until the mid 1970s most American courts held that premarital agreements and other contracts made quote in contemplation of divorce unquote were unenforceable as against public policy. Section one 90 sub paragraph two of the second restatement of contracts continues to declare that a promise that tends unreasonably to encourage divorce or separation is unenforceable on grounds of public policy. The vast majority of courts, however, now treat premarital agreements as enforceable, at least in some circumstances. Let's recap. Today. We talked about how a contract may be unenforceable on grounds of public policy if the interest in enforcement is clearly outweighed in the circumstances by a public policy against the enforcement of such terms. We looked at a case that held that cohabitation agreements whereby an unmarried couple allegedly agreed to share their accumulated assets was not unenforceable as against public policy.
