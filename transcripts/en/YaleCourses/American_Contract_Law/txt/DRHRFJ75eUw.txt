Speaker 1:          00:01          Our next case. Raffles v Wiggle House is famous and memorable just about everyone who's ever taken a common law contracts class in the United States. Will remember the case about the two ships named pure lists, whose names, if you think about it, certainly weren't accurate. The case comes from Britain in 1864 during the height of the British Raj in India and the industrial revolution in Britain. The textile mills in northern England needed a constant supply of raw materials. And in 19 and an 1864 the American civil war had shut down cotton exports from the American south. And so this case deals with a contract for the sale of cotton shipped from Bombay in India. The defendant will call house agreed to buy 125 bales of cotton from the plaintiff raffles when it arrived in Liverpool on the ship name to peerless.

Speaker 1:          01:12          Unfortunately there were two different ships named peerless plying the route between industrial Liverpool and the capital of Britain's largest largest colony Winkle house. Thought that they had agreed the cotton would arrive on the peerless that sailed from Bombay in October. While Raffles thought they had agreed on the pure lists that had sailed in December. You can see the October peerless in this picture. When the cotton actually arrived on the December peerless wiggle house refused to buy the cotton and so raffle sued. It's likely that the underlying reason for the dispute is that the two parties were speculating on the price of cotton and that the price of cotton increased over the months in question. Therefore, the parties were very concerned about when the ship carrying the cotton would depart at the time has in the merchant of Venice, there could be no guarantee of exactly when or even whether ships traveling across the seas would arrive.

Speaker 1:          02:22          This opinion is an English case and so it looks a bit different from the American decisions we've read from around the same time period. You'll notice that reporters, that the reporters summary or report of the case begins with the pleadings of each of the parties followed by a summary of the arguments that each barrister made with interjections by the judges. The actual decision by the court or to use the Latin phrase per curiam comes at the very end and just says that the defendants won. The court was faced with the question of whether there was a contract at all given that the two parties had had different understandings of which ship would carry the cotton. The court said there was not a contract. The key concept in the case is typically called the meeting of the minds in American contract law. This case and British law generally call it consensus odd item, which is Latin for agreement on the same thing.

Speaker 1:          03:26          The idea is that in order for two parties to form a contract, they must be thinking the same thing. When they make it, their minds must meet. Otherwise there hasn't really been an agreement and so there's nothing for the law to enforce. In this case, the two parties misunderstood each other because of the ambiguity of the term. Peerless note that the misunderstanding is different from mistake, which we'll discuss later in the course. Misunderstanding means that there was never a contract in the first place because there was no agreement. Mistake on the other hand involves false beliefs about aspects of what is being traded and often means that the contract is not void but voidable by the mistaken party. This ruling has concerned contract scholars over the years because courts have a very hard time looking inside the heads of the parties to see what they were thinking when they made their contracts.

Speaker 1:          04:29          In his book, the Common Law later Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr pointed out that if the ships had had different names and one of the parties had simply got the name wrong, they would have been bound by this ship name on the contract. Even though there had never in fact been a meeting of the minds in his view though for homes was willing to go further. He said the true ground of the decision in Raffles was not that each party meant a different thing from the other, but that each said a different thing. The plaintiff offered one thing. The defendant expressed his ascent to another. The plaintiff and defendant were essentially saying different words that merely sounded the same. Frankly, this seems to me like philosophical sophistry to me and most other commentators. The party said the same thing I said as a matter of objective, uh, conduct. It was just ambiguous.

Speaker 1:          05:34          Commentators have even pointed out that the peerless doctrine may not be necessary. Allan Farnsworth argued that in cases like this, neither party would be able to sufficiently prove that the other had not performed according to the contract and so the contract would be unenforceable anyway. On a similar view, we could say that there is insufficient objective for a contract when the objective manifestation is ambiguous as it is here. The doctrine about meeting of the minds has been enshrined in section 20 of the second restatement subsection one deals with cases like fearless. If there's an important ambiguous term in the contract and neither party or each party knows that it is ambiguous and the other party is thinking of a different meaning, then there is no mutual assent and so there's no contract. This can be thought of as the peerless case. In another sense, it's hard to find other examples of pure symmetric misunderstandings.

Speaker 1:          06:43          Many commentators have tried to find reasons why the buyer or the seller might have been in fact in a better place to avoid this misunderstanding. These commentators have tried to identify the party who in the words of subsection one had a better quote, reason to know the meaning attached by the other unquote subsection two deals with the asymmetric version of the situation where one party knows or should have known the others meaning but not vice versa. In these cases, the meaning attributed by the party that didn't know is the meaning of the contract and the contract is valid. In other words, if a party knows what the other party thought the contract meant, that party has to abide by what he or she knew the other party was thinking. So suppose the same scenario happened as in Raffles v Winkle House, except that wicked house knew that raffles was thinking of the December peerless under the second restatement.

Speaker 1:          07:47          Is there a contract and who would win the case? Well, the answer is a, as section 20 subsection two of the restatement tells us in an asymmetric information case like this, the party who knows the other's interpretation is bound to it. That means that wiggle house as much as he would like it to be the October peerless is bound to buy cotton from the December peerless raffles, we'll win the case in this lecture. We have seen that when two parties don't understand key terms of a contract in the same way, there is no contract because there has been no meeting of the minds. But when the situation is asymmetric with one party, knowing the other's interpretation and not vice versa, both parties are bound to the interpretation that both of them are aware of.
