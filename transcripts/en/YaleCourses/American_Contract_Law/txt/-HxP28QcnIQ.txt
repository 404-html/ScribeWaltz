Speaker 1:          00:00          Today we examine the requirement of good faith by examining the case of market street associates versus fry. The implied covenant of Good Faith and fair dealing is a mandatory rule that parties will deal with each other in good faith. It's an implied obligation in every contract, meaning it does not need to be explicitly written or stated and it can't be disclaimed. The covenant is incorporated into the uniform commercial code section one dash three Oh four and section two dash one oh three defines good faith in the case of merchants as honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade. The restatement Second Section Two oh five also states that every contract imposes upon each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance and its enforcement. The case of market street associates versus fry was decided by the seventh circuit in 1991 the opinions author, Judge Richard Posner is a leading figure in the field of law and economics.

Speaker 1:          01:14          The Journal of Legal Studies identified him as the most cited legal scholar of the 20th century. He is the closest thing we have today to Oliver Wendell Holmes, a Promethian scholar turn judge with seemingly unbounded capacities. The opinion while very long gives a detailed explanation of judge Posner's take on the duty of good faith in contracts, JC penny and General Electric Pension Trust entered into a sale and leaseback agreement to understand the case. It's useful to understand that sale and leaseback transactions are incredibly similar to a mortgage loan but are characterized as sale and lease back for various tax purposes with alone. Of course, the lender initially lends money to a borrower and the borrower then pays back the loan with smaller periodic payments with a sale and leaseback transactions. The cashflows are identical. The effective lender in this case, General Electric Pension Trust initially sends the cuase I borrower JC Penney, a bunch of money when GE buys the property and then Jacques Pinay effectively pays back the loan when it sends a it's periodic rent money back to the lender at the end of the lease back period.

Speaker 1:          02:46          That cuase I bar often can repurchase the property by paying what is similar to what would be a balloon payment. If the transaction where a traditional mortgage loan. Of course if this had been a traditional business loan, JC penny would have been able to make improvements and uh, and it's property and parties to sale and leaseback transactions often include provisions to give the renter this affective borrower various rights to allow the same kinds of improvement in the property without distorting the parties. Incentives regarding the buyback option. In this case, the contract included a provision requiring the trust to give reasonable consideration and to negotiate in good faith. Should JC penny make request to borrow more money for improvements to the leased property, the contract further stated that should negotiations fail this, the negotiations to acquire this new funding a JC Penney would be entitled to immediately buy back the property from the trust with the purchase price stipulated by a formula specified in the contract.

Speaker 1:          04:02          These important provisions are in paragraph 34 of the lease. Even though the contractual formula was an attempt to capture what the value of the property would be in the future, the formula in this case failed to accurately reflect what the market price turned out to be. So at the time of this dispute, the formula price was far below the actual market price of the property. JC Penny later assigned its interest in the lease a two market street which was the plaintiff and that now the appellant market street requested financing from the trust without informing the trust about the contractual terms granting market street and option to buy the property immediately at the formulaic price should the financing negotiations fail. The trust, uh, was apparently unaware of the purchase option term in the contract. The negotiations failed and market street attempted to exercise the purchase option at the formulaic price stipulated in the contract which has mentioned above was well below the market value after the trust refused to sell the property at that price market street sued for specific performance.

Speaker 1:          05:19          The district court granted summary Judgment to the trust ruling that market street's behavior violated a good faith contractual requirement in the instant decision. Judge Posner writing for the appellate panel reversed and remanded holding that the facts could be construed to find that market straight behaved in good faith. Just to make sure we understand the facts of the case. What does paragraph 34 of the lease and title the lessee to do? Which term did market street fail to disclose about? Two important things. First, it allows market street to request that the pension trust finance, the cost and expense of improving on the property. The pension fund is under a contractual obligation to consider and negotiate in good faith after it receives this request. Second, if these negotiation fails, the contract gives market street the option to immediately repurchase the property at a price derived from a formula specified in the contract.

Speaker 1:          06:30          Market Street's alleged failure was one of nondisclosure. They did not inform the trust about the purchase option term in paragraph 34 which gave market street this right or option to repurchase the property. Should negotiations fail like judge suitor in Central Phoenix? Judge Posner emphasizes that good faith can mean different things at different stages of contracting. At the formation stage, the duty is minimized whereas at the performance and post contractual enforcement stage and good faith is heightened because of change circumstances and the parties were reliance. Judge Posner says, quote, before the contract is signed, the parties confront each other with a natural wariness. Neither expects the other to be particularly forthcoming and therefore there's no deception when one is not afterward, the situation is different. The parties are now in a cooperative relationship. The cost of which will be considerably reduced by a measure of trust. So each lowers his guard a bit and now silence is more apt to be deceptive.

Speaker 1:          07:42          Posner sees that, uh, the good faith duty is equivalent to the law finding and implied or our default condition to a contract and suggests that the goal of courts in setting these implied conditions should be quote to give the parties what they would have stipulated for expressly if at the time of making the contract they had had complete knowledge of the future and the cost of negotiating and adding provisions to the contract had been zero. He says that the concept of the duty of good faith, like the concept of fiduciary duty is a stab at approximating the terms the parties would have negotiated had they foreseen the circumstances that have given rise to their dispute. These petitions are classic statements of what contract theorists call hypothetical default setting, setting the legal default at what the parties would have wanted. So what would the parties have wanted?

Speaker 1:          08:47          Posner suggest that the duty of good faith in this context is quote halfway between a fiduciary duty, the duty of utmost good faith and the duty merely to refrain from active fraud. Despite its moralistic overtones. It's no more the injection of moral principles into contract law than the fiduciary concept itself is unquote. The major issue is whether market street's duty of good faith to the trust included a duty to disclose the repurchase consequence. The courts ruled yes, judge Posner reason that both market street and the trust might want to minimize the cost of performing the contract. The point of the doctrine of good faith is to reduce defensive expenditures. So at least in part it seems to fit in this case in good faith should apply. Now you might wonder what these defensive expenditures are. Basically, these are costs that a person occur is to minimize damage to himself, uh, including the damage from making a mistake.

Speaker 1:          09:57          Judge Posner uses the examples of theft because of the thread of theft. People often take out insurance and install security systems or get menacing dogs. All of these are defensive expenditures. In the case of a contract, if parties did not have to negotiate in good faith, there would be a lot of investment in defensive expenditures to protect each that each party would make to protect themselves against making an um, uh, a poorly thought out, a agreement. Defensive expenditures are bad because they are a waste of society's resources. Removing the good faith requirement would induce more defensive expenditures because people would need to investigate whether the other party is being honest rather than taking their word for it. It would require more defensive expenditures cause you'd have to make sure you weren't a for getting a contractual term. It would be better if people just negotiated honestly and openly and the use the resources they would have spent on defensive expenditures.

Speaker 1:          11:03          Uh, somewhere else. In this case, Posner characterized as the failure to disclose as sharp dealing a sharp sharp dealing is when a party takes advantage of a clear oversight by the opposite party. There's no social benefit to inducing sharp dealings such as this one having concluded that the failure to disclose the sharp dealing, which itself might be a tort, the balance of the opinion. Next explicates the theory of post contractual cooperation in the performance of the contract within which good faith operates to prevent opportunistic behavior, deliberate advantage taking without justification. The bottom line is that the less or on these facts should have disclosed the contract clause much like a vendor should have a termite infestation. However, there's a limit to the good faith requirement. Judge Posner does not think that every contract makes a party his brother's keeper. Otherwise Mirror difficulty of performance would excuse a contracting party because the other failed to relax the terms of the contract. There's another issue in this case. Do you remember what the opinion said about whether the facts justify a summary judgement ruling against market street for violating the duty of good faith?

Speaker 1:          12:27          The court held that no market street should not lose the summary Judgment motion interpreting the facts most favorably to market street. Because this is a motion for summary Judgment and market street is the non moving party. It would be possible to conclude that market street did not violate it's good faith obligations, so the case must be remanded. So a, that a jury can decide whether market street violated his duty, uh, by failing to disclose a for sharp dealing reasons. In summary, the decision in market street associates versus fry gave us a perspective on the duty of good faith and contracting. Good faith is an implied duty not to intentionally take advantage of the other party's ignorance of the terms. Somewhat surprisingly, judge Posner fines that the law may require that a contract or a mind, a sophisticated party of the terms of a contract that a sophisticated party has already agreed to. Posner explain that good faith requirements and the performance of a contract help prevent opportunistic behavior and thus economize on inefficient defensive expenditures.
