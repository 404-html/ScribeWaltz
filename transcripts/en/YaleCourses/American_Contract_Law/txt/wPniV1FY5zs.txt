Speaker 1:          00:00          Today we're going to examine would the Lucy Lady Duff Gordon from this incredibly famous case, we will discuss implied promises and the use of those promises as consideration in the process. We'll also talk about exclusive dealing contracts. Lucy Lady Duff Gordon born Lucy Cristiana Sutherland was a famous and innovative British fashion designer whose company Lucille Limited, served an impressive array of famous clients worldwide. And Otis F would was a prominent New York advertising agent by the way. Uh, Lucy Lady Duff Gordon. She was also rather notorious. She's sailed on the titanic and she and her husband Sir Cosmo, were both saved by a lifeboat. Think of her as kind of a car dash in a per day. So in, in 1915 wood and lady death, Gordon signed a year long renewable contract whereby would was given the exclusive right to place lady Duff Gordon's endorsement on other designs and the exclusive right to sell lady Duff Gordon's own designs or licensed others to do so.

Speaker 1:          01:21          These rights, we're all subject to a lady Duff Gordon's approval. The contract provided that the two parties would split equally. All profits derive from this agreement. However, Lady Deaf Gordon then began listing her products for sale in Sears Roebucks catalog. And you can see one of our advertisements right here would allege that she did so without informing them and withheld from him the profits from the Sears Roebuck catalogs and would then sued for his share of these profits. So here's a quiz. The plaintiff argued that lady death, Gordon breached her contractual promise to would have exclusive dealing of exclusivity by endorsing products and earning money there from without the plaintiff's knowledge. And from the recital facts you just heard. What did would promise in return to the plaintiff in exchange for this plaintiff promise of exclusivity? Well, the agreement gave would the exclusive right to do certain things, to place deaf Gordon's endorsement on other's designs and to market products and to grant licenses and, and prescribed woods conduct when doing those things.

Speaker 1:          02:42          But it's not clear that the contractual terms actually required woods to endorse market or license anything. It was just his option. So it wasn't clear what he was promising in exchange for lady Duff Gordon's promise of exclusivity. That indeed was the basis of Lady Duff Gordon's defense. She argued that the party's agreement did not constitute an enforceable agreement because would did not bind himself to anything. The defendant argued, in other words, that the contract lacked consideration. The appellate division agreed reversing a trial court judgment in favor of the plaintiff. Every promise on woods part that court explained was dependent upon him actually making endorsements, Marketing Lady Duff Gordon's products or granting licenses and quote nowhere in the contract has he bound himself to do any of these things. The monumentally famous judge Benjamin Cardozo, who we already encountered in Jacob and Young's v Kent, wrote the opinion for the New York Court of Appeals.

Speaker 1:          03:53          You get a sense from this opinion of his ability to write memorable phrases such as instinct with obligation in this decision. Cardoza seem to acknowledge that the literal words of the party's agreement did not convey any binding obligation on woods part. Yet. He asserted that the law has outgrown its primitive stage of formalism when the precise word was sovereigns Talus man, and every slip fatal. Even if a promise, we're not explicit yet. The whole writing may be instinct with an obligation in perfectly expressed. Cardoza found this was the case in the agreement between wood and Lady Duff Gordon. There was an imperfectly expressed or implied promise by wood to quote, use reasonable efforts to place the defendant's endorsements and market her design. How did cars Cardozo discern such an implied promise? Well, first the fact that the right the defending granted was exclusive combined with the term of compensation set forth in the agreement was extremely important.

Speaker 1:          05:08          Cardozo insisted quote, we are not to suppose that one party was to be placed in the mercy of another unquote. If Lady Death, Gordon granted would the sole right to endorse products and market her designs and would had no obligation to do anything in return. Lady Duff Gordon could drive no profit if would chose not to exercise his right. Rather Cardozo argued, the acceptance of an exclusive deal agency was an assumption of its duties, a duty to make reasonable efforts. Additionally, the other terms of the contract illuminates the intention of the parties and the intention supported a conclusion that the plaintiff also had an obligation under the agreement. Those terms included recognition that woods was in the business of placing endorsements for quote. The implication is that the plaintiff's business organization will be used for the purpose of for which it is adapted unquote providing a monthly account of all the money would received and taking out all patents, copyrights and trademarks as were necessary to protect the rights and goods.

Speaker 1:          06:17          The agreement affected the implied promise to use reasonable efforts to bring profits and revenues into existence, constituted consideration that created an enforceable agreement and allowed the plaintiff to recover. For Lady Duff Gordon's breach. The holding of this case is essentially been codified as a default rule for exclusive dealing contracts and the uniform commercial code. The UCC section two three Oh six two reads a lawful agreement by either the seller or the buyer for exclusive dealing. The kind of goods concerned imposes unless otherwise agreed and obligation by the seller to use best efforts to supply the goods and by the buyer to use best efforts to promote their sale. And the official comment to this section says, subsection two on exclusive dealing makes explicit the commercial rule embodied in this act under which parties to such contracts are held to have impliedly even when not expressly bound themselves to use reasonable diligence as well as good faith in their performance of the contract.

Speaker 1:          07:31          The exclusive agent is required, although no expressed commitment has been made to use reasonable efforts and due diligence in the expansion of the market or the promotion of the product. We've touched upon unconscionability earlier in the course when we discussed Williams versus Walker Thomas Furniture, unconscionable contracts involved terms that are unreasonably favorable to one party. In that sense, there is a similarity between them and the sea and this contract, if we read it literally a between woods and Lady Duff Gordon. But note the important difference. Unconscionable contracts, the one sided pre present mutual obligations and courts declined to enforce them because they were forged through an unfair procedure that led to unfair results by contract. The one sided contract at issue here. In this case of Lady Duff Gordon, uh, appeared to lack mutuality, but the court rendered the contract less one sided by reading into it and implied obligation of reasonable effort.

Speaker 1:          08:39          Cardozo apparently felt the, the one sidedness was not a product of procedural defect, but merely an imperfect expression of the actual exchange promises. Reading these two different kinds of cases together teaches that courts have two starkly different ways of responding to one sidedness, uh, either by refusing to enforce them or by making them more once, uh, by making them less one sided by finding implied, uh, uh, returned promises as consideration as we've already mentioned, Cardozo's opinion reversed the decision of the appellate division, which unanimously agreed. It quote quite apparent that the defendant gives everything and the plaintiff nothing and there's a lack of mutuality and the contract indeed Cardoza his own court was split four. Three. Why can't parties too exclusive dealing contract simply include good faith or reasonable effort clauses into their agreements if they want to have them, uh, clothed with consideration. Wouldn't that obviate the need for implied promises? Did Cardozo in this decision and the UCC choose the best default.
