Speaker 1:          00:00          Today we're going to begin in depth exploration of a topic we've already come across a few times. The duty of good faith. We're going to start by discussing sent tronics corporation versus Gen Acom Corporation. A case decided by the Supreme Court of New Hampshire in 1989 the case concerned a rather complicated transaction for financial assets. Spintronics agreed to sell and Jen Acom agreed to purchase certain business assets. The parties agreed that the purchase price of the assets would be pegged to the assets value at closing because of the price. Uh, value couldn't be known at the time that the contract was formed. The parties agreed that disputes over there the ultimate purchase price would be referred to an accounting firm for arbitration. The parties also agreed that pending finding final valuation of the assets, Jen Acom would deposit a portion of the purchase price into escrow. The parties did indeed disagree about the value of the assets at closing and so began arbitration.

Speaker 1:          01:09          The arbitration process apparently was taking longer than the parties anticipated and while arbitration was still ongoing, Sin Tronics requested that Jen ECOM released from escrow the portion of the funds that were not in dispute. Jen and calm refused to do so and send tronic sued arguing that [inaudible] had breached an implied obligation of good faith. Jen ECOM moved for summary Judgment, which the trial court granted the New Hampshire Supreme Court in an opinion by then judge and now former Supreme Court justice David Souter affirmed Sutor did not deny that an obligation of good faith existed rather his opinion focused on what good faith requires. Seutter outlined three categories of cases in which good faith disputes might arise, cases dealing with standards of conduct and contract formation. That's the first category. The second is cases concerning at-will termination of employment contracts and the third is limits on discretion in contractual performance. These three categories corresponds to three different times of the contracts existence.

Speaker 1:          02:24          It's formation, it's termination, and what happens in between the good faith requirement can always be seen as limiting discretionary behavior. Seutter saw that the limits on discretion though differ depending on whether we're talking about a contractor, his discretion in forming or terminating a contract or an exercising discretion during the contract. That is how to perform a contract when there is some discretion granted one side or the other under category one concerning good faith in formation. Good faith is tantamount to the traditional duties of care to refrain for misrepresentation and to correct subsequently discovered error in so far as any representation is intended to induce and his material to another party's decision to enter into a contract in justifiable reliance upon it. Basically suitor is saying that you have to be honest, both explicitly and implicitly when dealing at arm's length in negotiating the possible formation of a contract under category two concerning at-will termination of a contract, the good faith obligation limits and employers power to fire an at will employee good faith is violated when employer fires and that will employ quote out of malice or bad faith in retaliation for action taken or refused by the employee in consonance with public policy unquote combing through precedent.

Speaker 1:          03:59          The court determined that good faith in the third category of cases into which the instant dispute fell requires quote and implied obligation of good faith to observe reasonable limits in exercising that discretion consistent with the parties purpose or purposes in contracting unquote. The court further broke down the analysis required for category three discretionary performance cases into four questions. First, whether the contracting question aloud or conferred upon the defendant, a degree of discretion in performance that was tantamount to a power to deprive the plaintiff has of a substantial proportion of the agreements value. Second, if it did, whether the evidence suggested that the parties intended to make a legally enforceable contract. Third, if so, whether the defendant exercise exercise of discretion exceeded the limits of reasonableness. A question that required identifying the purpose of the contract and forth, whether the damage complained of resulted from events beyond the control of either party.

Speaker 1:          05:09          But the court didn't need to run through each of these four questions because it determined in, uh, the decision in answering the very first question that the contract did, it found did not confer discretion upon Gen ECOM to deprive send tronics have a substantial proportion of the agreements value. The court examined the contractual provisions governing release of the funds from escrow. The escrow agreement provided that quote in accordance with section 2.07 of the purchase agreement. The escrow agent shall hold the escrow funds in its possession until instructed in writing unquote by the parties lawyers quote to distribute the same or same portion thereof to send tronics or Jen Acom as the case may be section 2.07 of the purchase agreement and titled Final Payment of purchase price stated quote, final settlement and payment of the purchase price shall be made not later than 10 days after determination of the closing value and computation of the purchase price, whether by agreement of the parties or decision of the arbitrator.

Speaker 1:          06:22          These provisions were in the court's words, express and unequivocal. They gave Jen and no discretion to withhold payout for approved, uh, for approval beyond that time or to affect the timing of the arbitration itself. Because of this, the court concluded the gender Khan was not given discretion such that it could deprive and tronics indefinitely of a portion of the greed consideration for the business assets previously transferred. The court addressed discretion beyond the timeline specified in the agreement. What about before that timeline? Does Jen ECOM have discretion to release the funds before 10 days after determination of closing value? The court believed the text of the agreement supported the claim that the parties intended the escrow agent to leave the fund intact until the point of final payment, if any, that would be due to send tronics 10 days after the final price determination. Good faith did not require Jen come to do something in consistent with the terms of the agreement and here I'm quoting what send tronics claims to be Jenna comes discretion over the timing of distribution is in reality a power that each party may exercise but only jointly with the other two agree to remove some or all of the escrowed funds from the ambit of the otherwise mandatory payout provision unquote.

Speaker 1:          07:56          The opinion further agreed with the trial court that it wasn't the judges duty to quote insert a provision in the contract for partial payments were such provision does not exist. The court will not renegotiate the contract between the parties to obtain this result. In determining how to approach the good faith question. Suitor discussed two scholars, Summers and Burton, and there are differing understandings of the meaning of good faith. Summers adheres to an excluder analysis. He defines good faith as anything that isn't bad faith. He denied that certain words or phrases have a general positive meaning of their own, but instead quote function to rule out various things according to context unquote. One example he offered is the word voluntary in criminal law. Quoting a philosopher summers argued that when we say someone acted voluntarily, the word serves to exclude a heterogeneous range of cases such as physical compulsion, coercion by by threats, accidents, mistakes, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          09:08          Voluntary itself didn't designate a specific mental state. Summers believes that good faith is similar. It functions as an excluder to rule out a wide range of heterogeneous forms of bad faith. Such forms of bad faith include evading the spirit of bargain and abusive of a power to define specific terms. Burton by contrast advocates what he calls a recapture theory. He explained that parties give up certain opportunities at the time that they contract. He termed this the expected cost of performance, a party acted in bath, bad faith burden, argued quote precisely when discretion is used to recapture opportunities for gone, uh, upon contracting when the discretion exercising party refuses to pay the expected cost of performance for the purposes of analyzing good faith and discretion during contract performance of this third category, Seutter said that he found summer's analysis more in line with the New Hampshire press precedent.

Speaker 1:          10:18          Nevertheless, the four question test he set out reads, especially with its emphasis on con contracts, purpose, somewhat like an implementation of Burton's recapture theory. In any case, sooner explicitly attempted to analyze the case in recapture terms and determined that even by those terms, Jenny comms actions wouldn't constitute bad faith. This was because first Gen McCombs refusal to consent to distribution from escrow. Quote neither recaptures nor gains Jen and calm anything in and of itself. The refusal removes no issue from the contingencies of arbitration and gives Jen and Cobb no present or future rights to the money it wishes to obtain unquote more significantly. The court emphasized that to Burton's parties expected costs depend upon objective analysis of the party's expectation as they may be inferred from the express contract terms. In light of the ordinary course of business and customary practice, the courts objective analysis found that the parties expected the escrow to remain intact during the arbitration.

Speaker 1:          11:28          The parties us quote never bargained away the right of either of them to condition any distribution on completing the arbitration of any disputes. Jen income by insisting arbitration be completed before releasing escrow funds then was not trying to recapture a foregone opportunity. I'm not as sure that Jen Acom had not by default bargain away the right to resist releasing escrow bounds, not at risk would rational parties give Jen and calm this power of insistence it it gives Jen and calm bargaining power to possibly get sent tronics to agree to less than the arbitrator would ultimately give. Judge shooter seems to think this bargaining power was what sen tronic signed up for. So Jen Acom wasn't using its progression to get anything extra, but a contrary ruling that was explicitly a default might not have been contracted around by many parties. Then again, this bargaining power might have also affected the initial price sale price that was offered knowing that there would be a difficulty negotiating in its shadow.

Speaker 1:          12:44          More generally, how should a court think about a use of discretion that gives defendant very little and costs, uh, the plaintiff Alot if choosing x instead of, uh, instead of y gains the defendant a penny, but cost the plaintiff $100, is that bad faith if it gains the defendant $99, but costs the plaintiff 100, is that small inefficiency, bad faith? If it gains the defendant $100, but costs the plaintiff $100 and is just a transfer of, well, can that ever be bad faith? I'd be attracted to saying that using discretion, even discretion and refusing to modify a contract should be bad faith if it creates massive inefficiency. Imagine though that Jen and [inaudible] were found to have acted in bad faith and performing the contract. Is that a separate cause of action? Well, some jurisdictions do recognize a separate cause of action for failure to perform or enforce and in good faith, but most do not.

Speaker 1:          13:56          Instead, construing the failure to perform specific contractual terms in good faith as a breach of contract restatement. Section two oh five says that the appropriate remedies in breach of good faith cases can vary according to context. Sin Tronics is a pretty packed case. There's a lot to take away from it. The primary takeaway, the one most relevant to the dispute between San Tronics and Jen accom was that good faith and contractual performance arises only in the context of the party's exercise of discretion. But beyond that, we talked about suitors classification of different good faith scenarios and corresponding understandings of what could good faith entails. We also discussed too influential and very different understandings of good faith. The excluder theory espoused by summers and the expected cost or recapture theory, uh, ex championed by Burton. Think about which of these you find more persuasive.
