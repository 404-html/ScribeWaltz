Speaker 1:          00:00          We're now going to look at a pair of cases, CAS v CAS from New York, an AC versus Bz from Massachusetts. In both of these cases, courts had to decide what could happen with cryogenically frozen embryos left over from infertility treatments after a couple had gotten divorced. The basic story is the same in both cases. In each case, a couple suffered from infertility and decided to use in vitro fertilization in order to try to have children. Before we go any further, it's worth having a basic understanding how in vitro fertilization or IVF works. First doctors collect sperm from the man in eggs from a woman in the latter case with a minor surgery. Physicians then combine the eggs and sperm forming what the courts in these opinions call pre embryos or pre zygotes several days later, some of those pre zygotes or then implanted into a woman's uterus in hopes of a successful pregnancy, the woman receiving the implant can be the same woman as the egg donor or a surrogate.

Speaker 1:          01:10          In our cases, the woman receiving the pre zygotes was the egg donor. One of the intended parents, any pre zygotes that are leftover can be cryogenically frozen for later use before any of this took place. The two couples in our two cases filled out consent forms where they specified what should happen to any cryogenically frozen embryos should various events occur. For example, if the couple's decided they no longer wanted children or if the couple is passed away. In particular, these forums specified what should happen if they separated or got divorced. The cast is said that the zygotes should be used for scientific research while AC and busies consent forms specified that Bz should get control of cryogenically frozen zygotes. In each case, the ex wife wishes to use the frozen embryos after the divorce, while the ex husband does not wish to become a father in the cast as case from New York.

Speaker 1:          02:17          This goes against the couple's wishes as expressed on their consent form and in an agreement they wrote up at the time of their divorce, which affirmed that the zygotes where to go to scientific research in AAC versus Bz case. This seems to accord with the wishes that the couples indicated that the couple indicated on their medical consent form and there is no ladder documentation in both cases. The question is can one parent and forced the medical consent forms against the other in cast versus cast? Steven CAS is attempting to enforce their agreement that the embryos would go for scientific research against his ex wife Maureen cass who wishes to try and have them implanted in AC versus Bz. Bz wishes to enforce the consent forms against her ex husband a z in order to get control of the cryogenically frozen vials in her opinion and cast versus cast.

Speaker 1:          03:19          Chief Justice k looks at the case like a typical contract case in which the court's goal is to ascertain what the parties agreed to and then to enforce their agreement. Just because they involve a sensitive subject does not mean they should not quote generally be presumed valid and binding unquote just as other similar agreements are. In fact, the chief justice things that these sort of quote, advanced directives unquote are especially important in emotionally sensitive domains such as personal matters of reproductive choice involved in this case since they can prevent litigation by making it clear what the individuals wanted before the conflict emerged. Written agreements make it possible for courts to seek to honor the parties. Expressions of choice made before disputes erupt. The court of Appeals For New York therefore ruled for the ex husband and prevented the ex wife from attempting to become pregnant using the frozen embryos against the couple's agreement that the embryos would go to research should they get divorced.

Speaker 1:          04:32          Justice Cowan writing for the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in AC versus BZ starts out in the same vein looking at this as just an ordinary contract. She recites five different reasons why the consent forms are likely unenforcable as a against the ex husband. The consent form was an agreement between the couple and the clinic, but did not say it was meant to form an agreement between the two members. Uh, of the couple that consent form do not indicate for how long a period of time they are intended to apply. There is no definition of the term separated in the consent form, so it is not clear when it applies and on all occasions except the first the husband's signed the consent form, what was still blank and then the wife filled in all the details including the instruction that she was to get control of the frozen embryos.

Speaker 1:          05:32          The consent form is also not a separation agreement, so it is not enforceable between the ex husband and the ex wife, but this is not justice Collins main argument. Even if this agreement were perfectly executed, it would not be enforceable as against public policy. The justice is quote, would not enforce an agreement that would compel one to become a parent against his or her will unquote just as Cowan reads other aspects of Massachusetts family law to indicate a general policy by the state legislature that quote, individuals should not be bound by certain agreements, binding them to enter or not enter into familial relationships unquote. She sees this principle at work in the fact that parents cannot contract and advanced to give their children up for adoption in courts reluctance to enforce agreements that for surrogate mothers to give up their children they bear and in their refusal to enforce contracts requiring an individual to a band in a marriage.

Speaker 1:          06:39          Justice Cowan here is announcing more than a default rule, an individual cannot by contract wave for later decision whether to become a parent. The justice then applies the broad principle that quote individuals shall not be compelled to enter into an intimate family relationships and that the law shall not be used as a mechanism for forcing such relationships when they're not desired unquote to the case at hand and finds that the ex wife cannot use the frozen vials since that would force her ex husband to become a father coat over his president. Objections unquote. The big difference between how the two cases come out therefore appears to be that in cast versus cas, the agreement would have prevented parenthood while an AC versus Bz. The agreement would have forced parenthood on one party, but we can easily imagine arguments for applying the general principle of cast to ac and BC as well. And he's Enbz may have thought through very carefully at the time exactly what they wanted and decided ex ante that the best option was for BZ to keep the vials. There's an asymmetry here where courts will protect parties from themselves when they have been agreed in advance. Not to become parents, but not when they have given. When they have agreed in advance that one we'll have a right to force a parenthood on the other.

Speaker 2:          08:10          Okay,

Speaker 1:          08:11          so let's go to a quiz. A couple began IVF several years ago and there are several vials of cryogenically frozen embryos leftover. The couple initially specified in their consent form that the husband would get control of the vials if they got divorced. Now the couple has divorced and the ex husband wants to have the frozen embryos implanted in a surrogate mother. The X, Y Sue's to stop him. For whom? What a Massachusetts court rule. The ex husband or the ex wife.

Speaker 2:          08:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:44          Well, a Massachusetts court following a z versus BZ would rule for the ex wife. In this case the ex husbands action would make her apparent against her will and so the forms they claim to give him the right to do this are unenforceable. Surrogacy contracts race similar, thorny, ethical and public policy questions. These contracts attempt to govern the procreative choices of the surrogate after implantation. Surrogacy provisions routinely give intended parents the right to force surrogates to terminate pregnancies. If quote a fetus suffers from a serious birth defect or if a multiple pregnancy occurs where the fetal reduction may be recommended to improve the outcomes for the remaining fetuses and the surrogacy contracts. Also routinely container related clause that restricts the surrogate's ability to terminate the pregnancy without the intended parents consent unless you faces substantial harm from continuing the pregnancy. Should these promises to terminate or not terminate pregnancies ever be enforceable? Should promise is determinate be accorded more weight than promises not to terminate for reasons suggested by the casts and AC decisions should enforce it. Borough should enforce the ability turn on whether the surrogate or intended parents would be biological. Parents. Few scholars think that a court would ever order specific performance of the surrogate's promises, but the possibility of damages is subject to differing views.

Speaker 1:          10:31          We have seen two different approaches to frozen embryo cases in the two cases we've discussed. Cast versus casts treated agreements about embryos is ordinary contracts where courts should go along with the party's expressed ex ante wishes a z versus BZ on the other hand, suggested that courts will not enforce all agreements that commit parties to future family relations because these are against public policy.
