Speaker 1:          00:00          Today we will continue our discussion of pre contractual reliance based liability. You might remember from our last class discussing the Hoffman v Red Owl case. That liability may be appropriate if one party repeatedly Bates and switches during negotiation and the other party relies to its detriment. Today we will see a more modern application of this idea in Dixon, the wells Fargo Bank. Despite being a fairly recent case, Judge Young's opinion includes one of the most careful discussions of the development of promissory Estoppel and the literature on pre contractual negotiations. Before we start, let's take a moment to understand the basics of a mortgage. A mortgage or a mortgage loan is used by home buyers to purchase the, to purchase homes. The lender is usually a bank credit union or other financial institution. These loans are usually secured on the, uh, with the security security being the borrower's property.

Speaker 1:          01:06          This means that if the borrower defaults or is unable to pay, uh, the loan as it comes due, the lender can start foreclosure proceedings, which ultimately can lead to a foreclosure sale where the proceeds from the sale or first used to pay off the debt and only the remainder if any. Uh, it goes to the debtor. By the way, the homeowner is the one mortgaging the property and so it was called the mortgage or, and then bank is the mortgagee. A mortgage is a contract with a set of terms that binds both the lender and the borrower. The terms of the contractor sometimes modified. This process is known as a loan modification, sometimes as a debt restructuring. Of course, both the lender and the borrower have to agree to the modification for the modification to be effective while people modify their loans for a number of reasons.

Speaker 1:          02:06          One common reason is for a change in the borrower's ability to pay. For instance, if someone loses their job or a spouse becomes sick, a borrower might want to modify the loan terms to make sure he or she doesn't default. As you can imagine, a home purchase is often quite expensive and most people did not have enough cash on hand to pay the whole price of the home. That's, that's why they borrow money. Mortgages are therefore very common and many of you may already have one or we'll have one soon. When functioning properly, mortgages are essential to the wellbeing of the economy and the real estate market. However, things sometimes go awry during the subprime mortgage crisis, which contributed to the US and world recession from 2007 through 2009 a decline in home prices caused a large number of homeowners to default and led to massive mortgage foreclosures.

Speaker 1:          03:07          The effects rattled the U S and world economies and we're still still feeling some of those effects today. The, uh, events in the Dixon case happen during this turbulent time in the u s economy in June, 2009, the plaintiff's Dixon's orally agreed with the defendant's well Fargo to take steps to enter in to a mortgage loan modification negotiations, including stopping payments on their mortgage and submitting requested financial information. The plaintiff's perform these, perform these steps. But the defendants failed to enter the modification negotiations in December, 2010 plaintiffs received notice that defendant was foreclosing based on the borrower's failure to make mortgage payments even though the borrower failed to make payments be at the request of wells Fargo as a precondition of going into a modification negotiation.

Speaker 2:          04:13          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          04:13          the plaintiffs initiated suit in state court seeking number one, an injunction prohibiting defendant from foreclosing on their home and number two specific performance of an oral agreement to enter into loan modifications. And number three, seeking damages. The defendant, Wells Fargo, removed the case to federal court and then move to dismiss. How can you make an argument that promissory Estoppel liability as appropriate under these alleged facts? Well, promissory Estoppel again allows for enforcing the promise even if made without formal consideration. When the promise see relies on the promise to her detriment. In this case, the promise, the promise. See was the borrower who relied on the bank's promise to enter in to modification negotiations. If the borrowers would stop making their monthly payments, the borrower's reliance was to their detriment because the bank subsequently foreclosed on their home.

Speaker 2:          05:20          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:20          The main issue in this case is whether promissory representations in preliminary negotiations give rise to pre contractual liability when the promise he acts in reasonable Lee foreseeable reliance upon those representations or promises to their detriment.

Speaker 2:          05:41          Okay,

Speaker 1:          05:41          let's break it down to make sure we understand the promises or the problem story representation in this case is the banks offer to enter into a loan modifications. The negotiations are preliminary because they're not negotiating the of the modification. The liability in this case would be pre contractual. Since we can consider the modified loan to be a new contract, the liability is for the borrowers reliance made prior to any actual loan modification. The promise. See in this case the borrower's relied on the banks promissory representation by stopping, uh, uh, making payments and, and by submitting the requested financial information, this was to their detriment because again, the bank turned around and foreclosed on their home for failure to make payments. Thus, another way to frame this issue is simply whether promissory Estoppel is available for pre contractual promises. In this case, the court held that yes, promissory Estoppel is available for pre contractual promises.

Speaker 1:          06:49          This is true. Even though all the other elements of contractual liability, we're not made out such as sufficient definiteness. Is this case a new red l? Well, in our last lesson we learned about the holding and red owl, which will also allowed for pre contractual reliance spaced liability. When read Al was decided there was thought there was a thought that it was an application of promissory Estoppel in the pre contractual setting that might point the way toward a more general obligation of good faith in pre contractual negotiations. That potential was not realized as red owl has not had a broad effect. In some ways the Dixon case though shows that Red Al is not dead yet. It can still have important implications in certain current circumstances. Also recall teachers insurance, uh, uh, by Judge Laval that we discussed in the last case. Uh, and it's line of preliminary agreement cases, the teachers insurance case adopted and intent based test for when parties have entered into a preliminary agreement to negotiate.

Speaker 1:          08:09          The key inquiry query was whether the parties intended for their commitment to negotiate to be binding. Judge young was clearly aware of the teachers case and that line of cases. Is there a reason he did not apply them to the Dixon case itself? Well, one reason may be that the intent based inquiry would not generate the result of liability that judge young wanted. Uh, this intent based inquiry created a strong presumption against finding binding obligations in agreements to negotiate. It might make more sense for sophisticated parties who understand what the law is and understand the each other. Here the bank has a lot more information than the plaintiff borrowers who are are struggling to understand the terms of the loan. This might be one reason for why judge young opted for promissory Estoppel in this case. This example also might be a, an example of crisis law.

Speaker 1:          09:18          During Times of war or economic or political crisis, courts might decide cases differently than they would during non crisis times. What law is being applied in this case, state or federal? The answer is State Law. Notice that while this is a federal court, most of the citations are to Massachusetts cases. Much contemporary law regarding pre contractual liability has been developed by federal courts, by federal judges applying state law teachers. Insurance is especially noteworthy in this regard. First, it ran against the spirit of New York state law cases, uh, cases decided by New York state courts, which schlock sharply limited pre contractual liability. And second, the broad ranging factual inquiry into the party's intent differed from the tendency of New York courts to put greater weight on the written word in the United States. A federal court can pose a certified question for an opinion on a question of state law to assist or state court.

Speaker 1:          10:31          Not every state permits federal courts to certify questions, uh, to their state courts. But Massachusetts does in Dixon judge young discuss this possibility but ultimately decided not to certify the question whether the Dixons allegations are sufficient to state a claim for promissory Estoppel to the judicial court, which is the highest court in Massachusetts. Though the judge leaves open the possibility for certification if wells Fargo or the Dixon files a motion for him to do so. Whether federal courts should be more willing to certify undecided state law questions to state courts is an interesting problem. On the one hand, certification might reduce inconsistency in application of state law and give states better control over what their law is. On the other hand, it might slow the wheels of justice. Today we examine Dixon versus wells Fargo, a case that held promissory representations in pre contractual note negotiations can be enough to establish reliance based liability. It is a modern application of red owl, which we learned in just the last class. The case also stands for the proposition that reliance based liability rather than the more exacting intent-based inquiry inquiry and teachers assurance is sometimes going to be chosen, at least during times of crisis.
