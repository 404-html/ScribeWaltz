Speaker 1:          00:00          Today we're going to talk about Wallace versus Smith. A case decided by the New Mexico Court of Appeals in 2001 like cases we've been discussing recently. Wallace versus Smith involves the enforceability of contract claims as well as the viability of tort claims in light of public policy. This case is an appeal from a dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim and so on. Appeal. The court assumes the allegations of the complaint are true for the purposes of determining whether the complaint states a viable claim for relief. The plaintiff, Peter Wallace, alleges that he and defendant Kelly Race Smith were a couple engaged in a sexual relationship. Wallace made it clear that he did not want to father a child and the two talked about possible methods of contraception. They agreed that Smith would use birth control pills and that their sexual intimacy would cease if Smith stopped using birth control.

Speaker 1:          01:03          Wallace did not himself use any form of contraception. At some point, Smith decided to stop taking birth control, but she did not tell Wallace. She had stopped and the two continued their relationship. Smith became pregnant and gave birth to a daughter. New Mexico law required Wallace to pay child support for the first 18 years of his child's life, while a sued for compensatory and punitive damages. Arguing that because of the child support obligations created by Smith's failure to tell him she had ceased taking birth control pills, he had suffered a substantial economic injury. The trial court, however, determine that public policy prohibited Wallace from bringing those claims. The court of appeals agreed. Recall our previous discussions about the factors that weigh in favor of finding that a particular public policy exists. One of the primary factors is what the legislature has said on the subject. The court emphasize that our legislature has spoken to the public policy that governs the economic consequences of sexual relationships that produce children and that policy is reflected in New Mexico child support laws.

Speaker 1:          02:19          New Mexico had adopted the uniform parentage act, which quote imposes a form of strict liability for child support without regard to which parent bears the greater responsibility for the child's being unquote. That in turn reflected a strong public policy that makes paramount the interest of the child genera generally in a, it was in the child's best interest to receive financial support from both parents by seeking to recover for the very financial loss caused him by the statutory obligation to pay child support. Wallace was attempting to circumvent is support obligations and shift financial responsibility for their child entirely on to Smith. The court of appeals determined this contravene the state's public policy and noted that tar knowledge, no jurisdiction recognizes contraceptive fraud or breach of promise to practice birth control as a ground for Justin and natural parent's obligation to pay child support. The court denied Wallaces fraud claims noting quote, not all misrepresentations are actionable unquote judge Allred's. Concurrence delved more deeply into the misrepresentation argument explaining if we recognize a claim based on intentional misrepresentation, we have started down the road toward establishing standards of conduct and reproductive relationships. One of the most important and private forms of interpersonal relations, candor and reproductive matters should be left to the ethics of the participants unquote, whether expressed as a contract or a tort claim. The court of appeals was clear that the economic injury caused by unwanted fatherhood was not compensable.

Speaker 2:          04:10          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:10          The opinions recital of facts suggest that Smith initially used birth control as agreed and only later changed her mind. But what if the facts were just did slightly imagine that Smith never intended to use birth control at all when she promised Wallace that you would, what kind of claim would that possibly suggest?

Speaker 1:          04:36          Well, it sounds like promissory fraud. Could Wallace pursue a promissory fraud claim? In theory, the arguments for promissory fraud look strong, especially a Smith, we're financially secure and could provide for her child the loan, but courts have not entertained such claims and the contraceptive fraud context, perhaps the reality of intimate relationships and the often imperfect understanding those in such relationships have of one another's intentions. Make that a good thing to mind. Mind, however, the court goes too far and is in establishing an immutable rule against liability. The court evidentiary concern could be handled by only enforcing written agreements of the kind that we've seen in the frozen embryo cases and the court's concern about child support could be handled by keeping the plaintiff contingently on the hook for support if the defendant failed to have enough resources to pay for the child.

Speaker 1:          05:38          Imagine now that Wallace and Smith had the same agreement to only have sex when contraceptives were used, but that that it was Wallace who would use a contraceptive if Wallace intentionally ceased doing so and Smith became pregnant when she has a better claim for damages. And then did in this case, notice that the court's opinion focuses on the fact that Wallace sought recovery purely for economic injury. Indeed, judge Alridge expressly declined to address whether tortuously inflicted physical harm to a sex partner would be foreclosed. In a similar case, the fact that pregnancy would cause Smith to cover physical trauma in addition to economic harm might make such a claim more plausible. Would a broken promise by a man to use contraceptive be more enforceable than a broken promise by a woman? Would promises not to use contraceptives? Be More enforceable under contractor toward fraudulently inducing consent to sex as a kind of assault, isn't it?

Speaker 1:          06:46          Now let's move away from the procreation promises and consider instead of very different hypothetical that raises some of the public policy concerns we've been discussing. Imagine that a bunch of professors are at a dinner together before the start of the fall semester. Professor a mentions that he's planning to sell his used car once the incoming students arrive on campus. Professor B who has just arrived for the year carless as a visiting lecture says she herself might want to buy the car and wants to know if she can have a mechanic examine it before purchasing it. Professor a agrees but only on the condition that professor B not disclose anything about what the mechanic fines. Professor B agrees after the mechanic looks at the car. Professor B calls professor a to say she does not want the car and begins to say that the mechanic found a problem with it. Professor a though cuts in says, don't tell me professor B response, but it's a safety problem and professor a repeats.

Speaker 1:          08:02          Don't tell me. Professor a then sells the car to an incoming graduate student. A does not disclose his agreement with Professor B and uh, professor aid does not disclose that. B had said there was a safety problem with the car later the graduate students suffers injuries in a car accident caused by that very safety problem. Should a should professor a face any liability for the students accident and did professor be breached and enforceable promise when professor B told professor aid there was a safety problem with the car. As you probably sense enforcing an agreement to remain silent in the face of a serious safety issue like the one described in this hypothetical would almost surely be against public policy. Though professor be breached, the agreement to remain silent, professor B would not be liable because of the agreement would be found to be against public policy.

Speaker 1:          09:08          And once professor a learned via the breach that there was a safety problem with the car. Professor a had a duty to disclose this to the student professor A's failure to do so would be a tort and possibly criminal. But are there potentially negative consequences to not enforcing this agreement to remain silent? If professor a knew that the agreement with professor a two with Professor B to remain silent, we're not enforceable, professor a probably wouldn't have let professor be inspect the car at all. This wouldn't give the student seeking to buy the car any new safety information because pref professor a would have remained willfully ignorant. One possible alternative would be to make professor be liable for small damages for contractual breach if she disclosed adverse safety information. But making professor be liable for large damages in tort. If she failed to disclose safety information and a subsequent purchaser was hurt, the damages for breach would likely be much smaller because they would only represent the a reduction in price of the car that would now have to be fixed, that professor A's of the world would still allow inspection and the professor B's might be willing to enter this kind of agreement because of the possibility that no adverse safety information would been terrilizer during such an inspection.

Speaker 1:          10:54          Perversely, by enforcing the silent promise, the law might produce more safety information. So what have we learned from Wallace and this agreement to remain silent? Hypothetical from Wallace, we know that courts generally will not recognize contraception fall contra contraception, fraud claims based on economic injury caused by an obligation to pay child support and know the reasoning was based on the best interest of the child. The case echoes some of the concerns about interfering with private and intimate relationships. We've touched on in previous cases from the hypothetical about remaining silent. We saw another example of an agreement in a context that would almost universally be considered unenforceable, but we also considered the potential negative implications of a policy against enforcement and a possible alternative policy.
