Speaker 1:          00:00          Today's case felled versus Henry s Levian sons concerns breadcrumbs, not the kind that fall off slice of slices of bread as you eat it, but rather industrial made machine ground breadcrumbs Felds company, the crushed toast company entered into a contract with Levine and son's bakery to buy all of the breadcrumbs they would produce in the upcoming year with the contract set to renew every year unless one party gave the other six months notice over the course of the year and sons produced and sold more than 250 tons of breadcrumbs, but over that time they decided that 6 cents per pound they had agreed to and the contract was too low. They tried to get fell to agree to a price of price increase of 7 cents per pound, but when he refused, they shut down their breadcrumb making operation and dismantled all of the machinery involved, the stale loaves of bread that they would have used making crumbs.

Speaker 1:          01:08          They instead sold for animal feed. Once they did this, they stopped selling any crumbs to the crush toast company as their output was now zero filled then sued. Considering this to be a breach of their contract. We're looking at the decision from the New York Court of Appeals on appeal from denial of both parties motion for summary Judgment and so the underlying procedural question is whether there is a question of material fact for a jury to decide in this case. In order to answer this question, Judge Cook looks at the substantive legal question of whether the seller was required to produce breadcrumbs or if Levian sons could satisfy its obligation by handing over the zero breadcrumbs it produced. Judge Cook relies on the uniform commercial codes, rules for output and requirements contracts. We've encountered these sort of contracts before, for example, in the sooner sand case, but it's worth a quick refresher in an output contract as we have in this case, the buyer agrees to purchase all of a given product that the seller makes in a requirements contracts.

Speaker 1:          02:24          On the other hand, the seller agrees to make as much of a given product as the buyer requires or needs. Note that in each of these types of contracts, one party has discretion over the quantity of goods sold in output contracts. It's the seller while in requirement contracts, it's the buyer. What we have in this case is an output contract. Since Levian son is obliged to sell its entire output to the crushed toast company, the agreement is only exclusive in one direction. Though the crush toasts company is allowed to buy crumbs from others. The key provision of the UCC is section two three Oh six subsection one and Forbes us at the party with discretion does not have unlimited discretion. They must determine the quantity in good faith in accordance with their actual output or requirements and that quantity cannot be unreasonably disproportionate to what the party's estimated or expected.

Speaker 1:          03:25          Courts have generally prioritize the good faith requirement over the prohibition of unreasonably disproportionate amounts output in requirement contracts. Give us another context to learn what the law demands in terms of good faith, you should see these discretionary quantity cases that they generally fit into the categories that judges suitor and Posner called discretionary performance as opposed to good faith in formation or in termination. But this particular case is more of a good faith in termination since Levian sons by choosing deceased production is also an essence terminating the contract. Judge Cook looks at what the UCC provision means for the case at hand. He finds that under New York law, good faith cessation of production terminates any further obligations and excuses further performance, so the simple fact that Levy and sons cease producing breadcrumbs is not sufficient for felled to win the case. The question is whether the seller acted in good faith.

Speaker 1:          04:31          Levian sons says that producing breadcrumbs was economically not feasible, but that's too vague and permissive. A test for Judge Cook. We need to look at the motives, cook fines, that it's not enough for a seller to simply find that it is making less profit than expected. Rather continued production must actually imperil the businesses continued operation or or push it into bankruptcy. Otherwise they are bound by the price they agreed to when they formed the contract even with judge cooks. Clarification, this rule is not obvious. It's not clear why bankruptcy should be sufficient. Leveraged Buyouts may leave businesses with very little room for reduced profitability, but that shouldn't affect their obligations to contractual partners. One possible economically sensible rule would be due excuse performance. When the joint profits of the seller and buyer combined are negative, that's one of the parties losses exceed the other party's gains from the transaction.

Speaker 1:          05:40          This case, however, looks pretty clearly like bad faith that at least on the facts that we have here, the bakery only dismantled its machinery after its attempts to extort a higher price from the buyer were unsuccessful. The court remands so that the ultimate decision on this factual question will be made by the jury. This decision is one of several areas where courts have conditioned to corporations legal duties on whether fulfilling the duty would drive the firm into bankruptcy. For example, if a set of disabled employees request reasonable accommodation, an employer is less likely to need to grant the request if doing so would drive the employer and the bankruptcy. But in today's world of modern finance, the risk of bankruptcy can be somewhat under the firm's own control and in part a function of how the choose the firm chooses to finance itself. Highly leveraged firms that are financed more with debt than equity will be more susceptible to bankruptcy, but bankruptcy, and in that case, in the case of a highly leveraged firm, doesn't mean the firm isn't viable economically.

Speaker 1:          06:55          It just means that the firm will have to reorganize and the erstwhile bond holders will become the new shareholders of the post bankrupt from imagine two identical firms that produce widgets. Both are wholly financed by equity or stock and both are worth $100 million. They'd have to lose a lot of money before they hit the bankruptcy point. But now imagine that one firm decides to do a leverage buyout where it borrows a bunch of money by issuing bonds and uses this money to buy back almost all of its shares. The firm is still worth 100 million, but now it's possible that 99 million of it will be owned by the bond holders and just 1 million by the remaining shareholders after the leveraged buyout. The second firm is much closer to the point of bankruptcy, but should the law allow the second firm to have lower duties with regard to output contracts and duties of reasonable accommodation, the economist would say no and instead argue that viable, the viability of the bread production should turn more on the joint profitability of production for the buyers and the sellers.

Speaker 1:          08:11          Let's take a quick look at subsection two of section two three Oh six as well. This provision says that when the buyer and seller have a contract with an exclusive dealing provision, they must unless otherwise agreed, use best efforts. The duty of making best efforts is usually seen as a default duty to the other side, uh, of a contract when the, uh, when there is exclusive dealing lady death. Gordon, for example, promise to deal exclusively with wood and wood in exchange, implicitly promised to use best efforts to promote her endorsements here. Levy and sons agreed to sell exclusively to Feld, but we don't need Felds promise of best efforts. Uh, so we might think that filled would promote the sale of breadcrumbs because felled had already committed to buy all of levies, output and the parties and making an output contract are not expecting the seller to make best efforts to supply the good, just an effort to supply an amount that is in good faith.

Speaker 2:          09:21          Okay,

Speaker 1:          09:22          so let's try a quiz. Imagine that we had the same contract as in this case, but as the year comes to an end and Levian son realizes that this contract is extremely profitable the following year, instead of 250 tons, they produce 5,000 tons of breadcrumbs. This felled of a suit for breach of contract. Well, probably yes, felled would advocates in this scenario, Levy and sons produces 20 times the amount of breadcrumbs he would have expected, uh, based on the first year. And the jury would likely conclude that this amount is unreasonably disproportionate under subsection one of two three Oh six so let's recap. We have seen that when parties enter and output or requirements contract, the party that has discretion over the quantity of goods sold must act in good faith and not impose a quantity unreasonably disproportionate to what the other party would expect either based on an explicit estimate or based on past or normal behavior.
