Speaker 1:          00:01          As we've previously discussed, the AME and awarding expectation damages as to put the injured party in as good a position as she would have been in had the contract been performed. This can be difficult when the injured party possibly has a subjective value in the other side's performance that exceeds the economic value of performance. And this is illustrated in a 1962 Oklahoma case called PV house versus Garland Coal Company, the Pv House cases incredibly famous and it provokes a passionate responses in generations of law. Students in the Pvs case, the PV houses signed a contract allowing the defendant, garland coal and mining company to strip mine a portion of their property in exchange for royalties on the proceeds, a contractual covenant specified however, that the defendant was required to restore the property. Uh, after the completion of the mining, uh, after the mining was completed, completed, garland refused to restore the land as specified in the contract. And the plaintiff sued for $25,000 in damages, slightly less than the $29,000 cost of performance at trial. The jury awarded the plaintiff's $5,000 far less than the cost of performance, but more than the dimunition in market value. As a result of the breach, which was found to be only $300 plaintiffs and defendants both appealed the damage award claiming respectively that the damage award was inadequate or excessive. The instant court ruled in favor of the defendant.

Speaker 1:          01:53          The central issue is this is the measure of contract damages, the cost of performance or the dimunition in market value as a result of the breach. The court held that when the cost of performance is disproportionately greater than the economic value of performance as it was in this case, damages are limited to the dimunition in value caused by the breach to reach this result. The court relied on Oklahoma statutes, which according to the court limit the damages recoverable to a reasonable amount, not contrary to substantial justice and quote, prevent plaintiffs from recovering a greater amount in damages for the breach of an obligation than they would have gained by the full performance thereof. The court then awarded $300 the dimunition in value resulting to the premises because of nonperformance of the remedial work under the most liberal view of the evidence, this holding was accompanied by a sharp dissent by Justice Irwin.

Speaker 1:          03:00          The descent noted that the defendant had knowledge when it prevailed upon the plaintiffs to execute the lease, that the cost of performance might be disproportionate to the value or benefits received by plaintiff for the performance and that quote, there were several negotiations between the plaintiff and defendant before the contract was executed. Therefore, the th the descent would award damages equal to the cost of performance. So let's take a short detour to answer a pop quiz. A construction company contracts to build a summer home for a property owner. The contract specifies that all plumbing must use readying pipe. The company unintentionally installs some pipe by another manufacturer. After the building is complete, the property owner refuses to pay the 3,500 balance due on a $77,000 contract price and sues for the cost to replace the pipes because most of the plumbing is encased in walls. The cost to replace the plumbing would be very high.

Speaker 1:          04:07          The value of the property would only slightly increase if at all with writing pipes. What result under the PV house decision? Well, under the PV house rule, the property owner would only be entitled to damages equal to the dimunition in value of the property, uh, due to noncompliant performance. Since the dimunition in values much lower because the dimunition in value is so much lower than that cost to performance, you should remember that this hypothetical is based on Jacob and Young's versus Kent, which we already studied at the very beginning of this course. If you didn't remember it, you might consider stopping and reviewing the course more generally. The Jacob and Young's case is a good application of the economic waste doctrine referenced by the majority in Pv House. The court points to section three 46 subparagraph one a of the first restatement which concerns damages for defective run, finished construction available for a breach by one who has contracted to construct this a specified product.

Speaker 1:          05:18          According to that section, the promise, he is entitled to the reasonable cost of construction completion in accordance with the contract. If this is possible and does not involve unreasonable economic waste or the difference between the value of that the product contracted for would have had and the value of the performance that has been received by the plaintiff if construction and completion in accordance with the contract would involve unreasonable economic waste. However, the court notes that the restatement makes it clear that the economic waste referred to consists of the destruction of a substantially completed building or other structure and that no such destruction was involved in the PV house case. So the provision is it most persuasive as an analogy, if the change in the value of the land from nonperformance was so much lower than the cost of restoration, why? Why might the contract have included this seemingly irrational provision of a requiring a restoration of the land, while perhaps the PV house has had a very high subjective value for their land that was considerably greater than the market value.

Speaker 1:          06:36          If the PV has his subjective value, exceeded the cost of restoration, but was less than the value of the contract to Garland, then the restoration provision was a value adding addition to the contract. There are other possibilities. However, the cost of performance may have just become unexpectedly high. As a result, Garlin preferred to breach and pay damages rather than to perform. Another possibility which comes closer to promissory fraud is that garland in making the promise to restore, never intended to perform. Perhaps garland knew the value of the land to the PV houses was less than the entire Lee than the expected cost of restoration of $29,000 but the garland never anticipated performing the restoration clause. It expected that a court, if push comes to shove, would only award a damages that were equal to this dimunition in value. Jude, Judith, Mao Tej has unearthed additional facts surrounding the PV house dispute.

Speaker 1:          07:47          In her historical analysis, she learned that the PV houses apparently waived the right to receive $3,000 in cash upon executing their lease in exchange for the special promise from Garland to repair the property. In other words, the remedial work garland agreed to was priced into the contract that garland was then able to breach without repaying at least the $3,000 originally waived by the PV houses suggests that the coal company received a windfall under the holding. The PV has his case has been criticized on the ground that the diminished value award undercut both the land orders, landowners subjective value in having his or her land reclaimed and a broader public interest in achieving the same result. In 1967 the Oklahoma legislature and posted duty upon mine operators to reclaim the land after work was done and authorized the state to contract for the work to be done.

Speaker 1:          08:54          If operator defaulted a procedural side note, the PV houses may have strategically chosen not to present any evidence of subjective value so as to leave the jury with an all or nothing choice of costs or performance damages or nothing. Hoping that the jury would pick the larger amount may be the land did have sentimental value to the plaintiffs because, oh, they were engaged to be married there, but sometimes it might strategically being the plaintiff's interest to withhold evidence of certain types of damage. If credible subjective value evidence were introduced, a dimunition in value award might include it. Finally, you might ask yourself whether the PV house rule is merely a default. The language of the opinion seems to be couched as a mandatory limitation on damages, but if future parties made clear that because of subjective value, they wanted cost or performance or even specific performance of the, of the restoration promise, there's at least some chance that courts would enforce it. Not withstanding a substantially smaller dimunition in market value. Let's review today we've considered a case in which a court awarded the economic dimunition in market value in the plaintiff's property due to a defendant's breach because the dimunition in value measure was considerably less than the cost or performance damaged measure. But just maybe this outcome is merely a default rule.
