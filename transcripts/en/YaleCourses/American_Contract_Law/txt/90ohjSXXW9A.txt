Speaker 1:          00:00          Welcome back to further explorations of the UCC section two seven Oh eight, section two seven Oh eight subparagraph two doesn't only cover lost volume sellers. There are other circumstances in which the damages calculated according to two seven Oh eight subparagraph one might be inadequate. Let's consider a hypothetical. Imagine a seller [inaudible] entered into a contract with a buyer Bisco whereby smergo would manufacture and sell 200 toaster ovens to Bisco for our $60 per oven, uh, for a total of $12,000. Bisco repudiates the agreement while summer go is manufacturing the ovens because the market for toaster ovens is dismal. SMERGO stops, uh, manufacturing them. Smergo suse and proves the following facts. The market price for ovens if completed at the time and place of tender was $7,000. [inaudible] can sell them material. He's amassed for manufacturing the ovens for $3,500 smirk. We'll have $800 in cost of shipping the ovens to the buyer.

Speaker 1:          01:19          Uh, if, if the, if the, if the ovens were completed and sold a smirk, GGO has incurred $6,000 in expenses at the time of the breach. SMERGO would have to spend $600 more to perform the contract and smirk go has allocated overhead at $10 per oven, uh, for a total of $2,000. What would damages look like under two seven Oh eight one. And what would they look like under subparagraph two seven Oh eight two uh, plugging in the data we have to the formula provided in those provisions, we'd get the following that four to seven Oh eight one we'd have the $12,000 contract price minus the $7,000 market price plus $0 million for incidental damages minus $800, uh, as the expenses saved for shipping, which equals $4,200. Note that this amount is not taking into account the amount smergo has incurred in expenses is overhead or the value of manufacturing materials?

Speaker 1:          02:32          Well, what would damage his be under two seven Oh eight subparagraph to one formula offered by professor John Siebert for calculating damages under that provision. In the case, in cases that don't involve lost volume is as follows, you take the unpaid contract price minus total variable costs plus incidental damages plus reliance damages. Minus the proceeds of resale minus expenses saved. And here is how subparagraph to damages would look like. They would be equal to $12,000 minus $6,600 plus zero plus $2,500 minus zero minus $800 which all adds up to $7,100. The first formula does not capture smirk goes expected profits, including fixed cost nor his reliance damages. The second formula does and would produce a greater damage. So in this case, Margot would want to argue that sub paragraph to damages were appropriate because sub paragraph one would be insufficient to put them in as good a position as if uh, the buyer had performed.

Speaker 1:          03:53          Catch your breath. And now let's consider another mathematical hypothetical. Suppose a middleman agrees to supply 9,000 units of goods to a buyer in six regular installments on July 1st and on January 2nd of every year for three years at $100 per unit. At the time of the first scheduled delivery, which is July 1st, the market price for the goods was $95 per unit. At that time, the seller delivered 1500 units. But by December 1st the price plummeted to $45 per unit. The buyer repudiated on that date. At this point, the seller had a forward contract with an option to purchase 1500 units for the next installment at $75 per unit and had no other goods or forward contracts on the date for the next delivery, which is January 2nd by which time the market price had now dropped to $40 per unit. The buyer rejected the second installment and said he would take no more deliveries.

Speaker 1:          05:04          The seller sued on July 1st the intended date of the third delivery. The market price was now at $50 but was expected to gradually recover. The seller wanted to use t two seven oh eight one as the basis of recovery. The buyer believes this will overcompensate the seller. Can you see why well considered the goods at the second delivery date? The contract price minus the market price. That is the measure of damages. Under sub paragraph one would be $60 per unit, but because of the buyers option contract at $75 per unit, the profit would have been only $25 per unit. Some courts would limit sellers recovery here because with his option contract he had hedge the risk of a declining market price. But in the third delivery where there was no forward contract under two seven Oh eight one the seller would be able to recover $50 per unit, the hundred dollar contract price minus the $50 market price.

Speaker 1:          06:18          The remaining intended deliveries are initially appear more complex because we do not know what the market price at the time and place of Tinder would be for these future deliveries, but a different UCC provision section two seven 23 one provides that in such situations, uh, where the time for performance has not yet occurred. The market price at the time the seller learned of the repudiation, which here is $45 will be used to calculate damages for all these remaining delivery times. So the seller would get $55 per units for all of these final delivery times. As these examples suggest, the damage calculation rules can lead to very different and somewhat perverse results for different installments. We've packed a whole lot into these, this two part video, so let's summarize what we've learned. First we use Locke v Wade to discuss lost volume sellers. Then we introduced and discussed UCC provision two seven oh eight and the differences between subsection one subsection two finally, we applied these subsections to two different mathematical hypothetical's and together we calculated damages under each.
