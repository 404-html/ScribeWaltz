Speaker 1:          00:02          In today's lesson, we will learn more about a promises, right to suspend performance before a promissory is breach by examining the case of AMF versus Mcdonald's corporation will take the opportunity to better understand sections two six oh nine and two six 10 of the uniform commercial code, which concerns party's right to adequate assurance, a performance and cases of anticipatory repudiation. First, let, let's review the two relevant sections of the UCC two six oh nine states that if a promise he has reasonable grounds for insecurity. In other words, if it has reasonable doubts that the other party will will perform her promise, the promise see can demand adequate assurance of performance. This request must be made in writing the promise. See if commercially reasonable may suspend her own performance until she receives adequate assurance and if the promise or doesn't give adequate assurance within a reasonable time not to exceed 30 days, it's considered a repudiation of the contract and the promise he can cancel.

Speaker 1:          01:18          UCC section two six 10 governs what happens for a repudiation of the contract. When one party repudiates the contract, the aggrieved party can await performance for a reasonable amount of time or resort to any remedy for breach, regardless of which option the aggrieved party chooses. It can suspend its own performance. Keep these two provisions in mind as we explore this case. So here are the facts of uh, AMF versus Mcdonald's. Mcdonald's, the defendant appellee in this case paid AMF. The plaintiff appellant some $20,000 for a prototype, a computerized cash register. Mcdonald's installed the cash register in it's elk grove store. Four months later, Mcdonald's ordered 16 more such registers. Five months later, Mcdonald's franchisees ordered seven more. The first registered was to be delivered in February, 1969 with the others delivered during the first half of that year. In February, 1969, the registers never arrived in AMF.

Speaker 1:          02:33          Moved the delivery's back to July, 1969 on top of this, the first test unit didn't test satisfactorily. At this point, Mcdonald's was starting to get concerned at a March 18th, 1969 meeting between AMF and Mcdonald's. Mcdonald's requested that production of the registers be stopped until the parties negotiated performance. And reliability standards for the machines. The parties were unable to agree on the standards. In April, 1969 the AMF prototype was removed from the elks Grove Mcdonald's for poor performance. On July 29th, 1969 Mcdonald's canceled AMF then sued for wrongful cancellation, McDonald's, Sudei IMF to recover the purchase price of $20,385 the cases were tried together. The trial court held for the defendant. In both cases, AMF then appealed and the instant court affirmed. The question is, did McDonald's rightfully terminate the contract per se pursuant to UCC sections two six oh nine and two six 10 the court held that yes, Mcdonald's was right to terminate the contract, but it took several steps to get there.

Speaker 1:          03:56          Let's go through the court's rationale by looking at each step of the analysis. Let's start with UCC. Section two six oh nine the court found that Mcdonald's clearly had reasonable grounds for insecurity in titling it to demand adequate assurance of performance under two six oh nine in other words, Mcdonald's had reason to believe AMF wasn't going to perform what conduct should constitute reasonable grounds for insecurity. This is a bit of an open ended question, but in addition to the failure to deliver on an individual installment, a merchants in solvency or even rumors of bankruptcy might be sufficient, but what about the UCC section two six o' nine's requirement of a written demand? You'll recall that Mcdonald's never issued a written demand for assurance of performance for this. The court excuses Mcdonald's from the requirement of a written demand by noting that the UCC is to be liberally construed and declaring that Mcdonald's requests for further negotiation led to a quote of clear understanding that Mcdonald's had suspended performance until it should receive adequate assurance of do performance from AMF unquote.

Speaker 1:          05:18          Mcdonald's is clearly sophisticated enough to read the UCC, so why does the court have the power to waive? The UCC is writing requirement by what right does this activist judge contravene legislative supremacy? This decision is not a conventional application of UCC is two six oh nine explicit requirement that the the man be in writing. Moreover, there was nothing in the opinion that indicates there was even a formal oral demand. Instead, the court applied to 609 to the parties routine negotiation behavior and gave it legal consequence to 609 is already a section that is replete with fuzzy standards. What are ground when, when our grounds for insecurity reasonable. What is uh, an assurance that is adequate? When is suspending performance commercially reasonable? When his failure to provide adequate assurance, not within a reasonable time. The requirement of a demand in writing was one of the few rural like requirements and this case dare to fuzz up this element as well.

Speaker 1:          06:32          On the other hand, a realist might claim that this is a victory of substance over form, especially where the lack of form was not prejudicial. The court then concluded that AMF never provided the assurance that had been demanded and this failure amounted to a repudiation under two six oh nine sub paragraph four. Thus, Mcdonald's rightfully canceled pursuant to two six 10. Uh, sub paragraph B ams to behavior. In this case it was clear it never gave assurance it was going to perform, but what kind of conduct should constitute adequate assurance? Mere words might at times be adequate, but in other cases, adequate assurance might also require additional forms of consideration from the promise or such as a bond or a letter of credit. Many contractors would be surprised to learn that by promising they were taking on an obligation to provide adequate assurance if reasonable insecurity arises much less that the adequate adequate assurance might include taking substantive action to assure the primacy of your ability to perform.

Speaker 2:          07:51          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:52          What was the last step of the court's analysis? The answer is UCC section two seven 11. The sub paragraph one that section lays out the buyer's remedies when the seller repudiates the contract, which includes canceling the contract.

Speaker 2:          08:12          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:12          Demanding adequate assurance can be a risky strategy. Uh, promises right to demand. Adequate assurance at first seems to importantly enhance the promises. Defensive right to assure the promise doors performance after all, two six oh nine allows promises to suspend their own performance even before a promise or breaches or repudiates the contract. And it allows a promise see to force the promise or into anticipatorily repudiating their promises if they can't give an adequate assurance. But the right to demand adequate assurance carries considerable risk. The privacy, who wants to suspend their own performance under UCC section two six oh nine Mustang have reasonable grounds for insecurity and they must make a demand in writing, uh, demanding adequate assurance and they must show that they have not received an adequate assurance from the promise or if a promissory suspends performance. And of course subsequently finds that one of these requirements was not present, the promises attempted defensive action will constitute a breach of contract by the promise see herself.

Speaker 1:          09:31          What starts off as a legitimate concern about whether the other side will perform, can ultimately become a finding that the promise see herself breached by mistakenly exercising her two six oh nine defensive rights. In other words, suspending performance or treating a contract as repudiated for failure to give adequate assurance might backfire on the promise. See, making the demand, maybe the fuzzy likes standards of two six oh nine are a feature and not a bug of this section. The possibility that either side might end up being held liable after a promise. He invokes the, the section might help drive both parties to negotiate a compromise and it dampens the likelihood that promises would overuse the two six oh nine option, the right to demand adequate assurance also exists in common law. Remember that the UCC only applies to a sale of goods. So we care about the common law rule for service contracts and non good contracting.

Speaker 1:          10:42          Section two 51 of the second restatement purports, uh, to state the common law rule on adequate assurance. Though it isn't not followed by all the states. For instance, New York has not embraced the adequate assurance doctor and outside of the UCC article two, but sometimes we'll apply it to non UCC cases. For instance, in One New York case about an electricity contract, the court was asked whether a party has the right to demand adequate assurance of future performance in a contract not governed by the UCC. That New York court answered the question in the affirmative by extending UCC two six oh nine two the contract by analogy concluding that the sale of electricity was sufficiently similar to a sale of goods and that parties to a longterm commercial contract, which is complex and not reasonably susceptible of all securities features being anticipated bargain for and incorporate it into the original contract.

Speaker 1:          11:46          As a law student at Yale, I used section two 51 in a lawsuit against Gel itself during a disruptive 10 week strike in the fall semester. I helped organize a group of students to place their spring semester tuition in escrow, suspending their performance, their a promise of pain spring semester tuition after sending the university a letter in writing saying that we had reasonable grounds for insecurity about the university's ability to perform its promises in the spring semester. The right to suspend your performance when you have reasonable grounds for insecurity has a hidden gem of contract law. In summary, let's review the steps in the UCC that the court used to reach the final result. First it determined under two six oh nine one that Mcdonald's had reasonable grounds for insecurity to make a demand of adequate assurance of performance. Second, it determined that Mcdonald's is excused from two six o' nine's requirement of a written demand. Third, it determined that AMF failed to provide assurance, adequate assurance, and that it's behavior amounted to repudiation under two six oh nine four under two six 10 be repudiation by the seller in titles to the buyer to remedies. And finally, UCC section two seven 11 one shows that one of such remedies available to the buyer is cancellation of the contract. Among everything we learned today, the key takeaway from this case is that non written demand for assurance can satisfy UCC. Section two six oh nine.
