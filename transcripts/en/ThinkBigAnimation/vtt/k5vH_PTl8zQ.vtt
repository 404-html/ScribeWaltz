00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.960
Have you ever been having a conversation with the group and while maybe you were

2
00:00:10.961 --> 00:00:12.550
interacting and talking to everybody,

3
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.910
you notice you always seem to be directing your attention at one particular

4
00:00:15.911 --> 00:00:18.430
person and checking to see if you're getting a reaction from them.

5
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:19.930
Probably if you look around,

6
00:00:19.931 --> 00:00:22.150
you will notice that everybody is doing the same thing,

7
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.660
directing most of their attention and looking for a reaction out of this one

8
00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:28.570
person.
Have you ever tried to say something to the entire group,

9
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.440
but it seems like nothing you say even gets acknowledged by a single person.

10
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.330
Yet somehow when this person speaks up,

11
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.600
everyone stops and he has captivated their full attention.

12
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.490
Why is that?
This is because he is the anchor of the conversation.

13
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.210
His voice is strong,
charismatic,
and he's completely authentic.

14
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.020
He is viewed as being the one who provides the most value to everyone in the

15
00:00:50.021 --> 00:00:52.840
interaction.
Therefore,
people are looking to him for input.

16
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.130
They hope to get is validation and when he speaks,
everyone listens.

17
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.620
Humans are amazing creatures.
We have the ability to learn amazingly quickly.

18
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.070
And one of the main reasons why is that we are incredibly good at learning

19
00:01:06.071 --> 00:01:09.670
socially.
While it can be useful to learn socially in so many areas,

20
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.820
any idea if it gains enough steam can be accepted socially,

21
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.830
no matter how dumb are hypocritical.

22
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.160
This leads to a generation of men who've been led to believe that to be

23
00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:22.270
attractive and to be someone who adds value to society,
you need looks,
status,

24
00:01:22.271 --> 00:01:26.440
money or power.
Since this is what you need to be attractive and to have value,

25
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.850
you go to work to get the job,
to get the money,
to buy the things,

26
00:01:30.851 --> 00:01:34.930
to look like the people in the magazine and then when you finally have it all,

27
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.090
it didn't work.
So the only conclusion you come to is that you need more,

28
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.650
you need to consume more.

29
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.460
And the cycle continues now because we learn socially.

30
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.340
People are constantly looking towards others to know how to think or act.

31
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.540
We live in an incredibly abstract world and nobody has any more information on

32
00:01:52.541 --> 00:01:55.900
how to navigate it than anybody else.
Despite this fact,

33
00:01:55.901 --> 00:01:59.050
we are always seeking certainty and whoever has the strongest,

34
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.610
most rock solid fixed interpretation of reality will have incredible influence

35
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.280
and will draw people into their world.
As humans,

36
00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:09.250
we are biologically inclined to constantly be seeking out value.

37
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.030
Your brain is constantly zoning in on what has value to you and putting up

38
00:02:13.031 --> 00:02:15.040
blinders to anything that doesn't have value.

39
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.100
This is why when you say something in a way that has little value to the group,

40
00:02:18.101 --> 00:02:21.280
they won't even hear you.
It's not even that they're intentionally ignoring you,

41
00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:23.800
but it literally doesn't even register in their brain.

42
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.220
If you take a second to think about this from an evolutionary perspective,

43
00:02:27.221 --> 00:02:29.890
when we were living in caves and death was around every corner,

44
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.100
what do you think a woman would be more attracted to and who would add more

45
00:02:33.101 --> 00:02:35.560
value?
The guy with the Chisel jaw line,

46
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.140
which obviously has so many uses out in the wild,

47
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.310
or would it be the guy that has a sort of rawness and authenticity to his

48
00:02:42.311 --> 00:02:47.140
personality?
A strong leader who's decisive,
resourceful,
fearless,

49
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.220
and won't back down.

50
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.890
People are naturally attracted to what has value to them.
Value can be anything.

51
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.830
It could be someone who makes you laugh,
someone who gives you good emotions,

52
00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.200
someone who gives you knowledge that could literally be anything.

53
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.760
So think back to that girl you lost or the one you never even got in the first

54
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:06.400
place.
Were you confident that you add value at the time?

55
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.340
If you were confident you add value,
how would you have acted?

56
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.340
You probably would have been conscious and present in the moment.

57
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.180
You wouldn't be filtering yourself and you'd be at ease,
secure with yourself.

58
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.990
If you weren't confident you had value.
You tend to be inside your head.

59
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.600
You micromanage what you say.
You seem contrived,

60
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.410
easily flustered and maybe worst of all you're constantly thinking,

61
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.700
how could I make this moment better?
You can never just be present.

62
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.430
If you weren't confident,
you add value.

63
00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:36.040
You can be pretty sure the girl wasn't competent.
You add value either.

64
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.770
You can rationalize and come up with any excuses you want,

65
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.330
but the only reason the girl would leave is if she saw more value somewhere
else.

66
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.670
Try and be honest with yourself and think,

67
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.210
did your personality really convey that rawness and authenticity?

68
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.580
Now you have a few options from this point.

69
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.430
You can either continue to make excuses for why it happens.

70
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.250
Go into your cave and just play video games for the rest of your life.

71
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.490
You can take a page straight from a Hollywood movie chaser down and profess your

72
00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:05.491
love or you could accept life isn't a movie and you can face reality as it is

73
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.090
that maybe you aren't that high value,
real,
authentic,

74
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.280
fearless guy you thought you were.
Now,

75
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:15.790
you can either be in resistance to that which is wishing that the reality in

76
00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:20.050
front of you with some other way or you can sink into a deep acceptance of it.

77
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.710
It might hurt,
it might be devastating.
It might make you cry,

78
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:27.490
but you need to sit with reality instead of running away from it.
Ultimately,

79
00:04:27.491 --> 00:04:29.560
these hard moments where you sit with the pain,

80
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.960
sit with the truth and don't shy away from it,

81
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.420
are going to be some of the most important moments in your life.

82
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.580
The difficult experiences you go through.

83
00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:40.600
Strip back the layers of your personality and leave only the core essence of who

84
00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:44.950
you are.
If you do this and you decide that you want to be that authentic,

85
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.020
charismatic person who captivates a room,

86
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.110
you can now start looking internally at what you can change.

87
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.660
So what can you do first?
You have to completely let that girl go.

88
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.800
Life is not a movie and you probably won't get her back,
and even if you do,

89
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.960
you probably spent a lot of time just waiting around.

90
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.280
What do you think the universe or God or Karma or whatever you want to call it,

91
00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:10.630
rewards more sitting around and waiting or going out in dictating reality for

92
00:05:10.631 --> 00:05:15.070
yourself.
You have to go out and meet women as much as you can.

93
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.320
If you don't let that girl go and move on,

94
00:05:17.321 --> 00:05:21.100
you will begin to sink into what is called a scarcity mindset in your head.

95
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:24.330
There is no way any of the 7 billion other people on the planet could be a

96
00:05:24.331 --> 00:05:28.390
special as one person.
Do you know how unlikely that is?

97
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.260
Remember how we talked about our brain constantly scanning for value.

98
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.070
When you can't go out and meet a lot of new women and don't have the ability to

99
00:05:36.071 --> 00:05:37.600
be selective about who you date,

100
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.230
you will begin to project traits onto that one girl that don't really exist.

101
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.590
<v 1>If you are coming from a scarcity mindset and this is the only person offering</v>

102
00:05:45.591 --> 00:05:46.424
value to you,

103
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.390
your brain will block out all the negative aspects of their personality and

104
00:05:50.391 --> 00:05:52.340
focus in on only the good traits.

105
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.080
You can see this happening relationships all the time.
When the value is high,

106
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.890
we'll block out all the negative aspects,
how they treat you,

107
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.210
how they treat other people,

108
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.140
but once the value you once for Steve starts to fade,

109
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.200
all of a sudden it's like the blinders get removed and all you can see is the

110
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:12.870
negative.
When you do have new women in your life,

111
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.530
bring her into your reality,
she will be brought into mini mints,

112
00:06:16.531 --> 00:06:20.250
reality and the one that provides the most value and gives her the best emotions

113
00:06:20.251 --> 00:06:21.320
will be the ones she stays it.

114
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.900
It's like David data says in the way of the secure your main,

115
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.460
you have to be a man on your purpose.
The woman cannot be your purpose.

116
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.230
It is like she's at an amusement park.

117
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.960
She has the choice to go on any ride that she wants to.

118
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.250
Once you bring her into your reality and she sees the ride with all the twists

119
00:06:38.251 --> 00:06:42.230
and turns,
she decides to come along for the ride.
But what do you fill?

120
00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:45.960
Many men do the abandoned their purpose.
They say,
no.

121
00:06:45.961 --> 00:06:48.690
I would rather sit here and talk with you.
Forget the ride.

122
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.650
The only reason she got on in the first place was for the thrill,

123
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.780
the unexpectedness and the excitement.

124
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.250
So what does a guy who offers a lot of value and how do you become one.
