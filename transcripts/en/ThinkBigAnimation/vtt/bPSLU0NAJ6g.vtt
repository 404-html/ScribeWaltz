00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.860
I remember when my old football coach used to sit us down after nearly every

2
00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:09.861
practice and every weight lifting session with our lungs gasping for air and our

3
00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:15.270
bodies just pushed past the point of what we thought we could do.
And he'd say,

4
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.690
we live in a microwave society.

5
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.020
When that is obsessed with getting instinct gratification,

6
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.540
it's a natural biological impulse for humans to want to minimize time and
effort.

7
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.150
We all have goals and dreams,
things we plan on accomplishing some day.

8
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.280
What we're really waiting for is a magic pill or someone to come along and do it

9
00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:39.114
for us.

10
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.680
And the media we consume on a daily basis only makes this worse.

11
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.760
We think if we just look like the people in the magazine,

12
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.180
then everyone would finally accept us and we could be happy.

13
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.310
Or we think if we just won the lottery and never had to worry about money again,

14
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.210
then we can start enjoying our life and finally be happy.

15
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.350
But at the same time,

16
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.320
we don't want to put in the effort it would take to actually become the best

17
00:01:05.321 --> 00:01:06.310
version of ourselves.

18
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.260
Why would I take the time and effort to learn about health and nutrition when I

19
00:01:11.261 --> 00:01:14.500
can just eat fast food all day,
then take a fat burner to lose the weight,

20
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.560
wanting to get in shape with almost no effort.
Perfect.

21
00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:21.820
Here's something called six minute abs where you get shredded and hardly have to

22
00:01:21.821 --> 00:01:26.350
put in any work.
There's no such thing as something for nothing.

23
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.800
You can't cheat even if you wish to do so.

24
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.680
If you're like me and like most people,

25
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.800
what are the biggest things holding you back in life is that you're comfortable.

26
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.630
It just becomes so easy to get our basic needs of food,
water,
and shelter.

27
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.690
For us,
gone are the days of hunting,

28
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.550
gathering and getting what you need before you die.
And because of this,

29
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.510
it becomes very easy to fall into the pattern of comfortable mediocrity.

30
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.200
Sometimes it takes hitting rock bottom to actually start making meaningful

31
00:01:56.201 --> 00:01:59.990
change in your life.
To quote Tyler Durden from fight club,

32
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.860
it's only when we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.

33
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.190
<v 1>Okay?</v>

34
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.380
<v 0>Well you don't have to wait till you're sick,
homeless,</v>

35
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:08.790
and depressed to make a change.

36
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.500
You can start by cultivating little habits of giving up instinct gratification

37
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.910
every day.
Start to its structure,
discomfort throughout your day.

38
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.560
Starting tomorrow.

39
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.720
Set your alarm 15 minutes earlier than normal and wake up immediately without

40
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:25.554
hitting snooze.

41
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.310
Your first instinct will always be to stay in bed and the more you give into

42
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.600
that instinct,
the more you damage your ability to use your willpower.

43
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.650
When everything in your body is telling you not to do something you said you

44
00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:42.570
would do.
You have to tell yourself,
fuck how you feel and do it anyway.

45
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.710
This is the same feeling you will get anytime you step out of what is

46
00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:49.110
comfortable for you,
no matter who you are,

47
00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:52.380
you can generate five seconds of willpower and that is all that we'll take.

48
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.860
The hardest part about forcing yourself out of bed in the morning,

49
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.230
it's just the first five seconds and then after that it gets easy.

50
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.380
It's the same with anything that is outside of your routine.

51
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.580
The hardest part about starting to meditate,
go to the gym,

52
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.560
read and eat healthy everyday is just carving out the time to actually do it and

53
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:12.910
committing to do it
day.

54
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.810
Realize that whatever rationalizations and excuses you have for not doing it

55
00:03:17.811 --> 00:03:20.300
today,
we'll be there every single day.

56
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.350
There will never be a perfect moment and you will never feel like it.

57
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.870
Anytime you try and break out of your comfort zone,

58
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.560
your brain will always come up with excuses to not do what you're trying to do.

59
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.160
Your brain doesn't care if you're living a fulfilled life or not.

60
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.140
All it cares about is self preservation and passing along its DNA and because of

61
00:03:39.141 --> 00:03:41.120
this,
your brain will want to keep you where it's safe,

62
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.250
where it's comfortable and where there's no unknown because our brains evolved

63
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.280
to associate the unknown.
Yeah.
With danger.

64
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.990
Finding what scares you most and constantly exposing yourself to it can be one

65
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:54.970
of the most powerful things you do in your life.

66
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.260
Steven Pressfield wrote in his book the war of art,

67
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.440
that the more fear and resistance we have towards something,

68
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.230
the more certain we can be that we have to do it.

69
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.210
Our fear is like a compass that points true north to the one thing we should be

70
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:11.044
doing.

71
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.490
I spent most of my life suffering from pretty severe social anxiety.

72
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.140
I remember if I was eating lunch with a group of my friends and they started

73
00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:22.990
hanging out with a group of other people that I wasn't comfortable with,

74
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.710
I would just go and wait in the bathroom until my next class started.

75
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.230
I was walking around constantly feeling like I was at the top of a roller

76
00:04:31.231 --> 00:04:33.340
coaster just waiting for it to drop.

77
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.260
I thought everyone else experiences the world a certain way and that just wasn't

78
00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:41.830
for me.
I thought this was how I was going to spend the rest of my life,

79
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.640
but it wasn't until I made the decision that it wasn't going to live like this

80
00:04:45.641 --> 00:04:48.290
anymore,
that my life started to change.

81
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.250
I started to get in as many uncomfortable,
weird,

82
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.140
awkward situations as I could until I slowly started to learn to not give a
fuck.

83
00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.190
I found what scared me.
Most of that,
I constantly expose myself to it.

84
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.640
This thing will be different for everybody.

85
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.490
For some people it will be giving a speech.

86
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.870
For others it will be approaching a beautiful girl and others that will be

87
00:05:11.871 --> 00:05:15.170
starting their business idea or putting their art out for the world to see

88
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.940
humans evolve because we had a lot of evolutionary pressure put onto us.

89
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.220
He was get what you need or you're going to die and not pass on your genes.

90
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.610
Now that we've engineered a society where that's not the case,

91
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.640
we have to put that evolutionary pressure on ourselves.

92
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.090
It starts with every decision you make them.
The moment you wake up,

93
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.380
the habits you make,
the food you eat,
how you interact with people,

94
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.380
it's all either feeling an upward or a downward spiral.

95
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.050
So you start with one habit,

96
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.640
like waking up a little bit earlier every morning you feel less rushed,

97
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.310
so you actually start to practice meditation before you go to work.

98
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.860
Because of this,
your mind is more clear.

99
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.310
You're more mindful about the food you eat.
You start to eat clean.

100
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.680
You notice you have more energy throughout the day,

101
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:03.140
so you start to go to the gym every single day.

102
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.560
You're starting to feel healthier,
more energized,

103
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.320
and this makes you more positive with everybody you interact with,

104
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.590
your relationships with your friends and family start to improve.

105
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.940
You're happier and more confident and more willing to put yourself out there.

106
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.660
Maybe you decide to start that business idea you've always thought about doing.

107
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.300
Maybe you decide to ask out.

108
00:06:24.301 --> 00:06:26.490
That cute girl you see every day on your way to work.

109
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.160
Small habits when done everyday can snowball and turn into big changes in your

110
00:06:32.161 --> 00:06:32.994
life.

111
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.010
Don't focus on what you're doing instead focused on why you're doing it,

112
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.660
because the reason will always be more important than the temporary discomfort.
