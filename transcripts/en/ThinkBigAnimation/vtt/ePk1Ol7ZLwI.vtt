1
00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:02.163
Hmm.

2
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.530
When we talk about meaning in life,
it is a metaphor.

3
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.250
It means that our actions are oriented towards some greater purpose,

4
00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:23.120
like the words in a sentence,
our range to point to some higher understanding.

5
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.770
We are meaning making creatures and we make sense of the world around us by

6
00:00:27.771 --> 00:00:32.570
assigning it meaning how one finds meaning in life is often dependent on the

7
00:00:32.571 --> 00:00:34.370
prevalent worldview in which they live.

8
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.240
Most of the dominant world views which have shaped our modern world had their

9
00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:43.241
origin between the period of 800 to 300 BC known as the axial revolution.

10
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.540
It is called the axial age because it came with a radical turning point in how

11
00:00:47.541 --> 00:00:49.670
humanity viewed its role in the cosmos.

12
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.440
Taking place in four main locations is real.
Greece,
India,

13
00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:58.490
and China.
From 1200 to 1150 BC,

14
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.540
they experience the greatest collapse of civilization the world has ever seen,

15
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.250
much greater than the fall of Rome.
Within 50 years,
more cities,

16
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.870
political organizations and ways of life go out of existence than any time in

17
00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:14.540
world history.
The Hittite,
Egyptian,

18
00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:19.541
Canaan and Mycenaean Greek civilizations all face widespread destruction from

19
00:01:19.941 --> 00:01:23.570
roughly 1150 to 800 the world enters a dark age,

20
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.250
huge amounts of literacy or lost trade breaks down and there is enormous

21
00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:32.090
economic decline.
This collapses due to mini converging factors,

22
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.800
but the result was clear,

23
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.070
a violent sudden and culturally disruptive transition which shook the

24
00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:42.350
preexisting worldview to its very core,

25
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.550
a worldview we are going to refer to as the continuous cosmos.

26
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.930
It was based on a belief that any difference between the natural human and

27
00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:53.840
sacred worlds is only a difference in degree.

28
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.130
The gods acting in very human ways,
but simply possessed more power.

29
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.270
The chaos and violence you see in the world.
It's just a part of that world.

30
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.120
There is no difference between the violence of nature,

31
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.800
the violence of humans and the violence of the gods.
Secondly,

32
00:02:09.801 --> 00:02:13.400
there was a belief that everything was cyclical like the days in the seasons.

33
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.600
You did not want to alter the world too drastically because it would inevitably

34
00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:18.770
come back to affect you.

35
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.790
Wisdom in this old worldview meant the knowledge that was needed to gain the

36
00:02:22.791 --> 00:02:24.440
most power and prosperity.

37
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.310
It was important to become as embedded in the world as you possibly can.

38
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.780
This was a powerful way to orient yourself and it built in sustained many of the

39
00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:37.700
great civilizations of the past.
What happened is these old kingdoms passed away,

40
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.860
small states begin to emerge.

41
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.790
There is more experimentation with social and cultural organization.

42
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.660
New Cycle technologies are invented which have an enormous impact on our

43
00:02:47.661 --> 00:02:48.494
cognition.

44
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.910
If a physical technology is designed to fit the way the human body operates to

45
00:02:52.911 --> 00:02:57.440
expand our physical capabilities,
a psycho technology is designed to fit in,

46
00:02:57.441 --> 00:02:59.830
enhance the capabilities of the mind.

47
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.270
The greatest of these psycho technologies was the emergence of alphabetic

48
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:05.104
literacy.

49
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.460
Old Forms of literacy were very difficult to learn often with thousands of

50
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:11.800
symbols standing for complex ideas.

51
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.970
It is likely that less than one percentage of the population was literate as it

52
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:19.900
was confined to a very small ruling elite with symbols.

53
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:21.550
Now standing for basic phonemes,

54
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.630
alphabetic literacy becomes much more accessible and it was during this period

55
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:28.990
that literacy was spread to a much greater percentage of the population.

56
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.270
As a technology literacy was able to stretch our cognition across much greater

57
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:37.390
spans of time.
Suddenly I could take my thoughts now,

58
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.650
my thoughts from a week in a month ago and apply them all to the same problem.

59
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.600
This allowed for the emergence of second order thinking that is a knowledge and

60
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.400
awareness of our own cognition.

61
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.640
As we began to empower and enrich the mind,

62
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.270
suddenly we become much more self critical and self aware.

63
00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.370
This rise in our capabilities for self examination came hand in hand with the

64
00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:02.680
rise in our ability for self deception.

65
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.300
Our mind and our perception acts as a lens through which we see the world.

66
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.920
An increased ability for self critical cognition comes with an increased ability

67
00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:16.090
to distort reality.
The mind can twist itself out of alignment.

68
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.270
Misinterpreting in misperceiving the world around us,

69
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.860
I wear glasses which allow me to see the world much more clearly.

70
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.920
If the lens gets smudged,
it can distort my vision.

71
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.960
So what can I do when this happens?

72
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.870
I can take a step back and look at the glasses.

73
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.520
I can examine the medium of site itself.
I can determine what patterns are.

74
00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:40.060
Properties are distorting my perception in order to fix them.

75
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.500
With the emergence of second order thinking and the ability to reflect on our

76
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:45.340
own cognition,

77
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.660
we can fix and transform the mind to see the world more clearly.

78
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.560
With this mode of thinking and new dominant worldview emerges,

79
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.540
we moved from a view of reality as a continuous cosmos which is cyclical and

80
00:04:58.541 --> 00:05:02.770
only varies in degree to two completely separate worlds.

81
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.560
There is an everyday world be sent by self deception,
violence and suffering.

82
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.360
A world in which we constantly acting it's star,

83
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.730
individual and collective self interest.
A world filled with frustration,

84
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:20.080
futility and despair and there was a real world,

85
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.700
a world free from self deception free from the suffering and violence that we

86
00:05:24.701 --> 00:05:29.440
cause a world in which we do not act in a self destructive manner and we can

87
00:05:29.441 --> 00:05:32.380
flourish into fully realized human beings.

88
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.670
With this transition and worldview comes a change in the way we think of wisdom.

89
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.940
It is no longer to gain power and prestige in this world.

90
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.100
Wisdom is now seen as the ability to transcend this illusory world and awakened

91
00:05:45.101 --> 00:05:46.570
to the world that is real.

92
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.130
We capture this idea in the metaphors that we use for transcendence,

93
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.600
metaphors of enlightenment,
waking up,
growing up,
being born again,

94
00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.630
being woke a f is the kids are calling it now are all pointing towards moving

95
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:03.950
from this world of illusion to the world of reality.

96
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.810
The prevalence of this idea of waking up in pop culture points to how much this

97
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:11.270
world view still affects us to this day.

98
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.150
Remember that in this old view of reality,

99
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:18.140
you did not want to affect the world too drastically or would inevitably come

100
00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:21.560
back around to affect you.
With this one shift in thinking,

101
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:25.880
we suddenly awakened to the fact that the future is wide open and that our

102
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:27.470
actions and moral choices,

103
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:31.010
heavy direct influence on how the cosmos unfolds.

104
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.510
What connects you right now to the seven year old version of yourself?

105
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.710
Every cell has died and been replaced so your body is not the same,

106
00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.450
but we tell a story that runs like a thread into our past and connects us to who

107
00:06:48.451 --> 00:06:52.410
we are now.
Narrative,
the idea of the beginning,

108
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.640
a middle and an end where some central problem is presented and then solve

109
00:06:56.641 --> 00:07:00.030
through the actions of the protagonist is deeply rooted in who we are.

110
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:05.190
We simplify narrative down to it's most easily graspable for so we can practice

111
00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:09.090
it over and over again.
We ask each other,
how was your day?

112
00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.630
Tell me about yourself.
We want to hear each other's stories.

113
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.070
We Orient Ourselves in the world by understanding where we fit within the larger

114
00:07:17.071 --> 00:07:21.630
narratives and Meta narratives that we hear and tell each other these stories

115
00:07:21.631 --> 00:07:26.160
constitute what is real and significant.
In the pre axial age,

116
00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.570
their sense of time was fragmented.
There were stories here and there,

117
00:07:30.571 --> 00:07:34.800
but no overarching story for why time is unfolding in the way it is.

118
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.180
The idea of time and folding in a narrative fashion has its origin.

119
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:44.420
Once again in the axial revolution and perhaps the most unlikely of places.

120
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.630
There is a beginning in which humanity is cast out from paradise,

121
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.350
from this real world,
free from suffering and self deception.

122
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:59.360
Then a story unfolds of how this conflict is resolved and how humanity can

123
00:07:59.361 --> 00:08:02.900
reclaim is standing and returned to the paradise that was lost.

124
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.270
Unlike many gods of the past,

125
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.600
the god of the Hebrews is not tied to any specific location,

126
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.630
but instead he seems to be a god of history.

127
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:17.050
He moves through time and space to deliver the Israelites from slavery in Egypt

128
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.520
into a promised land of milk and honey.

129
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.980
The fact that Egypt was chosen is deeply symbolic as it represents the epitome

130
00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:26.360
of the pre axial world.

131
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.020
Instead of a belief in a cyclical cosmos,

132
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.670
the belief emerges that the future can be radically different from the past and

133
00:08:34.671 --> 00:08:37.460
that our choices can bring about a better future.

134
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.870
Suddenly our human actions take on a cosmic significance.

135
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.180
Through our own moral action.

136
00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.690
We can steer the universe towards a better or worse ending.

137
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:52.820
We can move from this land of self deception and self-destruction into a world

138
00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:56.690
free from the pain and suffering that we on ourselves and each other.

139
00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.970
Their faith and bringing this better world to fruition was not faith as it is

140
00:09:01.971 --> 00:09:05.810
thought of now that is believing something without evidence.

141
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.980
Instead it was a sense of timing in how things were turning.

142
00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.480
It was paying attention to the course of history in observing how history was

143
00:09:14.481 --> 00:09:15.470
repeating itself.

144
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:16.830
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

145
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.030
<v 0>To live in the right way,</v>

146
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.900
the way in which we are the least susceptible to self deceptive in self

147
00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:25.110
destructive behavior.
It means developing a sensitivity,

148
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.630
an understanding of these pivotal moments,

149
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.680
these turning points in history in which things can radically change for better

150
00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:32.514
or worse.

151
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:33.640
<v 2>Okay.</v>

152
00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.160
<v 0>This idea took hold in the world of ancient Greece,</v>

153
00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:40.420
although in a very different form and together these ideas merged and formed the

154
00:09:40.421 --> 00:09:43.990
pillars of Western thought for thousands of years after.

155
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.380
Thank you guys for watching.

156
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.070
I hope you stick around for future videos because I love making them and I love

157
00:09:52.071 --> 00:09:53.330
sharing these ideas.

158
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:57.530
A lot of work and research goes into each video and if you liked the channel and

159
00:09:57.531 --> 00:09:59.840
want to support us,
there are a few ways you can do that.

160
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.470
If you want a free audio book from audible,
we get a commission for each sign up.

161
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.990
If you are already planning on buying something from Amazon,

162
00:10:05.991 --> 00:10:08.030
using our banner does help us out a lot.

163
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.810
Or we just launched our patrion page where you can get all kinds of rewards for

164
00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:14.150
supporting us directly.
Either way,

165
00:10:14.151 --> 00:10:17.540
I truly appreciate the support and I will see you guys next time.
