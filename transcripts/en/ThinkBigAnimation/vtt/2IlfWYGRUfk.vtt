1
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.051
In India.

2
00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:13.500
It is believed that if somebody can become an emperor of the whole world,

3
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.570
there are called a Chakra Varta.

4
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.460
The word Chakra means wheel to avoid unnecessary fighting.

5
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.450
The emperor would wheel his golden chariot from one kingdom to the next.

6
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.700
If the Cherry was left unobstructed them into kingdom excepted the owner of it

7
00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:32.340
as their superior and there was no need to fight.

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.460
Wherever people obstructed the chariot,
there would be war.

9
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.890
If the chariot was not obstructed anywhere,

10
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.640
then the superiority of the king was proved and without any war,

11
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.380
the king became a chakravarty.

12
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.420
This has been the desire of all kings.
It was such a rare feat,

13
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.330
only happening once every thousand years.

14
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.220
Even Alexander the Great was not a world conqueror because it chocolate Vartan

15
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.520
is such a rare being.
He's received in heaven with much rejoicing.

16
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.460
He's given the honor of being led to Someera,

17
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.420
the largest mountain in the universe to engrave his name on it.

18
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.830
His whole family even committed suicide so they could see such a rare thing,

19
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.860
a world conqueror,
engraving his name on this mountain.

20
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.390
The gatekeeper welcomed him.
When he arrives.
He says,

21
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.510
I have brought my family to watch me engrave my name on the mountain.

22
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.030
The gatekeeper pulls him aside.
Do not bring them with you.
You will regret it.

23
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.250
The emperor didn't understand what was the point of engraving his name,

24
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:36.000
if no one would see it.
If you wish,
golden,

25
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:39.000
engrave your name first and then bring your family into to see it.

26
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.470
The emperor agrees he's taken to the mountain and shocked to find that on this

27
00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:49.650
mountain that would dwarf the Himalayas.
There was no space to write his name.

28
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.680
The entire mountain was covered in names.

29
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.340
He could not believe his eyes and for the first time he realized what he was.

30
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.410
Up until now,
he thought he was a superman.

31
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.770
A rare being that only comes once in a thousand years,

32
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.770
but a thousand years means nothing to the full of attorney.

33
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.960
Countless numbers of world conquerors had come before him and countless would

34
00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:17.700
come after him.
The gatekeeper tells him,
if you wish it's to write his name.

35
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.890
He can erase a few names and write his own.

36
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.350
The emperor did not want to write his name.
What was the point?

37
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.660
One day someone would come in a race it,
his whole life had become meaningless.

38
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.870
This with his only hope that Someera would have his name engraved on it for this

39
00:02:36.871 --> 00:02:41.610
you lived stick his whole life and was ready to kill the entire world to gain

40
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.280
all to one day have his name a race.
I will not write my name.
He said,

41
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.160
in this whole world,
what can you gain?
What can you take away with you?

42
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.080
Your name,
your prestige,
you're respectability,
your money,
your power,

43
00:02:58.081 --> 00:03:02.340
your scholarship,
what you cannot take anything.

44
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.420
Everything will have to be dropped here and in that moment you will realize that

45
00:03:06.421 --> 00:03:08.580
everything you possessed was not yours.

46
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.520
You've spent your life working to gain possessions,

47
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.760
working to gain the respect and acceptance of people who mean nothing to you.

48
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.040
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

49
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.340
<v 1>thinking about how many times you didn't pursue a calling,
didn't speak up,</v>

50
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.190
hid your true self for fear of what others would think.

51
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.020
So many people have lived and died on this planet and it may no difference how

52
00:03:28.021 --> 00:03:31.480
they were perceived by others.
Even if you were such a rare being,

53
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:35.170
the only came once every thousand years,
it's still made no difference.

54
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.430
Your only concern should be to protect those qualities you can take with you.

55
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.590
When death destroys your body,
call it whatever you want.
Your integrity,

56
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.700
authenticity,
innocence,
these will be your soul companions.

57
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.920
These are the only values that matter.

58
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.710
The people that possess them or the only ones that live

59
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.310
to a child.
They are always called to the new,
to the unfamiliar.

60
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.840
If you listen to your innermost being,
it will always be drawn to the new.

61
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.740
The being is an adventurer and the heart is a Gambler,

62
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.750
but when a child is born,

63
00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:15.690
society grabs it and starts molding it into something useful.

64
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.170
They kill the child soul and gave him a false identity.

65
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.420
So the true self is not missed,

66
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.460
but this false personality is only useful in the crowd that has given it to him.

67
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.090
As soon as you are alone,
the false begins to fall apart.

68
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.790
This is why there was such a fear of being alone.

69
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.320
Meditation is nothing but a courage to be silent and alone.

70
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.960
As you start moving away from the false and intent,
the real,
this creates a gap,

71
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.480
a purgatory.
You are no longer the false identity,
but you are not yet the real,

72
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.270
this gap creates a sort of dark night of the soul.

73
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.060
You are in limbo and you do not know who you are,

74
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.760
but to be the real you against the values of society is true courage.

75
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.850
It does not matter that the whole world is against you.

76
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.250
What matters is that your experience is valid and the moment you are truly

77
00:05:08.251 --> 00:05:10.630
unafraid of the crowd,
you become alliance.
