00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.690
Back in 1965 the computer at Mit,

2
00:00:10.691 --> 00:00:14.170
Cambridge cost $11 million and took up half a room.

3
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.980
This was the same year.
Moore's law as publishing,

4
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.760
claiming the computer power was doubling every 24 months.
40 years later,

5
00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:24.520
the computer in your smartphone is a million times smaller,

6
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.480
a million times less expensive in a thousand times more powerful.

7
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.950
That is a billion fold increase in price performance and that trend is not

8
00:00:32.951 --> 00:00:34.570
slowing down.
In fact,

9
00:00:34.571 --> 00:00:38.080
it's speeding up with the next billion fold increase expected to happen within

10
00:00:38.081 --> 00:00:40.030
25 years.
Well,

11
00:00:40.031 --> 00:00:43.660
Kurzweil is thing is that our own biology is subject to the same effects of

12
00:00:43.661 --> 00:00:48.400
Moore's law.
How much do you think you age today?

13
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.090
Everyone grows older but we don't all age the same.

14
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.140
This is why a person can look old in their thirties and young in their sixties

15
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.260
if you drink lots of water,
exercise,

16
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.430
got eight hours of sleep and had engaging in conversations with friends and

17
00:01:03.431 --> 00:01:07.990
family,
you probably aged very little.
On the other hand,

18
00:01:07.991 --> 00:01:12.250
if you sat on the couch,
eat donuts,
smoked and got in it,
stressful arguments,

19
00:01:12.251 --> 00:01:15.850
you probably aged a lot.
When it comes to living longer,

20
00:01:15.851 --> 00:01:18.550
lifestyle choices make all the difference in the world.

21
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.600
How long do you actually want to live?

22
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.290
Most people would say living longer is always going to be a good thing,

23
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.270
and according to Ray Kurzweil,

24
00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:31.060
this is a question we're going to have to ask ourselves very soon.

25
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.580
He has to meets the,
if you follow his advice,

26
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.580
most people will be able to add an additional 20 years to their life,

27
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.860
but that's not it.
He says,

28
00:01:38.861 --> 00:01:42.510
this extra two decades we'll allow you to live to see a new technology literally

29
00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:44.400
allowing you to change your genes,

30
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.100
turning off bad ones and activating beneficial ones.

31
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.470
And this will add an additional two decades to most people's life,
which he says,

32
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:54.960
we'll give you enough time to have microscopic devices,

33
00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:58.140
the size of blood cells traveling through your bloodstream and keeping you

34
00:01:58.141 --> 00:01:59.700
healthy at a cellular level.

35
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.620
It won't be long before the sands of time run inwards rather than outwards.

36
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.070
Our genes are essentially little software programs and the evolved under

37
00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:11.190
circumstances very different from today.
For instance,

38
00:02:11.191 --> 00:02:15.060
something like the fat insulin receptor,
which says,
hold on there every calorie,

39
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:17.220
because who knows where the next meal is.
Coming from?

40
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.050
Something like that was very relevant from the hunter gatherer days today.

41
00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:25.440
This combined with our natural inclination for cravings and overeating is what

42
00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:29.190
causes an epidemic of weight problems with two and three adults being overweight

43
00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:30.540
and one in three obese.

44
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.650
What if we could turn this gene off and turn on helpful genes?

45
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.060
We possess a genetic program that wants us to die young,

46
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.780
but what if we could eliminate things like allergies,
cancer cells,

47
00:02:43.781 --> 00:02:44.680
and heart disease?

48
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.760
People literally won't be dying from disease and they won't be dying from old

49
00:02:48.761 --> 00:02:52.390
age.
With all these things becoming incredibly possible.

50
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:53.770
The question becomes,

51
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.030
is this even ethical to do with so many problems like deforestation,
hunger,

52
00:02:58.031 --> 00:02:59.950
and pollution caused overpopulation?

53
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.620
What will the effects of people literally not dying be?

54
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.150
If you're like Ray Kurzweil,
you probably believe the answer is more technology.

55
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.150
He believes no matter what difficulties we faced,

56
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.190
there exists an idea that can overcome it.

57
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.460
It is a question we will have to deal with very soon.
