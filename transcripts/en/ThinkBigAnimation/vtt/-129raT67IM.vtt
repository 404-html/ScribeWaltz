1
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.150
Oh,
I had a sister.

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.000
There was a very decent wardrobe that was getting very respectable,

3
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.650
close to being complete shit,
man.
Now it's all gone.

4
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.600
All gone.
All gone

5
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.940
in order today is,

6
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.350
it's a blank,
just blank.

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.660
White guys like you and I know what to phase this essential to our survival in

8
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:32.400
the hunter gatherer sense of the word.
No.
What are we doing?

9
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.390
Consumers,
your consumers.
We are byproducts,

10
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.460
lifestyle obsession,
burger crime,
poverty.
He sinks.

11
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:48.990
Don't concern me.
What concerns me?
A celebrity,
magazines,

12
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.950
television with 500 channels.
Some guy's name on my underwear.

13
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.140
Rogaine game by Agra,
less strength.
Martha Stewart.
Fuck Martha Stewart,

14
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.280
Arthur's policy and Nebraska on the titanic.
It's all going down,
man.

15
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.660
The fuck off with your sofa units and string green stripe pattern.

16
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.190
I say never be complete.
I say stopping.
Perfect.

17
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.923
I say,
look,

18
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.260
let's evolve with the chips fall where they may things you own end up owning.

19
00:01:18.521 --> 00:01:23.070
You
do it.
You're like,
man.

20
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.040
<v 2>So whenever things were going a little too well,</v>

21
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.820
like on one hand and motivated me to seek success because you can't go out and

22
00:01:39.821 --> 00:01:43.370
glory without success.
Everything was going well and then a system,

23
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.100
it's going to little too well let's keep pushing it pumps and it's basic gets

24
00:01:48.101 --> 00:01:51.370
bigger and bigger and bigger until you're forced to kind of confronted.

25
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.250
So right now,
whatever like a recurring theme,

26
00:01:54.251 --> 00:01:55.840
like another one's like losing weight,

27
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.100
like another part of that self concept was the bad guy,
but also the um,

28
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.450
kind of like dramatic,
like destructive artists.

29
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.160
So a win against me for example,
losing weight,
getting in shape consciously,

30
00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:11.050
I wanted to classes,
I'm like,
fuck yeah,
let's get ripped.

31
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.150
Get subconsciously you was different and your subconscious has been building for

32
00:02:16.151 --> 00:02:19.840
so long,
it'll be stronger than any fucking conscious thought you have.

33
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.640
It's crazy.
It's like consciously think about this consciously,

34
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.650
we would never do anything that is self destructive.

35
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.500
Why the fuck would you cautiously choose to do anything that's self destructive?

36
00:02:35.501 --> 00:02:40.270
You wouldn't,
it's awesome conscious.
You know,
we think like,

37
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.440
how did I end up here?

38
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.900
You got exactly what the fuck you want it subconsciously conscious.

39
00:02:46.901 --> 00:02:49.090
He may think I want a healthy relationships subconsciously.

40
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.740
Same maybe as a kid you associated like,
you know,
love with abandonment.

41
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.780
What's going to happen.
I want her to stay 90%.

42
00:02:58.781 --> 00:03:00.790
Your abandonment equals love.

43
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.170
Going through that kind of made me realize this brought my attention to it and

44
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:08.080
literally since then I've just been focusing on like what's buried down there.

45
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.590
Like actually sitting down and just jumping deep into my fucking subconscious

46
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.890
and bringing that shit up,
processing it.
And uh,

47
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.500
since then it's like gone extreme.

48
00:03:16.501 --> 00:03:20.140
You fucking in shape and it's like you finally get that lasting shit that you're

49
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:22.630
after a good way to,

50
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:26.350
to kind of reconcile self acceptance and self actualization.

51
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.330
It's by knowing deep down inside the,
we're already up here.

52
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.440
The journey is getting rid of everything that's in a way from you realizing

53
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:38.920
you're up here right now,
what do you feel?
Is there like a knot in your stomach?

54
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:43.660
Like what the fuck's going on?
Tuning into that?
Not Judging it.

55
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.030
Okay.
We're,
if you're going into your subconscious,
like for example,

56
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.860
replaying a certain experience that was like traumatic and usually like,
again,

57
00:03:50.861 --> 00:03:55.180
you'll fucking cry.
You'll,
you'll feel like horrible.
Like it's replaying that.

58
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.880
Um,
and then really focusing on that feeling.

59
00:03:57.881 --> 00:03:59.530
Like if there's something buried in there,

60
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:03.940
it's like replay that scenario and let yourself experience that scenario fucking

61
00:04:03.941 --> 00:04:05.620
fully.
It's like you're there.

62
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:08.530
It's like you're going through that shit and it's really painful.

63
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:11.350
It's not necessarily a fun process by the way.

64
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.770
You'll go through it and then it's about not judging it,
not labeling it,

65
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:17.770
not viewing it as bad.
And the only way to do that is to turn off your mind,

66
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.350
like to quiet your mind,
opening up to it,

67
00:04:19.351 --> 00:04:21.820
not resisting it because that's what we're taught as well.
Like anything painful,

68
00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:22.654
it's like resistant.

69
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.530
But here it's like opening up to the pain or softening to the pain,

70
00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:27.340
let's just say.

71
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.580
And then just kind of letting it run its course and you'll realize like just by

72
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:33.760
kind of breathing and letting yourself experience it,
you can visualize it.

73
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:38.530
Come up,
come out,
uh,
you'll let go of it.
You're like,
okay,

74
00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:40.500
what the fuck am I feeling?
You know,

75
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.600
when was maybe the last time I felt like this one is the first time I felt like

76
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:44.434
this.

77
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.470
And that's an interesting thing too with your subconscious is the more awareness

78
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:48.304
you bring to it.

79
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.510
At first you'll just have like little bursts of what was stuck there.
And uh,

80
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.650
it's like overtime that you slowly kind of allow yourself to let more out

81
00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.290
the way they're,

82
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:02.320
the way you grow is by realizing you're already there and getting rid of

83
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:05.410
everything,
telling you you're not there.
That's the journey.

84
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.090
If you get that and you let go of trying to feel happy

85
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.290
because you don't want to feel happy,
you want to be happy,

86
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.810
not the emotion but the state.
Fuck the emotion.

87
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.960
You do not want that emotion because as I said,

88
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.490
that emotion is out to your happiness.

89
00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:25.510
That emotion is dependent on something and it's linked to feeling happy,

90
00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:26.344
feeling not happy.

91
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.740
What makes you feel happy eventually will turn into unhappiness.

92
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.410
You don't want to feel happy.

93
00:05:32.411 --> 00:05:35.080
You want to let go of Shit that makes you feel happy cause that's the shit

94
00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:39.070
you're attached to you.
You want to let go of anything you want.

95
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.690
You want to let go of anything you don't want.

96
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.720
Let go of all the emotions that go of all the thoughts reached the state,

97
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.140
and again,
you can't put the state in towards,

98
00:05:47.141 --> 00:05:49.840
but that's what we're looking for because you've all had the emotional feeling

99
00:05:49.841 --> 00:05:54.130
happy.
It's clearly is not what you're after.
So it's like,

100
00:05:54.131 --> 00:05:58.040
just keep your awareness there.
Keep it like don't give up,
and then you'll get

101
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.880
<v 1>a little piece of the puzzle.</v>
