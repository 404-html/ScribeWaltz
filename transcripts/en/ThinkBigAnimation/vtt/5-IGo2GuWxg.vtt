1
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.480
Are we all here?
Why are you sitting in this chair?
What do you want out of life?

2
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.050
What do you think it is?
I know you see the answer,
but why are you here,
okay.

3
00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:22.400
If you follow the trail of wise,
it's always happiness.

4
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.980
This is something you should all do.
Like sit down and be like,

5
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.060
why do I want this?
Why do I want the girlfriend?
Why do I want the money?

6
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.690
Why do I want success?
Why do I want to hustle?

7
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.940
Why do I want to have a purpose?
Why do I want friends?
It's always to be happy.

8
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.360
I want the fucking beautiful girlfriend so all my friends can see me with the

9
00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:45.500
beautiful girlfriend and uh,

10
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.290
they'll finally approve of me in this means I can finally approve of myself.

11
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.040
You know,
if you go inside your body and you're like,
well,
how do I feel?

12
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.800
And not just from your subjective perspective,

13
00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:57.950
let's just say someone else other than you is transported in your body.

14
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.740
Would they have an enjoyable experience right now where they feel good?

15
00:01:00.741 --> 00:01:04.480
Would it be a pleasant experience?
Probably not.

16
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.850
Like it can guarantee you're not all 10 out of 10 back in the day I was probably

17
00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:10.310
a good three out of 10,
24,
seven like that was my default.

18
00:01:10.311 --> 00:01:15.170
Three out of 10 all the time.
Uh,
just always anxious,
introverted.

19
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.000
Okay,
this is why we're all here.
Okay?
Now by happiness,

20
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:21.230
and this is important to understand.

21
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.400
I'm not talking about the emotion of feeling happy because if you think about

22
00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:26.780
feeling happy,
what does it really,

23
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.840
it's this temporary escape for relief from pain.
That's it.
You know,
um,

24
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.110
will be somehow bought into the fact that we think our default is unhappiness

25
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.520
here.
What do we assume?
I'm unhappy unless,

26
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.640
and then we try to find ways to feel happy and it's usually this escape from our

27
00:01:46.641 --> 00:01:51.350
default that is unhappiness or so we think and we call that happiness every time

28
00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:55.150
we succeed.
In escaping we call the hobbies most common answer.

29
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.880
Like what makes you happy?
Going to a movie,
watching a cool TV show,
uh,

30
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.100
eating food,
um,
sex,
masturbation,
drugs,
drinks,

31
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.550
smoking.
It's an escape.
You know,
like that's when I'm happy,

32
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.280
but it's not true happiness.
Why?

33
00:02:10.281 --> 00:02:13.730
Because it's temporary and you don't fix the cause.

34
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.670
The underlying problem is still there.

35
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.580
The fact that you assumed that unhappiness as your default.
Okay.

36
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.180
And these are some obvious ones like smoking,
drugs on and so forth.

37
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.510
But it could also be simple things like drinking Kombucha or drinking a green

38
00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:33.440
juice.
I feel happy when I drink this really healthy juice.
That's cool.

39
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.860
But what happens when it ends?
When happiness depends on something,

40
00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:37.694
it's always temporary.

41
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.370
It's literally like we're putting our fucking hand like in the flames,

42
00:02:40.371 --> 00:02:42.860
like in the fire who were like,
let's put a little water.

43
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.000
I'm happy until you're back in the fucking flames.
It's crazy.
It's,

44
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.290
that's what we call happiness.
And as I really happiness,
he's getting,
you know,

45
00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:55.460
deep down inside that the underlying problem still there and you know,

46
00:02:55.461 --> 00:02:57.500
it's temporary.
So it's that worry.
How long is it going to last?

47
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.160
The fact you need to do something to be happy is reinforcing the assumption that

48
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.620
you're not enough to be happy right now.
You don't deserve it.

49
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.910
It's not your default.
And as long as it's not your defaults,
you are fucked.

50
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.410
No matter what you do,
you are fucked.
You can get a bigger purpose.

51
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.560
You can get more things.
You can get more girls who can get more validation.

52
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.820
You are fucked.
So it's getting back to that assumption.

53
00:03:22.821 --> 00:03:25.160
Getting back to that false assumption that's wrong.

54
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.890
Where your default is unhappiness.
Why not assume the opposite?

55
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.350
Who says your default is unhappiness?

56
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.410
Why isn't your default happiness?
Okay?
And uh,

57
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.940
this year,
funny enough is why we're seeking this state.

58
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.410
It's because it is our default because they're fucking basic nature.

59
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.470
We're all born,
whole,
born happy.

60
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.770
And somewhere along the way we assume the opposite.

61
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.240
And we live our lives based on this false assumption.
And until we reexamine it,

62
00:03:56.241 --> 00:03:58.760
until we step out of this paradigm,
we are fucked.

63
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.300
We know that we're not going to find happiness based on all of those things.

64
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.930
Like right now,
if I gave you literally everything in the world,

65
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.350
like let's say you had everything of the world,
you are the god of the world,

66
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.040
would you be happy
if the answer is no,

67
00:04:13.041 --> 00:04:16.310
why do you keep fucking seeking hit and all these things and all these

68
00:04:16.311 --> 00:04:19.430
validation and all these people and all these objects and all these green juices

69
00:04:19.431 --> 00:04:22.490
and drinks and all this knowledge and all these relationships.

70
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.240
If you literally had everything in the world,
you'd sell it.
I'd be happy.

71
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.000
It's pretty crazy because again,
it's still within that paradigm.

72
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.930
What you're seeking is in another paradigm,
a good quote to kind of a hammer.

73
00:04:38.931 --> 00:04:43.931
This home is we're trying to seek the infinite with the finite.

74
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.380
We're in this world of like limited things and we're seeking the unlimited.

75
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.690
It doesn't matter how much limited things you get,

76
00:04:50.691 --> 00:04:54.290
you're never going to get the unlimited,
you know,

77
00:04:54.291 --> 00:04:58.400
and until we find this too,
as I said,
everything will be compulsive.

78
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.550
You can't find something out there that is in here.

79
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.800
It's like if you're trying to seek what you already have,

80
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.640
you're never going to fucking find it.
You know,
it's like our default is happy.

81
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.550
We tell ourselves we're not happy and we tried to seek it out there.
And,
uh,

82
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.380
this year doesn't affect the fact that you can go out and get all these cool

83
00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:19.640
things.
Like it doesn't affect,
for example,
passion,
purpose,
success,
et cetera.

84
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.240
Like that whole list I said before,
being grateful,
being giving,
uh,
you know,

85
00:05:23.241 --> 00:05:26.000
being successful,
making money,
getting girls,
getting in relationship,

86
00:05:26.001 --> 00:05:29.510
having your fucking grandkids,
totally fine to go do that,

87
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.680
but it shouldn't be coming from that compulsive place.
It's not about the thing,

88
00:05:33.681 --> 00:05:37.670
it's about the place it's coming from or you doing it to see completion.

89
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.810
Are you doing it to be happy?

90
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.330
Are you doing it to fill that void or you it to escape yourself?

91
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.900
Or are you doing it coming from a place of abundance where it's no longer

92
00:05:44.901 --> 00:05:48.980
compulsive?
That's the key.
It's not the thing.

93
00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:52.310
It's the place it's coming from.
You can be as successful as you want,

94
00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:55.460
but it's not compulsive and it's different motives behind it.
