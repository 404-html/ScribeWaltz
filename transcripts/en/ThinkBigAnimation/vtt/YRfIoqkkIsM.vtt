00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.240
My favorite artists,

2
00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:07.590
performers or comedians always tend to be the ones who tipped till the lines of

3
00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:10.020
what we deem acceptable forms of self expression.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.140
These are people that challenged the status quo.

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.130
People willing to put themselves on the line,
willing to explore offensive,

6
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.700
introspective,
or just plain messy or dirty topics.

7
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.860
They had the ability to express where we all feel but can't explain.

8
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.970
One of my all time favorite comedians was bill Hicks.

9
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.970
<v 2>Why that our institutions are failing us.
Uh,
the church,
the state,</v>

10
00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:37.780
everything's failing is because,
um,
there are no longer relevant.

11
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.560
<v 0>Anyone here advertising,
marketing,
fill your shot.</v>

12
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.520
It's going to be a joke coming.
There's no fucking joke.
Comment.

13
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.980
You are Satan's spawn filling the world with filing garbage your pocket.

14
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.750
You are fucking eyes kill your shelf.

15
00:00:56.751 --> 00:00:58.810
It's the only way to save your fucking soul.

16
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.080
I want my till they're listening to people who's fucking around.

17
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.950
I don't care if they died in their own

18
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.690
with putting a goddamn dollar shine on every fucking thing on this planet.

19
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.480
<v 2>And tomorrow ladies and gentleman,</v>

20
00:01:16.481 --> 00:01:18.780
there's selling your fucking life out for money.
You.

21
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.650
Don't you ever fucking forget it either.
There's Dick Jokes coming up.

22
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.513
Please.
Your relax.

23
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.920
<v 0>That's going to happen to the arms industry.
When we realize we're all aligned.</v>

24
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.010
It's going to fuck up the economy.

25
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.721
<v 2>Today.</v>

26
00:01:43.721 --> 00:01:48.400
Young man on acid realize at all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow

27
00:01:48.401 --> 00:01:53.110
vibration that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself.

28
00:01:53.111 --> 00:01:56.440
Subjectively.
There's no such thing as death.

29
00:01:56.441 --> 00:02:00.370
Life is only a dream and we're the imagination of ourselves.

30
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.730
<v 0>Here's Tom with the weather,
with on topics.</v>

31
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.210
<v 1>A few comedians would even think about touching,</v>

32
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.510
and he did so in such a brilliant way.
He had absolutely zero need for approval.

33
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.970
He was able to handle the tension of the audience,

34
00:02:15.971 --> 00:02:18.550
not laughing in a way very few performers could do.

35
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.690
He was able to handle it so well that it was completely willing to alienate

36
00:02:22.691 --> 00:02:26.020
parts of the audience if it meant getting his real point across.

37
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.520
One of the best examples of someone embodying the spirit of Bill Hicks,

38
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.410
challenging our preconception of how we view comedy is the insanely creative,

39
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.070
thoughtful,
and talented musical comedian.
Bo Burnham,

40
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.770
<v 3>my ex girlfriend,
had a really weird fetish.
Uh,</v>

41
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.440
she used to like to dress up as herself and then act like a fucking bitch all

42
00:02:47.441 --> 00:02:51.240
the time.
Right.
Han's Taylor,
when you do a little bit of thing.

43
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.020
I is a Dutch absurdist.
Uh,
one of the things he does is he brings out a,

44
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.940
a sock puppet,
which is a black sock if you're already,
I don't like them.

45
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.850
All right.
All right.
And so it's a white sock.

46
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.523
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

47
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.440
<v 3>When did my mother first described gay sex to me?
Good question.</v>

48
00:03:09.441 --> 00:03:11.660
I was eight years old.
She said,

49
00:03:11.661 --> 00:03:16.520
what happens when two men love each other like that?
What they do is they,
uh,

50
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.200
they take off all their clothes,

51
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.460
they get in the bed and they shit on the Bible.

52
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.920
<v 0>Okay.</v>

53
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.940
<v 1>Bone never dove into the realms of politics,
war,
corruption or poverty,</v>

54
00:03:28.941 --> 00:03:32.210
like bill head in his own words,
he said

55
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.740
<v 3>revealing it in yourselves.</v>

56
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.180
I never talk about what I really think about onstage directly cause I just don't

57
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:41.230
think I don't value what I think at this point.
How about those issues?

58
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.460
We'll just really like,
I don't,

59
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.460
I don't think anyone wants to get up and here at 20 year olds like tell them

60
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:46.850
what they think we do,
the world,
where would you,

61
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.390
<v 1>but what Bo was able to do was provoke our thought process on a completely</v>

62
00:03:51.391 --> 00:03:55.230
different level from his first songs that blew up on youtube too is witty one

63
00:03:55.231 --> 00:03:56.790
liners and self deprecating humor.

64
00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.930
<v 4>And I masturbate cause I'm the only one whose standards are low enough to</v>

65
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.793
<v 0>wait</v>

66
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.150
<v 1>to his incredibly deep song lyrics.
As he evolved as a performer,</v>

67
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:13.930
he continued to find new thought provoking ways of getting his message across.

68
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.290
<v 5>It's a consummation of helping to be wished to die,</v>

69
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.070
just sleep or tends to dream Aye.

70
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.390
There's the rub for in that sleeve of death what dreams may come and we have

71
00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:28.880
shuffled off this mortal coil,
muscular smells like

72
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.350
<v 1>hit such a hidden cleverness and so many of the songs he performed,</v>

73
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.950
if you weren't paying very close attention,

74
00:04:40.951 --> 00:04:42.990
the deeper meaning would pass right over your head.

75
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.510
Many of his songs showcased a brilliant play on words hit an incredibly unique

76
00:04:48.511 --> 00:04:49.231
use of language.

77
00:04:49.231 --> 00:04:53.340
And I was amazed that I could listen to his songs dozens of times and grasp a

78
00:04:53.341 --> 00:04:57.540
different meaning buried in the seam lyrics.
I had heard so many times before

79
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.280
Bose act and a college audience seem to be a match made in heaven with

80
00:05:03.281 --> 00:05:05.560
astonishingly clever songs like new math

81
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.400
<v 4>Santa Claus multiplied by I.
Well,</v>

82
00:05:09.401 --> 00:05:14.401
I guess that makes him a real and the square root of the end to Ba is app

83
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.750
<v 1>songs like nerds and my whole family thinks I'm gay.</v>

84
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.770
Detailing the struggles of growing up seemingly out of the loop of the cool
kids.

85
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.600
<v 3>Even my boyfriend thinks I'm gay,
another mother fucker.</v>

86
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.420
<v 1>His earlier songs were very clever and seemed like the creation of an innocent,</v>

87
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.810
eager young man just wanting to put his art out and get noticed.

88
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.480
We saw a change in him when he put out his first non comedic song,
art is dead.

89
00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:40.660
Okay.

90
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.120
<v 3>How the world,
where would you do me a favor?
Just kind of,
you do me a favor.</v>

91
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.350
Would you do artists,
dad?

92
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.650
Because I think that song says everything that I think I'm talking about.
Hey.

93
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.280
Yeah,
I'll do that one.
Yeah.
He's a prop comic

94
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.670
<v 6>detailing the harsh truths of how show business really operates as well as his</v>

95
00:06:09.671 --> 00:06:12.310
own emotions.
Not Feeling that he deserves the attention.

96
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.710
<v 4>He's getting Ben to a birthday party for retail trend,</v>

97
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.420
one of the children and won't stop screening cause he's just a little at 10

98
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:25.421
Santa tracks or when he grows up to be a comic or acts or he'll be your award in

99
00:06:25.711 --> 00:06:30.711
for never been touring for never understanding or learning every day can't be

100
00:06:32.011 --> 00:06:36.900
about him.
There's other pain.
Must be psychotic.

101
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.360
It must meet the men said,
I think that I'm worthy evolve.

102
00:06:40.361 --> 00:06:42.580
There's a tension of all of this money.

103
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.470
<v 1>He goes even deeper in the finale to a second special.</v>

104
00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:48.140
What was the song we think we know you.

105
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:50.721
<v 4>That's the end of the show.</v>

106
00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:54.770
I probably should have ended it on a sort of higher note there,
but uh,
yeah,

107
00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:59.450
that's the end of what I hope you liked it but oh oh my God.
How are you?

108
00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:02.690
I haven't seen you since like freshman year.
Oh my God.

109
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:07.090
<v 1>It starts out with him dealing with what we can assume our various encounters.</v>

110
00:07:07.091 --> 00:07:08.930
He has throughout his life anyway,

111
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.840
a fan with the superficial infatuation with him,
an agent trying to grow the

112
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.610
<v 4>Bo Burnham brands.
Young people do not respond to this,
you know,</v>

113
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.440
introspective material are these challenges to the form.
You know,

114
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.590
young people want jokes they can relate to.
Okay,

115
00:07:24.591 --> 00:07:27.800
so write a write a silly song about Facebook

116
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.580
<v 1>and an old classmate telling him fame has changed him.</v>

117
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.720
<v 4>You've changed.
I never knew you but uh,</v>

118
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.630
my friend's old roommates friends that he knew you in high school and you became

119
00:07:37.631 --> 00:07:40.890
a real ass hole once all this comedy stuff started happening.
What?

120
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.210
What is it man?
You think you're better than us did?

121
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.063
You're better than us just cause

122
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.420
<v 1>these three separate interactions converge into one main point.</v>

123
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.310
That becomes the theme of the song.

124
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.520
<v 7>Oh,
we think you've changed bro.
We know best.</v>

125
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.130
We think you've changed bro.

126
00:07:55.131 --> 00:07:59.160
We know best that we think we know you.

127
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.870
We think we know you.
We think we know you.

128
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.560
We think we know you.
We think we know you.

129
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:10.250
We think we know you.
We think we know you.

130
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.190
We think we know you.
We think we know,

131
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.950
<v 6>we think we know,
you know,</v>

132
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.750
a seemingly small well one could describe as first world problem.

133
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.470
We know when that is very real and we all seem to face,

134
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.600
people always love to put you in a box.
They live to categorize you.

135
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.950
It just makes things simpler.
It makes their world easier to understand.

136
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:34.211
After all,

137
00:08:34.211 --> 00:08:37.630
we can't go around thinking about all the infinite complexities hidden deep

138
00:08:37.631 --> 00:08:41.290
within every person we meet.
There is not enough time in the world.

139
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:46.210
So we fit everyone we know perfectly into a category based on a small amount of

140
00:08:46.211 --> 00:08:47.110
knowledge we have of them.

141
00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.640
It was when we're nearing the end of his third special,

142
00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:05.630
make happy that we all experienced one of the most real moments I had ever seen

143
00:09:05.631 --> 00:09:06.464
from a performer.

144
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.850
<v 8>Could we get the house lights up for a second?
Could you let the lights on stage,</v>

145
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.070
let the artifice fade away.
Now we're all the same.

146
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.520
I mean you're all facing this way

147
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:20.653
<v 0>still.</v>

148
00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:28.260
<v 8>You know,
I look at it,
I look out at you and it's a very diverse crowd.</v>

149
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:32.070
I mean more European than I would have hoped,
but we'll get there.

150
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.750
I look at the young people,
you know,

151
00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:40.470
and I feel like I was born in 1990 and I was sort of raised in America,

152
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.640
but it was a cult of self expression and I was just talking,
you know,

153
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:49.020
express myself and have things to say and everyone will care about them.

154
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.070
And I think everyone was taught that and most of us found out no one gives a

155
00:09:53.071 --> 00:09:53.940
shit what we think.

156
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.620
So we flock to performers by the thousands because we're the few that have found

157
00:09:58.621 --> 00:09:59.250
an audience.

158
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.370
And then I'm supposed to get up here and say follow your dreams as if this is a

159
00:10:02.371 --> 00:10:04.470
meritocracy.
It is not okay.

160
00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:07.660
I had a privileged life and I got lucky and I'm unhappy.
Right.

161
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.920
They say it's,
it's like the me generation.
It's not,

162
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:17.730
it's not the arrogance is taught or it was cultivated.
It's,

163
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.490
it's self conscious.
That's where it,

164
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:24.000
it's conscious of self with the social media,

165
00:10:24.001 --> 00:10:28.410
it's just the market's answer to a generation that demanded to perform.

166
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:33.270
So the markets that here perform everything to each other all the time for no

167
00:10:33.271 --> 00:10:35.550
reason.
It's prison,
it's horrific.

168
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.490
It is performer and audience melded together.

169
00:10:38.491 --> 00:10:41.700
What do we want more than just lie on our bed at the end of the day and just

170
00:10:41.701 --> 00:10:45.810
watch our life as a satisfied audience member and I know very little about

171
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:46.703
anything,

172
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.940
but what I do know is that if you can live your life without an audience,

173
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.593
<v 9>you should do it.</v>

174
00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.820
<v 6>He's rented in interviews about the VAT badness of a social media culture.</v>

175
00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:05.470
Everyone is creating these curated versions of their own lives that are

176
00:11:05.471 --> 00:11:08.170
impossible to live up to.
As a people.

177
00:11:08.171 --> 00:11:12.700
We demanded a platform to perform so the market gave it to us.

178
00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.670
There's no substance.
There's no need to be thoughtful.

179
00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.820
There's no need to spend countless hours working in honing a craft,

180
00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.850
no need for genuinely expressing yourself to an art form.

181
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:26.560
You can skip all of that.
Just post your rant on to Facebook.

182
00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:28.630
No one is really listening,

183
00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:32.130
but enough people hit that like button that we get our little bit

184
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:33.023
<v 0>dope.</v>

185
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.870
<v 6>We used to glorify icons and celebrities based on their merits.</v>

186
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:41.360
Whether or not you liked Jimi Hendrix music,

187
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:45.500
you could feel the soul of his art oozing out from every poor.

188
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.510
Now we glorify celebrities simply for living their lives.

189
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.910
The work they put out simply isn't good enough yet we don't hold them

190
00:11:54.911 --> 00:11:58.840
accountable to any kind of standard.
Everything has become homogenized.

191
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.070
There's no depth.

192
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:04.930
Our attention spans had been damaged by 32nd viral videos and clickbait titles.

193
00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.520
One of my favorite lines from Terence Mckenna,

194
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:11.700
a personal hero of mine was when he said,

195
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.360
<v 8>hi,
where are you?
Are Now</v>

196
00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.890
your of your universe?

197
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.280
And if you're worrying about Michael Jackson or Bill Clinton or somebody,

198
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.070
you are disempowered,
you're giving it all away.

199
00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:35.230
I call it icons,
which are maintained by an electronic media.

200
00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:36.940
<v 9>Okay?</v>

201
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.360
<v 6>We exist in a culture that says your experience is not valid.</v>

202
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.480
So we didn't outsource our own experience to icons.

203
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.980
We live vicariously through reality TV and celebrity gossip.

204
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.300
We cultivate this curated representation of our lives and put it on display

205
00:12:52.301 --> 00:12:53.170
through social media.

206
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.480
We hope it lives up to the icons we immortalize yet no matter how well we

207
00:12:58.481 --> 00:13:03.430
portray this curated life,
still nobody gives a shit.

208
00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:09.330
Yeah.
We keep trying hopelessly performing in each other day after day.

209
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:10.323
<v 8>Oh,</v>

210
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:16.030
differ and what is real and your brand and your PA,

211
00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.880
your high and your arc as your hopes,
your plants,
your ears.

212
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.970
<v 6>What is real is you and your experience,
but we're told no,</v>

213
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:32.090
our experiences are irrelevant.
You can.

214
00:13:32.091 --> 00:13:34.670
Since the conflict in boat coming through in his performance,

215
00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.780
he had a career that was completely made possible due to social media.

216
00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.280
The best part about something like youtube is that everybody has a voice.

217
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.240
The worst part about youtube is that everybody has a voice,

218
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:51.890
but still people like bone never would've gotten notice in the old form of
media.

219
00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:57.080
His type of performance art is one that could only exist through this platform,

220
00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.990
the very platform he's rented against

221
00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:04.400
and rest assured this irony is not lost on him.

222
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:08.180
He stated in interviews that his entire show was an act of hypocrisy.

223
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:12.440
He acknowledges how lucky and fortunate he was to find a voice,

224
00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.570
an audience to appreciate his work,

225
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:19.790
but that same medium he used to find his voice,
he now calls prison in horrific

226
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.980
<v 1>what can be true to ourselves.
One moment is false.
The next our thoughts,</v>

227
00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:29.210
states and emotions aren't a constant state of flux and I think what comes out

228
00:14:29.211 --> 00:14:33.590
of this is an obligation to act through an interpretation of your truth.

229
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.540
Whatever you feel that is in the moment.

230
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:41.590
Bone knew he had a privileged life yet in this moment right now he was unhappy

231
00:14:42.471 --> 00:14:46.640
with how it all worked out.
That is what was true to him and he spoke about it.

232
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:52.520
Topics like this can be hard to face yet forced us to do it anyway.

233
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.960
I think we all collectively cringed when he was going down this path.

234
00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:02.510
We didn't want to face it.
Go back to the jokes,
the playfulness,
the silliness.

235
00:15:02.511 --> 00:15:03.344
We said,

236
00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:08.740
I believe that truly revolutionary artists are ones who challenged the form,

237
00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.350
who pushed the boundaries of what we find acceptable.

238
00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.980
Bo was going to make us deal with this no matter what.

239
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:17.170
No matter how much we wanted to hide from it.

240
00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.580
And now you're thinking,

241
00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.790
how the fuck are you going to dig the show out of this weird,

242
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:29.810
<v 10>hold on.
Do you want me to be funny and to make a point?
Nah,
Nah,
Nah,
Nah,
Nah,</v>

243
00:15:29.811 --> 00:15:33.190
Nah.
Batman.

244
00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.920
So how do we do it?

245
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:39.913
<v 0>Okay.</v>

246
00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:44.100
<v 1>Both in cracks into his finale to the show entitled can't handle this.</v>

247
00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:49.980
It starts in typical Bobar and fashion.
He lightheartedly makes fun of Kanye West

248
00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:55.380
<v 8>power.
His $90 tee shirts weren't selling very well.</v>

249
00:15:55.381 --> 00:15:57.450
That was most of it.
And I watched this.

250
00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.630
<v 1>As the music starts to build,</v>

251
00:16:00.631 --> 00:16:04.290
he begins his rant on the width of Pringle cans and Shapolsky overfilling his

252
00:16:04.291 --> 00:16:04.990
burrito.
Yeah.

253
00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:06.260
<v 4>When it's Europol,
boy</v>

254
00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:11.470
God mot self and Chicken Ball Reno.

255
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:15.300
<v 1>No,
I haven't heard this directly from Bo.</v>

256
00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.720
Just what I've read out of the mini speculations from fans,

257
00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:23.790
but given how bold presents his shows and his uncanny ability to play on words

258
00:16:23.791 --> 00:16:26.070
and hide meaning in the seeming randomness,

259
00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.820
I find it very unlikely that he's not creating a metaphor with these lines.

260
00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:31.740
He keeps repeating.
Yeah.

261
00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:32.470
<v 4>The line.</v>

262
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.170
I wouldn't have gotten half this shit if I knew what's going to fit in the

263
00:16:35.171 --> 00:16:38.790
Burrito.
All right.
Look,
I wouldn't have got the murder so

264
00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:45.760
water wouldn't have got the peppers.
God,

265
00:16:45.761 --> 00:16:47.490
God,
God,
God damn,

266
00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.670
<v 1>as he's going down the Burrito line,
everything looks amazing.</v>

267
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:57.280
He wants to add it all to his burrito.
Finally he gets to the end of the line.

268
00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.130
He's arrived.
He's made it.
Yeah.

269
00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.840
<v 6>His life and his career are better than he could have ever envisioned and</v>

270
00:17:04.841 --> 00:17:08.260
suddenly everything starts spilling out of the Burrito.

271
00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:11.170
He says,
you should have warned me.

272
00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.470
Someone should have told him what would happen if you got into this.

273
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.440
He wouldn't have gotten into half of it if you knew what it really meant.

274
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.083
<v 4>Good</v>

275
00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:27.260
<v 1>for all Bo Burnham fans when he spoke the line.
Huh?</v>

276
00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.680
<v 4>Think that I can handle this right now.</v>

277
00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:34.740
Handle this right now.
I don't think that I can handle this right.

278
00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.220
I don't think they are not getting handled inside.

279
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:48.290
I don't think I know the answer.
I just stay here right now,

280
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:53.470
like comment and watch the skinny kid with a steadily declining mental health

281
00:17:55.560 --> 00:18:00.140
and laugh se tamps to give you what he cannot do if ever,
sir,

282
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.640
<v 12>I think collectively all of our hearts broke.</v>

283
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:06.420
How could this person who's been such a source of joy,

284
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:11.190
laughter and good emotions be unhappy?
It just didn't feel right.

285
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:15.930
One of our icons,
one of those people we put on a pedestal and glorified,

286
00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:20.970
he is unhappy.
If he is unhappy,
what could this mean for me?

287
00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.800
We're not supposed to feel sad at a comedy show.
I came here to laugh,

288
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.960
just make me laugh,
but he didn't care how uncomfortable it made us.

289
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:32.363
He was going to say,

290
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:36.560
<v 0>felt no matter what,
but you don't eat it.</v>

291
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.400
<v 4>Good night.
I hope you're happy.</v>

292
00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:03.160
Standup comedy and comedy's seems so inherently Western.

293
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:05.260
So like to understand eastern.

294
00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:07.900
Oh and then and then that might me be me being stupid,

295
00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:10.420
but I like how does that affect your perspective on common?
Cause I don't,

296
00:19:10.421 --> 00:19:15.290
I don't lay down some wisdom.
Wow.
Yeah.
What happened?

297
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:18.320
That is the correct question.

298
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:24.080
The answer to that takes a tad of time.

299
00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:29.990
I think the eastern philosophy,
uh,
really,
uh,

300
00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.730
encouraged is authenticity,

301
00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:35.630
authenticity and nothing but authenticity.

302
00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:39.590
What I saw when I saw you on stage is I didn't see a thing

303
00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:42.660
<v 12>moment,
but here's where it gets difficult to explain or understand.</v>

304
00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:50.190
I hope that you had gut trembling or something resembling fun.

305
00:19:50.191 --> 00:19:52.410
And if you watch this thing alone,

306
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:58.310
Robbie didn't laugh,
but maybe a few times you went to sale that of your nose.

307
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:04.080
But if you hated it,
that's fair buddy.
Either away.

308
00:20:04.081 --> 00:20:09.081
Could you find a little more time for partying questionnaire on a scale from one

309
00:20:10.081 --> 00:20:11.040
to zero?

310
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:15.540
Are you happy because you're on your own from here.

311
00:20:15.541 --> 00:20:18.420
So are you happy?

312
00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:23.220
I'm open to suggestions.
Are you happy?

313
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:27.780
But what the fuck kind of question is,
am I happy?

314
00:20:27.781 --> 00:20:29.670
I really want to try that,
get happy,

315
00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:34.100
then I think that I could get it if I didn't always panic every time I'm
unhappy.

316
00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.850
I'm a lifer.
I'm always like happy,

317
00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:42.300
which is stupid because I wouldn't need them one it if I got hit,
wait,
Oh God,

318
00:20:42.301 --> 00:20:43.840
my dad was right.

319
00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:47.813
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

320
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:50.430
<v 12>So with,
you know,
whatever,</v>

321
00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:55.460
knew how to be happy on a scale from one to two.

322
00:20:55.561 --> 00:20:59.620
Now are you happy?
You're everything,

323
00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:04.200
you hate it or are you happy?
Hey look,

324
00:21:04.201 --> 00:21:08.130
ma,
I made it.
Are you happy?
