00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.080
Today.
I have a very special guest.

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.760
His name is John [inaudible] and he's an award winning lecturer at the

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:08.870
University of Toronto.

4
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:09.440
<v 1>Then the newspapers,</v>

5
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.340
I'm also interested in try to get all the platonic stuff and the neoplatonic

6
00:00:13.341 --> 00:00:14.180
stuff and and,
and,

7
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.060
and make use of that to try and reconfigure a world view in which the

8
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.110
cultivation of wisdom and self transcendence and virtue makes both intellectual

9
00:00:23.211 --> 00:00:24.590
and existential sense to us.

10
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.550
<v 0>He has an amazing series on youtube called Buddhism and cognitive science.</v>

11
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.540
He coauthored a book titled Zombies in Western Culture

12
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.930
<v 1>and so the Zombie,
you know,
the way they move in horror,</v>

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.110
the shuffling boards without there being any shared communication or culture.

14
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.440
It's,
it's the Dar nightmare side of cut.

15
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:44.800
We sometimes feel like we're shuffling through the streets with all of these

16
00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:46.270
strangers around us

17
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.380
<v 0>and he has a new series being released now on awakening from the meaning crisis.</v>

18
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.450
<v 1>I don't want to build my audience on the back of controversy.</v>

19
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.650
Politicizing these issues.

20
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.510
Thinking that are issues of the conflict of political ideologies is something I

21
00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:06.150
wanted deeply undermining because that is spice sweet.

22
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.770
One of the things driving the meaning question.

23
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.600
<v 0>John is doing some amazing work.</v>

24
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.880
I felt very lucky to speak with him and I hope you guys enjoy,

25
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.880
<v 3>um,</v>

26
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.510
I thought we could start by discussing some of your background and education and

27
00:01:22.511 --> 00:01:26.440
how that has led you to this topic of meaning,
which is so central to your work.

28
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.370
Sure,
sure.
Um,
so,
uh,
I started out,

29
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.463
uh,

30
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.040
I was doing a Ba in Hamilton at McMaster and I just,

31
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.590
I took a philosophy course when I got very interested.
Um,

32
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.630
I read the republic by Plato.

33
00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:46.350
I got very interested in the topic of wisdom and this quest for meaning in life.

34
00:01:46.351 --> 00:01:49.800
And by that time in my own personal life,
I was post religious.

35
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.910
I'd been brought up,
um,
and sort of a,
a,
a very sort of fundamentalist Christian,

36
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.920
uh,
upbringing.

37
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.140
And I was sort of post doc and I was looking around and initially I got very

38
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.070
interested in what was going on,
but as it went on an academic philosophy,

39
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.610
although I saw its value and I went on to get phd and everything,
um,

40
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.360
and how it helps us better understand science.
And culture,

41
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.660
the whole Platonic Aristotelian quest for wisdom and in life and self

42
00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:25.221
transcendence was not being discussed very adequately in academic philosophy.

43
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.140
So I started,
I started to do stuff extra curricular,

44
00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:32.850
which I've continued to this day.
I did,
I learned to tie Chitwan I learned,
uh,
uh,

45
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.420
the past,
the meditation,
met contemplation,
a bunch of other practices,
printing,

46
00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:40.190
Ammo,
yoga and I do all that.
I teach some of it extra curricular and that,

47
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.450
and then I felt this big disjunct between,

48
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.710
I'm doing all these sort of wisdom cultivation practices over here and I have

49
00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:51.680
all this academic stuff.
So then I decided to find how can I put them together.

50
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.010
So I went back and I,
I,

51
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.340
I did a bsc in cognitive science to get the scientific training.

52
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.680
And then I went on and did more of that.
And then I went into cognitive science.

53
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.100
And by that time it's just one of those weird synchronicities,

54
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.800
the field that started to catch up field and people in cognitive science,

55
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.730
cognitive psychology.
Those are my two areas of specialty.
Do,

56
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:13.120
we'll do a lot of work and wisdom,
meaning all this stuff.

57
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.610
So a lot of your work has been connecting the,

58
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.540
the practical stuff you do in martial arts and all the,

59
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:22.510
all the education you've had.
Yeah.
So I know,

60
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:24.340
I think I heard in one of your classes that you,

61
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:27.970
you said you went to school for 17 years.
Is that,
is that right?

62
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.880
Well I went to,
well I went to university,

63
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.160
I went to university for 17 years because you need to get very good expertise

64
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:37.780
and one of the core disciplines.

65
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.410
So I ha I basically I had done like I had got up to my ama in philosophy so I

66
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.680
got quite a bit of expertise in that and that's when I,
as I mentioned,

67
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:51.220
I realized I really wanted to do cognitive science so that I went back into the

68
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:53.740
cognitive science and then I went back and did my phd.

69
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.770
And so adding in that whole other undergraduate degree,
uh,
and then uh,

70
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.640
a longer phd cause I was integrating stuff together that really add up.

71
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.430
I hadn't quite a bit onto it to philosophy.
That was kind of your first interest,

72
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:09.130
right?
That was my first interest.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.

73
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.820
Cause this is right when I started reading Plato and Aristotle and all these

74
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:16.480
philosophers is right when I came across your videos and you had some of the

75
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:18.490
best explanations cause you know,

76
00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:21.620
that's not the easiest thing to jump right into.
Yeah.

77
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.130
Oh thank you.
I mean I,

78
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.210
I've been privileged to teach at UFT for I guess what is it,

79
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:33.520
25 years now.
And so,
you know,

80
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.780
these are really bright people where I'm getting to work with.

81
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.390
So I've got,

82
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.170
I've got is afforded me in an arena in which I could really practice refining,

83
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.270
explaining these ideas.
Um,

84
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.300
and so I really appreciate that opportunity because I think these ideas are,

85
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.730
are really pertinent and relevant to many people today and making them

86
00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:58.280
accessible and making them sort of vibrant again for people.

87
00:04:58.281 --> 00:05:00.310
That was one of the things that I consider my important,

88
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.930
what am I important goals.
So a lot of the courses that builds up to,

89
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.760
to Buddhism and you talk a lot about practice practices of mindfulness and how

90
00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:11.200
people can integrate that in their lives.

91
00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:14.440
And there was something really interesting you said about mindfulness,

92
00:05:14.441 --> 00:05:18.250
that there's something we get wrong in the west and that is how we interpret the

93
00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:21.640
Buddhist notion of suffering.
And that was a really interesting point.

94
00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:26.280
I was wondering if you could expand on that a little bit.
Sure,
sure.
Uh,

95
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.620
so,
uh,
part of the argument

96
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.450
is that we've typically understood suffering as the experience of pain.

97
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.843
Um,

98
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.930
and although there are metaphors in the Buddhist pictures where pain is used,

99
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.650
uh,
to talk about the suffering,
that's not the most common metaphor.

100
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.690
The two most common metaphors are imprisonment,
trapped,
fettered locked,

101
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.590
stuck and diseased,
right?
And,

102
00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:58.400
and

103
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.550
<v 1>so I thought,
oh,
well,
what's being emphasized there?</v>

104
00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:05.530
And this is our actually the original meaning of our word software.
Like,

105
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.150
which is a loss of agency.
You're giving up,

106
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.500
you're losing your agency so you can actually technically suffered joy.
I mean,

107
00:06:12.501 --> 00:06:15.440
that's not an excuse to the word,
it's an archaic use of the word.

108
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.290
People would go,
what do you mean?
But what it literally means is I've,
oh,

109
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:22.900
I'm overwhelmed by joy and I sort of lose my agent.
Yeah.

110
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.890
And so this idea of losing agency is much more important because it's much more

111
00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:31.490
directly relevant to what the Buddha claim you said.
You know,

112
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.630
you just like you can get,
no matter where you taste the ocean of tastes,
of salt,

113
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.990
no matter where you dip into my teaching,
it's all about freedom.
Right.

114
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.570
And so the freedom from this loss of agency,

115
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.870
I think is one of the major things.

116
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.200
I think this is part and parcel of the Neo Ferrari.
Nah,

117
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.260
I published an article a couple of years ago on this about the West has really

118
00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:59.051
got sort of very narrow and I think overly superficial understanding of

119
00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:03.440
mindfulness and has misinterpreted and in some pretty fundamental ways.

120
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.250
I talk about this also in the new series talking about the mindfulness

121
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.820
revolution,
and I try and give it a,
a stronger account of what I,

122
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.700
how I think we should understand and interpret mindfulness.

123
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.730
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
And the new series,
the new series is great,
by the way.</v>

124
00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:19.370
I've seen the first two episodes so far.
Thank it's,

125
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.640
it really does a great job on building from the last series.

126
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:29.460
Yeah.
Yeah.
The hope was to so that people are who the people,

127
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.620
I was trying to split the difference.
I was trying to get it to that.

128
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.260
People who have seen the series will say,
oh,
I get this.
This is familiar.

129
00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:37.190
I can build on it.

130
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:42.020
But also people coming in from nowhere can watch the new series and it's a

131
00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:46.250
standalone.
So
that's been a tricky balance,

132
00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:48.620
but I think we're getting it right.

133
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.360
I'm working with some really great people who are really helping with the

134
00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:57.250
direction and the editing and the filming and everything.
Yeah,
yeah.

135
00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.300
Well it wasn't just the content,
all the editing,

136
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.540
the filming was that everything was great.
Yeah.
Well I really wanted to,

137
00:08:03.541 --> 00:08:07.090
I mean it's common complaints that got into Buddhism and cog psy series is like

138
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.750
the audio and the video because all I did was just set up a camera and put it
on.

139
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.340
Right.
Because I didn't think that much of it.

140
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.460
But I'm one of the most common criticisms is like,
well,
you know,

141
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:20.870
the content is great,
but the format is crap.
So I really wanted to improve it.

142
00:08:20.871 --> 00:08:21.740
This done well.

143
00:08:21.741 --> 00:08:24.040
That's what everyone on youtube does is like when I first started,

144
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:25.590
the audio was off.
Like the,

145
00:08:25.591 --> 00:08:29.450
the video wasn't that great and you just kind of learn as you go and get better

146
00:08:29.451 --> 00:08:33.920
and better.
Um,
but so you said you had a religious upbringing?
Yeah,
it was,

147
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.290
it was a Christian.
And so,
um,

148
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.450
I keep an eye on that because I try,
I try to be,

149
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:46.060
um,
I'm going to put this,
I try to be very respectful.
Uh,

150
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.280
whenever I'm talking about a religious framework and a spa.

151
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.200
And I tried to be especially mindful of Christianity because of course I'm going

152
00:08:52.201 --> 00:08:56.070
to have a,
a sort of bias take on it.
And so I,
that I repeatedly

153
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.510
<v 1>ours or any practicing Christians in my class if like,</v>

154
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.380
if they're,

155
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:05.640
if they're being offended by what I'm doing and I consistently get no,

156
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.700
they say no,
it's good.
You know,
sometimes it's challenging,

157
00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:10.530
but I still find it beneficial.
And you're very,

158
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.290
and so that's very important to me as well.

159
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:14.540
<v 4>That's good.
And it's,
it's,</v>

160
00:09:14.541 --> 00:09:17.580
it's important I think to have your beliefs challenged like that and to be okay

161
00:09:17.581 --> 00:09:20.920
with it.
And the get used to get used to people doing that cause I think that's,

162
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.130
that's kind of what a university is supposed to do.
Right?

163
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:28.320
<v 1>I think so.
I mean,
I,
that's what I would hope.
So.
It's,
um,</v>

164
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.570
it depends what course you read,

165
00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:33.840
but it certainly in the courses I'm privileged to teach people that are coming

166
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:35.710
in with an expectation,
uh,

167
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.600
both from the content of the course and something of my reputation that these

168
00:09:39.601 --> 00:09:42.510
courses are going to challenge them and sort of fundamental ways.
Yeah.

169
00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:43.630
<v 4>Right.
So,
yeah,</v>

170
00:09:43.631 --> 00:09:48.550
I grew up in a very strict Christian household and um,

171
00:09:48.551 --> 00:09:50.350
I remember when the Harry Potter series came out,

172
00:09:50.351 --> 00:09:54.190
like I had to hide them from my dad because it was all about like witchcraft and

173
00:09:54.191 --> 00:09:55.510
all this evil stuff.
Right.

174
00:09:55.870 --> 00:10:00.220
And so I was very biased against any part of the Christian worldview for most of

175
00:10:00.221 --> 00:10:02.650
my life.
Um,
until recently I've kind of,

176
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:06.600
I've kind of found the beauty in Christian symbolism.
Um,

177
00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:10.030
I don't think I could ever go back to it just because of that experience I had.

178
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:14.980
Yeah.
Yeah.
Say,
if someone asks me what I'm reading,
and I say the Tao Te Ching,

179
00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.610
there'll be like,
oh,
okay,
okay,
interesting.
But if I said the Bible,
they're like,

180
00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:23.050
oh,
and they kind of,
they kind of have all these preconceived notions about it,

181
00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.610
which,
yeah,
I think it's like too personal for a lot of people in the west,

182
00:10:27.611 --> 00:10:29.200
which you make the bridge to Buddhism.

183
00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.090
And you said it's a way to bridge that gap.

184
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:36.320
<v 1>Well,
that's one of the things I recommend.
I mean,
I,
I,
I'm also,
I mean,
I,
I,</v>

185
00:10:36.321 --> 00:10:39.610
I'm privileged to be in dialogue with,
uh,
uh,

186
00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.740
some Christians that I really deeply respect Jonathan Pojo,
Paul Vendor,
clay,

187
00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:49.910
right?
Um,
and,
and,
and they bring,
you know,
philosophical profundity and,
um,
and,

188
00:10:49.911 --> 00:10:54.550
and so,
um,
I,
I understand what they're doing,

189
00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.000
but,
um,
I think they also appreciate what I'm saying,

190
00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.290
that for many people like yourself and I,
that really isn't an option.

191
00:11:02.291 --> 00:11:07.060
And that seems to be something that's growing culturally in the west.
I mean,

192
00:11:07.061 --> 00:11:11.350
the numbers are pretty clear about that.
Um,
and so we need something other,

193
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:16.370
another sort of set of psycho technologies and practices and institutions and

194
00:11:16.371 --> 00:11:20.500
traditions.
Um,
I've also,
uh,
I mean,
uh,
in,

195
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.010
in that series because that was the sort of syllabus content of the course.

196
00:11:24.011 --> 00:11:27.670
It focuses in on Buddhism quite a bit because that's one of the things that

197
00:11:27.671 --> 00:11:31.600
people are reaching to,
to try and bridge between the practice and the science.

198
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.430
Um,
I of course do that in the new series,
but in the new series,

199
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.450
I'm also interested in trying to get some of the,
uh,

200
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.920
pre-christian sort of heritage from the west,

201
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:47.000
all the platonic stuff and the neoplatonic stuff.
And can we access that

202
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:53.260
and,
and,
and make use of that to try and reconfigure a world view in which the

203
00:11:53.261 --> 00:11:56.860
cultivation of wisdom and self transcendence and virtue,
uh,

204
00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.800
makes both intellectual and existential sense to us.

205
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:01.630
<v 4>And that's what I like about the series is you're,
you're,</v>

206
00:12:01.631 --> 00:12:05.790
you're showing how it all works together.
Trying.
Yeah.
Yeah.

207
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.800
And that's what you show with each philosophy.

208
00:12:07.801 --> 00:12:09.400
Are you talking about when you talk about Augustine,

209
00:12:09.401 --> 00:12:12.360
you show how he merged all the worldviews of Asia,

210
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.940
Israel and Greece and the tightness and Plato and all these people.

211
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:16.943
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

212
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.940
Because you got to explain why did this stuff take off and why does he become

213
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.330
this like literally civilization building individual,
you know,

214
00:12:24.331 --> 00:12:28.980
medieval civilizations sort of built on Augustine and profound ways and so,

215
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:33.450
um,
you don't want to trivialize that and you want to take one of you.
I mean,

216
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:38.480
it's really important to try and we really deeply get into like the worldview

217
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:42.030
that the people had and what was functioning for them.

218
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:46.890
Like I really try and we reverse engineered the viability.

219
00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:51.060
What made this viable for people?
And I mean these are,
these are intelligent,

220
00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:54.090
thoughtful,
rational,
reflective,
spiritually d people.

221
00:12:54.091 --> 00:12:55.440
What made this viable for them?

222
00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:59.400
I really want to try to work really hard to reverse engineer that.
How could I,

223
00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.830
what would I need to be doing?
What would I need to be practicing?

224
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.460
How would my worldview has to be functioning in order that this could be viable

225
00:13:05.461 --> 00:13:07.680
for me?
And then that's what I try to articulate.

226
00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.360
<v 4>I feel like nowadays we think,
oh,
they were just superstitious.</v>

227
00:13:11.361 --> 00:13:13.310
So it didn't really matter what they believe.

228
00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:17.950
And that's kind of a way of dismissing the,
the whole reason why it was,

229
00:13:17.951 --> 00:13:19.730
it was such,
such a powerful idea.

230
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.440
<v 1>Exactly.
And,
and,
and,
and the problem with that,</v>

231
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:26.990
with that dismissal is we tend to,
we're,

232
00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:31.830
we're building all these blinders that prevent us for looking for things that

233
00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:36.630
might be structurally or functionally analogous right now.
Right.
Um,
and,

234
00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.800
and the thing is,
I'm not,
I make it clear in both series.

235
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:43.320
Like I'm not saying we'd go back to these things that this is not a nostalgic

236
00:13:43.321 --> 00:13:47.490
thing,
but it's like if we understand them properly,
that will give us,

237
00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.480
when you reverse engineer,
you get the capacity for renewing your engineering.

238
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:55.140
Like I make something now my pride,
I plead,

239
00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:59.130
I see my project and I hope people don't misunderstand when I use this term.

240
00:13:59.131 --> 00:14:03.450
I mean it respect that I'm trying to salvage everything I can from the
beginning.

241
00:14:03.451 --> 00:14:06.870
Not trying to get in for anyone.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

242
00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:11.700
I want to salvage as much as I can from all of this vast heritage and so that we

243
00:14:11.701 --> 00:14:13.560
can appropriate this legacy and,

244
00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:18.680
and retool ourselves for confronting the meaning crisis right now.

245
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:22.280
<v 4>And you know,
and you also talked about a lot about,
um,
and the new series,</v>

246
00:14:22.281 --> 00:14:25.300
shamanism and altered states.
And,
um,

247
00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.600
do you receive any pushback talking about that in a academic setting?

248
00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:32.650
<v 1>Um,
a little,
um,
yeah,
so there's,</v>

249
00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:37.820
when we get into like the actually yeah,
the third and fourth,
uh,

250
00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.020
video fifth,
there's even more.
Cause that's a lot of work I've been doing.

251
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:44.380
It depends.
So in one sense,
very strong academic support.

252
00:14:44.381 --> 00:14:48.840
I was invited by Laurie Paul,
who I constantly recommend in both series,
uh,

253
00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:53.780
down to Yale to talk to her class and all stuff like Alex.
So they're like,

254
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:58.340
wow,
that's,
you know,
that's like,
oh,
that's pretty official academic appreciation.

255
00:14:58.341 --> 00:15:03.290
Right?
But also,
but,
but I've also had within at UFT and have people saying,

256
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:07.870
oh,
what are you doing?
And I was saying,
well,
like,

257
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:10.100
this is really important research.
This is why.

258
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:11.630
And there's lots of people working on it,

259
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.180
so they can't deny that it's scientifically valid.
But yeah,

260
00:15:14.181 --> 00:15:15.180
there's still this like

261
00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.910
you get that response from some people and then it's like,

262
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.140
you know what Pete people,

263
00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:28.090
and so my official position,
just to restate it right.
Um,

264
00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:30.690
and if anybody's watching,
they can,
you know,

265
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:35.300
government people like I am against prohibition on any of any substance because

266
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.970
it doesn't work.
The data on this is really clear.

267
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:40.340
Like we're going to pay attention to prohibition doesn't work.

268
00:15:40.341 --> 00:15:43.050
It doesn't affect addiction rates.
Right.
And,
and the Kemp,

269
00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:46.520
the chemical dependence model of addiction is more abundant.
So absolutely,

270
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:50.030
that's not how addiction works.
So justification is,

271
00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:54.420
is obsolete and the data shows it's ineffective southern hand.

272
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:59.270
I'm against the recreational use of my consciousness,

273
00:15:59.271 --> 00:16:02.600
mind altering drugs because,
right.

274
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:07.690
This is part of the whole way in which people can enhance self deception and the

275
00:16:08.061 --> 00:16:12.830
cultural project of like really trivializing and dismissing the spiritual and

276
00:16:12.831 --> 00:16:15.330
transformative potential of experiences.
Well,

277
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:18.710
one of the things he talked about is we had,
we used to have universities,

278
00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:20.240
this is where we get knowledge.

279
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:24.680
And then we had other places where we'd get wisdom,
the Monistat.
Yeah.

280
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.530
But now there's nowhere that we get wisdom anymore.
That's right.

281
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:30.380
I love to do that in the class I'll say,
well,
where do you go for,

282
00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.720
for information on the Internet?
Where do you go for knowledge?
You know,

283
00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:36.350
the university science,
and then where do you go for wisdom?

284
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.420
And then there's this,
then there's this stony silence.

285
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:45.650
When I say,
well,
you know,
foolishness is something much more than just ignorance,

286
00:16:45.651 --> 00:16:50.220
right?
Ignorance is just a lack of knowledge.
Where it's foolishness is,
you know,

287
00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:52.040
you're caught up in,
you know,

288
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.310
a compelling pattern of self deception and self destruction.

289
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.800
And that requires a lot of intervention.

290
00:16:57.801 --> 00:17:01.450
We know this because this is why we have therapists,
right?
Yeah.

291
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.620
It's unfortunate that we have sort of lost,

292
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:08.721
I didn't know what to call it,

293
00:17:08.721 --> 00:17:13.400
the cultural commitment to making this a central issue that we,

294
00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:17.720
uh,
aid people in their lives.
We just,
as a culture,
we're not doing that

295
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:23.630
and we're paying for it,
right?
We,
yeah,
we have mental health crisis.

296
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:28.520
We have all kinds of,
you know,
deaths of despair on the rise.
We,
we have people,

297
00:17:28.521 --> 00:17:33.521
we have increasing a sense of nihilism and cynicism and our culture.

298
00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:40.550
It's eroding our political institutions that are very rapid rate,

299
00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:42.830
all this kinds of stuff.
We're paying for it very deeply.

300
00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.370
Um,
so

301
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:38.630
about two or three or four years before I did the Buddhism and cog psy series,

302
00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:42.150
so that's what,

303
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:47.150
2016 so maybe around 2012 or so I was already cracking that argument,

304
00:19:48.841 --> 00:19:51.320
building it in,
cause I'd already been teaching that course for a while,

305
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:56.270
building that argument and then I realized and it was like,
it was like,
oh,

306
00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.190
it's kind of a union inside.
It's like when Putin should be,

307
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:02.340
there should be a mythological expression of an emerging crisis.

308
00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:07.050
And then it was oh crap.
And that's when the zombies were taking off.
Right.

309
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.360
That's just how it came together.

310
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:14.760
Jonathan Patio independently came to that realization.
Oh he did?
Okay.

311
00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.140
That's interesting.
Yeah,
that's how we actually met.

312
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:24.230
He independently came to it and then he was giving a talk and he mentioned

313
00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:30.000
he did,
he didn't quite extension,
not just to mention he did it quite extensive,

314
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:33.990
extensive exposition,
what you think.
And he said,
Oh man,
we got to talk.

315
00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:38.190
And so yeah,
that's how we ended up doing the talk on his,
on his panel.
Oh yeah.

316
00:20:38.191 --> 00:20:41.700
That's interesting that,
that you came to those two conclusions simultaneously.

317
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.660
He talks about how um,

318
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:48.010
the Zombie is a perversion of the death and resurrection

319
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:53.110
<v 4>and Christianity.
And um,
yeah,
that's,
that's probably how he got to that.</v>

320
00:20:53.111 --> 00:20:55.210
And then you make the case in,

321
00:20:55.211 --> 00:20:59.260
in the stuff you talk about how Christianity was the,

322
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:04.340
was the scaffolding that basically held up our society for so long and still the

323
00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:08.320
Zombie when it,
when it,
um,
perverts that,
that story.

324
00:21:08.321 --> 00:21:10.960
It's like all that history is just being wiped out.

325
00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:14.710
<v 1>Yeah.
I think that's,
yeah.
So my coauthors and I,
you know,</v>

326
00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.950
Christopher must've Pietro and Philip [inaudible] we were talking,

327
00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:22.160
that's why we were,
we were arguing,
right.
That,
um,

328
00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:25.750
it's not just the Zombie,
it's the Zombie apocalypse.
It's the combination.

329
00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:30.580
It's not only a perversion of the resurrection,
right,
which are,
yeah.

330
00:21:30.581 --> 00:21:32.600
Jonathan also talks about,
uh,

331
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:36.070
we talked about how the apocalypse is a perversion of the Christian notion of

332
00:21:36.071 --> 00:21:41.010
apocalypse,
which is the,
the,
the culmination redemption of all of history.

333
00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.760
It gives history all of its meaning.
And of course,

334
00:21:42.761 --> 00:21:46.690
the whole point about apocalypse in the Zombie mythology is it doesn't redeem

335
00:21:46.691 --> 00:21:51.470
the world or it actually,
it just,
it opens into this sort of vapid nothingness,

336
00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.410
right.
Going forward and,
and,
and,
and,

337
00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.950
and their sense that the world is ending,
but not in any,

338
00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:02.320
any way that's affording redemption or restructuring or changing and,
and so,

339
00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:06.850
yeah.
I,
what we were trying to get on about is that the,

340
00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:12.730
the collapse of this framework,
the
rigor posts,

341
00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:17.270
like the sacred canopy is,
is way more comprehensive.

342
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:21.930
Uh,
because,
uh,
because if it goes to the metaphor I often use is like,

343
00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:26.960
we have this sort of conceptual grammar by which we sort of think and makes

344
00:22:27.231 --> 00:22:32.231
sense and that that was so interwoven with two things,

345
00:22:32.811 --> 00:22:35.390
sort of the Christian framework and the platonic framework.

346
00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:40.340
And as those have eroded,
right?
Yes.
I mean many people up here,
they're all,

347
00:22:40.341 --> 00:22:40.880
I'm happy to.

348
00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.880
I don't believe like you are not right when that Abram or got gets eroded,

349
00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:48.530
we have to replace the grammar.

350
00:22:48.531 --> 00:22:50.990
Even though you've already dispensed with the beliefs.

351
00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.310
This is part of what again,

352
00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.730
I often repeat those people don't get it when [inaudible] is saying that God is

353
00:22:55.731 --> 00:22:59.540
dead.
That's why.
That's why the madman says it to atheist.

354
00:22:59.541 --> 00:23:01.100
He's not saying it to believers.

355
00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.610
He goes into the marketplace and he says it to atheists cause he says you don't

356
00:23:04.611 --> 00:23:05.480
know what you done.

357
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:09.080
Like you've taken a sponge and you've erased the sky and that we're forever

358
00:23:09.081 --> 00:23:14.060
falling like you.
You like we have to replace what this was doing for us.

359
00:23:14.061 --> 00:23:17.150
We can't just stop believing at the superficial level.

360
00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:20.650
<v 4>So I'm watching your,
your first series of Buddhism and cognitive science.</v>

361
00:23:20.651 --> 00:23:24.340
It felt like it was kind of building up to Nietzsche.
Yeah,
I was,

362
00:23:24.341 --> 00:23:25.720
I was very excited when he said that.

363
00:23:25.721 --> 00:23:29.170
A lot of your new series and we talk about Nietzsche and young and how they were

364
00:23:29.171 --> 00:23:30.280
going to integrate into it.

365
00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:34.460
<v 1>Yup.
So I've already done it.
I mean we sort of,</v>

366
00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:38.580
we indicated we have sort of 23 videos,
um,

367
00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:42.150
and I've already done a bit of Nietzsche and one of them sort of laying them

368
00:23:42.151 --> 00:23:42.984
into the history.

369
00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.560
And then when I come back at the and talk about the meaning crisis,

370
00:23:46.561 --> 00:23:49.350
we'll say I'm going to do a bigger,
a bigger chunk on him.

371
00:23:49.351 --> 00:23:53.070
So he's going to show up in sort of two places in the new series in a more

372
00:23:53.071 --> 00:23:54.350
substantial way.
Uh,

373
00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:59.610
and part of it again is I want to do more on like what was going on and what's

374
00:23:59.611 --> 00:24:03.070
the central,
I think for me,
what [inaudible] is trying to do,
right?

375
00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:08.120
The central project is he's trying to recover self transcendence within a world

376
00:24:09.371 --> 00:24:11.600
in which,
um,
the two worlds mythology,

377
00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:16.120
the axial revolution mythology has decayed for us and he's struggling to do it,

378
00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:20.570
but I think he's still caught up in a lot of the Christian grammar.

379
00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:23.390
Um,
and,
and he doesn't quite

380
00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.180
six,
the Christian grammar,
which is not to escape from it,

381
00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.240
it's still to be working within it.
Um,
and so,

382
00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.750
and I don't mean this in a,
I don't mean this to be dismissive.

383
00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:38.500
If I about what we need is sort of a post Nietzschean response snuff.

384
00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.160
Nietzsche was a great articulator I think of it,

385
00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:45.850
the problem and even even so insofar as indicating some of the things that are

386
00:24:45.851 --> 00:24:47.860
going to be needed for a solution,

387
00:24:47.861 --> 00:24:50.590
but I don't think his solution is the answer kind of.

388
00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.060
<v 4>Okay.
Um,</v>

389
00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:56.560
we talked about the collapse of religious belief and it seems like we kind of,

390
00:24:56.561 --> 00:25:00.450
we project that belief out on to other things that aren't a religion and that's

391
00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:02.220
worked out disastrously,
right?

392
00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:03.790
<v 1>Yes.
So,
I mean,
it would,</v>

393
00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:07.210
I talked to quite a bit more about this in the new series,
right.

394
00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:10.260
Cause I take the history farther than I did in the Buddhist and Clark Psych

395
00:25:10.261 --> 00:25:13.450
course.
I talk about,
uh,

396
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:18.300
posttraumatic pseudo religious ideologies,
like not Sikhism and Marxism,
um,

397
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:22.900
and,
and nationalism,
patriotism,
all these surrogates.
Um,

398
00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:27.010
and even,
um,
even stuff we're doing now,
which is,
you know,
people who are,

399
00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:32.180
I'm not religious and yet they're like obsessed with superhero movies and they

400
00:25:32.981 --> 00:25:35.360
want,
they want,
they try as much as they can to symbolic.

401
00:25:35.361 --> 00:25:39.610
We live in that world and identify with individuals.

402
00:25:39.611 --> 00:25:41.830
And um,
so yeah,

403
00:25:41.831 --> 00:25:46.831
there's a lot of the attempts and and many of them are on nostalgic it critical

404
00:25:49.021 --> 00:25:53.760
sense of that term or attempts to try and replace that grammar.
Uh,
but

405
00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:59.340
did they fail for some very deep reasons.
One of the,
uh,

406
00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:04.360
one of the reasons is many of them are caught within a model,

407
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.680
like a framing of the scientific understanding of the mind that we've largely

408
00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:11.930
inherited from Descartes.
And that's,

409
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:15.930
that's now the project of philosophy and cognitive science in the last hundred

410
00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:19.190
years has been trying to deconstruct that Cartesian a framework and open us up

411
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:24.300
to alternatives.
Like one of them is even to think about,

412
00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:26.880
we even use this as a synonym Iti.

413
00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:31.110
Think about religion as a sophisticate has belief as a system of beliefs.

414
00:26:31.111 --> 00:26:34.740
That belief is the primary thing.
We should be like focusing on it.

415
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:39.700
And so we keep trying to pick ideological responses to the meeting prices

416
00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:44.720
without realizing that it pervades into much deeper levels of the psyche then

417
00:26:46.231 --> 00:26:50.280
are reached by just our,
our,
our sort of introspective or beliefs.

418
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:55.630
<v 4>You talk a lot about meaning in life and how that's all been lost to us and our</v>

419
00:26:56.571 --> 00:26:57.560
in our modern world.

420
00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:01.430
Based on your work and maybe like the attitude that you see in your students,

421
00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:04.190
are you optimistic about regaining that meaning?

422
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:09.500
<v 1>Yeah.
Okay.
I mean,
so,
well my most days,</v>

423
00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:14.450
but I need,
so again,

424
00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:19.070
one of the things that Topol is meaning in life is such a hot topic now and many

425
00:27:19.071 --> 00:27:21.830
aspects of cognitive science.
It's a hot topic in philosophy,

426
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:25.250
very hot topic in psychology doing work on it.
My lab,

427
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.020
the consciousness and the wisdom study labs.

428
00:27:27.021 --> 00:27:31.580
We just did a huge m Turk study and we found that there's a significant,

429
00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:34.370
I'd like to know not just statistically significant,

430
00:27:34.371 --> 00:27:37.820
but a significant correlation between,
um,

431
00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:41.390
if people have mystical experience and how meaningful they rate their life.

432
00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.390
And then,
and then trying to find out,
okay,

433
00:27:44.391 --> 00:27:48.920
what is it in the experiences sort of doing most of the heavy lifting and in

434
00:27:48.921 --> 00:27:53.600
this lines up with other work by someone's Samantha Hanselman and others that

435
00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:57.680
it's sort of the insight like machinery cognition is sort of this making

436
00:27:57.681 --> 00:28:00.500
coherence making sense,
right?
Um,

437
00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:05.770
that's the level at which you can improve people's meaning in life.

438
00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.920
And it,
it,
it's,
it's,
it's being able to again,

439
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:16.350
trigger these kinds of experiences with reliable systems a or technologies that

440
00:28:18.551 --> 00:28:23.430
are set within an intellectually and culturally validated,
right.
Um,

441
00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:27.880
worldview and framework that I think is doable for us now because I think,

442
00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:29.740
I think all the pieces,

443
00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:33.550
there's so many good people doing work on all of the pieces and we're,

444
00:28:33.551 --> 00:28:38.230
we're making pretty significant understanding and all the components and there

445
00:28:38.231 --> 00:28:41.080
is great.
And on the other side,
right,

446
00:28:41.081 --> 00:28:44.350
there's great cultural hunger for all of this stuff.

447
00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:49.700
And so I see this confluence picking up speed.
Now I'm not,
I'm not,

448
00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.440
I think there's,
I don't believe in destiny or anything like that.

449
00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:56.230
And this can all go wrong in many ways because we're in a,

450
00:28:56.231 --> 00:29:01.130
we're in a very tight race.
Cars trying to get this addressed is,

451
00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:05.800
is meshed up with other horrible things we're facing in our culture.

452
00:29:05.801 --> 00:29:08.050
Like there's political,
socioeconomic,

453
00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:12.220
environmental issues that are pressing on us in a very urgent manner.

454
00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:14.390
<v 4>We talked about the,
the showman too,</v>

455
00:29:14.391 --> 00:29:17.600
and it seems like just in the last maybe five to seven years,

456
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:22.280
there's been a rediscovering of the showman and trying to get back to wisdom as

457
00:29:22.281 --> 00:29:23.114
you talk about.

458
00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:27.620
<v 1>Nope.
Again,
I think that's there.
There's again,
there's good and bad about that.</v>

459
00:29:27.621 --> 00:29:29.960
The fact that the,
that your tip,
right?

460
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:32.720
So they're like,

461
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:37.280
this is a mythological attempt to try and get back before there's history so

462
00:29:37.281 --> 00:29:40.170
that we can,
and I think there's sort of like,

463
00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.390
I don't want to call it they're avocado,

464
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:43.630
but this sort of semi conscious understanding of it,

465
00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.110
we've got to somehow get back,
uh,

466
00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:50.740
to this machinery that's been layered over.
And I respect that.

467
00:29:50.741 --> 00:29:54.370
And then the idea that,
you know,
altered states of consciousness,
uh,

468
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:59.670
and transformative experiences play an integral role in a self transcendence.

469
00:30:00.821 --> 00:30:04.930
And self transcendence itself plays an integral role in the cultivation of

470
00:30:04.931 --> 00:30:05.560
wisdom.

471
00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.640
You really can't overcome pervasive self deception unless you're doing powerful

472
00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:13.240
self transcendence.
Those two are just locked like this together.

473
00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:18.300
I think that all is very good.
The problem we have,
and this is,

474
00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:20.590
I think you noticed this in the,

475
00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:23.200
in the old series and it's in the new series as well,

476
00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:28.380
is our culture tends to commodify and trivialize things and displace them from

477
00:30:29.171 --> 00:30:31.960
an ecology of practices.
Like again,

478
00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:35.620
too many people that just sort of taking shamanism and then all just practice it

479
00:30:35.621 --> 00:30:40.621
on my own as somebody in North America in the year 2019 and that has no problem

480
00:30:42.061 --> 00:30:46.750
is from something that you know is from the Upper Paleolithic era right now.

481
00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:51.220
Others like come on that,
that you have to pay attention to.

482
00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:54.250
Like what?
Like that.
So yeah.

483
00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:54.821
<v 4>Well yeah,</v>

484
00:30:54.821 --> 00:30:57.820
there's like this Hubris and thinking you can do something on your own that has

485
00:30:57.821 --> 00:31:00.940
this thousands of years of history behind it and you're like,
ah,
I'm good.

486
00:31:00.941 --> 00:31:02.290
I can just,
I can do it on my own.

487
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:06.240
<v 1>Exactly.
And,
and,
and so this is part of the problem we face,
right?</v>

488
00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:07.930
There's a bit of a,
you know,

489
00:31:07.931 --> 00:31:12.900
a cult of individualism that we've inherited in the west.
Uh,
uh,
you know,

490
00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:16.730
uh,
and this,
again,
this is part of the Christian heritage.

491
00:31:16.731 --> 00:31:19.230
The Christian heritage tended to give us the sense of the value of the

492
00:31:19.231 --> 00:31:23.580
individual because if it's mythology of the individual soul that was destined to

493
00:31:23.581 --> 00:31:28.230
return to God and,
and I,
and that has had a lot of positive benefits for us,

494
00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:33.330
but we have tended to come to this idea of the completely self reliant self made

495
00:31:33.331 --> 00:31:36.110
individual,
which is a mythology,
right?

496
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:40.020
There are just so many ways in which that's not true of us.
In fact,

497
00:31:40.021 --> 00:31:43.710
one of the exciting things that's going on in cognitive science right now is to

498
00:31:43.711 --> 00:31:48.711
understand how much brains work in networks in what's called distributed

499
00:31:49.051 --> 00:31:49.884
cognition.

500
00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:54.660
Most of our problem solving has done long before the Internet network computers

501
00:31:54.661 --> 00:31:54.961
together,

502
00:31:54.961 --> 00:31:57.660
their culture was networking brains together because most of our significant

503
00:31:57.661 --> 00:32:01.270
problem solving is done by networking brands.
And I'm like,

504
00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:04.980
look at the language you're using.
You didn't make it.
I didn't make it right.
Uh,

505
00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:09.620
this technology,
I didn't make it.
You didn't make it
there.

506
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:10.590
Yeah.

507
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:15.590
And so you can't sort of leap out of all of that into a sort of raw and rugged

508
00:32:15.931 --> 00:32:19.410
individualism.
Um,
now everybody please,

509
00:32:19.411 --> 00:32:22.830
that's different from the moral argument that we all have to bear it individual

510
00:32:22.831 --> 00:32:26.570
responsibility for actions.
I'm not denying that I'm making a point.

511
00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.140
I'm making a dip and part of it,

512
00:32:28.141 --> 00:32:31.710
but my point is we shouldn't confuse the fact that we are individually morally

513
00:32:31.711 --> 00:32:35.730
responsible with the fact that our cognition often works in a distributed

514
00:32:35.731 --> 00:32:40.190
fashion.
So do you think it's,
um,
taking individual responsibility but doing

515
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:42.380
<v 4>that within a culture and within a community?</v>

516
00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.640
<v 1>Exactly.
Exactly.
Very well put.
That's very welcome.</v>

517
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:48.290
<v 4>Yeah.
And one of the big things you've talked about in the,
the,</v>

518
00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:52.460
the book on zombies is that we're surrounded by each other,

519
00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:54.800
but completely isolated at the same time.

520
00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:58.150
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.
Go ahead.
Oh No,
you go ahead.</v>

521
00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:03.360
I was just gonna say it and then this Ami just captures that and reflect,
I mean,

522
00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:06.820
the point about myth,
right,
is to reflect back.

523
00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:11.530
I mean it's to transform it and it's through imagery and reflect it back to us

524
00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:15.850
so that we can gain some awareness and insight.
And so the Zombie,
you know,

525
00:33:15.851 --> 00:33:19.870
the way they move in hoards the shuffling boards without there being any shared

526
00:33:19.871 --> 00:33:22.670
communication or culture.
It's,
it's,

527
00:33:22.671 --> 00:33:25.020
it's the dark nightmare side of how we,

528
00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:29.800
how we sometimes feel like we're shuffling through the streets with all of these

529
00:33:29.801 --> 00:33:32.140
strangers around us.
Um,
yeah,

530
00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:33.070
<v 4>sure.
Yeah.</v>

531
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:35.950
So I think it's interesting you used the word reflection and myth has a

532
00:33:35.951 --> 00:33:39.760
reflection of,
um,
of these patterns that were playing out.

533
00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:43.720
And a lot of people take myth as just,
Oh,
a,
a fairytale,
you know,

534
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:46.260
something that's not true,
then I'll leave.

535
00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:51.220
<v 1>So that's an unfortunate,
a negative consequence of the enlightenment.</v>

536
00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.050
I don't mean Buddhist enlightenment to,
I mean,

537
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:57.910
in period in Western history called the enlightenment,
you know,
the 16th,

538
00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:00.160
the 16th and 17th centuries,
right?

539
00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:04.390
Early 18th century in which,
you know,
there's the,
there's the,

540
00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:09.070
there's the scientific revolution.
Uh,
there's the development of,
uh,
of,
uh,

541
00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:13.060
of a completely secular state.
Um,
there's the industrial revolution.

542
00:34:13.061 --> 00:34:16.660
All of these things are coordinating together.
Um,
and

543
00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:18.571
so,

544
00:34:18.571 --> 00:34:23.571
and there was a project of trying to understand everything before that as you

545
00:34:24.601 --> 00:34:29.030
know,
superstitious or inaccurate or incomplete or,

546
00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.210
or something like that.

547
00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:35.010
And I think that has led us to misunderstand myth.

548
00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.040
And the problem is the misunderstanding is on sort of

549
00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:44.520
both sides of the debate.
People who see them like so the,
the,
the,
the,

550
00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:46.030
the point about,
like I said,

551
00:34:46.031 --> 00:34:51.031
the point of what myth is and to give us literal stories about some past

552
00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.220
something that actually happened.
Um,

553
00:34:55.640 --> 00:35:00.290
and so I think fundamentalism is very much the same mindset,

554
00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:00.980
uh,

555
00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:05.980
applied to the miss as the people who reject myths because right now,

556
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:10.780
and so the point of a myth and the reason why the myth persists and not on this

557
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:12.470
persist,
they die.
Right?

558
00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:17.750
And that tells you that they aren't being judged in terms of their literal truth

559
00:35:17.751 --> 00:35:22.100
or falsity.
They're being judged in terms of how they resonate with us,

560
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:23.090
how they perform,

561
00:35:23.091 --> 00:35:28.091
this reflective function of putting us in contact with sort of perennial

562
00:35:29.031 --> 00:35:32.330
problems that are very hard to keep in mind.
Very hard.

563
00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:36.540
I need to think about the fact that many of the things that you really are,

564
00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.000
I do this in the lecture so you get familiar with this,

565
00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:40.890
but many of the things that we very value,

566
00:35:40.891 --> 00:35:44.910
it's very hard to hold in mind like holding justice in mind is very high.

567
00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.350
We need a symbol,
we need a myth,

568
00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.020
and then if you can tell the story around the symbol,

569
00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:50.460
it becomes more efficacious.

570
00:35:50.461 --> 00:35:53.940
And if there's a story you can put yourself into sort of a participation,

571
00:35:53.941 --> 00:35:54.840
you can get involved.

572
00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.770
And so what miss do is they help us right there about these perennial problems,

573
00:35:58.771 --> 00:35:59.850
these perennial patterns,

574
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:03.960
and they give us ways of holding these otherwise difficult things in mind and

575
00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:06.630
involving ourselves with them.
That's very,
very powerful.

576
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:09.900
That's why people want to be zombies.
That's why they,

577
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:13.980
they go on these Zombie walks and you've had,
why aren't you doing this?

578
00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:15.550
What's it going off of it?

579
00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:20.250
<v 4>Well,
a lot of religions,
they focus on ethics and being a good person.</v>

580
00:36:20.251 --> 00:36:20.821
And you were saying like,

581
00:36:20.821 --> 00:36:24.750
why do I need a story to tell me how to be a good person?
But it's like you say,

582
00:36:24.751 --> 00:36:28.550
it's hard to hold that in your mind all the time because like I know it takes it

583
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:30.090
what it takes to be a good person.

584
00:36:30.091 --> 00:36:32.860
But when you go into your life and you're faced with problems,
right?
You,

585
00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:36.840
you act on instinct and you don't,
you don't,
you don't think about that.

586
00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:41.180
<v 1>That's right.
This,
this is,
this is people who say this,
uh,</v>

587
00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.730
the point you just made us,
uh,
you know,
what do I need a story for it?

588
00:36:44.731 --> 00:36:47.770
Let's split.
We cut because I mean your,

589
00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:52.860
your autobiographical memory abilities or something that you don't,

590
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:57.780
aren't natural to you.
You like,
look,
we practice narrative all the time.

591
00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:02.730
Like every,
every we get up and we read stories and we look stories.

592
00:37:02.731 --> 00:37:04.740
And when you meet somebody,
you tell them your story.

593
00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:08.190
And if I ask you who you are as a person,
not as a biological organism,

594
00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:11.670
but who you are as a person,
you tell me your autobiography.

595
00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:14.430
And when you're watching the news and you don't know the story,

596
00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:18.480
well why did that happen?
You get all upset.
But when a story get is going to go,

597
00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:19.650
you relax.

598
00:37:19.651 --> 00:37:24.651
Because stories are how we actually create that autobiographical sense of

599
00:37:25.891 --> 00:37:29.480
ourselves extended in time into the past and future.

600
00:37:29.481 --> 00:37:33.810
I had to talk more about this in the new series.
And so like no stories are,

601
00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:34.411
again,
they're,

602
00:37:34.411 --> 00:37:38.990
they're part of the grammar of your agency as a person,

603
00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:43.430
as a moral agent.
Right.
So that's why stories matter.

604
00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:48.540
<v 4>Yeah.
And one thing I love about your work is it's very grounded in science.</v>

605
00:37:48.541 --> 00:37:52.410
Like you talk a lot about the science of the mind,
but it's also,

606
00:37:52.411 --> 00:37:56.970
it's very focused on the human experience and you focus on that aspect.

607
00:37:56.971 --> 00:38:00.770
Is that something you,
you make a point to focus on?
And I think that's why your,

608
00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.100
your talks are so captivating.

609
00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:07.700
<v 1>Thank you.
Uh,
thank you for saying that because that's exactly right.
For me,</v>

610
00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:12.440
bridging between those is a,
an explicit and constant goal.

611
00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:16.010
What are used to guide me,
uh,
what I'm trying to do,

612
00:38:16.011 --> 00:38:19.220
my work really trying to get right,
uh,

613
00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:24.340
the science and the experience really,

614
00:38:24.381 --> 00:38:28.910
really well wedded together so that they're mutually informing each other.
Um,

615
00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:30.590
yeah,
that,
that,
that,

616
00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:34.490
that's like the North Star of my work and farms and we orienting towards that.

617
00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:36.070
And one you talk about is

618
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:40.450
<v 4>I'm a very pivotal moment and,
uh,
our history,
which is Descartes,</v>

619
00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:41.530
right?

620
00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:45.580
You talk about one of his contemporary spinosa and how different our world could

621
00:38:45.581 --> 00:38:47.860
have been,
um,
if,
if,

622
00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:52.960
if we had followed the principles of Spinosa instead of Descartes.

623
00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:55.130
I was already,
if you could talk about that a little bit,
how,

624
00:38:55.131 --> 00:38:56.260
how different it could have been.

625
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:57.990
<v 1>Okay,
yeah,
sure.
I mean,</v>

626
00:38:57.991 --> 00:39:00.500
so that's where this gives me a chance to advertise for us,

627
00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:04.770
but knows it is going through something of a renaissance now.
Um,

628
00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:07.140
at least within academic philosophy,

629
00:39:07.141 --> 00:39:12.120
there's a growing appreciation of his relevance,
how relevant he is now to us.

630
00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:17.390
So the thing that was just a very,
very quick thing up or,
so who is he?
Right.

631
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:22.360
And so I spinosa east,
he's a contemporary of Descartes off.
So he,

632
00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:23.490
he,
he,

633
00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:28.520
he is a big fan of and is like in meshed with the new emerging science.

634
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:31.370
And so one of the things that happens with the partners,

635
00:39:31.371 --> 00:39:35.300
we get mathematics wedded to science.
Aristotelian science has no math in it.

636
00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:39.170
And so you get math as the quarter science and mathematical reasoning.

637
00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.750
And so spinosa is,

638
00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:46.130
he is baker to genius,
but Spinosa is too,

639
00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:51.200
he hit his ability to like mathematically logically reason is to pass when you

640
00:39:51.941 --> 00:39:56.170
read his book,
the ethics.
But remember that title when you read his book,

641
00:39:56.171 --> 00:39:59.720
the ethics,
it is like reading Euclid's geometry and it's,
you know,

642
00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:04.480
axiom roof aren't,
I'm not saying it's absolutely flawless,
but man,

643
00:40:04.481 --> 00:40:07.660
talk about something that is logically logically rigorous,
right?

644
00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:12.840
So you get all of what was being valued in the Cartesian revolution.

645
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:14.740
Black and this is the important point.

646
00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:19.860
It's called the ethics because it's about not just their new scientific world

647
00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:24.520
view.
It's about how can I recover,
right?

648
00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:29.500
A sense of sacredness,
blessedness,
self-transcendence wisdom,

649
00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:34.530
these are all terms spinosa is really key to talk about within and completely

650
00:40:35.261 --> 00:40:39.280
consistent with that scientific method.
So for me Spinosa is like,

651
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:43.650
yet that's part of the endorsed star I was talking about.
He was trying,

652
00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:46.780
we didn't add them together.
And when you read the ethics,

653
00:40:46.781 --> 00:40:49.670
it's not just the content,
the way it's the way it's designed,
it,

654
00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:52.000
it's really transformative on your cognition.

655
00:40:52.001 --> 00:40:56.020
It's like going through like almost like,
I don't mean in terms of content,

656
00:40:56.021 --> 00:40:59.410
but the effect it has on you.
It's like going through a meditation course.

657
00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:01.360
It's not just changing what you believe,

658
00:41:01.361 --> 00:41:05.620
it's changing how you think and how you see.
Right.
And so if we,
if he,

659
00:41:05.621 --> 00:41:07.630
if that had been more central right,

660
00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:11.320
then the project of keeping the two together would have been more central for us

661
00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:12.310
and that,

662
00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:15.850
that would probably have led to a very different place than where we are now.

663
00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:18.510
<v 4>Yeah.
Cause Descartes kind of does away with all that stuff.</v>

664
00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:22.830
He said the only thing that's real is this small slice of consciousness that I

665
00:41:22.831 --> 00:41:25.590
can prove 100% exists.
Okay.

666
00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:31.130
<v 1>Yeah.
And would they also with Descartes,
right.
Uh,
I mean he,
he,</v>

667
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:35.500
he done,
I'll get into passions and stuff.
Is He is interested.
Uh,

668
00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:39.740
we're trying to help people sort of develop,
uh,
and,
and,

669
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:44.270
and I think his whole project is a response to,
uh,
the,
uh,

670
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:47.030
the emergence of the meaning crisis with the emergence of the scientific

671
00:41:47.031 --> 00:41:51.350
revolution.
But I think he fundamentally misunderstood it.
So,
I mean,
I,
I don't,

672
00:41:51.351 --> 00:41:55.070
I'm not,
I don't like it when people blame Descartes for everything.
But,
uh,
uh,

673
00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:57.090
I'm not saying you said that either.
Um,

674
00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:03.160
I think Descartes gets the existential anxiety and dread and it's going on.

675
00:42:03.651 --> 00:42:06.290
I mean,
it's one of his contemporaries.
Pascal says,
you know,

676
00:42:06.291 --> 00:42:09.380
the infinite spaces terrify me,
right?
Descartes gets that.

677
00:42:09.381 --> 00:42:12.980
But Descartes thinks the way that will alleviate anxiety is by pursuing

678
00:42:12.981 --> 00:42:13.814
certainty.

679
00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.340
And he thinks that what the new math and the science is going to give us a

680
00:42:16.341 --> 00:42:20.570
certainty.
And,
and what we've discovered through the history of science,
right?

681
00:42:20.571 --> 00:42:23.190
And the philosophy of science,
it's not,
science doesn't give you certainty.

682
00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.340
In fact,
that's what,
what's valuable.

683
00:42:25.341 --> 00:42:29.720
It's science isn't the content being certain cause it never is.

684
00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:34.900
It's that the process is so fantastically and elegantly self correcting what

685
00:42:35.961 --> 00:42:37.700
matters.
Right?
And so,

686
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.970
and I think Spinosa sees that way better than daycare.

687
00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:46.960
<v 4>Way,
way better.
Okay.
And so I know you talked a lot about practices.
We need the,</v>

688
00:42:46.961 --> 00:42:49.990
we need the knowledge,
but we also need the practices in our lives.
And you're,

689
00:42:49.991 --> 00:42:53.560
you're a martial artist,
right?
Yup,
Yup.
Yeah.
We'll kind of martial arts.
Do you do

690
00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:55.830
<v 1>like I do touch each one and that's the primary one.</v>

691
00:42:55.831 --> 00:42:59.770
I do different persons of it.
There's a slow form I do.
I also do a fast biking,

692
00:42:59.771 --> 00:43:02.140
Fordham fault.
The Gin,
I do a sword form as well.

693
00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:05.710
<v 4>Okay,
cool.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm so I've done in Jujitsu for a long time.</v>

694
00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:10.570
<v 1>Yeah.
Just as a side,
this is anecdotal,</v>

695
00:43:10.571 --> 00:43:12.770
I haven't done any scientific investigation on it.

696
00:43:12.771 --> 00:43:17.560
So take it with a big grain of salt.
Right.
A lot of people who come to my work,

697
00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:21.240
I often have kind of a martial art.
Right.

698
00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:25.210
So I think that gives them a way of understanding some of the stuff I'm talking

699
00:43:25.211 --> 00:43:25.570
about it.

700
00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:28.030
<v 4>Yeah.
Well a lot of the stuff you talk about in like states of flow,</v>

701
00:43:28.031 --> 00:43:31.410
like you definitely experienced that.
And so there's this instructor,

702
00:43:31.411 --> 00:43:32.590
his name is John Danaher,

703
00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:37.060
and he had a really interesting way of describing why Jujitsu in martial arts

704
00:43:37.061 --> 00:43:39.550
are so addicting.
It's such an addicting practice.

705
00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:44.770
And he says that we are complex,
unique problem solvers,

706
00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:48.040
but in Jujitsu we're not being presented with a static problem.

707
00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:51.700
We're being presented with another complex and unique problem solver.

708
00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:54.820
So I give this person a problem,
they solve it,

709
00:43:54.821 --> 00:43:58.090
they give a problem back to me and it just goes back and forth like that.
Yeah.

710
00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:01.360
That was a really interesting,
uh,
a point that he made.

711
00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:04.110
<v 1>I think that's an excellent point.
That's why the,</v>

712
00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:08.650
that's why other people are the best flow inducers for us.
Yeah.

713
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:13.370
You want to get into flow state the best,
the best video games are coming close.

714
00:44:13.371 --> 00:44:15.020
Right.
Uh,
but the best thing is,

715
00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:19.700
is like some kind of cooperative competitive thing with another human being.

716
00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:24.090
<v 4>Yeah.
Um,
so you also talk about mindfulness practices a lot and that's,</v>

717
00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.520
maybe I misunderstood this,
but I think,

718
00:44:26.521 --> 00:44:30.870
I believe you're saying that by practicing mindfulness you can make that flow.

719
00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:35.110
Um,
more of your default state.
You get closer and closer to making it.

720
00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:38.330
<v 1>Oh,
totally,
totally.
I mean that's,
I need that.</v>

721
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:41.420
That was a claim made way back when in 1990 when she sent my,

722
00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.900
I did the book on flow.
He,

723
00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:47.890
she talks about the sort of environmental conditions that are conducive to
float,

724
00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:52.180
but he says,
what are those sort of,
what's the skillset of the person,
uh,

725
00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:54.070
and that is more likely to get into flow.

726
00:44:54.071 --> 00:44:58.840
And mindfulness training is one of the best predictors of your ability to get

727
00:44:58.841 --> 00:45:02.190
into the flow state.
And we actually talked about that.
Um,

728
00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:07.680
uh,
Leo and uh,
uh,
Erin,

729
00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:12.510
uh,
Leo for our area here,
a Bennett and uh,
we published a,

730
00:45:12.511 --> 00:45:16.600
an article last year and the Oxford handbook of spontaneous thought on flow and

731
00:45:16.601 --> 00:45:19.180
we tried to argue about the deep con like arguing,

732
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:23.650
explained since the deep connections between mindfulness insight flow.

733
00:45:23.830 --> 00:45:28.060
And they all had to do with sort of how you're learning to discipline your

734
00:45:28.061 --> 00:45:31.480
attention so that you can restructure what you find relevant and salient,

735
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:33.660
but you have to learn how to do this,
optimize you're saying.

736
00:45:33.661 --> 00:45:36.760
And this really complex,
sophisticated manner.

737
00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:40.420
When the environment you're doing dealing with is also complex.

738
00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:43.220
<v 4>Yeah.
Environment's constantly changing.
Is that accurate?</v>

739
00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:47.080
And when you talk about Phil,
you also mentioned rock climbing on that,

740
00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.900
which there's this new movie,
I don't know if you've seen it.

741
00:45:49.901 --> 00:45:54.070
It's called freecell though.
No.
Oh Man.
It's amazing.
It follows this guy,

742
00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:58.360
Alex tunneled and he goes to some of the most dangerous walk rock walls in the

743
00:45:58.361 --> 00:46:02.890
world.
And he climbs without a rope.
Oh yeah.
So it's still crazy.

744
00:46:02.891 --> 00:46:06.760
It's just one step or one tiny finger hold is the difference between life or

745
00:46:06.761 --> 00:46:08.440
death.
So just the,

746
00:46:08.441 --> 00:46:12.450
the state of mind you'd have to get in to do something like that.
And so the,

747
00:46:12.451 --> 00:46:13.960
in one of the scenes,
they,
um,

748
00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:17.950
they scan his brain and they show that he has almost no activation in his

749
00:46:17.951 --> 00:46:21.940
amygdala.
And so this thing is not so much that he doesn't feel fear,

750
00:46:21.941 --> 00:46:26.170
but it takes a much more,
um,
a much higher stimulus than a normal person.

751
00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:29.230
And so I thought that was kind of an interesting point.
Like,
whether you can,

752
00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:33.460
whether he was born with that or whether it was a thing that was trained over

753
00:46:33.461 --> 00:46:36.100
doing these dangerous things for so many years.

754
00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:40.400
<v 1>It's hard to say.
I mean it's always GBV sorts.
That's mean.</v>

755
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:45.090
It's always genetic environment interacting like the old,

756
00:46:45.091 --> 00:46:50.050
the old nature nurture debate,
such genes.
It seemed more abundance,

757
00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:54.950
like the two are locked together and just really,
really complex interaction.

758
00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:56.750
So you probably had,

759
00:46:56.810 --> 00:46:59.720
he was probably constitutionally born with some dispositions,

760
00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:03.470
but there was also stopping early upbringing things base.

761
00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:08.480
But he also is probably cultivators trying to trace like trying to find that the

762
00:47:08.571 --> 00:47:13.270
silver bullet point of that now.
Yeah.
So,

763
00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:17.100
but one thing I think is,
is,
is very,
um,

764
00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:22.580
we can have confidence in saying is that extended training and skills is

765
00:47:22.581 --> 00:47:26.780
definitely a rewinder and cause brain and powerful and important ways.
I mean,

766
00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:31.120
that's what practice does.
It,
it taps into the,
of your brain in important ways.

767
00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:34.510
<v 4>Okay.
So your book zombies in Western civilization,</v>

768
00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:37.900
that was one of the most disturbing books I've ever read.
Um,

769
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:40.210
and I mean that in a good way.
Like,
I feel like you need those,

770
00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:44.500
those experiences where,
um,
you like have that existential crisis.

771
00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:45.850
And do you think,

772
00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:49.630
you'd probably say that in our modern world we already are alienated,

773
00:47:49.631 --> 00:47:53.380
but do you think we kind of need to realize that alienation before we can start

774
00:47:53.381 --> 00:47:54.214
to move through it?

775
00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:57.270
<v 1>I think so.
I mean,
again,</v>

776
00:47:57.370 --> 00:48:01.440
the is tried to wake us up to the realization in mythology isn't doing the

777
00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:03.720
theoretical work,
but it's,
it's,
it's a,
it's a,

778
00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:08.700
it's a cycle technology you've designed to wake us up to the realization what

779
00:48:08.701 --> 00:48:11.990
are the,
the interesting things that many people,
other people,

780
00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:14.670
cause there's a lot of people that are converging on this idea,
right?

781
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:17.700
I'll also be going to mean for us as Charles Taylor's talk to you about it with

782
00:48:17.701 --> 00:48:19.860
the Malays and maternity,
right.
You know,

783
00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:21.480
young even talked about it way back when,

784
00:48:21.481 --> 00:48:23.980
but he did modern man in search of a soul right there.

785
00:48:23.981 --> 00:48:26.670
So there's a lot of different people converging on this.

786
00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:31.200
But one of the things is often is that the deadening nature of the meaning

787
00:48:31.201 --> 00:48:36.201
crisis can often sort of make people superficially on aware of how much it is

788
00:48:37.831 --> 00:48:41.520
pervading their life.
So they tend to,

789
00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:47.300
they tend to only come into awareness of it when they get things that reveal

790
00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:52.320
sort of the fragility and the lack of resilience they have to dealing with,

791
00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:56.940
uh,
you know,
issues of self,
deception,
self destruction,

792
00:48:57.150 --> 00:48:57.690
right.

793
00:48:57.690 --> 00:49:02.690
A lack of connectedness to other people not having a world view that can help

794
00:49:02.791 --> 00:49:06.030
them deal with their own suffering and distress.
Right.
All that.

795
00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:08.270
<v 4>I think you're doing some very important work and I'm,</v>

796
00:49:08.271 --> 00:49:11.110
I'm glad that you stopped here to talk with us today.
Um,

797
00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:16.560
and one of your contemporaries is Jordan Peterson at the University of Toronto.

798
00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:17.280
Right.

799
00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:21.480
And so he kind of got famous after getting caught up in that gender pronoun

800
00:49:21.481 --> 00:49:22.840
issue.
Um,

801
00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:26.610
have you ever thought about just getting embroiled in a personal scandal to get

802
00:49:26.611 --> 00:49:27.600
your ideas out there?

803
00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:33.280
<v 1>Um,
yeah.
I'm not in the sense that I've considered it,</v>

804
00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:38.470
but people have proposed it to me.
And,
um,
I hope,
I mean,

805
00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:42.470
I mean,
Jordan and I have debated and we've been to conferences together.

806
00:49:42.471 --> 00:49:46.260
I mean we used to talk fairly regularly.
Um,
and,

807
00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:48.650
and so I,
I,

808
00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:52.070
I don't want to easily dismiss or,

809
00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:56.930
or say anything about,
I mean,
he's a complex guy and there's lots of,

810
00:49:57.110 --> 00:50:00.170
I think he's really,
I think you're right.

811
00:50:00.171 --> 00:50:02.330
Part of his famous is controversy and he,

812
00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.600
he makes some practice of saying controversial stuff on a regular basis.

813
00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:09.140
Traversal.
I get that.
Right.
Uh,
but I think,

814
00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:12.980
I think it's fair to say because that doesn't explain all of his success.

815
00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:17.530
He puts his finger on the meeting crisis.
There's a reason,
you know,

816
00:50:17.810 --> 00:50:21.620
we shared so many students and we often appeared at conferences together because

817
00:50:21.621 --> 00:50:26.210
we're both concerned in different ways about the meaning crisis.

818
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:30.920
So I,
I acknowledge that however,
and,

819
00:50:30.930 --> 00:50:34.010
and I,
I mean,
I have,
I,
I would,
I'd like,

820
00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:38.090
I'd like to debate in the good sense to talk with them again in public about

821
00:50:38.091 --> 00:50:39.480
responding to the meaning crisis.

822
00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:42.180
Cause there's points of his work that I agree with.

823
00:50:42.181 --> 00:50:44.280
There's points of his work that I disagree with.

824
00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:48.840
And our last conversation I think was really sort of good about that.

825
00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:54.390
But I don't want to build my audience on the back of controversy.

826
00:50:55.850 --> 00:51:00.810
Right.
And,
and,
and it's not just because that's sort of who I am as a person,

827
00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:03.900
but it's also that we talked about this earlier,

828
00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:06.240
politicizing these issues,

829
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:11.040
thinking that are issues of the conflict of political ideologies is something I

830
00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:14.730
want to deeply undermine because that is sys Lee.

831
00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:18.090
One of the things driving the meaning crisis,
the idea,

832
00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:23.480
we can frame this and resolve it as a clash of political ideologies is exactly

833
00:51:25.111 --> 00:51:26.670
something,
a presupposition.

834
00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:31.940
I want to fundamentally excavate and dispose of it because that is something you

835
00:51:32.191 --> 00:51:35.500
significantly contributing to the meaning crisis.
So it would,

836
00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:40.730
it would feel deeply hypocritical for me to try and build my reputation on the

837
00:51:40.831 --> 00:51:42.390
back of a political controversy.

838
00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:45.530
<v 4>Yeah.
Yeah,
that's a very good point.
And I know with Jordan,</v>

839
00:51:45.531 --> 00:51:47.150
he didn't do it on purpose,
right?

840
00:51:47.151 --> 00:51:50.240
He got Kinda got swept up in the controversies and that kind of,

841
00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:53.690
that exposed a lot of people to his ideas that he was already putting out for a

842
00:51:53.691 --> 00:51:56.500
long time.
And I think that's a good point though that um,

843
00:51:56.690 --> 00:52:01.550
it doesn't seem like a lot of those topics do add to the polarization so people

844
00:52:01.551 --> 00:52:04.760
don't actually listen to you.
It's like you say your point,

845
00:52:04.761 --> 00:52:07.670
they say their point and no one's really,
no one's really making any ground.

846
00:52:07.671 --> 00:52:10.880
They're listening to each other.
That's why I really like,

847
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:15.590
<v 1>I like the discussion I had with Jordan.
I really,</v>

848
00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:20.480
really like the discussion that I had with Jonathan about that because you know,

849
00:52:20.481 --> 00:52:23.870
Jonathan and I,
we differ in some fundamental ways.
He's a practicing Christian.

850
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:28.280
I'm not,
I mentioned it but there was so,
so much mutual respect and so much,

851
00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:30.210
how can we talk about this,

852
00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:34.430
like a Socratic and platonic fashion and you know,

853
00:52:34.431 --> 00:52:38.810
and I would be happy to talk with Jonathan again at any point.

854
00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:41.900
I think we mutually enjoyed it.
We've mutually beneficial.

855
00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:45.600
He came to Toronto not that long ago and we had lunch together.
I mean it's,

856
00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:49.070
that's,
that's,
that's what we need to be doing more of.

857
00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:54.110
<v 4>Yeah.
Those,
those uh,
productive talks instead of just the back and forth.
Um,</v>

858
00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:55.200
and Jonathan Patio,

859
00:52:55.201 --> 00:52:59.100
I really liked his channel because he comes from a perspective of a practicing

860
00:52:59.101 --> 00:53:02.910
Christian,
which I don't think I'm ever going to return to something like that,

861
00:53:02.911 --> 00:53:07.440
you know,
so it's,
it's from a perspective,
but he makes it accessible to everyone.

862
00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:11.700
Christian symbolism that most people wouldn't take seriously.

863
00:53:11.701 --> 00:53:15.390
He kind of makes it,
makes it relevant to people.

864
00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:16.500
<v 1>Totally.
I need,</v>

865
00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:21.500
Jonathan is philosophically astute and he is very open to considering,

866
00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:27.120
you know,
arguments and points other than and framework.
He sees the value,

867
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:30.750
I think of other philosophical and religious framework and I don't think that's

868
00:53:30.751 --> 00:53:34.530
false.
I think he genuinely sees the value.
But what's also important for me,

869
00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:38.220
you know,
I often say,
this is a slogan.
Don't tell me what you believe.

870
00:53:38.221 --> 00:53:42.240
Telling me what you practice and see,
Jonathan has a practice and his art,

871
00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:44.250
his art,
it's not even a good enough word,

872
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:49.650
but he's art as a sacred practice for him.
It's really a sacred practice for him.

873
00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:54.870
Like he's got a deep and profound practice.
And I,
and I really,

874
00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:58.380
really respect that and that,
that,
that needs,
you know,
even,

875
00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:02.310
even though we made different disagree about things we've got,
we've,

876
00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:05.130
there's depth there that we can,

877
00:54:05.131 --> 00:54:08.580
we can draw upon in conversation and I find it very valuable to do so.

878
00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:12.980
<v 4>Okay.
Wow.
Great.
Well,
thank you John for coming here today.
Um,</v>

879
00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:15.470
and I feel like this is a great conversation.
I really enjoyed it.

880
00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:18.230
<v 1>Thank you very much.
It's been a pleasure to meet you.</v>

881
00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:23.190
I really enjoyed it and I just want to stop now and say,
um,
you know,

882
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:26.600
thank you.
Uh,
for the,
the videos.
I mean,

883
00:54:26.601 --> 00:54:29.940
they're so well done and thank you.
They're,

884
00:54:29.970 --> 00:54:34.610
they're simultaneously intellectually rigorous and entertaining and you know,

885
00:54:34.611 --> 00:54:38.570
and you're doing this and like 15 minutes things just,
this is really,

886
00:54:38.571 --> 00:54:42.290
really cool.
And I know a lot of my students and my viewers,
when they see it,

887
00:54:42.291 --> 00:54:45.170
they're just,
they're really appreciative of it.
Thank you man.

888
00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:46.930
I mentioned it to my coauthors.

889
00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:49.460
I mentioned that to Chris and Phillip and they were both like,
wow,

890
00:54:49.461 --> 00:54:50.900
these are great.
These are big as a

891
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:53.140
<v 4>thank you man.
I really appreciate that.
Well,
there was so much,</v>

892
00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:57.180
there's so much source material to work with.
You guys did all the legwork and I,

893
00:54:57.220 --> 00:55:01.660
my,
I felt like my job was just to try and condense it into something that people

894
00:55:01.661 --> 00:55:03.400
could watch in one sitting,
you know,

895
00:55:03.401 --> 00:55:06.280
and trying to keep it as true to the source material as I could.

896
00:55:06.281 --> 00:55:09.550
So I'm glad that makes me very glad that you enjoyed it.

897
00:55:09.690 --> 00:55:12.610
<v 1>You're succeeding admirably out though.
You just succeeding admirably,</v>

898
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:17.580
so thank you.
Thank you.
Um,
so where can people find you?
Ah,
so the,

899
00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:21.290
the,
the best thing is,
um,
I,
if they want to,

900
00:55:21.350 --> 00:55:25.820
they can just email me if they want to engage in email conversation,

901
00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:29.450
Don docker naked you mail.com or they can just,
I mean,

902
00:55:29.451 --> 00:55:31.910
if they want to see all this stuff,
just go on to my youtube channel,

903
00:55:31.930 --> 00:55:34.580
but I got a youtube channel and

904
00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:39.250
<v 4>John,
Jennifer,
Vicky,
right.
That has all the,
all your lectures and talks in there.</v>

905
00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:40.690
<v 1>All of it.
And it's all playlisted.</v>

906
00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:44.350
That's where the new video series is being released.
It's all there.
Ready to go?

907
00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:47.470
Okay.
Anything else you want to promote or talk about?
Um,

908
00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:48.850
there's more books coming out.

909
00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:51.400
There's two books going to be coming out this year.

910
00:55:51.610 --> 00:55:55.780
Chris and I are looking at working on the follow up book to the Zombie Book.
Um,

911
00:55:55.810 --> 00:55:57.580
it's called,
um,
unsheltered.

912
00:55:57.730 --> 00:56:01.390
It's about the whole genealogy of where we lose the sacred canopy and the west

913
00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:02.920
and what does that mean for us?

914
00:56:03.250 --> 00:56:06.550
And then something somewhere we were talking about today.

915
00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:11.320
And then there's a book I'm working on with,
um,

916
00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:12.273
with,
uh,

917
00:56:12.370 --> 00:56:17.370
Daniel Craig and had a toy and it's called the cognitive continuum from insight

918
00:56:18.611 --> 00:56:22.170
to enlightenment.
A all about what I was,
how there's this,

919
00:56:22.210 --> 00:56:26.800
there's these insight experiences,
flow experiences,
a psychedelic experiences,

920
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:29.020
awakening experiences,
enlightened experience,

921
00:56:29.110 --> 00:56:32.830
and trying to break cognitive science to that and make sense of it in a coherent

922
00:56:32.831 --> 00:56:34.420
fashion.
So those are both coming up this year.

923
00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:39.090
<v 5>Okay.
Awesome,
man.
I look forward to all of that.
Okay.
All right.
Well,
thank you.</v>

924
00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:41.850
Thank you.
You too.
