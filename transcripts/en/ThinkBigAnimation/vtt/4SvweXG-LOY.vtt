00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.640
Last slide I wanted to leave you with,
which is sort of coincidence,

2
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.020
CEO pause a tarp,

3
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.050
fun because it will bomb some and exalt others is the one thing that I could

4
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.580
learn from psychedelics that seems secure over all the decades and the,

5
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.330
you know,
embracing one idea,
one in theology after another.

6
00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:35.331
The one thing that seems secure is a truth that is hard to hear in the context

7
00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:42.520
of a dominator culture with the obsession with the material world and,

8
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.530
and that truth is that nothing lasts,

9
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.190
nothing lasts.
You know,

10
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.020
your enemies will fade,
your friends will fade,

11
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.910
your fortune,
your poverty,
your disappointments,
your dreams,

12
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.620
everything is in the process of changing into something else.

13
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.030
So your agony is about to be a suede.
On the other hand,

14
00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:13.270
your happiness is about to be destroyed.
So the,

15
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.380
the obligation that comes out of this realization is an obligation to the date

16
00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:24.150
of the immediate moment to this thing that I've been calling the felt moment of

17
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:26.100
immediate experience.

18
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.370
It isn't who you were or what you were,

19
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.580
or who you will be or what you will be.

20
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.700
It's the felt moment of immediate experience.

21
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:40.701
And this has been robbed from a spike media and by our tendency to denegrade

22
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.220
ourselves to see the world in terms of the great ones,

23
00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:51.870
not here,
whoever they are,
Aristotle,
Madonna,
Jesus,

24
00:01:51.871 --> 00:01:55.020
whatever your particular band is.
Um,

25
00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.090
the overcoming of neurosis,
of unhappiness,

26
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.520
of toxic lifestyles is,
uh,

27
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.570
the felt presence of the media experience in the bonding in the moment.

28
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.760
And you know,
psychedelics sexuality,

29
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.750
guess draw on the main sport,
dance.

30
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.780
These are the things which puts you in the felt presence of the moment.

31
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.550
And that's really all you ever possessed.

32
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.250
Your memories are eroding away.

33
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.530
The futures you anticipate will mostly not come to pass.

34
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.090
And the real richness is in the moment.

35
00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:44.091
And it's not necessarily some kind of be here now feel good thing because it

36
00:02:44.461 --> 00:02:48.390
doesn't always feel good,
but it always feels,

37
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.090
it is a domain of feeling.

38
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.760
It's primary language is not,

39
00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:56.940
the primary ideology is not primary.

40
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.300
The propagation of future and past vectors is not primary.

41
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.350
What's primary is the felt,

42
00:03:03.351 --> 00:03:07.210
the presence of experience of that is the source of love.

43
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.350
And that is the source of community.

44
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.330
<v 2>Yeah.</v>
