How do you know if a girl likes you?
I see a lot of videos like this out there,

2
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.490
and to be honest,
almost all of them totally suck.

3
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.990
All focus on these strange abstract body language cues like,
Oh,

4
00:00:19.991 --> 00:00:22.270
if she touches her hair,
it means this,
or Oh,

5
00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:25.180
if her feet are pointing towards you,
it means this.
Yes,

6
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.840
a girl who likes you might touch her hair,
she might point her feet towards you.

7
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.350
Maybe her hair was literally just in her face and she wanted to move it.

8
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.190
Maybe it is just anatomically normal for a girl's feet to be pointing towards

9
00:00:36.191 --> 00:00:40.450
you when she's talking.
Yes,
there are signs she might give if she likes you,

10
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.720
but let me introduce you to the only thing that matters in the bigger picture.

11
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.670
What is her attention drawn to?

12
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.520
There's a part of your brain called the reticular activation system or your Ras.

13
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.020
This is your selective focus and determines what your attention is drawn to.

14
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.100
<v 0>Okay?</v>

15
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.671
<v 1>As humans,</v>

16
00:00:57.671 --> 00:01:01.870
our attention is naturally drawn to what has value to us and when you're sitting

17
00:01:01.871 --> 00:01:05.650
in a restaurant hungry and your friend is talking and a plate of delicious

18
00:01:05.651 --> 00:01:07.480
fragrant smelling food gets walked by,

19
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.970
your focus will be drawn to it like a magnet.

20
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.420
This is the same with our social relationships.

21
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.790
We're drawn to people that have value to us.

22
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.730
Think about how you react to the different people in your life.

23
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.910
If you run into a guy trying to sell you you sneakers on the street,

24
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.730
you're probably not going to feel very compelled to talk to that guy.

25
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.460
But if that same person was handing out hundred dollar bills,

26
00:01:27.461 --> 00:01:28.900
you'd feel very drawn to him.

27
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.780
When you've been friends with someone for a long time,

28
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.290
a lot of social value has been built up.
You are willing to put up with behavior.

29
00:01:35.291 --> 00:01:37.480
You probably wouldn't from someone you just met,

30
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.030
and if you are attracted to someone,

31
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.960
your attention will naturally be drawn to them.
When they speak,

32
00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:46.930
you listen and in a room full of people,
they stand out.

33
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.180
Our attention will always be drawn to value.

34
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.000
So fat girl's attention is constantly drawn to you.

35
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.190
That means you have value to her.

36
00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.830
One of the most important things to realize about social interactions is that

37
00:01:59.831 --> 00:02:02.260
one person is always reacting more to the other.

38
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.830
One person is at the cause and one person is at the effect.

39
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.890
It can be really subtle or it can be really obvious.

40
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.670
It could be this person is reacting 51% and this person is reacting 49% or it

41
00:02:14.861 --> 00:02:18.160
could be 90% to 10% but in almost every scenario,

42
00:02:18.161 --> 00:02:22.270
one person is reacting more to the other.
As a general rule of life,

43
00:02:22.271 --> 00:02:25.600
you don't want your emotions to be at the whim of whatever people say or do

44
00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:26.434
around you.

45
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.070
Your happiness should be deeply rooted in a fundamental knowledge of self,

46
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.510
of who you are.
At your core.

47
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.170
You want to be that grounding source of energy for people around you.

48
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.180
So notice if for focus constantly seems to hone in on what you have to say.

49
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.630
If in a room full of people,
her attention constantly finds you.

50
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.240
If he's laughing at your jokes that aren't that funny,

51
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.490
her Ras per selective focus has zoned in on you because you have value to her

52
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.180
and whatever you say has value purely because you are the one saying it.

53
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.750
Now,
I want you guys to be aware of this,

54
00:02:58.751 --> 00:03:02.950
but please do not overblow this in your mind.
Be aware of it,

55
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.090
but don't be constantly worrying.
Oh,
is their focus on me now,
what about now?

56
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.230
One important thing I want to say is that whether or not you see the things we

57
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:14.080
talked about in this video,
if you liked this girl,

58
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:17.320
I want you to ask her out no matter what and when you do ask her,

59
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.760
it's no big deal.

60
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.810
Hopefully you are a guide that is used to having women around him.
If not,

61
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.370
please just try and act like it for 10 seconds.
She could take it or leave it.

62
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.870
It's no big deal.
If she says no.
If you get rejected,

63
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:34.540
quote unquote,
you're not going to take it all personally.

64
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.430
This girl doesn't owe you anything.
This world doesn't owe you anything.

65
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.610
You're not coming to this person with an empty cup saying,
oh,

66
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.240
please give me the good emotions.
Please make me feel okay about myself.

67
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.140
You're coming to this person with a cup that is overflowing.

68
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.590
You're looking to share your positive emotions.

69
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.220
You're looking to give your gift to the world.
If she wants to be a part of it,

70
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.870
awesome.
If she doesn't,
awesome as well.
Your Cup is already full.

71
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.220
You feel amazing no matter what.
So like I said,

72
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.050
with any of the signs of how to tell if a girl likes you,
be aware of it,

73
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.240
but don't try too hard to focus on it.

74
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.840
A girl could give you every one of these signs and not be interested.

75
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.410
She can give you none of these signs and secretly be in love with you.

76
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.650
And the only way to know is to put yourself out there and find out.
