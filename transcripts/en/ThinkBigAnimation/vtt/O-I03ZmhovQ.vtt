1
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.100
Let's see,
we take your average person has no real unique personality.

2
00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:08.934
Your traits,

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.410
their lives and decisions are based either on biological impulse or an

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.760
uncritical acceptance of social values.
The reactions are not unique.

5
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.290
The lath at weddings and cry at funerals all based on what is accepted in a

6
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:23.400
social context.

7
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.660
Their life has been shaped by immediate and an education system that does not

8
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:32.661
value individual expression and real examination Dubroski causes level one and a

9
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:36.120
significant majority of the population falls under this category.

10
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.550
Then on the other hand,
we have what he calls level five the visionaries,

11
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.430
the Nelson Mandela's and the Martin Luther kings at the world.

12
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.930
Nearly every action they take is in line with their core values and unique way

13
00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:49.764
they see the world.

14
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.150
Truly visionary works are only created by people who were unrestrained and

15
00:00:54.151 --> 00:00:57.570
social conviction,
deep strong acts of creative expression,

16
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.600
usually from action art or social change.

17
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.130
And then we have everyone else who is somewhere in between on both levels,

18
00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:05.671
one to five.

19
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:09.570
There's a little internal conflict for level five that just because their

20
00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:12.150
actions almost always aligned with their views online.

21
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.810
There was no internal turmoil because all decisions are based on,

22
00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:20.811
well thought out hierarch go values on level one their actions are often self

23
00:01:21.451 --> 00:01:26.380
advancement but they can always be justified either by a social norm like ice

24
00:01:26.381 --> 00:01:30.810
speed because everyone else speeds or through the mindset of the ends justifies

25
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:35.250
the means and we see this all the time and leaders,
politicians,

26
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.330
it on TV shows like game of Thrones and house of cards at this level,

27
00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:41.760
self advancement comes before all else.

28
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.660
This is something I saw a lot while I was working in sales.

29
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.440
There wasn't even a second thought given to misleading or misrepresenting the

30
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:53.720
truth in order to make a sale and it could always be justified by,
oh,

31
00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:57.420
I have to hit my sales numbers in order to keep my job or something like,
Oh,

32
00:01:57.421 --> 00:01:59.280
this guy drove up in a Rolls Royce.

33
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.570
He can afford it on level one because their values are shaped by culture.

34
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.800
They will only stay ethical as long as the society holds an ethical standard.

35
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.370
Where it gets interesting is between levels two through four.

36
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.830
This is where real personal struggle and existential crises begin to happen at

37
00:02:16.831 --> 00:02:21.480
level two many of the status quo explanations for the way things are learned

38
00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:24.990
through traditional education began to collapse under individual scrutiny.

39
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.640
They begin to see the gap between where the world could be in where it is right

40
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:33.300
now.
Common behaviors and ethics come to be seen as inadequate,

41
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.950
wrong or hypocritical.

42
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.510
Crises like these represent a strong potential for personal growth.

43
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.230
This person can now move ahead with careful examination of the world and their

44
00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:48.120
own value system or the social and internal pressure can cause them to fall back

45
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:48.954
into level one.

46
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.600
Transitioning from level two to three you begin to compare and contrast actual

47
00:02:54.601 --> 00:02:58.170
behavior.
Most people to a higher idealize choice.

48
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.190
Your authentic self will always choose the higher path is the clear and obvious

49
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:08.140
one to follow.
If this person's behavior fall short of the ideal.

50
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.920
There was internal disharmony in the are driven to review and reconstruct their

51
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:13.570
behavior to fit the ideal.

52
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.900
This is the point where you were like neo taking the red pill.

53
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.430
If you advance pass level three you can no longer go back to seeing the world

54
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:22.264
the way you used to.

55
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.940
It's a person does not have what Dobrosky calls enough developmental potential

56
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:29.050
to move past this point.

57
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.440
They will again fall back into level two and didn't level one

58
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.760
at level four a person takes full control of their development in voluntary

59
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:44.050
spontaneous reactions to stimulus or replaced by a conscious and self directed

60
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:44.884
view of life.

61
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.360
Old views of life are replaced by carefully thought out and examined ideals.

62
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.110
If a common social convention is seen as appropriate,

63
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.060
the person continues to accept it.

64
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.450
On the other hand is social norm can be reviewed and replaced by a self

65
00:03:58.451 --> 00:03:59.770
perceived higher value.

66
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:04.570
One these individuals have a feeling of responsibility that extends to just

67
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:05.404
about everything.

68
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.740
This theory states that not all people have the potential to advance through all

69
00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:14.680
five levels.
In fact,

70
00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:18.460
most people will only get as far as level two unable to handle their existential

71
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:19.294
crisis.

72
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.290
They get integrated back into level one where they can seek comfort in the hive

73
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:25.110
mind or group.
Think Paradigm.

74
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.300
The most evident characteristic of people who have high developmental potential

75
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.310
is what he calls over excitability or how intensely that person experiences day

76
00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:41.170
to day emotions.
The more over excitability a person has,

77
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.690
the more intensely they experience day to day life.

78
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.340
They feel the extreme highs and lows of joy and sorrow more profoundly.

79
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.910
There are often driven by their emotions and have a powerful perception of the

80
00:04:51.911 --> 00:04:56.080
world.
They are more prone to experience an angst,
anxiety and depression,

81
00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.700
and this is why his theory is called positive personality disintegration.

82
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.510
The more stress and turmoil a person is exposed to,

83
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.090
the more potential there personality has to develop.

84
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.170
The whole person on level five will face a little internal conflict.

85
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.920
Most likely they will experience a lot of resistance externally.

86
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.330
They do not care about how their actions are perceived by the outside world and

87
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:19.961
because of that,

88
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:23.440
they will probably face pressure to conform to society's standards.

89
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.880
Debraski says,
a person who's over excitability is high enough,

90
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.520
will undergo personality disintegration.

91
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.900
Despite any social or family efforts to stop it is can often place the person in

92
00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:39.280
great peril with many brilliant minds ending up exiled,
assassinated,

93
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.030
or burnt at the stake
Dubroski called over excitability.

94
00:05:44.031 --> 00:05:45.020
A tragic gift.

95
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.730
People who feel emotions more intensely are naturally going to experience great

96
00:05:49.731 --> 00:05:51.200
highs and tragic lows.

97
00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.610
They will face much internal and external conflict is their personality
develops.

98
00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.820
The stress causes will drive personal growth,

99
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.480
but can actually result in suicide from people who can't handle their world

100
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:03.500
being turned upside down.

101
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.870
People with high potential for development have to walk their own path often at

102
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:13.070
the expense of fitting in.
Joseph Campbell said in nights quest for the grail.

103
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.710
If a path exists in the forest,

104
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.100
don't follow it for though it took someone else to the grill.

105
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.410
It will not take you because it is not here.
