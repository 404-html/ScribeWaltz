00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.730
When you're seeing a woman who you're looking to approach,

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.160
you know you have the desire to approach her,

3
00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:08.010
but your emotions aren't backing you up and your body's slowing you down.

4
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.110
What it is that you're being stifled in due to impulse control.

5
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.720
So what I do is I call it proof,
not promises.

6
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.680
You want to view your brain as a horse and you have to be good at tricking the

7
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:21.450
horse into doing what you wanted to do.

8
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.250
Everything that I do on a day to day basis is constantly me tricking my brain.

9
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.790
I trick my brain now I feel an insightful just by maybe doing a little bit of

10
00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:35.790
silly stuff.
It's like a shell that you break out of.
Okay.

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.220
I used to do exercises with students.
I don't do this anymore.

12
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:39.180
I was afraid I'd get in trouble,

13
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.970
but I literally make them take their shirt off and run through the streets
going,

14
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:45.600
I'm free.
I'm free.
Or like put it on,
put a shirt on like a Ninja Masters Walker.

15
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:49.170
I'd be like,
God,
like you're like running through the streets.

16
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.890
Some of the best moments of my life.
We're doing that.
It's exhilarating.

17
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.280
I got to tell you,
because what happens is that you'll feel your body going,
no,

18
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.160
no,
no,
like this.

19
00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:01.200
And then because you're doing something so dramatic like running around

20
00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:03.960
shirtless or running out the Ninja mask on your head and had to have like my

21
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:07.380
boots on my feet and start doing like Ninja poses and shit is completely
bizarre.

22
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.630
It was just social experience.
But it taught me something.

23
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.150
But what happened is I feel like,
no,
no,
no.

24
00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:14.280
And then all of a sudden my brain would go,
he's doing this,

25
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.650
this mother fuckers doing this.
Let's make it better because it's going to do it.

26
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.480
And so it's almost like,
you know,

27
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.090
you're thinking of climbing a mountain and your brain is like,
no,
no,

28
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.730
don't climb the mountain.
Don't lend them out.
Look,
look down.
It looks so scary.

29
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.900
You know,
you look down and get all scared.

30
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.090
But if he just forced her and you start climbing that mountain,

31
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.600
all of a sudden your brain shifts lenses and it's like maybe the climbing the

32
00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:36.660
mountains.
Fun Dude,
that shit down there.
Don't even worry about that.

33
00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:37.390
There's the next rock,

34
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.350
there's the next rock and you start to focus on the upside.
You start to go up.

35
00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:43.950
Your brain actually shifts lenses in terms of what is focusing on.

36
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.400
Here's what my brain led me to do.
It led me to have success barriers.

37
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.930
It led me not to approach women.

38
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.100
It led me to be a coward and led me to be depressed.
It led me to make excuses.

39
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.370
It fucked my life up.
My brain's default pattern is like this,

40
00:01:56.371 --> 00:01:57.810
like garden full of weeds.

41
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.540
I've personally found that my brain will grow weeds and I have to plug the

42
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:03.840
fucking weeds at times.
I will brow beat myself if I fucked up.

43
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.650
I will sit around and beating myself up for a while and think how I'll change,

44
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.330
but I don't brow beat myself for no reason.

45
00:02:09.331 --> 00:02:11.730
I don't just probably myself like I'm dumb.
I'm dumb,
I'm dumb.
I'll be like,

46
00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:14.700
know what I'm doing right now is fucking perfect.
This is a guy damn joke.

47
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.630
How like change.
What would I change a week ago?
What would I change a month ago?

48
00:02:18.631 --> 00:02:20.580
What would I change to your ago?
And I reflect on that as a man.

49
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.690
I think you have to have a nice like that.

50
00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:24.360
You have to have nice like where you just sit around and think about it.

51
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.660
You know?
Like if I,
if I do something wrong,

52
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.260
sometimes I'll take an afternoon off like three or four hours and I'll sit alone

53
00:02:31.261 --> 00:02:33.900
in a room and I will ruminate on what I did wrong.

54
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.780
That's healthy because that's going to say you got the ship,

55
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:40.950
it's on autopilot and you spend those couple hours turning the writer to go

56
00:02:40.951 --> 00:02:44.190
somewhere else.
That's healthy.
I have days like that regularly.

57
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.550
If your brain is giving you a hard time,

58
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.740
little do you realize your brands giving you a hard time.

59
00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:52.050
It could mean that by the time that you actually team the damn thing,

60
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.590
it's going to be amazing.
You know?
It could be amazing.

61
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.800
Like I probably have some kind of light autism or or something.
I don't know.

62
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.670
I don't really know.
And what does that mean?
I mean,
people are like,
what?

63
00:03:02.671 --> 00:03:04.810
What does that mean?
Like you're like autism.
Oh my God.
What does that mean?

64
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:08.260
It means that you think with depth,
not breadth.
That's all it means.

65
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.790
It doesn't mean I'm walking over a toilet go like that.
That's an,

66
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.650
that's a more extreme case in the spectrum on a light case on the spectrum,

67
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.890
you just see things deeply.
You dissect things deeply.
That's in my brain does.

68
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:19.930
My brain is always going deep all the time.

69
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.500
I'm either present in the moment which case everything's Nice and light or I'm

70
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.860
pulling shit apart.
Thinking of all different directions,
a shit.

71
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.660
Some people would call that bad.

72
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.030
It was bad for me cause I couldn't socialize for 20 years.

73
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.630
But now that I figured out how to work it,
I have an advantage.

74
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.300
I'd like to see somebody who doesn't have a brain like mine,

75
00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:40.630
tried to do what I'm doing and be tough and it'll keep switching on more and

76
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:44.020
more.
Your intelligence.
If you,
if you keep reading great books,

77
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.560
put healthy shit in your body,
challenge yourself,
put yourself through stress,

78
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:50.950
try different things.
Your brain will keep switching on more and more and more.

79
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.970
But the last thing I'd say on this topic is look at what I'm doing here,

80
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.860
how it's focused on thriving and not coping.

81
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.550
So you could look at what I'm saying.
It'd be like,
oh,
this is a little much,

82
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:03.460
just a little heavy.
I mean clearly it's not for everybody,

83
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.780
but what I found was you want to know the best way to get out of your petty

84
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:12.130
problems,
get better problems,
start thinking bigger,

85
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.900
and then this other shit will seem small.
The problem with a lot of dudes,

86
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.200
they're not thinking very big and if you're not thinking big,

87
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.380
then anxiety over approaching a woman is very real and pervasive and consuming

88
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.200
and that you can tell the size of a man by the size of his problems.
So man,

89
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:34.600
who's very upset and overwhelmed by a small problem,

90
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.700
it's probably a man was smaller ambitions and a smaller circle of concerns as

91
00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:40.570
Steven Covey would call it.

92
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.250
Because I was walking around in such an angry any state for so many years.

93
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.020
I actually found a lot of relief in thinking it actually paradoxically made my

94
00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:50.854
life easier.

95
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.350
It made my life less pain by thinking bigger because now I'm afraid to approach

96
00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:59.950
that girl.
Huh?
Well,
I've got a lot bigger shit to worry about the most.
Let's go.

97
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.420
So that's what I think is like a thriving as opposed to coping and coping.

98
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:06.640
Everything seems like a big deal.
Oh,
I'm feeling bad today.

99
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.010
That's another big thing is rapping with,

100
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.950
it's like everything I'm talking to you guys about is about thriving now.
Coping

101
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.190
don't need to do to be happy.
You can be in coping and be happy again.

102
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.990
You're carbon.
Flip your phone,
have a good little wink.
Good can be happy.

103
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.570
But to me it happened to send the bar low.
You know,

104
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:26.050
people say happiness is the ultimate.
You're making happiness too complicated.

105
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.560
Look your fucking phone.
You'd be happy.
You don't have guys like you.

106
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.550
I just want to get,
you know,
I just want to get a job at subway.
Dude,

107
00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:36.430
how about this?
Stop worrying about the job is subway,
let's by the subway.

108
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.510
Then you can put the fucking little paper had on hire yourself.
You don't,
right.

109
00:05:40.511 --> 00:05:43.760
So it's like you get bigger,
you get bigger,
think bigger,
and then,

110
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.940
and then you're going to a different paradigm.
Like what was it,

111
00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:46.900
Einstein or someone like,

112
00:05:46.901 --> 00:05:48.820
you can't solve the problem in the paradigm of which was created,

113
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.250
go to higher paradigm.
So yeah,
I just,
I love the concept of thriving.

114
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.410
I don't think driving is necessary to be happy.
I think you'd be happy.

115
00:05:57.411 --> 00:05:58.221
I did a lot of people that are,

116
00:05:58.221 --> 00:05:59.570
that are coping through life that are still happy,

117
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.240
but I think you'd be happy anyway,

118
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.990
but then you could thrive just cause just if you want it just to be wanted,

119
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.570
that's it.
No need to,
no need to.
