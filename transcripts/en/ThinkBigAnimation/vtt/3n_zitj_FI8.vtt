1
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.100
In Leo Tolstoy novel the death of Ivan Illich.

2
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.020
Ivan is mounting a step ladder to hang some drapes when he slips and Bang

3
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.530
Society against the window frame.
The injury does not seem serious,

4
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.860
but his health a slowly deteriorates more and more.

5
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.610
Until Ivan Ilitch realizes that he is going to die,

6
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.480
we're all going to die.
That is the truth that we all know,

7
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.500
but we knew it in a very abstract way.
We knew it in the same way.

8
00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:38.050
We know that the earth rotates on an axis.

9
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.070
We know it in a way that has no effect on our day to day lives.

10
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.760
It is not until death has brought to the forefront of our attention that it

11
00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:47.890
becomes an unavoidable reality.

12
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.620
Socrates was very concerned with the moral complacency he saw in his fellow

13
00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:57.790
Athenian citizens.
He watched as they live their lives in a selfish,

14
00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.320
unreflective Hayes.

15
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.890
His solution was to act as a moral gadfly,

16
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.340
stinging his fellow citizens and to self-examination.

17
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.430
Socrates stood in the marketplace daily,

18
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.440
forcing anyone he encounter to reflect on their lives,
beliefs and motivations.

19
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.680
Socrates is trying to make himself and others realize in the clearest possible

20
00:01:19.751 --> 00:01:23.830
way how much our lives are geared towards self deceptive and self destructive

21
00:01:23.831 --> 00:01:24.664
behavior.

22
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.990
He wanted us to know this like Ivan knew he was going to die after the accident.

23
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.540
This led to was development of a Linkous,

24
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.530
an intense form of dialog we now refer to as the Socratic method

25
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.100
in ancient Greece.
The temple of Apollo was home to the Pythia,

26
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.270
also known as the Oracle at Delphi who is believed to have a direct line of

27
00:01:46.271 --> 00:01:50.050
contact with the gods.
If you're in the oracle business,

28
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.470
it is smart to word your prophecies as vaguely as possible.

29
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.430
You want your words to sound profound without committing yourself to any direct

30
00:01:57.431 --> 00:01:59.380
answer.
Because of this,

31
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.100
when his friends traveled to the temple of Apollo and asked the Pythia,

32
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.380
is there anyone wiser than Socrates,

33
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.730
the must have been surprised to hear there is no human being wiser than

34
00:02:09.731 --> 00:02:13.780
Socrates.
When this news reached Socrates ears,
he fought the gods.

35
00:02:13.781 --> 00:02:17.830
Must've made a mistake since he knew very well that he was not wise,

36
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.890
but he also knew the gods do not make mistakes.

37
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.270
This became a grand mystery and it launched him on his lifelong quest.

38
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.720
He sought out every person who made claims to wisdom.

39
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.600
He would converse with them,
ask them questions,

40
00:02:31.601 --> 00:02:34.930
and try to uncover if indeed there were as wise as they claimed.

41
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.980
The most notable of these interactions were with two groups of thinkers,

42
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.770
the natural philosophers and the sophists.

43
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.540
We will use the first natural philosopher Bailey's as an example for this

44
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.393
viewpoints.

45
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.980
Instead of attempting to explain the world around him through mythology,

46
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.000
dailies tried to explain natural phenomenon by theories and hypotheses.

47
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.830
Dailies believed that the originating principle of nature and the essence of was

48
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:04.210
a single material substance.
Water on the surface.

49
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.590
We know this is not true,

50
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.620
but it is the change in the way of thinking that is important.

51
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:12.760
Here they lived in Greece,
which is surrounded by water.

52
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.610
Water falls from the sky and allows us to live,

53
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.710
dig into the earth and we find water.
Every living creature requires water.

54
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.630
It is a very plausible idea.

55
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.840
One could reach the reasoning and observing the world around them.

56
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.030
It is very different from the type of thinking you would find from an oracle who

57
00:03:30.031 --> 00:03:33.430
would explain every natural phenomenon through the will of the gods.

58
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.200
The main takeaway is that families and the natural philosophers after him,

59
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.610
we're using rational reflection and observation and attempts to find some

60
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.710
underlying structure to reality.

61
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.170
Socrates became impressed by thinkers like these,
but he ultimately rejects it.

62
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:51.004
They have wisdom.

63
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.730
He felt that this type of knowledge isn't wisdom because it doesn't enable you

64
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:58.900
to become a good person.
It has no existential relevance.

65
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.190
It does not instruct us on how to overcome the self destructive and self

66
00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:07.030
deceptive behavior.
Socrates felt was so prominent in Athens.

67
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.230
Socrates enjoys rational knowledge as much as the next guy,

68
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.210
but he doesn't find wisdom or the capacity for self transcendence within it.

69
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.850
The second group he encountered where the Sophos mini sophos specialize in the

70
00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:22.870
use of rhetoric,

71
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.760
which is the art of using speech to enhance the ability to convince and persuade

72
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.080
a skill that had become incredibly important in the democracy of Athens.

73
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.790
To understand why Socrates ultimately rejected the ideals of the Sophos.

74
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:40.720
We will analyze the philosopher Harry Frankfurt's essay on bullshit.

75
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.010
Frankfurt says that there is a fundamental difference between bullshitting and

76
00:04:45.011 --> 00:04:49.000
lying.
The liar tries to get you to believe something is true when it is not.

77
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.260
They are relying on the fact that you want to know the truth and they use your

78
00:04:53.261 --> 00:04:55.630
commitment to truth as a means of deception.

79
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.390
The bullshit artists does something different.

80
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.590
They direct your attention in a way that makes you no longer care about whether

81
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:04.300
something is true or false.

82
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.220
The bullshit artists is no longer concerned with truth,
but with salience,

83
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.250
salience is how things stand out to us.

84
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.910
We can bullshit ourselves because we can direct our attention.

85
00:05:15.911 --> 00:05:20.830
So certain things become more salient.
With the rhetoric of the Sophos,

86
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.540
I can make something relevant to you without you having to believe or even care

87
00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:26.374
if it is true.

88
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.020
Socrates felt that through the practice of the Sophos salients and what people

89
00:05:32.021 --> 00:05:34.840
find relevant were being separated from truth.

90
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.070
What grabs people's attention is no longer leading them to what is true and

91
00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:43.090
Socrates felt that there was something deeply deceptive and immoral about this

92
00:05:43.091 --> 00:05:43.924
practice.

93
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.970
Socrates believe the natural philosophers provided truth without relevance and

94
00:05:48.971 --> 00:05:53.971
the Sophos provided relevance without truth was Socrates wanted was both.

95
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.090
He wanted a rational pursuit of truth that has transformative relevance to the

96
00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:02.750
individual.
He was after the type of truth that can make you wise.

97
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.190
He wanted what grabs our attention to also track what is truthful and this is

98
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:09.410
why he developed his practice of a Linkous.

99
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.130
He would sit in the marketplace for hours and ask everyone he encountered

100
00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:16.010
questions which seemed innocuous at first,

101
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.540
but at each answer he would dig deeper and deeper into why they do the things

102
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:21.260
they do.

103
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.400
Until the person reaches a state of APP Poria or a point in which they are

104
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:28.760
forced to step back and say,
I don't know.

105
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.050
Socrates wants to shock us out of our day to day thinking.

106
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.370
He wants us to realize that the way we are living is perfectly set up for

107
00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:41.900
bullshit and self deception because the things that motivate and attract us

108
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.330
massively outstrips our understanding of them.

109
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.970
This discourse of his was disruptive to many and eventually led him to be

110
00:06:49.971 --> 00:06:54.140
arrested on charges of rejecting the gods of the state and corrupting the youth

111
00:06:54.141 --> 00:06:56.330
of Athens at his trial.

112
00:06:56.331 --> 00:07:00.590
Socrates is basically told that if he stops philosophizing in this way,

113
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:01.790
he will be able to live,

114
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.530
which led to his now famous claim that the unexamined life is not worth living.

115
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.240
If we do not think and become aware of our self deceptive tendencies,

116
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.160
then we are trapped in the mundane world and remain incapable of transcending

117
00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:17.750
our self destructive behavior.

118
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.310
He knows this to be true and is willing to die for that truth.

119
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.620
Unlike the natural philosophers,

120
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.200
he's not making any claims about the natural world.

121
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:31.580
He's making a claim about our individual experience and how each of us can live

122
00:07:31.581 --> 00:07:32.960
a more meaningful life.

123
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.010
Socrates comes to the realization that the gods were right,

124
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:42.050
that he was the wisest human being.
Only because he knows that he knows nothing.

125
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.840
Most of us know that we don't know a lot,

126
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.040
but we know it in a way that Ivan Ilitch knew he was going to die before the

127
00:07:49.041 --> 00:07:53.930
accident.
We don't know it as a constant and ever present reality.

128
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.970
Socrates claimed to be the midwife of new ideas because while this type of

129
00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:03.020
thinking was a difficult labor,
if one is willing to pass through it,

130
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:07.810
they can give birth to a new way of being,
and the court of Athens,

131
00:08:07.811 --> 00:08:12.220
after Socrates is found guilty,
each side gets to suggest their own punishment.

132
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:14.710
The accusers proposed the death penalty,

133
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.410
but Socrates suggests something different.

134
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.270
He says that because this life of philosophy has kept him impoverished and cost

135
00:08:22.271 --> 00:08:25.510
him so much time and energy in service of other people,

136
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.310
that he should not receive a punishment,

137
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.960
but the reward of free housing and food so he can do even more service to Athens

138
00:08:31.961 --> 00:08:35.790
with his philosophy,
the court,
Moses Silver,
and decides,
okay,

139
00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:44.670
in doing this,
Socrates was leaving the people of Athens.
The one final lesson.

140
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.940
Since we cannot know what awaits us after this life,

141
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.330
we have no way of knowing if it is better or worse than what we were

142
00:08:51.331 --> 00:08:56.220
experiencing now.
And if that is the case,
once you not compromise integrity

143
00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.090
<v 3>in fear of death,
because death is nothing to be feed.</v>
