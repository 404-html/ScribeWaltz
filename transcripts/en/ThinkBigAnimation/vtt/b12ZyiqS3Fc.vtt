1
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.760
The ability to imitate.

2
00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:15.200
It's more of the great evolutionary advantages of our species through imitation.

3
00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:17.450
We learn how to speak a hunt and built,

4
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.290
but there comes a time when imitation fall short and for better or worse,

5
00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:23.870
we are left to plow the soil at her own feet.

6
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.420
What we admire about great minds like Shakespeare play to in Milton,

7
00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:29.810
they said they spoke now what was true of their time,

8
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.550
but what was true to themselves.

9
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.840
They had the courage to follow their own thoughts and their own convictions to

10
00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:40.160
trust in our own intuition and that spontaneous insight which flashes across

11
00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:42.620
each of our minds.
That is genius.

12
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.490
Yet all too often we dismiss these thoughts simply because they are our own.

13
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.250
Instead of owning up to our brilliance,
we give it all away.

14
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.360
In every work of genius we find our own discarded thoughts and with shame,

15
00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:56.930
we must take it from another what we have thought and felt the whole time

16
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.850
American writers,

17
00:00:58.851 --> 00:01:02.990
Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau where the central figures behind the

18
00:01:02.991 --> 00:01:07.220
transcendentalist movement and the 1830s it was an idealistic philosophy

19
00:01:07.221 --> 00:01:10.100
developed not to oppose the empirical method of science,

20
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.980
but rather to focus on the power of the individual.

21
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.910
Emerson and Thoreau expanded on the system of thought developed by and Manual

22
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.280
Kahn who believe that to understand the nature of reality,

23
00:01:19.281 --> 00:01:23.000
one must first examine the reasoning process which governs the nature of

24
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:24.020
experience.

25
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.920
One of the key beliefs of transcendentalism is that there's a divinity which

26
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:32.180
pervades all nature and all humanity as well as a belief in the inherent

27
00:01:32.181 --> 00:01:34.220
goodness which exists in all people.

28
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.220
They believe that society and its institutions,

29
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.570
particularly organized religion and political parties corrupt the purity of the

30
00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:45.400
individual.
They have faith that people are at their best when truly self,

31
00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:46.960
reliant and independent.

32
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.380
The great fear that tears us from the self trust is our apparent obligation to

33
00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:52.310
consistency.

34
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.240
The eyes of the crowd have no means for gauging our personality other than from

35
00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:59.660
our past actions and we are terrified to disappoint them.

36
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.950
We carry along this corpse of past action because it is the only way for us to

37
00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:07.850
find recognition in the eyes of the public to the self reliant individual.

38
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.610
The eyes of the crowd are of no significance.

39
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.770
Speak what you believe now and tomorrow.
Speak.

40
00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:17.510
Could you believe then you are sure to contradict yourself and thus you are sure

41
00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:18.590
to be misunderstood.

42
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.870
Pythagoras was misunderstood and Socrates and Jesus and Galileo and Newton in

43
00:02:23.871 --> 00:02:28.580
every pure and why spirit that has ever been greatness has no need to explain

44
00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:31.580
itself in the present.
It's loyalty is to the future.

45
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.750
It's journey is one of zigs and Zags,
moves and countermoves.

46
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.500
Actions and contradictions are apparently contradictory.

47
00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:44.030
Axar decisions can only truly be examined at the end when the entire corpus of

48
00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:48.290
our life's work can be taken in at once to exhibit originality is what's

49
00:02:48.291 --> 00:02:49.760
happened to our child.
Like nature.

50
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.600
Children are the perfect model of self-reliant behavior because they are too

51
00:02:53.601 --> 00:02:57.680
young to be hesitant and fearful.
They're possessed by a need for self discovery.

52
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.600
The applied their own to the world and have no care for how their actions are

53
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:03.070
interpreted by those around them.

54
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.780
This stands in sharp contrast with the attitude of cautious adults who because

55
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:12.010
they are overly concerned with reputation approval and the opinion of others

56
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.550
have great difficulty acting genuine knee or spontaneously.

57
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.550
The worst thing one can be in the crowd is inconsistent,

58
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.210
but it is inconsistency that we find the death of individuality.

59
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.880
Our culture gives us identity,

60
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.410
but at the same time it views our societal role as the totality of who we are.

61
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.570
It protects molds,
constraints and limits us all at the same time.

62
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.970
No matter how much your father,
your mother,

63
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:40.930
your friends or your culture may try the can never truly insulate you from

64
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:43.690
reality.
Instead,
we must serve,
rendered,

65
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.250
give incompletely to the temptation of discovery and our curiosity of the

66
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:51.010
unknown.
It is a path that must be walked alone,

67
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.910
but it requires only one thing to trust in yourself.

68
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.480
Like all the great minds of history.
I'm done.
In doing so,

69
00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:01.720
you will find that child like genius waiting to be discovered.

70
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.733
<v 0>Okay?</v>

71
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.850
<v 1>I know we've all had the same experience.</v>

72
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.140
You get home from a long day at work feeling absolutely exhausted.
You know,

73
00:04:15.141 --> 00:04:17.630
you should read a book or do something productive with your time,

74
00:04:17.631 --> 00:04:20.120
but all you want is to collapse and drift to sleep.

75
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.770
Then you remember your audible app and the fact that you have over 180,000

76
00:04:24.771 --> 00:04:26.450
titles right at your fingertips.

77
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.700
You can now drift away as the soothing narration of your favorite books slowly

78
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:31.960
laws you to sleep.

79
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.270
<v 2>Keep still,</v>

80
00:04:33.271 --> 00:04:38.271
he orders and slowly here search his top inside me,

81
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.470
like dating it allowed that are striking,

82
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.660
not fun.
