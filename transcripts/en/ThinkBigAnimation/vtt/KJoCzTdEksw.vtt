1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.143
Yeah.

2
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.340
There was a young artist who dropped out of school at the age of 16 his mother

3
00:00:12.341 --> 00:00:15.580
patiently urged him to get a job or learn a trade,
but to him,

4
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.850
this idea of daily work in submitting to authority was revolting.

5
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.990
His father had passed away and his mother could not convince him to do what she

6
00:00:22.991 --> 00:00:27.370
told.
He would spend his time wandering around his own city,
visiting museums,

7
00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:31.690
attending the opera and sitting by the river dreaming of becoming a great
artist.

8
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.570
He had a very fantastical view of the world.

9
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.410
He would borrow a large number of books from the library on history and Nordic

10
00:00:38.411 --> 00:00:42.760
mythology and let his mind get lost in his crazy imaginings of the world.

11
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.150
At the age of 17 he took his first trip to Vienna,

12
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.950
one of the most important centers of art,
music and old world European culture.

13
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.020
He was in thrall by the city's magnificent architecture here.

14
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.550
He dove deeply into his art.

15
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.310
He could draw detailed pictures from the memory of a building.

16
00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:03.250
He had only seen once a very rare skill to have,

17
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.060
but when he returned home he had little motivation to do well in school.

18
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.290
After dropping out,
he put all this hope into achieving greatness as an artist.

19
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.460
At the age of 18 he had rolled in the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts.

20
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.610
He had taken all his money and planned to live and study in Vienna.

21
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.110
He had taken a huge risk and stick his whole life on his belief in himself as an

22
00:01:23.111 --> 00:01:27.040
artist.
After taking the two day entrance exam,
he felt confident,

23
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.420
assured that he was going to get in,
but failure struck him like lightening.

24
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.620
His drawings were judged as unsatisfactory and he was told he had a lack of

25
00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:39.160
artistic talent with a notable lack of appreciation for the human form.

26
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.050
Shaken,
heartbroken and rejected.

27
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.430
He left Vienna and returned home planning to take the entrance exam next year,

28
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.190
but things didn't quite go to plan for him.

29
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.260
The next year he failed the exam again and his beloved mother died after a long

30
00:01:56.261 --> 00:01:57.160
battle with cancer.

31
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.670
It wasn't long before he ran out of money and was forced to live in homeless

32
00:02:00.671 --> 00:02:03.880
shelters and mince hostels.
He was a broken man,

33
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.010
rejected and told he wasn't good enough that his dreams would never come true

34
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.350
with not much left to turn to.
He enlisted in the army in war.

35
00:02:14.351 --> 00:02:17.260
He was able to get in glory.
He never achieved through his art.

36
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.460
He described war as the greatest of all experiences and he was praised by his

37
00:02:21.461 --> 00:02:25.960
commanders for his bravery after the war had ended and with no other real skills

38
00:02:25.961 --> 00:02:26.800
or education.

39
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.220
He remained in the military where they gave him an assignment to infiltrate the

40
00:02:30.221 --> 00:02:32.890
DAP or German Workers Party.

41
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.270
He quickly gained influence in the group and especially gay notoriety for his

42
00:02:37.271 --> 00:02:38.530
public speaking skills.

43
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.430
He proceeded to attract a larger and larger crowds to the parties events.

44
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.560
He soon got the DAP to change its name to the national German Workers Party or

45
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.870
you will probably know a better as the Nazi party.

46
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.130
He even designed the parties new banner and I think we all know where the story

47
00:02:54.131 --> 00:02:59.060
goes from here.
Most of us have two.

48
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.870
<v 1>The life we live and the unlived life within us between the two stands</v>

49
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:05.704
resistance,

50
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.820
that destructive force inside human nature that arises whenever we consider a

51
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:13.060
tough long term course of action that might actually do something that's good

52
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:17.470
for once.
We've all felt it.
If you've ever tried to quit a habit or addiction,

53
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.060
ever tried to start any creative or entrepreneurial venture or ever tried to

54
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:26.710
take up any act of moral,
political or ethical courage,
you have felt resistance.

55
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.930
Resistance can defeat any one of us and for Hitler it was literally easier to

56
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:35.050
start world war two than it was to face a blank square of canvas.

57
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.100
Everyday resistance beat him like it beats most the warrior and the artist live

58
00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:44.380
by the same code each day.
The battle must be fought anew.

59
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.870
The artist must prepare his mind for the long haul.

60
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.370
He knows if he caves to resistance,
he will be twice as likely to cave tomorrow.

61
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.490
The artist's gives resistance to utmost respect.

62
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.950
He knows it can defeat him on any given day.

63
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.350
Just as the need for a drink can overcome an alcoholic.

64
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.520
<v 0>All we can do is sit down and do the work day after day.</v>

65
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.010
When you look up at the clock hours later,

66
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.490
you will know I've put in my time and I hit it with all that I have,

67
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.560
and that is all that counts this day.
I have overcome resistance.
