00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.980
You talked a lot about meaning in life and how that's all been lost to us,

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.990
uh,
in our,
in our modern world.

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.830
Based on your work and maybe in like the attitude you see in your students.

4
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.580
Are you optimistic about regaining that meaning?
Yeah.
Okay.

5
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.030
I mean so well on most days but I need,

6
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:25.020
so again,
one of the things that's hopeful,

7
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:29.490
there's meaning in life is such a hot topic now in many aspects of cognitive

8
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:31.230
science.
It's a hot topic in philosophy,

9
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.650
very hot topic in psychology doing work on it.
My lab,

10
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.420
the consciousness and the wisdom study labs.

11
00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:40.980
We just did a huge m Turk study and we found that there's a significant,

12
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.770
I'd like to know,
not just statistically significant,

13
00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:47.210
but a significant correlation between,
um,

14
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.480
if people have mystical experience and how meaningful they rate their life and

15
00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:53.790
then,
and then trying to find out,
okay,

16
00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:58.320
what is it in the experiences sort of doing most of the heavy lifting and in

17
00:00:58.321 --> 00:01:03.000
this lines up with other work by someone's Samantha Hanselman and others that

18
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.350
it's sort of the insight,

19
00:01:04.351 --> 00:01:09.090
like machinery recognition is sort of this making coherence making sense,

20
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.133
right?

21
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.170
That's the level at which you can improve people's meaning in life.

22
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.320
And it,
it's,
it's,
it's being able to again,

23
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.380
trigger these kinds of experiences with reliable systems,

24
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.440
a steak or technologies that are set within an intellectually and culturally

25
00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:32.850
validated,
right.
Um,

26
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.280
worldview and framework that I think is doable for us now because I think,

27
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.140
I think all the pieces,

28
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.950
there's so many good people doing work on all of the pieces and we're,

29
00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:47.630
we're making pretty significant understanding and all the components and there

30
00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:50.480
is great.
And on the other side,
right.

31
00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:53.750
There's great cultural hunger for all of this stuff.

32
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.090
And so I see this confluence picking up speed.
Now I'm not,
I'm not,

33
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.840
I think there's,
I don't believe in destiny or anything like that.

34
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.600
And this can all go wrong in many ways because we're in a,

35
00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:10.570
we're in a very tight race.
Cars trying to get this addressed is,

36
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.200
is meshed up with other horrible things we're facing in our culture.

37
00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:17.450
Like there's political,
socioeconomic,

38
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.250
environmental issues that are pressing on us and a very urgent manner.
Well,

39
00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:25.580
one of the things he talked about is we had,
we used to have universities,

40
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.450
this is where we get knowledge and then we had other places where we'd get

41
00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:33.800
wisdom.
The monastery.
Yeah.
But now there's nowhere that we get wisdom anymore.

42
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.340
That's right.
I love to do that.
In the class I'll say,
well,
where do you go for,

43
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.620
for information or the Internet,
where do you go for knowledge?
You know,

44
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.190
the university science and where do you go for wisdom?

45
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.310
And then there's this and there's this stony silence.

46
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.590
Well then I want to say,
well,
you know,

47
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.260
foolishness is something much more than just ignorance,
right?
You know,

48
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.120
ignorance is just a lack of knowledge where it's foolishness is,
you know,

49
00:02:57.121 --> 00:02:59.070
you're caught up in,
you know,
a,

50
00:02:59.071 --> 00:03:02.140
a compelling pattern of self deception and self destruction.

51
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.690
And that requires a lot of intervention.

52
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:08.260
We know this because this is why we have therapists,
right?
Yeah.

53
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.480
It's unfortunate that we have sort of lost,

54
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.601
I don't know what to call it,

55
00:03:15.601 --> 00:03:20.280
the cultural commitment to making this a central issue that we,

56
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.570
uh,
aid people in their lives.
Like we just,
as a culture,
we're not doing that

57
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.480
and we're paying for it,
right?
We,
yeah.
We have a mental health crisis.

58
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.080
If you have all kinds of,
you know,
deaths of despair on the rise.
We,

59
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.270
we have people,
we have increasing,
um,
um,

60
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.900
sense of nihilism and cynicism and our culture.

61
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.400
It's eroding our political institutions at a very rapid rate.

62
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.450
All this kinds of stuff we're paying for ready.
