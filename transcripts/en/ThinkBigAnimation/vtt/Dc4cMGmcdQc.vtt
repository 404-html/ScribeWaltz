1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.340
I'm a professional MMA fighter when a record of far and 1:00 AM I'm an up and

2
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:11.730
coming fighter and without a doubt you will see me on the UFC in the near
future.

3
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.510
<v 1>Last year</v>

4
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.780
<v 2>I knew I was going to be the person to bring martial arts in the public eye.</v>

5
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.330
I know it's happening.
You know what I mean?

6
00:00:22.331 --> 00:00:24.700
There's two things I've learned from all from these past seven months.

7
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.600
Number one is the hard work pays off and number two is that dreams come true.

8
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.990
<v 4>If you go up to 100 people and ask them what they really want out of life,</v>

9
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.600
98 of them won't be able to tell you.

10
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.400
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.880
<v 4>You'll get a lot of answers like,
oh,
I just want to be happy,</v>

12
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.850
or I just want to be able to do what I love,

13
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.190
but most of them won't be able to give any concrete form to what they want and

14
00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:58.700
they definitely won't be able to give even the slightest indication of a plan to

15
00:00:58.701 --> 00:00:59.534
get it.

16
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:02.723
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

17
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.820
<v 0>so it's all I do.
I train twice a day.
That's all I think about.</v>

18
00:01:06.821 --> 00:01:10.000
It's just I don't want to do anything else.
It's as simple as that.

19
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.390
My dream was to be world champion.

20
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.600
The lightweight champion in the UFC have mom will need to have,

21
00:01:16.601 --> 00:01:20.560
I know what to deal with and have a great low for me,
my kids,
my grandkids,

22
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.480
everyone in my,
in my family,
everyone that's come up with me.
That's my dream.

23
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.300
<v 4>Back when Conor McGregor was first pursuing his love of mixed martial arts,</v>

24
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.790
he was told countless times how impractical it was.

25
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.590
No Man from Ireland had ever made it to the highest levels of fighting.

26
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.240
What made him think that he could be the first,
but Connor didn't care.

27
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.880
He not only knew exactly what he wanted,

28
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.110
but he carried himself like he already had it.
In his mind,

29
00:01:48.111 --> 00:01:49.910
the goal was already a wedding.
His claim,

30
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.610
he just had to execute so we could go and take it.

31
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.540
His desire was so strong at forced him to take continuous action towards his

32
00:01:57.541 --> 00:01:58.374
goals,

33
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.300
not knowing what one wants in life is one of the major causes of failure.

34
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.840
If you don't know what you want,
how can you ever expect to get it?

35
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.420
If you don't write down your goals,

36
00:02:16.421 --> 00:02:20.230
your just living in this wishy washy world of,
Oh,

37
00:02:20.231 --> 00:02:21.670
I just want to be happy.

38
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.840
There's never anything concrete that you can grasp onto action will always be

39
00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:29.360
more valuable than theory.

40
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.190
Halfheartedly wishing and hoping for something we'll never be as effective as

41
00:02:34.191 --> 00:02:37.430
taking direct action.
And yes,

42
00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:40.850
writing down what you want is the first and the easiest to action to take.

43
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.201
But by doing this,

44
00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:45.740
you've just taken the first step to coaxing your idea into the physical world.

45
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.540
Connor did this by vividly imagining himself in a better life and carrying

46
00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:57.260
himself like he already had that life.
And he still does this today vividly.

47
00:02:57.261 --> 00:02:58.970
Imagining not only his victories,

48
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.620
but also the challenges he will face and what he will do to overcome them.

49
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.460
<v 0>Yeah,
true.
Oh,
training camp,
you definitely have shots that you see,</v>

50
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:13.720
that you feel cracking.
You know,
you've,
you'll feel them shots happen,
you know.

51
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.160
Um,
but this is,
this is,
trust me,
this is a first round k over me.

52
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:20.710
I've no doubt on my mind,
his,

53
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:23.410
his toes will curl and I will celebrate

54
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.520
hands in his hands

55
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.570
if he's,
if he shows up,
I feel hell.
Okay.
I'll him inside.

56
00:03:38.571 --> 00:03:41.420
Warning if he may start walking to be is in the octagon.
I feel every single,

57
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.490
every single movement I make,

58
00:03:43.491 --> 00:03:46.370
we'll get an overreaction off of him cause he's emotionally invested in it.

59
00:03:46.371 --> 00:03:47.390
This June.
What Jane in front of me.

60
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.883
<v 3>Gotcha.</v>

61
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.953
<v 0>How do you do that</v>

62
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.680
is you can see it here and you have the courage enough to speak it.

63
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.033
It will happen.

64
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.210
<v 4>Another one of the most common causes of failure is the habit of quitting.</v>

65
00:04:20.211 --> 00:04:22.910
When someone is taken by temporary defeat.

66
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.590
Connor was on the verge of giving up,
fighting for good.

67
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.990
When he finally got the call to fight for the UFC,

68
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.420
imagine how different his life would be if he stopped three feet short of

69
00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:38.230
striking gold,
and this happens in all walks of life.

70
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.050
It seems like there is an invisible guide that tests people through all sorts of

71
00:04:43.051 --> 00:04:46.920
discouraging experiences to see you is truly worthy of success.

72
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.190
Persistence knows no such thing as failure.

73
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.383
<v 5>Okay.</v>

74
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.980
<v 4>Connor woke up at 5:00 AM every morning.</v>

75
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.880
We're 10 to 12 hours a day as a plumber and then went immediately to training at

76
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:01.714
night.

77
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.530
This was taken an incredible toll on his body and he was faced with the choice.

78
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.030
He quit plumbing and focused on training full time despite many heated arguments

79
00:05:10.031 --> 00:05:10.864
with his parents.

80
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.960
<v 3>Okay.</v>

81
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.690
<v 4>Burning the boats is a popular self improvement topic.</v>

82
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.690
You burn the boats and get rid of all forms of retreat,

83
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.760
so now you are forced to succeed.

84
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:22.250
<v 3>Okay.</v>

85
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.290
<v 4>Many people talk about burning the boats,</v>

86
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.760
but they forget the element of taking action.
Cool.

87
00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:29.870
You burnt the boats,

88
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.280
you are not guaranteed success and you will fail if you don't hustle towards

89
00:05:34.281 --> 00:05:35.114
your dreams.

90
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.840
Imagine if at the signing of the Declaration of Independence,
Thomas Jefferson,

91
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:44.380
John Hancock,
and everyone else who signed their name said,
okay,

92
00:05:44.381 --> 00:05:46.600
we just burned the boats and now we can't fail.

93
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.030
They knew if they didn't win the head just signed their death warrant.

94
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.140
They gave themselves no choice but to devote all their energy into winning their

95
00:05:55.141 --> 00:05:55.974
freedom.

96
00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.013
<v 3>Okay,</v>

97
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.090
<v 0>I will.
Oh,
you will be where I want to be.
I mean,
I'm really,</v>

98
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:06.050
I'm 100% confident that I,
that I will make it to the top.
I have the scales,

99
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:09.290
I have the dedication and it's something I really,
really want to.

100
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.800
Boards boards can't even describe,
but it will happen.

101
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.150
I let you know when it happens.

102
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.700
I feel to be at the pinnacle on money game in any whatever you do,

103
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.450
you've got to be a little bit gone to it.
You're not all there.

104
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.000
You've got to be almost insane,
Tia.
Craft,

105
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.640
not a lot of people can understand that.

106
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.980
That's why I don't know about nothing else.

107
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.140
I do not pay attention to not announced.

108
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.330
What happens if you do lose to Josie elder.

109
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.070
That is not in the equation.

110
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.390
That does not processing my brain for one second.

111
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.800
<v 4>Connor was 15 when he experienced a life changing moment.</v>

112
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.180
He moved from his hometown in Crumlin to a quiet neighborhood on the outskirts

113
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:01.600
of Dublin.
The move toward him,

114
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.680
away from his lifelong friends and put them in a place full of people he didn't

115
00:07:04.681 --> 00:07:09.050
know.
As a teenager.
He did not handle this very well,

116
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.430
but it set the stage for his deep visualization that he credits for his success.

117
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.720
He said,
I feel being alone with your thoughts is a good thing.

118
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.910
It allows you to figure things out for yourself.

119
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.790
Thinking is one of the hardest jobs you will ever do.

120
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.480
Tear someone away from their cell phone and make them sit in a room with just

121
00:07:27.481 --> 00:07:30.030
their thoughts for eight hours and they will freak out.

122
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.520
It was around this time of deep introspection that Connor first started to

123
00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:38.700
develop.
Napoleon hill calls a money consciousness.

124
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.950
He refused to accept a life without riches.

125
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.710
When you create your plan to achieve your desire,

126
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.260
do not base it on what you think is practical.

127
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.910
You reasoning faculty is lazy and we'll talk you out of taking action.

128
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.260
If your actual goal is to become a millionaire or to become a world champion

129
00:07:56.261 --> 00:07:58.210
fighter,
you're reasoning faculty.

130
00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:01.870
We'll see how much work it would take and it will talk you out of it by saying,

131
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:06.300
Oh,
you have to be more practical.
If you truly,

132
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:10.050
deeply want something,
you have to be able to vividly see yourself possessing it.

133
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.380
If you can't even imagine a world where it's possible,

134
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.060
how are you ever going to get it?

135
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.720
A good exercise is to ask yourself,

136
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:23.700
is there someone who is already accomplished what I want?
Most likely there is.

137
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.620
Then you have to ask yourself,

138
00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:30.960
is there something special about them that I can't replicate or they just cut

139
00:08:30.961 --> 00:08:35.040
from a different cloth?
In most cases,
the answer will be no.

140
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.870
In that case,
you can now try your best to replicate exactly what they did.

141
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.180
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

142
00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.730
<v 4>All great achievements are born from an idea.</v>

143
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.190
<v 3>Okay?</v>

144
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:49.700
<v 4>Every new success,
every new business,
every new invention has it.</v>

145
00:08:49.701 --> 00:08:52.730
Start in an idea.
Unfortunately,

146
00:08:52.731 --> 00:08:56.070
we live in a world where most ideas get snuffed out before it can actually be

147
00:08:56.071 --> 00:08:59.520
brought to life.
We get distracted and don't pursue it,

148
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.180
or we're told it's impractical or we're scared of what others will think of us.
