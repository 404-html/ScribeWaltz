Most people will try to tell you everything in moderation,
balance,
balanced,

2
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:07.930
balanced.
This is a word you will hear over and over again.

3
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.090
You need more balance in your life.

4
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.830
But how many successful people claim moderation is the key to success.

5
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.133
In fact,

6
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.050
almost all will claim that the only reason they were successful is that they

7
00:00:20.051 --> 00:00:22.150
were consumed by an all out obsession.

8
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.640
<v 2>People say you have to have a lot of passion for what you're doing.</v>

9
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.890
And it's totally true.
And the reason is,
uh,

10
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.540
is because it's so hard that if you don't,

11
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.460
any rational person would give up.

12
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.900
It's really hard and you have to do it over a sustained period of time.

13
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.530
So if you don't love it,
if you're not having fun doing it,

14
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.300
you don't really love it.
Uh,
you're gonna give up.

15
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.610
<v 0>Success came from the pursuing the passion they would've been doing regardless</v>

16
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:53.700
of the money.
Success came from creating a clear,

17
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.540
defined goal and obsessing to the point of forgetting to eat and to the point of

18
00:00:57.541 --> 00:01:00.870
literally not hearing people when they're talking about anything else.

19
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.730
I remember when I was a kid,
I tried so many times to pick up the guitar.

20
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.180
I would practice for hours,
but it would always end with me quitting.

21
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.140
It was really frustrating for me at the time.
I would get really into it,

22
00:01:13.141 --> 00:01:16.320
but it couldn't convince myself to stick with it and I didn't know why.

23
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.900
The last time I picked up the guitar,

24
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.230
I decided I would just dedicate myself to practicing for 10 minutes a day,

25
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.551
just 10 minutes,

26
00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:27.480
and then after that I could do whatever I wanted and almost always I would end

27
00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:28.740
up playing way longer.

28
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.670
Pretty soon that 10 minutes turned into eight or more hours a day,

29
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.360
but starting with 10 minutes and just getting that daily sense of accomplishment

30
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:37.740
was incredibly important for me.

31
00:01:37.741 --> 00:01:41.160
Sticking with it and allowing it to become an all out obsession in my mind.

32
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.380
I would forget to eat,

33
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.460
I wouldn't want to sleep and all I saw when people were talking to me were notes

34
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:49.050
in sequence is going through my head.

35
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.400
Being obsessed means showing up and doing your work no matter what.

36
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.310
If you're a writer and don't feel like writing,

37
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.820
just commit to writing one page a day.
If you want to play music,

38
00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:03.720
commit to learning one new song a week and once you learn to just go through the

39
00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:05.150
motions,
intellectual kickstart,

40
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.890
your brain and your instincts and creativity will take over,

41
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.130
what do you think it would take to get to the top 1% of any field?
I mean,

42
00:02:14.131 --> 00:02:16.980
it would probably take Malcolm Gladwell's 10,000 hours,
right?

43
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.110
That sounds pretty reasonable until you realize what the average person is

44
00:02:22.111 --> 00:02:26.460
actually like the average person works in nine to five that makes them

45
00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:27.294
miserable.

46
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.900
They eat like shit to handle their stress and have their attention span drained

47
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:35.340
by things like social media and the Kardashians.
Once you look around,

48
00:02:35.341 --> 00:02:37.740
you realize hardly anyone else's,

49
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:42.030
even competing just for a year,
commit yourself to being healthy and fit.

50
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.630
Commit yourself to learn piano or a martial art or had a code.

51
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.690
Go completely overboard,
completely over the top.

52
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.750
Find the point of overtraining so you know where your limits are.

53
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.530
Obviously getting to the top 1% is one thing,

54
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.560
but working your way to the top of that 1% is another struggle entirely.

55
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.460
It's going to be a grind and that is where Gladwell's 10,000 hours comes in.

56
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.330
It's important to realize this is not going to take some crazy amount of work

57
00:03:08.331 --> 00:03:12.590
ethic.
Lack of work ethic is not the major cause of underachievement.

58
00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:13.424
For most people.

59
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.870
They could harness the incredible work ethic if it was directed at something,

60
00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:21.180
they were passionate about something with meaning,
but for most,

61
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.170
their work ethic is watered down by all sorts of distractions.
In the end,

62
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.680
the stimulation provided by a strong passion for something,

63
00:03:28.681 --> 00:03:33.550
it has the potential to replace people's needs for coffee,
porn,
sugar,
alcohol,

64
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.040
and whatever stimming with you might think you need to get through the day.

65
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.870
If you pick one thing that clearly defined goals and allow yourself to become

66
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:42.850
completely obsessed by it for one year,

67
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.470
I truly believe you will be better at that one thing.
The 99% of the world.
