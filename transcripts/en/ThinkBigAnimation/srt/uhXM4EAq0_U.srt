1
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,830
It's like we're building our
society from an etch a sketch.

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,390
We were given a solid foundation in
a warning of what dangers to avoid.

3
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,970
At some point, someone came in long,
Andrew Dix all over our etch a sketch.

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,920
We are afraid to lose our work for
had such potential, but it is dead.

5
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,430
It has been hijacked and
we need to shake it clean.

6
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,610
George Orwell's stated that the best
books are the ones that tell you what you

7
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:39,540
already know.
1984 will tell you what you already know,

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,270
that there was something
very wrong with our culture.

9
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,920
Okay. War is peace. Freedom is slavery.

10
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,330
Ignorance is strength.
These were the three slogans of ink sock.

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,920
The totalitarian party,

12
00:00:59,921 --> 00:01:04,360
which controlled the superstate of Oceania
in George Orwell's dystopian novel,

13
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,390
1984 these slogans were precisely chosen
to create cognitive dissonance in the

14
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:15,140
citizen's minds. Each slogan uses words
directly contradictory to one another.

15
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,450
It was a concept known by party members
as double think to hold paradox school

16
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:23,360
views of reality.
Simultaneously. In your mind,

17
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:28,250
you were asked to completely disregard
your own perception and be completely

18
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:30,500
dependent on the state's
definition of reality.

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,480
If the party needed you to believe that
two plus two equals five do you have to

20
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:39,620
find some way to resolve the fact that
you know that equals four it is not just

21
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:40,700
enough to say the words.

22
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,630
The party was very sophisticated in
observing when you were faking it.

23
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:49,880
You needed to actually believe when a
party member holds up two and two fingers,

24
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,790
you are truly seeing five.
Furthermore,

25
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:57,020
if the party puts you in a situation
where two plus two must equal for for the

26
00:01:57,021 --> 00:01:58,880
sake of science and practicality,

27
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,080
you must find a way to resolve these
two paradigms as the party soffit.

28
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,040
Sometimes the answer was five,

29
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:10,090
sometimes it was three and sometimes
it was all of them at once.

30
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,620
The party specifically denies this
such a thing as the truth even exists.

31
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,660
The objective truth is whatever suits
their needs at the time in soc controls

32
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:24,280
all records, all memories of past events,
and they control your entire reality.

33
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,700
There would be no loyalty
but loyalty to the party.

34
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,700
There'd be no love but
love for big brother.

35
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,490
The validity of the human experience and
the very existence of external reality

36
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:39,220
itself was denied by their philosophy.

37
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:45,040
The greatest of all Harris's was common
sense and the most terrifying thing

38
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:48,790
about this proposition was not that they
would kill you for thinking otherwise.

39
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:53,980
What was truly terrifying was what if
they were rights first common sense,

40
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:58,720
truth like two plus two equals four or
the existence of gravity or that the past

41
00:02:58,721 --> 00:02:59,554
is

42
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,020
if these ideas exist only in the
mind and the mind is controllable,

43
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,250
what happens then?

44
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,840
The truth becomes whatever
those empower want it to be.

45
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,060
The way this manifested in Orwell's
nightmarish reality was this.

46
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,160
If someone you knew disappeared,

47
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,610
they were no longer a person
and in fact never existed,

48
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,290
any record of them was wiped out.
Any memory you had of them was false.

49
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,490
It was your imagination and speaking
about them could lead to your own sudden

50
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:34,660
disappearance.
The State of Oceania had two main rivals,

51
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,370
Eurasia and East Asia.

52
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,660
Whoever they were at war with in this
moment was who they had always been at war

53
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:45,100
with. Even if you had a memory of being
at war with East Asia four weeks ago.

54
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,480
Right now we are at war with your ratio
and had always been at war with your

55
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:53,290
ratio, any piece of news that had
ever said otherwise, it was altered.

56
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,830
Anyone who spoke to the
contrary, was it criminal? Okay.

57
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:02,600
When the planes hit the two towers on
nine 11 it was very clear what we needed

58
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:05,940
to do. We needed to find who was
responsible and crushed them.

59
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,610
Osama bin Laden was responsible. Osama
bin Laden had always been responsible.

60
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,620
This led to a war in Afghanistan.

61
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,280
Afghanistan had always been behind
the terror attacks on nine 11

62
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,050
so as the war with Iraq waged on,

63
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,690
we knew they had always had
weapons of mass destruction.

64
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,490
We all knew we had to rid this evil
totalitarian country of these weapons.

65
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,620
So this is the war in
Afghanistan continued. We came
to the realization to Iraq.

66
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:36,590
Never had weapons of mass destruction,
but this was okay.

67
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,310
That had never been the reason for
going to war in the first place.

68
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,960
What I rack really needed.

69
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,163
Okay.

70
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,140
Was the regime change?

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Whoever controls the present controls
the past and thus controls the future.

72
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,000
Those who control our history books are
able to control our perception of the

73
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:02,370
past.
Like most kids in America,

74
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,590
I was taught that no matter
which war we were fighting,

75
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,800
the United States was on the sight of God,
truth and justice.

76
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,703
This,

77
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,100
but history proves to be much more
complex than our linear way of learning in

78
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:15,990
schools allows us to understand,

79
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:17,560
okay,

80
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,130
every historical subject and we learned
gets condensed into a narrow lens,

81
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,180
usually portraying and imposing on us
a belief of American exceptionalism.

82
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,130
God's chosen people who've been burdened
with the task of enlightening other

83
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:32,260
cultures of their primitive ways.

84
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:38,850
And the 241 years since 1776 the United
States has been engaged in some type of

85
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:44,221
war for 224 of them wore in reality,

86
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:47,590
by definition should be something
that inevitably comes to an end.

87
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:52,750
There was a clear enemy. We fight.
We go until there was a clear victor,

88
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,830
then the war ends. The wars between
Oceania, East Asia, Eurasia.

89
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,720
We're not battles over resources.

90
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,610
War was enacted to keep a labor force
within its own boundaries in Orwell's

91
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:08,000
novel by becoming continuous
war has ceased to exist.

92
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,810
Each willpower stockpiles atomic
weapons and points the met each other,

93
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,380
planning and plotting for
the right moment. Of course,

94
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:18,980
this moment never comes and the leaders
of instock never want it to come.

95
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,910
None of the three powers ever attempt
any maneuver which involves the risk of

96
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:25,520
serious defeat in this way,

97
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:29,360
big battles and wars are being fought.
It could be true,

98
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,680
it could be a lie. The citizens
of Oceania have no way of knowing.

99
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,810
The real truth is that each superstate
is nearly identical to one another with

100
00:06:38,811 --> 00:06:41,660
only slight differences in
way of life in ideology.

101
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,170
This is why each superstate does
not want to conquer one another.

102
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,130
If you were to conquer a new territory,
what would you do with its people?

103
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:54,260
You can either have a mass genocide or
you can assimilate these people into your

104
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:55,094
own society.

105
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:00,710
That would be almost unthinkable if the
residents of Oceania actually mingled

106
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,080
with the enemy that had
been propped up for so long.

107
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,760
Soon they would come to realize that
they are more similar to themselves then

108
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,930
they could have ever
imagined in Orwell's reality.

109
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,650
War is waged by each ruling
class against its own subjects.

110
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,520
The object of war is not to take
your perfect conquest of territory,

111
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,550
but to keep the very
structure of society in tact.

112
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,700
A hierarchical society requires
a certain way of thinking,

113
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,710
particularly a feeling of scarcity and
lack that's drink too far from the herd

114
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,850
will result in death.
When war becomes literally continuous,

115
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,460
there was no such thing
as military necessity.

116
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,010
The war becomes merely an imposter.

117
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,520
It becomes like a battle between two
animals live set their horns at such an

118
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:45,740
angle that they are incapable
of hurting one another.

119
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,420
This is not to say that many people
won't die. Certainly they will,

120
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,890
but the foundation of these superpowers,

121
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,370
the way of life is never
endanger for even an instinct.

122
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,020
Though it is just an act.
It is not meaningless.

123
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,080
War eats up the surplus
of consumable goods,

124
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,010
and it helps to preserve the mental
atmosphere that a hierarchical society

125
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:07,880
requires.

126
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,760
A state of perpetual war has become
nearly identical to a state of perpetual

127
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:14,594
peace

128
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:27,110
throughout recorded time. There has always
been three types of people. The high,

129
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:31,940
the middle, and the low. They
have been subdivided many
ways, born countless names,

130
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,850
but the central structure of
society has never changed.

131
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,530
Even after enormous upheaval is the same
pattern has always reasserted itself,

132
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,800
just as a gyroscope will
always return to equilibrium.

133
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,210
The aims of these three groups
are entirely irreconcilable.

134
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,510
The aim of the high is
to remain where they are.

135
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,010
The aim of the middle is to overthrow in
change places with the high and the aim

136
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,240
of the low if they have an aim is to
abolish all distinctions and create a

137
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:01,980
society where all are equal.

138
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,890
Thus a struggle which maintains the
same basic outline recurs over and over

139
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:08,724
again.

140
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,810
The need for a hierarchical society has
always been the doctrine of the high.

141
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,900
The high had promised you safety and
security and all the riches available in

142
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:23,280
the next slide.
All it estin return was everything.

143
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,470
All of the riches in this world.

144
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,950
There are four ways in which your
ruling class can fall from power.

145
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,140
Either it is conquer from without. It
governs so poorly that the masses revolts.

146
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:40,590
It allows us strong discontented
middle group to develop or a loses self

147
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:44,860
confidence and willingness to govern a
ruling class which could guard against

148
00:09:44,861 --> 00:09:47,370
all of these would remain
in power permanently.

149
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:53,110
The high realizing history was a cyclical
process and that the middle and low

150
00:09:53,111 --> 00:09:55,150
would always try to usurp their status,

151
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,690
chose to find a way to maintain
their position permanently.

152
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,570
This new group of high was more conscious
of what they were doing and more

153
00:10:01,571 --> 00:10:03,460
focused on crushing their opposition.

154
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,140
This new group of high realized the
only way to keep an oligarchy intact was

155
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,070
through collectivism.

156
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:14,380
A society needed to exist with the greater
good of the group always had priority

157
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:15,310
over the individual.

158
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,180
One of the main mistakes these groups
have made in the past was the forming of

159
00:10:19,181 --> 00:10:23,770
an aristocracy. The privileged few
flaunted themselves. They had slaves.

160
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,100
They made it very clear that they
were the high and we were the low.

161
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,000
Once the high had an
overwhelming amount of resources,

162
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:36,270
the middle would inevitably enlist the
low to overthrow the high usually to a

163
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:41,641
violent in the key to success needed
to be secrecy and shadowed intentions,

164
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,160
the new oligarchy, the one
that can actually maintain
their status as the high.

165
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,760
We'll have to learn how
to hide their true aims

166
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,330
today. The high are no longer people.
They are corporations and institutions,

167
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,730
institutions which are too big to fail.

168
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,570
They become something like the
Federal Reserve, the very name,

169
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:06,070
a brilliant act of double thing.

170
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,940
It would suggest to an observer that they
are beholden to the federal government

171
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,060
and that they hold the reserve
of our currency. In reality,

172
00:11:13,061 --> 00:11:17,110
they are not a part of the federal
government nor do they hold any reserves.

173
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,820
They are nameless,

174
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,120
faceless shape shifting entity with no
loyalty or ties to anyone or anything.

175
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,670
Nathan Rothschild once said,

176
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:32,080
give me control of a nation's wealth
and I care not who makes its laws.

177
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,730
Once you have gained complete
control of a nation's wealth,

178
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,320
you can then plaster the face of a big
brother who is always watching you on to

179
00:11:41,321 --> 00:11:43,540
every TV,
every street corner,

180
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:47,530
and didn't every home while the
high remains truly anonymous.

181
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,060
Okay?

182
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,960
Through collectivism,

183
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:52,780
the hire able to keep up the illusion
that we've not been in sleep,

184
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,530
people are not productive when
we realize our enslavement,

185
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:01,750
our human spirit compels us to break
free of our masters. And furthermore,

186
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:05,720
when you knowingly in slave someone,
you don't want to educate them for them,

187
00:12:05,721 --> 00:12:07,150
they use it to turn against you.

188
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,950
So you are only able to take advantage
of the muscle of your human farm and not

189
00:12:11,951 --> 00:12:13,270
the most valuable asset.

190
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,860
Their minds
give them the illusion of freedom.

191
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,570
Let them choose their job,

192
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,720
where they want to vacation and how
they want to spend their free time.

193
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,160
They will choose a job that is safe and
secure though they have the ability to

194
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:29,320
go as far and for as long as they want.

195
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,010
They will vacation where countless
people have gone before and will always

196
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:38,011
return home when they are told and
inevitably almost all our various forms of

197
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:40,960
entertainment will merely
become a way to numb our senses,

198
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,490
give them the illusion of choice
and they will imprison themselves.

199
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,390
Thus,
freedom is slavery.

200
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:56,050
In 1984 the ink sock party was in the
middle of implementing a new type of

201
00:12:56,051 --> 00:12:59,740
language called quite
creatively new speak.

202
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,750
It would take time,
however,

203
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:06,160
to replace all the unnecessary old speak
words with the more useful, efficient,

204
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:09,790
new speak words, words that meant
the same thing were thrown away.

205
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,030
Words like fantastic,

206
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,630
ecstatic and amazing exist when they
could be covered by the word good.

207
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,510
If something was better,
it would be double good.

208
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:24,020
Something bad was simply an good language
was simplified as much as possible.

209
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:28,740
The goal of the party was to have any
idea divergent from the ink sock doctrine.

210
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:33,750
Literally unthinkable. All ambiguity
and shades of meaning were purged out.

211
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:38,120
Newspeak was designed to limit the range
of thought and there would be no room

212
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:41,960
for philosophical discussion.
In a world like this.

213
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:45,710
How could one fight back when the
thoughts and words that have a revolution

214
00:13:45,711 --> 00:13:47,780
couldn't even be thought or spoken?

215
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,990
Look at this example from Orwell's
article politics in the English language,

216
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,840
which shows the path modern
day English is heading down.

217
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,580
He takes a verse from ecclesiastics and
translates it into a more modern day

218
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:04,540
English type of writing.

219
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:09,940
I returned and saw under the sun that
the race is not to the swift nor the

220
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:11,140
battle to the strong,

221
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:16,480
neither yet bread to the wise nor yet
riches to men of understanding nor yet

222
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:20,980
favor to men of skill,
but time and chance happiness to them all.

223
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,300
Let's look at how the same sentence
would be written in a more modern day

224
00:14:25,301 --> 00:14:26,350
English type of writing.

225
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,540
Objective considerations of contemporary
phenomena compelled the conclusion that

226
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:36,070
success or failure in competitive
activities exhibits no tendency to be

227
00:14:36,071 --> 00:14:37,780
commiserate with the neat capacity,

228
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:42,070
but then a considerable element of the
unpredictable must invariably be taken

229
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:42,910
into account.

230
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,600
The first sentence contains 49 words,

231
00:14:47,601 --> 00:14:51,170
but only 60 syllables and all
its words those of everyday life.

232
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,460
The second contains 38
words of 90 syllables.

233
00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:00,200
Every form of imagery and
concrete illustration has
dissolved into these vague

234
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:02,570
phrases and just by its 90 syllables,

235
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:06,440
it gives us only a shortened version of
the meaning contained in the first yet

236
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:07,520
without a doubt,

237
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,090
it is the second kind of sentence which
is gaining ground in modern English.

238
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,940
This type of writing is youthful.

239
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:18,890
If one wants to hide their meaning and in
political language, this is everything.

240
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,880
For those who claimed a power must always
portray their reasons for doing so as

241
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:26,330
noble, they did it for
truth, God and justice.

242
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,490
This is rarely true.

243
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:34,150
Power has always been acquired for power's
sake or will realize this and realize

244
00:15:34,461 --> 00:15:39,140
that this trick is often masked by
language leaders, politicians and media,

245
00:15:39,141 --> 00:15:42,110
often new soft language
to mask a brutal reality.

246
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,970
British rule in India, the Russian
purges and deportations under stolen,

247
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,780
the dropping of the atom bombs
in Japan can be defended,

248
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,860
but only by arguments which are too brutal
for most people to face and which do

249
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:57,740
not align with the professed
aims of the political parties.

250
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,770
Euphemism is what makes up the majority
of our political language deficits.

251
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:06,620
Villages are bomb from the
air, the inhabitance driven
out into the countryside,

252
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,650
the cattle machine gun in the home set
on fire. This was called pacification.

253
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,581
Such phrase,

254
00:16:12,581 --> 00:16:15,740
knowledge is needed if one wants to
name things without calling a mental

255
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,560
pictures of them.
This is the trick.

256
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,110
You youth a nice name
for a horrific thing.

257
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:25,070
Political writing and speech is
often a defense of the indefensible.

258
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:29,120
Very often the words chosen directly
contradict the ideas they represent.

259
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,100
This kind of speech is
not hard to recognize,

260
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,700
so the speaker is dependent on
one key fact about human nature,

261
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,240
and that is the individual's
desire to deceive himself.

262
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,590
We all have a story,

263
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:49,210
a sort of internal narrative which shapes
our identity and molds our perception.

264
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,920
In 1984 the narrative was that big
brother was omnipotent and the party was

265
00:16:53,921 --> 00:16:54,754
infallible,

266
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:59,560
but because big brother was not omnipotent
and the party was not infallible,

267
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:03,910
there was need for an unwavering moment
to moment flexibility in the treatment

268
00:17:03,911 --> 00:17:04,744
of facts.

269
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:09,730
One needed control over their own mental
processes as complete as that of a

270
00:17:09,731 --> 00:17:13,540
contortionist over his body in new speak.

271
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,960
This is called double think.

272
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,350
Double think less is the very heart of
ink sock way of life since the essential

273
00:17:20,351 --> 00:17:24,610
act of the party is to use conscious
deception while retaining the firmness of

274
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:26,620
purpose that goes with complete honesty,

275
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,180
to tell deliberate lies while
genuinely believing in it.

276
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:36,080
This brings up the question, why must
reality be distorted in this manner?

277
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:37,340
Okay.

278
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,820
Why must the narrative pervade every
layer of the societal structure?

279
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:47,110
It is important to realize that
power is in the collective alone.

280
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,160
Every human being will fail because every

281
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,870
human being is doomed to die,

282
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,390
but if he can make complete utter
submission, if he can escape his identity,

283
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,200
if you can immerse himself into
the parties that he is the party,

284
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,170
then he is all powerful and a mortal.

285
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,420
You see then why you must never lose
faith in the infallibility of your country

286
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,350
or political group.

287
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,760
These things make up the foundation of
how you interpret the world and if they

288
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:18,840
collapse, your entire structure
of beliefs will collapse with it.

289
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,140
This is why above all the story,

290
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:27,350
the narrative and the mythologies must
remain intact and why you will follow

291
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:29,940
your culture down whatever
path it leads you.

292
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,250
We tend to think of an oppressive regime
is containing two categories of people.

293
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,080
The oppressive rule in class and the
innocent people who are being oppressed.

294
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,500
We think of tyranny is something
which comes from the top down,

295
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,440
but a system like that
simply would not function.

296
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:51,670
Regimes like that have stolen or Hitler
required the willing participation of a

297
00:18:51,671 --> 00:18:52,780
mass amount of people.

298
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,680
This is not fit very well with
our perception of what happened.

299
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,910
It is much easier to look at history
as a case of black and white,

300
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,280
right and wrong or good and evil,

301
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:07,270
and each of us would like to believe
if we were put in that situation,

302
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:11,680
we would take the side of good.
If only it were that simple.

303
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,800
If only there were some
unmistakable mark of evil,

304
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,170
we could simply separate
the good from the bad.

305
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:22,240
But the line between good and evil does
not pass through political parties nor

306
00:19:22,241 --> 00:19:27,100
states nor social classes,
but right through every human heart.

307
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,260
This runs absolutely counter to
what we would like to believe.

308
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,400
We lack our villains out in the open
where they can be easily identified,

309
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:41,260
but it was not good men or bad men who
were behind the horrors of Auschwitz and

310
00:19:41,261 --> 00:19:44,470
Soviet Russia.
It was ordinary men,

311
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,750
people just like you and me.

312
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:53,320
To truly understand Nazi Germany or
Stalin's Russia is to understand the

313
00:19:53,321 --> 00:19:56,050
ordinary people,
meaning you and I.

314
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,640
If we were put in that situation, we
would have done what ordinary people did.

315
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,660
What every totalitarian state had in
common was the layer of deceit and bed

316
00:20:10,661 --> 00:20:14,500
within its culture and within his language
and a willingness of the individual

317
00:20:14,501 --> 00:20:17,260
to accept an act out in lists lies.

318
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:22,030
This is what Orwell so eloquently brought
to light and politics in the English

319
00:20:22,031 --> 00:20:24,700
language.
Speaking in an imprecise man,

320
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:29,560
or at least the groundwork for society
built unconscious deception and it starts

321
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,060
at the level of the individual.

322
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,270
We can not lay responsibility
at the feet of another.

323
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,660
For the enemy is not some
dictator in a far away land.

324
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:41,920
When we realize the enemy
lies within our own hearts,

325
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,980
suddenly one becomes too.

326
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:49,120
We have found the enemy and he is us.

327
00:20:58,910 --> 00:20:59,270
Okay.
