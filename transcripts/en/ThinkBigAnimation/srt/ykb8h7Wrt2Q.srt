1
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,810
A teacher is helping one of his students
who was stuck trying to complete a

2
00:00:08,811 --> 00:00:09,644
reading assignment.

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:15,580
The same is write a 500 word story
about her hometown and she can't write a

4
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:20,510
single word. Her town seem
so small, so insignificant.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,840
How could she ever find something
interesting enough to write about?

6
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,130
The teacher thinks about this and
he decides to change the assignment.

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,410
Okay.
He says,

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,830
your new assignment is to write about
the opera house outside the classroom.

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,920
In fact,
start with the upper lefthand brick.

10
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,750
The student is so confused how is she
ever going to write about a brick?

11
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,140
But she didn't really have any
other choice but to get started,

12
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,360
once she sat down to write this exercise
destroyed her writer's block and she

13
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:54,040
seemed to have endless creativity.

14
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,520
She came to class the next
day with 20 inspired pages.

15
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,150
When Josh was first starting
his journey in chess,

16
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,990
the first instructor he had did things
a little bit different than most.

17
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,790
He took nearly all the pieces off the
board and had him practice with just a

18
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:11,470
king and upon versus a king.

19
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,860
A little counter intuitive as most people
will start from the beginning and work

20
00:01:15,861 --> 00:01:16,840
their way through the whole game.

21
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,130
But in the beginning there's too much
to focus on and most people will become

22
00:01:21,131 --> 00:01:23,410
lost by the sheer number
of options they have.

23
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:29,510
What Josh has teacher did instead
was having focused on less this way.

24
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:33,520
His mind wasn't hindered by countless
options and he was able to internalize

25
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:35,050
high level chest principles.

26
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,300
We basically have two approaches we
can take to learning the first and most

27
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:45,010
common in our add society to try and cram
more and more information into our head

28
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,270
to try to recite more facts
and learn more technique.

29
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,280
So we appear to have more knowledge,

30
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,670
but this is a very
surface layer knowledge.

31
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,150
A good example of this would be to click
on Facebook right now is go through the

32
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:01,900
500 different gurus,
philosophers and stoics,

33
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,080
who all seem to have the
perfect philosophy on how
you should live your life.

34
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,570
Probably based on the last
Oprah episode they saw.

35
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,660
The second approach is to narrow your
focus to one or two things to do less,

36
00:02:13,661 --> 00:02:14,920
but to do it incredibly well.

37
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,270
Yeah,

38
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:21,160
to focus on depth over breadth through
Josh's approach to learning with just a

39
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:22,390
few pieces on the board.

40
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,110
It gave is my room to think and completely
internalized how each piece moods.

41
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,480
He would then move on
to a king and a night,

42
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,800
then a king in a rook until he deeply
internalized every single piece on the

43
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:37,010
board. Now when you actually
dove back into the complex,

44
00:02:37,011 --> 00:02:40,970
middle and opening game positions,
the chaos seems slowed down.

45
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,030
He could see the
intricacies of each piece.

46
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,020
He learned more by focusing on less,
what do you call,

47
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,890
discovering the macro by diving into
the micro and does his knowledge grew,

48
00:02:53,891 --> 00:02:57,040
he was able to chunk new
information faster and faster.

49
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,350
Chunking the ability to take
a large amount of information
and group it together

50
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:06,340
under a certain principle or pattern where
can now be accessed as a single piece

51
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:07,174
of information.

52
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,300
Yeah.

53
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,060
This creates something called a
carved neural pathway in the brain.

54
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,020
Imagine it is having to cut your way
through a dense jungle with nothing but a

55
00:03:15,021 --> 00:03:15,854
machete.

56
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,990
Yeah.

57
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,570
In the beginning, this will take
an incredible amount of time.

58
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,630
You will have to monotonicity
Plod your way through,

59
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,490
but once you carved out a path,

60
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,940
anything that fits on that path can
get through almost instantaneously.

61
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:29,741
As you learn,

62
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:33,370
you will be able to discover organizing
principles that allow you to access new

63
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:35,170
information with increasing ease.

64
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,470
A man wants to walk across the land,
but the earth is covered in thorns.

65
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,930
He's two options.

66
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:51,030
One is to try and pave a road to
try and tame nature into compliance.

67
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,370
The other is to make sandals.

68
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,720
Making Sandals represents
creating an internal solution.

69
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,720
It represents a mind that is
working in this soft softsoap.

70
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,800
It does not require a submissive
world to be successful.

71
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:10,140
Instead of does a state of mind that
relies on preparation and resilience and

72
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:13,710
resilience is a trait that can be built
up over time by planning setbacks,

73
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,800
distractions,
and adversity into your practice.

74
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,410
There are certain people you run into
who you just know. No matter what.

75
00:04:22,411 --> 00:04:25,290
We'll always find an excuse
to not get something done.

76
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,570
They can't do it because they're sick.

77
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,210
They can't do it because their
girlfriend broke up with them.

78
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,170
Do you think Michael Jordan is going to
skip practice because he's not feeling

79
00:04:34,171 --> 00:04:35,004
good?

80
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,700
Do you think Michael Phelps is not going
to go slam because his girlfriend broke

81
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:42,750
up with him? No. If anything, they
are able to take distractions,

82
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,690
pain and setback as fuel to work harder.

83
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,480
It actually makes them
perform at a higher level.

84
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,600
Nothing is going to stop them
from completing their work.

85
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,770
This is because they have cultivated a
mind that lives and breathes in the soft

86
00:04:55,771 --> 00:05:00,180
zone. To become a master, you have to
train and perfect your art no matter what.

87
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,080
If you have a mind that is operating
in the hard zone, you were saying,

88
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,700
I have no control over my fate and I need
the world to cooperate in order for me

89
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:11,310
to get my work done.
On the other hand,

90
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,230
if your mind is operating
in the soft zone,

91
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,970
you will either completely ignore
external pressure or actually use it to

92
00:05:17,971 --> 00:05:19,170
enhance your creativity.

93
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,030
Cultivating a practice in the soft zone,

94
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,260
we'll give you an internal locust of
control, not just in learning but in life.

95
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,300
You can create a proactive, like when
that you build from the inside out,

96
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,410
you're not reactive to whatever
stimulus you happen to be exposed to.

97
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,850
You're not going to become a lawyer
because mommy and daddy always wanted it.

98
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,550
Even though deep down you
always wanted to be an artist.

99
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,580
You were going to live a life
that is true to yourself.

100
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,470
True Learning and growth comes when we
act in the outer reaches of our ability.

101
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,630
You're like a hermit crab that is
constantly outgrowing it. Shell,

102
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,410
the only way the crab will grow bigger
is by abandoning the safety and comfort

103
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:05,240
of his former shell. Now, he has to take
a soft, mushy body out into the world.

104
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,070
At times you might outgrow certain
comforts, certain practice routines,

105
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:14,930
certain teachers you are now like a soft,
mushy buddy crab.

106
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,810
At times like this,
you have to go out and test yourself.

107
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,880
Otherwise you become like an
anorexic crab that refuses to grow,

108
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:24,710
so he doesn't have to leave his show.
