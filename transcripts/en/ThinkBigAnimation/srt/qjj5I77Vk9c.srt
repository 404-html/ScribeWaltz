1
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,840
Harry Potter in the Church.
Needless to say,

2
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:17,830
spin rate. What have been
plucked out of warlocks

3
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,250
organized book burnings,
nationwide bands,

4
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,450
and I even heard a story of a child in
a Christian orphanage with nothing left

5
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:26,901
in the world,

6
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:30,110
but it's Harry Potter books who's forced
to burn them because they promoted

7
00:00:30,111 --> 00:00:34,560
witchcraft. What is it about our own
imaginations that can be so terrifying?

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,950
I had a very active
imagination as a child.

9
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,290
I also happen to live in a
house with nine kids. They'll,

10
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:44,880
keeping track of me was impossible
one step outside and I was in another

11
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:45,481
universe,

12
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:50,280
so real and vivid that it was almost
indistinguishable from reality like mini

13
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:53,940
children. My imagination was easily
swept off into the world of fiction.

14
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,920
Naturally,
the stories I like best,

15
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:59,040
we're about knights and
quests and slaying dragons.

16
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,410
They were about King Arthur, Luke
Skywalker, and of course Harry Potter.

17
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,650
As soon as the new Harry Potter
book was available in the library,

18
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:11,880
it was a mad rush to be the first
one to check it out. Unfortunately,

19
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,020
I was told these books say tannic
witchcraft and I was never allowed to read

20
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:17,220
them.
Of course,

21
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:20,340
the fact that the books were forbidded
only made them that much more attractive.

22
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,690
I read them anyway,

23
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,470
hiding them all around the house and
getting caught all the time. Mr. Smith.

24
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,240
Oh yeah. Just masturbating. The books
clearly accomplished something amazing.

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,640
They had fifth graders reading five,

26
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,050
six and 700 page books and my own love
for reading to this day can be traced

27
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:40,440
back to that time in my life.
In my 11 year old mind.

28
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:44,040
I simply couldn't understand how something
which provided me with so much joy

29
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,390
and wonder could be evil.

30
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,950
I've come to believe that it is precisely
the amount of joy we received that

31
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:53,340
caused this kind of backlash
and it is not hard to see why.

32
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,950
What are we doing when
we get lost in a novel?

33
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,820
It is more than just
fantasy and escape isn't.

34
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,470
We are creating detailed
images in our mind,

35
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,000
bringing them to life and blurring
the lines between fantasy and reality.

36
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,220
That is magic. Like seriously
getting that immersed in something.

37
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:15,930
It's truly a religious experience and
unfortunately it's all too common.

38
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:19,620
The churches in the business of preventing
religious experience rather than

39
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:23,220
mediating it.
Look closely and you will see at its core,

40
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:27,720
the Harry Potter series is about a
religious transformation that's tyrannical

41
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:30,090
king becomes paranoid
about a new miracle child.

42
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,140
The child is then driven
out of the magical kingdom
only to return later as the

43
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:36,330
savior sound familiar.

44
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,390
Both were crucified for
telling people the truth.

45
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:43,410
They did not want to hear both willingly
face death to save the ones they love

46
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,660
and both died and were reborn. The story
of Harry Potter is his oldest time.

47
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,900
It is the endless battle
of good versus evil.

48
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,960
When Adam and eve ate of
the tree of knowledge,

49
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:58,800
the tension of opposites came into being
and it became apparent that the key to

50
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,340
heaven light and renouncing,

51
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,060
ignoring and suppressing our
most base in evil desires,

52
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,150
but that which we suppressed
does not simply go away.

53
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,840
Voldemort is a clear representation
of the young Ian Shadow.

54
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,840
Carl Young stated that
we all have a persona.

55
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,300
This is the mask that
we put on for the world.

56
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,870
It encompasses all those traits we
deem worthy and socially acceptable.

57
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,790
Then we have the shadow, the part of
ourselves. We hide from the world,

58
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,320
the basement of our psyche,

59
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:30,190
which stores every repressed memory
and every skeleton of our past.

60
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:35,710
These disowned parts of ourselves are
extremely valuable and cannot be discarded

61
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:38,920
without a cost.
If channeled properly,

62
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,620
they can fill our life
with meaning if ignored,

63
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,670
they will always find a way to express
themselves often in unforeseen and

64
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:49,750
destructive ways.
We all have a two sided nature.

65
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,640
Voldemort is the other side of Harry
and their lives aren't inescapably woven

66
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:55,474
together,

67
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,290
but it is emphasized time and again that
it was the choices Harry made that set

68
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:03,880
them apart. Voldemort is often
translated as flight from death.

69
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,960
That is what everyone does.
They refused to speak his name,

70
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,960
refuse to acknowledge
their own two sided nature,

71
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,470
refuse to see the darkness
that exists within themselves.

72
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:19,990
Everyone refuses to look except for Harry
in his first two encounters with the

73
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:24,160
pace of evil, he can only look at
it indirectly. First is reflection.

74
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,920
Then is nothing more
than a memory in a diary.

75
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,510
While he meets the face of evil
courageously, he's clearly outmatched.

76
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,720
This is a part of himself.
He does not yet understand

77
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,710
three words in the goblet
of fire change everything

78
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,180
up to this point.

79
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,480
These were child like adventure stories
where the hero always conquered.

80
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,940
This all changes. When Harry has his
first direct look into the face of evil,

81
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,890
he sees death, an experience
which changes him completely.

82
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,420
He now sees the world in a way his friends
cannot something which causes him to

83
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:02,340
question himself and his sanity,

84
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,360
but confrontation with the shadow was
actually what guides here. He's life.

85
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,380
He says, his aim to become an or and
to join the order of the Phoenix.

86
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:15,240
It provides his life with purpose and
meaning the strongest parts of himself.

87
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,710
His capacity for love and friendship
are discovered in his most vulnerable

88
00:05:19,711 --> 00:05:20,544
moments.

89
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,010
Those who are reading Harry in the
Bible are experiencing the same thing.

90
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,730
There's a reason the death and rebirth
theme has survived in our storytelling

91
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,080
for thousands of years.

92
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,650
It speaks to something deeply
embedded within the human experience,

93
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,820
and it is the reason the story of a young
wizard has been able to successfully

94
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:42,640
reach the hearts and minds
of billions of people.
