1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,490
Let's see. You work for southwest airlines
and you see a huge number of customers

2
00:00:12,491 --> 00:00:16,600
requesting different food choices
like a Greek chicken salad on flights.

3
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,870
If you brought this request
to the CEO of the company,

4
00:00:19,871 --> 00:00:24,871
he would probably show you this
quote southwest the low fare airline.

5
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,560
How will offering a Greek salad on our
flights help keep us as the low fare

6
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:30,394
airline?

7
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,720
This is the core of the southwest
business model broken down to its simplest

8
00:00:34,721 --> 00:00:38,470
possible element. If it doesn't help
keep us as the low fare airline,

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,530
we are not going to do it in this way.

10
00:00:41,531 --> 00:00:44,380
Every decision can be put through the
filter of how will it affect our core

11
00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:45,214
message.

12
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,840
You might notice that many workers at
southwest are able to be more lighthearted

13
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,850
and have fun. If you want to
sing a song over the inner calm,

14
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:52,930
it doesn't affect our core,

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,130
but if you decided to throw confetti
after every landing requiring a cleanup

16
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,010
crew, now you are affecting
the core of the business.

17
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,340
When making a complex idea simple,

18
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:06,880
you need to make it as compact as
possible while maintaining the core of the

19
00:01:06,881 --> 00:01:10,840
idea when done correctly.
This can be incredibly powerful.

20
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,990
The idea of a proverb captures
this concept perfectly.

21
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,550
It condenses lessons from a lifetime of
experience into a phrase like a burden.

22
00:01:18,551 --> 00:01:20,020
The hand is worth two in the bush.

23
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,340
A phrase that takes five seconds to read
could take years to really implement in

24
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:25,174
your life,

25
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,960
but how do we get to the core of an idea
without dumbing it down and making it

26
00:01:28,961 --> 00:01:33,460
meaningless? The book takes us through an
exercise of trying to memorize letters.

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,040
Try and remember as many
letters as you can. J. F, K, F,

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,900
B. I. N. T, O, u.

29
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:48,901
P.

30
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,360
S. N. A. S. A. I. R. S. Now listen to
the same exact letters in the same order,

31
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:57,210
but just read a little
bit differently. J. F,

32
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:58,044
k,

33
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,540
F.

34
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,983
B. I. N. A. T. O. U. P.
S. N. A. S. A. I. R. S.

35
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,010
Now you could probably memorize a lot
more with the first sequence you're trying

36
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:20,180
to remember rod data with the
second you are memorizing concepts.

37
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,240
There is no way the concept of JFK
is more simple than the letters Kjf,

38
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,210
but your tapping into a deeply
internalized concept of JFK.

39
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,450
The memory work has
already been done here.

40
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,700
A complex idea is chunked as one concept.

41
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,830
Well Keiji F makes our brain trying
to remember three unrelated concepts.

42
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,770
If you find yourself stuck,
deciding between conveying
accuracy or accessibility,

43
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,300
always go for accessibility.

44
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,140
It's like when a teacher tries to explain
the concept of electrons to a six year

45
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,960
old, they will teach them by
comparing it to the orbits of planets.

46
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,130
Even though is not totally accurate.

47
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,750
That is because the concept of orbiting
planets is already accessible in their

48
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,240
minds.
This is not dumbing down the message,

49
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,440
but stripping the idea to its main
essence. When you're doing creative work,

50
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:15,040
it can be painful to leave out incredibly
valuable information that is not the

51
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:15,874
core message.

52
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,700
Learn to relentlessly prioritize and make
your ideas as profound and compact as

53
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:25,060
you can.
Try to create proverbs with your work.
