1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,203
Sure.

2
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,480
Throughout our entire lives we
are in search of some creed.

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,810
We seek certainty and somewhere to belong,
someone to rely upon.

4
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,520
You come to these things out of fear.
I mean even with videos like these,

5
00:00:24,521 --> 00:00:26,800
you probably watched them
seeking some kind of certainty.

6
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,440
You're looking for someone
to tell you how to live.

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,760
You're probably looking for that one
video to tell you exactly what to do.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,050
The video that will make everything click.
You seeking certainty.

9
00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:42,760
It's the hearing, but there is no
such thing. Um, with that being said,

10
00:00:42,761 --> 00:00:45,280
please keep watching my videos.
Hashtag I love you

11
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,880
encouraged by Osho. He would like to
make us more insecure, more uncertain,

12
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,110
because that is how life is a truly alive.

13
00:00:57,111 --> 00:01:00,620
Men will always feel insecure if
anyone knew what was going to happen.

14
00:01:00,621 --> 00:01:05,621
Each moment in life is just
a dead mechanical process
waiting to be played out.

15
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,010
A secure life would be worse than death.
When you say you are certain,

16
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,770
you declare your death,
you've committed suicide,

17
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,790
and I know one thing, this, I'll get
a lot of comments from people like,

18
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,390
oh well then should I just quit my job?
And go live on the streets.

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,990
And the answer I'd give
is, I don't know, man.

20
00:01:23,991 --> 00:01:26,810
Maybe there isn't really
a cookie cutter answer.

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,220
Each situation is a unique
life is not a stagnant pond.

22
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:35,810
If the dynamic flowing river with
constantly changing circumstances.

23
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:40,220
Now obviously being stable and having
security is not totally a bad thing.

24
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,210
I talk a lot in my videos against
consumerism and materialism,

25
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,050
but that doesn't necessarily mean enjoying
the materialistic things of the world

26
00:01:48,051 --> 00:01:51,670
is bad. Oh, show himself
the spiritual guru.

27
00:01:51,671 --> 00:01:56,671
Oh 98 Rolls Royces 98 so obviously he
had an enjoyment for the material things

28
00:01:58,581 --> 00:01:59,414
in life.

29
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,200
Does that make him incapable
of being someone you can
take wisdom and advice from

30
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,190
with this? I've experienced
both sides of the spectrum.

31
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,380
When I was 19 I landed the
secure, comfy, cushy sales job.

32
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,730
I thought I hit the lottery all my life.

33
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:20,930
The bar for a successful life was a
good job that you can retire on and just

34
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:25,160
like that, I already had it. I was making
more money than I knew what to do with.

35
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,460
And Luckily I had some good family
around me teaching me how to be frugal.

36
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,160
Friends told me how
jealous they were of me.

37
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,810
Family was telling me how proud they
were that I was successful and I was so

38
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:38,450
happy.
I had taken a risk,

39
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,890
moved from my small town and had all
worked out there was going to be a happily

40
00:02:42,891 --> 00:02:43,724
ever after.

41
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,520
But soon the novelty wore off and
everyday started to look like the last and

42
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,410
three years past in a blur,
I knew I needed a change.

43
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,500
I started to spend every day at work
reading about people who are living on the

44
00:02:57,501 --> 00:03:01,450
edge, people who are bold, taking
risks and making like an adventure.

45
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,390
I read about people saying,
fuck the standards of society.

46
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,530
People would sleep in their truck or
van that would airbnb and couch surf and

47
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:10,990
travel and go with their heart desired.

48
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,250
So eventually I got fired from this job.

49
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:20,490
I wonder why I decided to take all my
savings and spend a year sleeping out of

50
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:24,040
my truck and doing nothing but surf
and train martial arts all day.

51
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,980
It was scary,
but a risk I wanted to take.

52
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:29,790
Okay.

53
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,630
And suddenly it's like I had life
breathed back into me everyday scene,

54
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,840
brand new,
different from the last,

55
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,780
every day was a question
of where would I sleep,

56
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,360
what would I do and where would I go?

57
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,640
Until soon routine took over,

58
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:52,170
the novelty wore off and every
day seemed to be like the last

59
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,210
I felt exactly like I did in that
stuff to professional workplace.

60
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,860
I just had less space,

61
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,200
less things and more time and it was
never a question of having money or not

62
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:07,260
having money, having free
time, not having free time.

63
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:12,110
It was always a question of mine
awareness. It's not bad to see comfort.

64
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,510
It's not bad to seek the material things.

65
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,270
It's always a question of
the place it's coming from.

66
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,960
Is it coming from a place of
compulsion of seeking completion?

67
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,040
It didn't matter if I was at the
cushy job or living in the truck.

68
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,220
It was only a question of
my awareness in each moment.

69
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,190
I wasn't necessarily more
happy living out of the truck.

70
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,480
I felt happier because the danger and
novelty forced my attention into the

71
00:04:35,481 --> 00:04:36,314
present moment.

72
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,450
What is the right thing
to do when each moment

73
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,610
it is that which is harmonious
with nature and with existence?

74
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,040
What does this even mean? What
is right? It can't be described.

75
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,970
This is why you must stay alert
in each moment. What is right?

76
00:04:57,971 --> 00:04:59,470
One moment is wrong than that,

77
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,040
and you cannot depend
on ready made answers.

78
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,030
You must maintain awareness
to respond to a changing life.

79
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,720
This is why it is critical
to live a life of courage,

80
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:16,140
a life on the edge who is more aware
that the man on the edge of a cliff keep

81
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:21,460
your awareness and listen for the unknown.
Gather courage to move into it.

82
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,930
You will not need to seek the new for.
It will come to you in a thousand ways.

83
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,530
If you have the eyes to see it,
you cannot keep rejecting.

84
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:33,850
The new for the old has not given you
what you seek. No effort is needed.

85
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,350
Just courage.
