1
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,530
No Mcdonald has had a lot of well wishes
recently and a lot of people that would

2
00:00:08,531 --> 00:00:12,430
like to throw him down. One, uh,
well they want to murder him.

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,443
Well,

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:18,531
seems a bit harsh,

5
00:00:18,531 --> 00:00:22,340
but old turd Ferguson is found himself
in a bit of hot water recently and I have

6
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:26,680
been racking my brain to try and find
out why was it for whipping out his dirty

7
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:30,220
cock for an Oprah. Was it for
killing his wife and a waiter? Nope.

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,470
Instead it was for his incredibly ill
advised decision to speak honestly and an

9
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:36,030
interview with the Hollywood reporter.

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,170
I had initially planned this video to
be an analysis and tribute to norm,

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,800
but I now feel the need to address
this crazy stolen Essex show trial.

12
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:47,160
He's just been dragged through for
his incredibly innocuous comments.

13
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,060
But first I want to explain
to the folks at home my norm,

14
00:00:50,061 --> 00:00:54,290
Macdonald is possibly the greatest
comedic mind in the entire universe.

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,730
Great Star got blessing world,
great people. This is wonderful.

16
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:03,600
Being here at the home

17
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,430
[inaudible]

18
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,440
Don Rickles was the master of the old
timey rose, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis,

19
00:01:12,441 --> 00:01:16,100
Frank Sinatra. Nobody was safe from
the sharp tongue of Mr. Warmth.

20
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,730
It seems so effortless because
funny was simply who he was.

21
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,290
It was just dawn being done.
The roasts of today are very different.

22
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,490
The punchline has become almost irrelevant
and shock factor seems to be all that

23
00:01:28,491 --> 00:01:31,760
matters. When norm as the
producers of comedy central,

24
00:01:31,761 --> 00:01:33,010
what to talk about on a roast,

25
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,400
they told him exactly that to be
as shocking as possible. Of course,

26
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:41,000
norm knew right away the most shocking
performance he could give and it gave us

27
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:43,700
one of the greatest
moments in comedy history.

28
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,120
Yes, but of course he was famous
for being a vegetarian. Hey,

29
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,060
she may be a vegetarian, but you're
still full of Bologna in my book.

30
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:02,560
That's a beautiful face. Like
a flower. Yeah, Cali flower,

31
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,210
no offense,
but your face looks

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,330
like a collie flower.

33
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,520
This moment is still talked about in the
world of comedy is one of the ballsiest

34
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:24,360
things any performer has ever done.
The audience expects,

35
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,030
even demands profanity and nastiness.

36
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,070
Then norm walks up to the podium with all
the confidence in the world and begins

37
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,320
delivering dad jokes.

38
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:38,321
So exquisitely hokey that they cross over
into the realm of genius to those who

39
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:42,210
just know norm from weekend update or
his hilariously strange appearances on

40
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:43,140
late night talk show this.

41
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,080
It can seem like he is slowly
turning into that senile old man.

42
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:50,100
He's always been pretending to be despite
the fact that he is one of the most

43
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:52,680
intelligent,
well read people in the world of comedy.

44
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:56,550
Norm is okay with giving off this persona
of the crazy rambling uncle and for a

45
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:00,220
very good reason,
his what

46
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,450
he should be doing as being funny.
That should be his goal.

47
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,270
Your friend Bill Maher for instance,
you know,

48
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:11,410
he wants to be seen as an intellectual,
this Miller, Dennis Miller,

49
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,270
but a Letterman, but Letterman understands
he's smarter than both of them.

50
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,140
He understands. Play
the dumb guy, you know,

51
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,170
play the play, the play, the every man.

52
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,280
Nobody likes a guy smarter than them.
That's the worst.

53
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,840
The worst guy. You can be a
guy smarter than the audience.

54
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:35,440
They're going to hate you, you know?
Yeah. It's a very good observation

55
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,590
and just in case you thought he
really was that. See now old man,

56
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:42,220
he often seems to be,
feel free to test his wit off the cuff

57
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,500
and I slept at the parking lot.
Oh,

58
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:49,220
the comedy store and I had no
money and I was broke. Both. Yeah.

59
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,960
You are making a movie with carrot top
right? I made a movie with carrot top.

60
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:01,120
Okay. All right. It's like nine
and a half weeks, but carrot top.

61
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,353
Wow.

62
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:10,160
I got to check out that movie you
called nine and a half seconds

63
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,360
movie going to be called. I know
it's going to be called. Yep.

64
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,313
What's that?

65
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,270
If it's got carrot top and it, you know
what a good name for it. B. What's that?

66
00:04:21,271 --> 00:04:23,240
Norm box office poison

67
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,450
from Mcdonald's. God
bless. You're watching.

68
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:31,630
Your set was like watching
Henry Fonda pick blueberries.

69
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,443
Why?

70
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,460
I don't think there's a person in here
there would not love to watch Henry Fonda.

71
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,740
Big Boy

72
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,560
movie coming out. Yes, title undetermined
at this point. Chairman of the board.

73
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,130
Wow. All right. Do something
with that. You can breed.

74
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,470
I,
I've had the board is spelled Bor.

75
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:02,883
Yeah.

76
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,230
If you try and tell your favorite norm
McDonald joke to a friend where you will

77
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:15,740
find as you stand there in
awkward silence is the norms.

78
00:05:15,741 --> 00:05:18,770
Delivery is one of the most
important factors to a success.

79
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,310
He's mastered the ability to
keep the audience off balance.

80
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,090
You're expecting a short joke.
He gives you a long one.

81
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,460
You're expecting a clever punchline.
He gives you a simple one.

82
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,050
You're expecting him to be dumb.

83
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:35,290
He makes it profound and sincere statement
norm has devoted his entire life to

84
00:05:35,511 --> 00:05:39,860
finding out what it will take to delight
and surprise the audience. Every pause,

85
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:44,270
every expression, every delivery he makes
is always with the punchline in mind.

86
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,020
When you launched into his joke and most
of the credit is wondering if this guy

87
00:05:48,021 --> 00:05:49,700
has any idea what he's doing,

88
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,080
those who know him understand that the
innocent looking smile means that he is

89
00:05:54,081 --> 00:05:58,550
an absolute control of what's happening.
If you watch norm long enough,

90
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,230
you will have no choice
but to conclude the,

91
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:03,770
he's one of the most loving and
caring people in all of show business.

92
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,510
If you want to see evidence of this,

93
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:08,930
you need only to look at him tearing up
in his last appearance on Letterman or

94
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:10,610
watch him crash.
The set of Conan,

95
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,850
not long after Conan learns that he's
losing the tonight show to Jay Leno.

96
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,620
According to someone who is at the show.

97
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:19,010
Conan was shaking the entire
time when the band spoon played.

98
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:22,010
He held up their vinyl to introduce
him and he was shaking even more.

99
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,770
Didn't nor makes his surprise appearance.

100
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,440
Well, I want to drop by show my
respects, you know. Well, you know,

101
00:06:28,441 --> 00:06:33,250
for you to bring up a basket
commemorating sort of the, the,

102
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,280
the tough situation I'm in is really nice.

103
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,020
Hello Salad.

104
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,760
That is well, what, what, what does
this basket or this is an older basket.

105
00:06:42,761 --> 00:06:47,320
I a I procrastinate as you
know, and uh, this is a basket.

106
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:48,880
I got you back in June.

107
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,130
No,

108
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:54,190
you've had this basket since
June. Yeah, I've seen you.

109
00:06:54,191 --> 00:06:56,920
You've been on the show like three times.
Why didn't you ever give me the basket?

110
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:01,090
I keep forgetting,
but I wanted you to know I bought it.

111
00:07:01,091 --> 00:07:06,070
It was $60. I wouldn't open
it. I think it would smell.

112
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,530
Okay.

113
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,740
Why does a card also I, yeah, I
see that it congrats. Yeah, that's,

114
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:17,370
that's terrific. Oh, I don't know if
that, can I read it? Yeah. Why not?

115
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,770
Congratulations Conan and finally securing
your place as permanent host of the

116
00:07:22,771 --> 00:07:23,120
tonight.

117
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,953
Sure.

118
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,710
That's something that
could never take away.

119
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,020
It is perhaps the shrewdest
programming decision ever.

120
00:07:46,021 --> 00:07:49,520
It made me see a brain trust.

121
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,790
Sure. The pressure is on, but
if I know you, Conan O'brien,

122
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,820
miserable failure is not an option yet.

123
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,370
The new late night.
Thank you.

124
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,613
Yeah.

125
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,080
He delivers this absolutely hilarious
bit and is able to make a hard situation

126
00:08:15,181 --> 00:08:18,940
so much lighter through laughter
after seeing how kind norm can beat.

127
00:08:18,941 --> 00:08:22,330
It's so hard to see him being dragged in
front of the view to apologize for his

128
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:22,780
comments,

129
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,440
which were so much less controversial
than the ones made by that Holocaust

130
00:08:26,441 --> 00:08:29,770
denying sidekick of his in the
Hollywood reporter interview.

131
00:08:29,771 --> 00:08:31,060
He first says that he's happy.

132
00:08:31,061 --> 00:08:34,780
The me too movement has slowed down
a bit and felt that people like Chris

133
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,100
Hardwick got the raw end of the stick.

134
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:40,000
He also talks about how we set up a call
between Lucy Keen Roseanne because they

135
00:08:40,001 --> 00:08:44,040
had the unique experience of having the
careers ended in one fell swoop and that

136
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:47,220
the victims did not experience
the same thing. Twitter,

137
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,730
a place which has mastered the art of
interpreting everything in the worst

138
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:54,580
possible way took this to mean that norm
thinks Louie and Rosanne had it worse

139
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:58,680
than the me two victims. He may have
been guilty of a poor choice of words,

140
00:08:58,681 --> 00:09:02,340
but if you allow him to explain himself,
that is very clearly not what he meant.

141
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,910
He simply felt bad for his friend Roseanne
and didn't know who could relate to

142
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:09,270
her situation other than Louie.
What happens after this?

143
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,960
His appearance on the tonight show was
canceled after Jimmy Fallon staffers were

144
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,790
apparently in tears. Come on, man,

145
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:18,180
as a brittle spirit and he had to go
under the view, not only to apologize,

146
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:21,390
but to apologize for his
previous apology on Howard Stern.

147
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,623
I said,

148
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:28,180
not many of us have gone through this
and and so you should talk to each other

149
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:32,710
because you've you. And then the guy said,
what about the victims? And I said, well,

150
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:36,850
the victims haven't gone through this.
I was talking about this particular event.

151
00:09:36,851 --> 00:09:40,000
Of course the victims have
gone through worse than that,

152
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,250
but I want to get a victim
to phone Roseanne. No, but
that's a good clarification.

153
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,080
I don't want to be tossed in with
people that actually did not crimes,

154
00:09:50,081 --> 00:09:54,150
but since our, you know, I, uh, no,

155
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,790
I barely have consensual sex.

156
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,150
I can't believe nor for apologizing
because none of us know what it's like to

157
00:10:04,151 --> 00:10:06,400
feel that kind of social
pressure being put on you.

158
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:10,720
And most of the people hitting on norm
by saying he cooks out by apologizing or

159
00:10:10,721 --> 00:10:14,560
the same people who would crumble if they
had to step on stage for even an open

160
00:10:14,561 --> 00:10:18,730
mic night. It takes insane balls to do
it. Norm has done throughout his career.

161
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:22,270
But getting the apology from
him is crucial for those
who are trying to drag the

162
00:10:22,271 --> 00:10:24,430
names of norm and others through the mind.

163
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,030
The best analogy I can make us to
Arthur Miller's play the crucible.

164
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,850
It is set in the hysteria
of the Salem witch trials.

165
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,070
The accused are given two options,

166
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,420
admitted their crimes in live or
deny wrongdoing and be executed.

167
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,780
The people who signed the false
confessions to save their life soon.

168
00:10:40,781 --> 00:10:44,980
Find out that those holding the trials
are using the confessions as validation

169
00:10:44,981 --> 00:10:47,380
and proof that the trials
being held are just,

170
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:51,280
and their decision to confess is actually
helping them condemn their friends who

171
00:10:51,281 --> 00:10:53,320
are denying the charges
levied against them.

172
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,740
Let us throw open the floor
to a wild accusations.

173
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,850
There are three steps which take place
in these media and Twitter. Witch hunts.

174
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,310
Step one,
the person must have something to lose.

175
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,940
They must believe that not admitting
guilt will land them in a worse situation

176
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:11,900
than there are now. Step two, you get
them to confess to their wrongdoing,

177
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:16,220
which gives validation to the inquisition
that is being held by his admission of

178
00:11:16,221 --> 00:11:20,270
guilt. Your actions as accuser have now
been justified in the mind of the public.

179
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,990
You can either proceed with the planned
execution in this case that would be

180
00:11:23,991 --> 00:11:27,470
protesting his show until it's
canceled or by your own mercy.

181
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,500
You will allow him to soak back with
his spirit thoroughly crushed if he

182
00:11:32,571 --> 00:11:35,120
promises now,
were you thinking twice before?

183
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,560
Yeah,
and it gets out of your mouth.

184
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,490
The beauty of someone like norm is that
he says exactly what comes to his mind

185
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:46,830
without thinking about how
his words will be interpreted.

186
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,910
If this man loses his will to speak
freely out of fear of repercussions,

187
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:55,120
it would be a travesty and we would have
destroyed perhaps the greatest comedian

188
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:59,690
of our generation.
The firestorm quickly died this time,

189
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,570
but it doesn't mean that others
will be so lucky in the future.

190
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,980
I'm glad to see the most,

191
00:12:03,981 --> 00:12:07,430
the internet seems to be on norm side
with this as a man of true comedic

192
00:12:07,431 --> 00:12:07,881
integrity,

193
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:11,990
he has always refused to compromise and
has constantly risked everything to tell

194
00:12:11,991 --> 00:12:14,460
the truth. And while it may have
held him back from the stardom,

195
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,530
he could have attained,

196
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,730
it has earned him a permanent place
as one of comedies all time greats,

197
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,550
woody Allen.

198
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:26,290
And they went on stage and a lot of
the people did much better than him.

199
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:31,790
And he was upset and his manager said,
no, no, it's what you leave on a stage.

200
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:36,170
That was his remark upon
woody Allen. And so, uh,

201
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,030
I always thought, well, I guy like
Andrew dice clay would destroy,

202
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,380
you know, and have me hitting the
wall, as you say. But then afterwards,

203
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:47,390
maybe it feel a little queasy,

204
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,880
whereas you kill and then you
leave something nice on the stage.

205
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,950
You know, it's one thing to make people
laugh. It's another to make people smile.

206
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:00,523
Wow.

207
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,310
Thank you guys for watching.

208
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,850

Cool.
