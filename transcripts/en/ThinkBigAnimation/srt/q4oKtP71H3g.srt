1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,003
Yeah.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,420
Uh,

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:09,491
in video three,

4
00:00:09,491 --> 00:00:13,630
we discussed the origins of the Socratic
method and how Socrates was using this

5
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:18,010
intense form of dialogue to try and
awakeness to a more meaningful and

6
00:00:18,011 --> 00:00:20,950
reflective way of life.
In this video,

7
00:00:20,951 --> 00:00:25,150
I want to build on the Socratic way of
thought and how these ideas parallel and

8
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:29,080
eventually merge with the type of
meaning we observed in ancient Israel.

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,200
If you want to be caught up,
you can check out those videos first.

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,430
Or if you don't like being told how to
live your life, just carry on from here.

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,990
A steady was given in which children
were presented with two rows of candy and

12
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:45,000
asked to choose which one they wanted.

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,470
We can clearly see it doesn't matter
which one they pick because both rose

14
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:54,471
contain five but almost every child would
reliably pick the bottom row because

15
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:55,374
it looked larger.

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,030
A child's perspective is only able to
focus in on a small amount of information,

17
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,130
so if something looks larger in
their mind, it must contain more.

18
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,360
It is an illusion we can easily see
through as adults because we possess a

19
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:14,220
perspective that the child is not before
you take this information and begin

20
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:16,320
rubbing it into the face
of your six year old.

21
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,970
I want to show you one more example.

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,950
The nine dots puzzle is well known to
many psychologists and the challenges to

23
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:27,540
drop for continuous straight lines which
go through the middle of all nine dots

24
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:31,530
without taking the pencil off the paper.
It seems pretty straightforward.

25
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,003
Hmm.

26
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,200
The problem is the way our
mind frames this puzzle.

27
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,490
We assume there was an invisible boundary
which forms at the edge of the box

28
00:01:42,491 --> 00:01:43,930
that we cannot go beyond,

29
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,640
but it is not until we step outside of
our initial perception that we are able

30
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:52,870
to solve it. When shown the answer,
many will say this is cheating,

31
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,530
but nowhere in the rules does
it say stay inside the box.

32
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,800
That is a restriction we impose on
ourselves with his method of a Linkous.

33
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,880
Socrates was trying to shock people out
of the nine dots of their day to day

34
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:07,720
concerns.

35
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:12,040
He felt the narrow perspective of his
fellow citizens with steering them towards

36
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,230
eighth thoughtless and selfish life.

37
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,450
Now we know Socrates was executed partly
for his disruptive form of philosophy,

38
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,690
but mostly for pulling a
Bart Simpson and his trial.

39
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,060
Socrates never wrote anything down,

40
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,700
so we don't have any firsthand
accounts of his life.

41
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,730
Everything we know about him
comes from secondhand accounts.

42
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,210
The most notable of these were
by Socrates student Plato.

43
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,490
Plato was traumatized by the execution
of his mentor and he spends the rest of

44
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:43,860
his life trying to understand how
people could be so foolish and so self

45
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:47,830
destructive that they would kill
someone as wise as Socrates.

46
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,780
Plato begins writing his dialogues,
which were essentially little plays,

47
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,470
most of which center around Socrates
and his method of a Linkous.

48
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,910
He did not write these dialogues simply
for us read or encounter the viewpoint

49
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:02,980
of Socrates.
Instead,

50
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,100
Plato is trying to get us to
see something about ourselves.

51
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,840
What he is trying to get us to realize
ties in with the two experiments we did

52
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:12,340
at the beginning of this video.

53
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,090
Let's say we take a child who is
looking at a problem they want to solve.

54
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,560
This is the child's perspective of the
problem and the parents is they're trying

55
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:22,060
to help them.
Of course,

56
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:26,530
the perspective of the adult encompasses
so much more because they have more

57
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:29,620
life experience as the adult helps them.

58
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,520
The child will begin to imitate the
words and actions of the adults.

59
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:38,110
One of the reasons our species has
thrived is that we are very powerful

60
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:41,500
imitators and we have an intense
trust in those we imitate.

61
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,450
This was shown very strongly
in an experiment in which
a chimp and a child are

62
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:48,160
each shown an opaque box.

63
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,950
The adults pulls and presses a series of
levers and a candy comes out the chimp

64
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:57,940
watches and does everything the
human does and gets the candy.

65
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,720
Then they repeat the experiment with
the child who does the same thing.

66
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,850
They repeat the steps and get the candy.

67
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,240
Then the experiment is repeated with a
box that is now completely transparent,

68
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,020
so it is obvious that the last action is
the only thing that releases the candy

69
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:18,310
and then the box is turned over to the
chimp and the chimp does only the last

70
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:20,200
action and gets the candy.

71
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,370
Then they give it to the child and the
child repeats all the steps they can

72
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:29,080
clearly see are useless,
not looking so good for team human,

73
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,690
but there's something very
important happening here.

74
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,600
The child may see that
all the steps are useless,

75
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:38,410
but they repeat them anyway because
a child trust that the adult has a

76
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:43,120
perspective which is greater than theirs
and has some purpose beyond what they

77
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:46,000
can understand as the child imitates,

78
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,810
they are gaining the ability to
internalize the adult's perspective.

79
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,250
It is very hard for us to recognize our
own biases because we live within our

80
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:57,640
own perspective and it can be
very difficult to see through it.

81
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,120
When the child begins to take on
the perspective of the adults,

82
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:05,650
they can now take on goals that are
much more longterm and far reaching.

83
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:09,250
Eventually the child doesn't
need the adult around anymore.

84
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,180
They have gained the ability to
take on a perspective of their own.

85
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,660
The child moves to adulthood
by internalizing the
mind of an adult's butts.

86
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,070
As we showed in the nine dot problem.

87
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,950
I have my own biases that
I can become trapped in.

88
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,900
If I approached this problem as a connect
the daughter solving a connect the dot

89
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:31,600
problem.
I will keep making the same mistakes,

90
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,710
but it is possible that there is a
perspective that is greater than mine,

91
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,680
which I could internalize to become wiser.

92
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,020
This is our idea of a sage.

93
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:45,700
They represent a perspective that can
see above and beyond what we can like the

94
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:49,600
child is to the adults.
The adults is to the sage.

95
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,860
I can become wiser by internalizing
someone wiser than me.

96
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:59,150
That is why Plato wants to give us
Socrates and acted as a living person.

97
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,970
He believes that if we
can internalize Socrates,

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,710
we can reorganize our psyche to live
a more harmonious and meaningful life.

99
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,360
Plato wants to understand why humanity
is so prone to foolish and self

100
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:15,530
destructive behavior and he creates a
psychological theory to account for this.

101
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,620
He says that each of us has
three centers of cognition.

102
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,130
There is the monster which
represents the appetites,

103
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:27,200
the lion which represents honor and
the man which represents reason.

104
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,950
He believed these three centers of our
cognition and we're constantly getting

105
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:35,480
into conflict and anyone who has ever
tried to set longterm goals knows this to

106
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:36,314
be true.

107
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:41,530
The recidivism and failure rate for any
new diet is around 95% the reasoning

108
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,330
part of our brain knows
that we should eat better,

109
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,670
that it would make us
healthier and happier,

110
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,180
but our appetite overpowers
our longterm goals.

111
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,590
Another part of our psyche is responsible
for looking at all the possible

112
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:57,440
consequences our actions
might have in the future,

113
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,580
but we all know this voice is much,
much quieter.

114
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,850
The final piece of this
model is that the lion,

115
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,380
it is not quite our emotions or feelings,
but more like our spirit.

116
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,020
The lion represents our socialization.

117
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,520
It represents that process
of internalization and
we talked about earlier.

118
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,810
It is how we adopt the perspective
of other people onto ourselves.

119
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,610
Plato says that we can teach the men
who can then train the lion and together

120
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,310
the lion and the man
can control the monster.

121
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,330
It is the internalization
of Socrates or the sage,

122
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,870
which empowers us to deal with our
own self destructive tendencies.

123
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,560
This is a radical transformation and
reorganization of the psyche and Plato

124
00:07:41,781 --> 00:07:44,690
argues that we have a
fundamental desire to do this.

125
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,150
We want this conflict to be resolved.

126
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:52,510
We want to experience inner peace and we
are craving a culture within ourselves.

127
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:57,140
Plato takes these ideas and links them
together. In his most famous story,

128
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:01,610
the allegory of the cave, there's a group
of people who are trapped in a cave,

129
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:06,820
chained facing a wall with a fire burning
behind them and puppeteers casting

130
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:12,170
shadows against the wall of the cave. The
people chained cannot turn their heads.

131
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,940
They could only watch the shadows and
they believe these are what is real.

132
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,740
One person gets free from his
chains and turns around. At first,

133
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:25,760
he is blinded by the light of the fire
until his eyes adjust and he can now look

134
00:08:25,761 --> 00:08:30,320
at his surroundings. The fire reveals
a pathway going up and out of the cave.

135
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,070
As he starts to walk up the path with
the light of the real world blinds him

136
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:35,840
even more until again,

137
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:40,400
his eyes adjust and now he can see
the real world outside of the cave.

138
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,280
He wants to see the source of
all the light in the world.

139
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:48,020
So we observed the sun and then he goes
back down into the cave to tell the rest

140
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:52,700
of the people that what they think
is real is an illusion. Of course,

141
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,830
his eyes are now adjusted to the light,
not the dark,

142
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,990
and he stumbles about and looks
like nothing but a madman to Plato.

143
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,760
It is the philosopher that makes this a
scent and this journey into the light is

144
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:10,410
Plato's theory of enlightenment.
So here's our psyche.

145
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,520
It is disorganized, are different,
natures are at war with each other.

146
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,970
We learn to internalize
Socrates or the sage,

147
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,390
which puts us a little more
in order as we do this.

148
00:09:21,391 --> 00:09:26,040
Our inner conflict is reduced.
We can see into the world more clearly.

149
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,430
We are more connected to reality
and how things really are.

150
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,030
As we see the world more clearly,
what is real,

151
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,540
what is truthful now
becomes more salient to us.

152
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,420
It starts to have more of
an impact on our psyche.

153
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,980
We are less trapped within our bias
perspectives. We gain more inner peace,

154
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,730
which in turn allows us to see
even more deeply into reality.

155
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,740
This allows us to internalize the sage
even deeper and this process continues to

156
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:56,910
feed back onto itself.
This is how we walk out of the cave.

157
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:02,070
This is Plato's is sent
into the light to Plato.

158
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,540
This is what makes life meaningful and
in was this meaning that Socrates was

159
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:07,770
willing to die for.

160
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,700
We can see that this is different from
the form of meaning we saw in ancient

161
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:16,701
Israel both focused on moving from the
mundane world of self deception and self

162
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:21,330
destruction into the real
world or the world of paradise.

163
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,950
In future videos,

164
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,730
we're going to look at how these
ideas emerge and grow together.

165
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,640
Then we're going to look
at how they were all lost,

166
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,080
and that is the meaning crisis
we detailed in episode one.

167
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,130
Yeah.
