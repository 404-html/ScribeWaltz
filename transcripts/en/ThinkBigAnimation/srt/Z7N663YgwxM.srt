1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,303
Uh,

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,870
today we are going to be looking
at some VI uplifting writing,

3
00:00:10,871 --> 00:00:15,760
an Edgar Allen Poe syndicate, red
death, illimitable dominion over.

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,150
Wow,
that's depressing.

5
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:23,151
Let's tone it down a bit on some fun on
bidding on I ponder the weekend weary

6
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,760
over many acquainting. Curious
volume move, forgotten on.

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,590
I nodded,
nearly napping.

8
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:36,210
Suddenly there came a tapping
as if someone gently rapping,

9
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:39,600
rapping it in my chamber
door to some visitor.

10
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,690
I muttered tapping at my chamber
door only this and nothing.

11
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,750
So the ominous mood set for one of
the most famous poems ever written,

12
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,690
coming from a generation of
horror stories like Stephen King.

13
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:55,810
It is very interesting to look back
at someone like Edgar Allen Poe,

14
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,570
who's riding while much more
subtle than we are used to.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,270
It's still capable of sending
chills down your spine.

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,170
I'm going to first look at the structure
of the Raven as it is a very carefully

17
00:01:06,171 --> 00:01:07,040
organized poem.

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,050
The rhyme scheme scene in the first
stanza is repeated throughout the poem as

19
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:14,710
well as the internal rhyme scheme.
That is the rhymes within the same line.

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,460
It feels impossible not to be
swept off by the hypnotic rhythm,

21
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:23,170
which like a drum beat slowly built in
speed and intensity until it reaches a

22
00:01:23,171 --> 00:01:27,070
fever pitch where you can imagine this
speaker yelling at the top of his lungs,

23
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,090
Podo, something very interesting on
the second, fourth and fifth lungs.

24
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:35,410
Each line ending with the rhyme or is
one syllable shorter than the other two

25
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,770
and we can clearly see the final
line is much shorter than the rest.

26
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:43,060
The result is that when the raven enters
and utters the ominous word, never more,

27
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:47,290
it hangs in the reader's mind emphasizing
and exaggerating how this word

28
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,760
repeatedly spoken by the Raven, slowly
burrows its way into the speaker's mind,

29
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,130
driving him to the brink of insanity.

30
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,300
What starts out as a story of a talking
raven quickly spirals into a story of a

31
00:01:58,301 --> 00:02:03,160
man descending into his own personal hell.
I told you this would be cheerful,

32
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,350
so not much is happening at the start
just to man sitting alone reading old

33
00:02:08,351 --> 00:02:09,070
books.

34
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,460
We find out the room is filled with Purple
Silk Curtains and velvet line chairs

35
00:02:12,461 --> 00:02:15,310
in a library of old sophisticated books.

36
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,240
It is the creepy house in every ghost
story and it seems like the perfect place

37
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:20,620
for someone to sit and brood

38
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,780
distinctly.

39
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,780
I remember it was in the bleak Duesenberg
and it's separate dying ember Reuters

40
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,400
ghost upon the floor eagerly.

41
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:34,300
I wish the moral Vinnie had I
sought to borrow from my books.

42
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,570
So Cecil sorrow,
sorrow for the [inaudible],

43
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,650
for the Rem Radian meeting,
the angel's name,

44
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,570
nameless here for ever more.

45
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,010
So we find out the man is trying to bury
his sorrow due to his loss of a love.

46
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,550
A woman named Lenore. We don't know
who she is or what happened to her.

47
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,330
All we know is that this
man is desperately trying to
relieve the pain of losing

48
00:02:58,331 --> 00:03:02,380
her and we know the best way to get
over a girl is to brood and get all my

49
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:03,700
chemical romance about it.

50
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,210
He starts to have hallucinations
about her perfume filling the room and

51
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:11,200
longingly remembers her ass print on
the velvet cushions. Little weird,

52
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:13,240
but we all take heartbreak
a little differently.

53
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,240
I'm the silicon said,

54
00:03:15,241 --> 00:03:20,241
uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
thrilled me fill me with fantastic

55
00:03:20,251 --> 00:03:21,840
terros.
Never felt before.

56
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,650
Most of us probably know the feeling of
watching a horror movie and having every

57
00:03:25,651 --> 00:03:27,960
creak of the house set.
Our nerves are on edge.

58
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,270
That seems to be what is
happening to our speaker here.

59
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,950
Then there's a rapping at the door.
This could represent a great many things.

60
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,150
First off, it is the unknown is
the introduction of the stranger.

61
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,020
The Stranger is not a person,
but rather a category of experience.

62
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,230
It is the introduction of
anomaly and uncertainty,

63
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,060
which shakes up the status
quo. The stranger fills us
with both hope and dread.

64
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,620
He can inspire us, shower us
with gifts, or he can kill us.

65
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,701
In this case,

66
00:03:56,701 --> 00:04:00,390
the tapping at the door appears as a
disruption of the serene state within this

67
00:04:00,391 --> 00:04:01,800
man's comfortable chamber.

68
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,290
Presently, my soul grows stronger,
hesitating then no longer

69
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,660
so finally built up the
courage to open the door,

70
00:04:08,661 --> 00:04:13,661
only to find darkness and nothing back

71
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,750
the chamber turning all my
soul within the burning sooner.

72
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:20,990
Ghana hood at tapping
somewhat louder than before.

73
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,750
Soon he realizes the tapping is coming
from the window and he tries to comfort

74
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:25,584
himself,

75
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,310
does the wind and nothing more open.

76
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:34,311
Here I flung the shutter when with many
a flirt and flutter in the step to state

77
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,440
the Raven of the saint need days of Yore,

78
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,060
not the least of basins made he
let a minute stop to a statey,

79
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,900
but with mean of Lord or lady
perched above my chamber door,

80
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:51,410
perched upon the bust of partners just
above my chamber door pitched and sat and

81
00:04:52,081 --> 00:04:52,914
nothing more.

82
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,750
And what do you do when a
bird flies into your house?

83
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,290
Obviously you start talking to it.
If you're a crazy person

84
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,210
though the Crespi shown
and shaven though I said,

85
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:05,350
I sure know craven gas,

86
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,940
the grim and ancient raven
wandering from the nightly shore.

87
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,450
Tell me what the law,

88
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,550
the name is on the nights
Plutonian shore quote,

89
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:17,460
the Raven Nevermore.

90
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,990
It is clear.
This is no ordinary bird.

91
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,890
He calls it a stately raven of the days
of Yore and he's clearly approaching it

92
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:28,540
with awe and respect, as you probably
know from reading Norse mythology. Okay,

93
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,660
who are we kidding? As you probably know
from the movie anchorman, the Norse God.

94
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:36,190
Odin has two companion Raven's named
Hugans and Muninn roughly translated to

95
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:40,660
thought and memory whom Odin gave the
power of speech just as Hugans and Muninn

96
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:44,290
pry beneath the surface of the world in
order to bring hidden truth to Oden's

97
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:44,920
ears.

98
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,730
So to does our speaker pry into the
hidden knowledge he believes the Raven to

99
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:53,080
possess the Raven has purchased
self atop the bust of palace.

100
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,940
Another name for the Greek Goddess Athena,

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,120
most commonly known as the goddess of
even more connection to the Raven as a

102
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:00,950
source of knowledge and insight.

103
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,790
And there was another
mythological reference when
he says the night's Plutonian

104
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,350
shore Pluto,

105
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:09,560
who you'll probably know better as
Haiti's was god of the underworld.

106
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,540
A Raven often depicts it,

107
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:15,830
a top skeletons or scavenging a field
of human corpses seems exactly like the

108
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:18,170
kind of beast that would
occupy our nightmares.

109
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,450
It also perfectly sets the mood for this
dark and brooding pool of a man alone

110
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:27,800
in his room or depending on how you look
at it alone in his mind with nothing to

111
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:31,700
occupy him but his own disturbing
thoughts and memories. Now,

112
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:34,460
the communication between the
man and the refund continues.

113
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,910
The question starts simple.
He first asked the ravens name.

114
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:42,380
He then asks if on the morrow he will
leave me as my hopes have flown before.

115
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,280
Then the bird said never more.

116
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,800
Then upon the velvet seeking,

117
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,180
I took myself to linking fancy
on the fancy thinking, what?

118
00:06:52,181 --> 00:06:53,620
This ominous bird of yours,

119
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,160
what this grim on game day gasoline
gone an ominous burden of your meant and

120
00:06:59,681 --> 00:07:00,790
cooking and nevermind.

121
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,250
He keeps posing more and more
serious questions to the Raven.

122
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,590
The main already knows the
answer to each question.

123
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,040
It's still he holds on hope that the
raven will tell him something different,

124
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,620
but soon as he digs deeper,

125
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,610
the answers we'll begin to peck
and pry on comfortably at his mind.

126
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,400
He asks if the thing he most
longs for to see his loss,

127
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:22,190
Lynn nor will ever come to be

128
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,300
quote the Raven nevermore

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000

Deslie jet all on daunted Nanda.

131
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:42,241

132

133
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,000

134
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,550
Is there bombing Giliad is just a fancy
pants way of asking if you will ever

135
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:54,960
find relief from his sorrow.

136
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,490
Quote the Raven nevermore

137
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,960
be that word I sign of partying.
Brutal feeding.

138
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:07,530
Nice shrieked upstarting get the back
into the tempest and the knights Plutonian

139
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:12,380
shore leave. No black plume as
a token of that lied I sold,

140
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:16,940
have spoken. Lead my loneliness
unbroken. Quit the buster above my door.

141
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,690
Take ty beak from out my heart and
take life form and what my door caught.

142
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,650
The never mom,

143
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,700
the speaker is blaming all his pain and
sorrow on the appearance of the Raven

144
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,720
and shrieks for it to go. But the
Raven refused. It is the old adage,

145
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,360
wherever you go,
there you are.

146
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:40,040
The Raven now appears to be
a dark fragment within the
man's soul and something

147
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,360
he's completely incapable of escape.

148
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,590
No matter how hard we
tried to banish them,

149
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:50,030
the ravens have our own thoughts and
memories will forever remain is our

150
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:51,470
constant companions.

151
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,400
And the Raven never flooding.
Still is sitting,

152
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,400
still is sitting on the pallet bust of
palace just above my chamber door and his

153
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:08,211
eyes have all the seeming of demons that
is dreaming and the lamp light oil in

154
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:12,090
streaming throws his shadow on the floor.

155
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,840
And my soul amount,

156
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,940
that shadow that lies floating
on the floor shall be lifted.

157
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,330
Never.
