1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,233
Okay.

2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,070
Something strange has been happening in
the remote area of a forest near King's

3
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:14,904
castle.

4
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:15,430
Huh?

5
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,720
Every hundred that goes near this area
disappears never to be seen again.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,500
Others are sent to search for
them and they go missing as well.

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,910
People begin to believe this
area is cursed and decide
simply never to go there.

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,840
A hunter shows up one day and asked the
king if there is any dangerous work that

9
00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:32,674
needs to be done.

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,550
The king immediately tells him about
the forest and warns him of the strange

11
00:00:36,551 --> 00:00:37,480
disappearances.

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,500
This turns out to be exactly the type
of adventure the hunter was seeking,

13
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,050
so he sets out the young hunter,

14
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:46,870
wanders with his dog into the
forest until they pass upon.

15
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:52,540
Suddenly a hand reaches up from the water,
grabs the dog and pause it underneath.

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,990
As much as he loved the dog,
the young man doesn't become hysterical.

17
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,160
He simply recognizes that this is
the place he goes back to the castle.

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,760
Then rounds up three men and together
they returned to bucket the water out of

19
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:06,730
the pond.
It is slow and monotonous work,

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,500
but they get to the bottom and discover
a large man covered in hair from head to

21
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:16,480
toe. His hair has reddish like rusty
iron, so they give him the name Iron John.

22
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,440
They take him back to the castle where
he is immediately imprisoned by the king

23
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,870
who then gives the key
into the care of the queen.

24
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,180
When a man looks into his psyche deep
underneath the water in a place no one has

25
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:32,590
visited for a very long time, he finds
this ancient hairy man line there,

26
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,750
man, as we see him today is a
late, an uncommon phenomenon,

27
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,360
a blip on the radar of human history.

28
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,830
Only recently has there
been a rapid evolution where
all of our animal instincts

29
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:47,410
have become useless and
in order to survive,

30
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:51,880
we must now rely on our conscious mind
rather than our unconscious impulses.

31
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,570
If we do actually discover
this wild men exist within us,

32
00:01:55,571 --> 00:02:00,010
what is our first impulse to lock
him up and pretend he isn't there?

33
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,570
Parents,

34
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:05,530
teachers and ministers and principals
have been telling us our entire life that

35
00:02:05,531 --> 00:02:08,560
we should have nothing to do with him,
that we should be frightened of him.

36
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,140
When he comes out in school,
we medicate him away.

37
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,400
One day the Kings eight year old son is
playing in the courtyard with a golden

38
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:19,450
ball. He loves, he loses the ball
and it rolls into iron John's cage.

39
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,200
If he wants it back, he must approached
the wild man and ask him for it.

40
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,930
The boy is eight and it is around this
age that all of us boy or girl loses

41
00:02:28,931 --> 00:02:30,430
something of incredible value.

42
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,600
This is the same golden ball in the
princess and the frog that is lost the

43
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:35,560
bottom of the pond.

44
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,910
It is also the golden ball that Harry
Potter is so desperately trying to catch.

45
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,790
It represents the most
important thing in our lives.

46
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,270
It reminds us of that unity of
personality we had as children.

47
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,080
I kind of radiance or
wholeness we possessed before
the more difficult aspects

48
00:02:50,081 --> 00:02:53,770
of life began to set in.
If we still have the ball in kindergarten,

49
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,650
we lose it in grade school.
If we still have it in grade school,

50
00:02:56,651 --> 00:03:00,820
we lose it in high school and once the
ball is we spend the rest of our lives

51
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:04,660
trying to get it back. Obviously this
wouldn't be much of a story of iron.

52
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:07,300
John simply gave the ball back to him.
Instead,

53
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,780
our psyche is a deal maker and we
must be willing to bargain with it.

54
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,510
So Iron John offers the boy a deal.

55
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,200
He will give the ball back if
the boy agrees to open the cage.

56
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,820
The boy gets frightened and runs off, but
he returns to the next day. In reality,

57
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:25,030
this day that has passed might
be 10 years. On the second day,

58
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:29,050
the boy can now be 25 he asks,
can I have my ball back?

59
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,280
The wild man says, yes. If
you let me out of my cage,

60
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,230
the boy hears him,

61
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,640
but by now he has two Toyotas or
mortgage and possibly a wife and kids.

62
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,400
How can he possibly let the wild man out?

63
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:46,930
Now he leaves again without saying
a word and returns the next day.

64
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,940
On this third day, perhaps another
10 years have passed the boys.

65
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,120
Now 35 look into the eyes of a 35
year old man in what do you see?

66
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,070
Men that are overworked, alienated,
and completely beaten down by life.

67
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,550
Again, he asks him, can I have my
ball back? The wild man says, yes.

68
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,020
If you've let me out of my cage this time,
the boy responds.

69
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,380
Even if I wanted to let you out,
I don't know where the key is.

70
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,570
The Wild men tells him the key is
under his mother's pillow. It is here.

71
00:04:18,571 --> 00:04:22,380
The story takes a very Freudian turn
in case you're not familiar with Freud.

72
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,380
In one of his more famous ideas,
the Oedipus complex,

73
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,950
he describes what he thought
of as a universal infant tile,

74
00:04:28,951 --> 00:04:33,630
which we all have to kill our fathers
and sleep with our mothers and vice versa

75
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:35,250
for father daughter relationships,

76
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,930
something we are still
vehemently suppressing to this
very day and now you know

77
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:42,450
why? Literally everyone
in the world hates Freud.

78
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,190
While many believe he's mistaken in his
attempt to reduce all general problems

79
00:04:47,191 --> 00:04:49,890
of humanity down to this
kind of repressed sexuality,

80
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,770
he was able to diagnose
a very real problem.

81
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,910
It is the stereotype of the father with
a shotgun at his daughter's wedding or

82
00:04:56,911 --> 00:04:59,760
the 30 year old man living
in his mother's basement.

83
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,730
It is the overbearing and
overprotective tendency.

84
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,730
All parents and especially
mothers feel for their children,

85
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,170
but it is wrong except in extreme
cases to place the blame on the mother.

86
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:14,580
As many in the 40 in school are prone
to do for where would we all be without

87
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:18,720
the fierce protection we receive from
our mothers and another time it was the

88
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:22,530
tribe who decide when to take the boy
away from his mother and guide his

89
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:23,880
transition into adulthood.

90
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,910
These initiation rights would
be incredibly challenging.

91
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,310
The boy would be left
out in the wilderness,

92
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,720
have his body covered in fire ants or
left somewhere clinging halfway between

93
00:05:33,721 --> 00:05:34,554
life and death.

94
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,550
While you might say there is no place
for this in a civilized society,

95
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,720
the complete absence of initiation along
with the epidemic of the 30 year old

96
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:46,740
man child we see today might have some
correlation. The message is clear.

97
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,880
At some point there must be a clean
break from the family and a proper

98
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:55,170
transition into adulthood.
But our most common form of initiation,

99
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:58,520
today's the Frat,
it is boys initiating boys.

100
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,780
There are few men and even fewer who are
actively guiding the initiation of the

101
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:06,440
next generation.
So for many the key remains hidden.

102
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,270
No matter what it takes,

103
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:12,560
he must get the key back and he must
realize that nobody is going to come along

104
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:16,400
and do it for him.
The keys being held underneath the pillow,

105
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,330
perhaps in our parents' dreams
and expectations for us,

106
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,920
they wanted to raise a doctor or a lawyer
and they definitely did not want to

107
00:06:23,921 --> 00:06:28,060
raise a wild man. The boy agrees to
take the key and free orange and John,

108
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,870
but as he's opening the cage,
he cuts his finger on the rusty lock,

109
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:36,400
breaking away from the parents, define
their wishes and freeing the wild man.

110
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:40,960
These things will always cause a wound.
These wounds come in various forms.

111
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,040
It can be dealt in a single blow or it
can be a steady, poisoned drip of shame.

112
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:49,420
Constantly reminding you how you are not
living up to their standards and many

113
00:06:49,421 --> 00:06:53,560
primitive societies. Outward scarring is
given as a reminder of internal scars.

114
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,680
The important distinction is that the
scarring is not coming from a place of

115
00:06:56,681 --> 00:06:59,590
cruelty but rather from a
place of profound meaning.

116
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,390
There is a reason children were scars
and broken bones as badges of honor.

117
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,700
They are looked at with awe and respect.

118
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,610
Adolescence is a time of
extreme risk and suffering.

119
00:07:09,611 --> 00:07:14,320
Wounds is essential to our growth. Once
we are wounded, we have a few options.

120
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,690
We can take the road of grandiosity.

121
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,640
We tried to rise above it all but like
Peter Pan or ICARUS, we fly too high.

122
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,150
We turn into megalomaniacs
or remain naive children.

123
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,450
We can take the road of
numbness and turn into addicts.

124
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,050
If modern men were a bullfighter,

125
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,390
he would simply let the bolts trample
over his body and then wallow in self pity

126
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:39,250
and talk about how unavoidable it was
medicating himself with alcohol, drugs,

127
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,820
porn or worst of all memes.

128
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,890
Or we can choose not to forget our wounds
but also not to wallow in self pity.

129
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,520
Instead, we can use them to uncover
the real depths of our potential,

130
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,810
where our wound is.
That is where our genius would be found.

131
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,850
Now that Iron John has set free,
the boy has a few options.

132
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,640
He can stay and take all
the blame for releasing him.

133
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:08,770
He can soak in pity over his wounded
finger, or you can run away with him.

134
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,940
Of course, we know what the boy will
do just as we know what we all must do.

135
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,680
So once the boy has runaway and
followed Iron John into the wilderness,

136
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:22,090
what happens next? Well, that
is a story for another day.

137
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,290
Thank you so much for watching,
and if you enjoyed the video,

And of course we'll leave a comment
because I love to hear from you guys.

140
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,043
Thank you.

141

Sure.
