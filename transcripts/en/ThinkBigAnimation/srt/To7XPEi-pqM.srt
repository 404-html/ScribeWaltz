1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,923
Okay.

2
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:09,603
No,

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,721
that's going to be assume like,

4
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:14,020
it's so scary because you think if
you'd like to that pit of unhappiness,

5
00:00:14,021 --> 00:00:17,320
like the lowest get your defaults
and happiness, but when I let go,

6
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:21,520
I realize like it wasn't happiness,
it was happiness and this. I was like,

7
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,690
Holy Shit.
You know,

8
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:26,660
it's like we're literally all hanging
onto the side of a cliff and you know

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,820
someone's billows like, let go. I'll
catch you. You're like, no, if I let go,

10
00:00:30,821 --> 00:00:32,980
I'll die.
And then you actually do let go.

11
00:00:32,981 --> 00:00:35,170
But he requires so much to
just like go cause again,

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,690
you've been hanging on
your entire fucking life.

13
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,090
Everything you've been doing
has been reinforcing it.

14
00:00:40,091 --> 00:00:42,370
Assumption upon assumption upon
assumption, belief, belief. It's like,

15
00:00:42,371 --> 00:00:46,540
hang on or I will die. And you think that
the journey is just to keep hanging on.

16
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:49,630
It's like let go.
Easier said than done.

17
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,090
It's easy to do but hard to do.

18
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:58,240
You make that false assumption
that our default is unhappy. Wrong.

19
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,380
Okay.

20
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:04,380
That false assumption is the cause of
every bad thing in your life and a that's

21
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:09,400
huge. Consciously, it's not as hard
to let go. While your problems,

22
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,940
it's not as hard to let go of that wrong
assumption because you're conscious of

23
00:01:12,941 --> 00:01:13,450
it.

24
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,100
The hard part is this assumption is
buried deep down in your subconscious and

25
00:01:18,101 --> 00:01:18,851
that's the tough part.

26
00:01:18,851 --> 00:01:22,510
It's sitting down and diving into it
and this is the shit that's fucking

27
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:23,290
terrifying.

28
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,590
This is the shit that's the scariest thing
you'll do in your entire fucking life.

29
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:29,590
It's sitting down and diving into it.
Bad Memories.

30
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,140
Do you want to be aware
of different bad memories?

31
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,220
Do you want to be aware of every
fucking rejection you experienced

32
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,110
Carol?
Stuffing in your subconscious?

33
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,350
Do you want to be aware of different
emotions? You're angry, you feel guilty.

34
00:01:44,351 --> 00:01:45,550
You shoved that in your subconscious.

35
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,120
Different emotional traumas
as you're growing up.

36
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,050
Shove that in your subconscious. We're
just shoving all this shit and stuff.

37
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,880
It's like the trash bin of
her fucking mind. I was like,

38
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,020
just throw it in the trash. Never focused
on like never be aware of it again,

39
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,700
but just cause we shoved it there.

40
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:03,100
Just cause we're not focusing on
it doesn't mean it goes anywhere.

41
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,590
It's still there. You're just not
aware of, you know, Eckhart toll calls,

42
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:08,020
this pain body attack for example,

43
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,160
something happens and you get extremely
mad more than you logically slash

44
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,880
consciously think you
shouldn't be mad about right.

45
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,850
That's when Shit that you've been
stuffed down kind of pops out.

46
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,480
It kind of takes over, but it's not just
anger because we think, oh pain body,

47
00:02:22,481 --> 00:02:26,250
it's anything that's painful.
What's another one? [inaudible]

48
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:31,600
logically we know it doesn't fucking
make sense to be that scared something

49
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:35,290
takes over.
Fear of rejection.

50
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,310
Is that like a logical like
from a conscious perspective
like is it make sense

51
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:41,890
to me that fucking scared?
No,

52
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,580
that is a pain body attack and that's
like the process is like sitting down and

53
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:49,090
being like, what have I store down there?
Again, it's not running away from it.

54
00:02:49,091 --> 00:02:53,140
It's like stopping facing it and like
bringing that shit up and experiencing it

55
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,400
and that's why it's like so fucking
hard and that sort of so stubborn.

56
00:02:57,401 --> 00:03:01,240
It's like we just don't want to just
fucking keep putting it off no matter what

57
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:04,780
it takes. Thinking that maybe someday
it'll just magically click them all.

58
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:08,710
Just be happy. New. Okay. You
cannot run away from the pain.

59
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:12,970
You got to run through it.
Focus. Next time you have
that little pain, body attack,

60
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,500
next time something's triggered.

61
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:19,770
Maybe someone says something that upsets
you more than it should instead of what

62
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:20,870
do we all do?
As I said before,

63
00:03:20,871 --> 00:03:25,480
we tried to escape it instead of running
away from it. Go into that. Like again,

64
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:27,370
you break up with your girlfriend.
There's another one,

65
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,760
like all this trauma kicks in.
Don't go for the fucking drink.

66
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,570
Don't go for the drugs. Don't go for
the party. Don't go for the movie.

67
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,300
Don't go for the video game. Don't go
for the food. Don't try to escape it.

68
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,580
Go into that shit. That's
the way there. And uh, again,

69
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,410
you're fighting experience resistance.

70
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,070
She'll probably have to go
into the resistance first on.

71
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,510
You're probably gonna be scared shitless
to cause you think if you let a little

72
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:51,690
bit of it out, everything will
fucking come out. And that is true.

73
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:55,980
Everything will come out like you'll,
you'll be in fuck tears.

74
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,680
It'll just be absolute hell.
That will happen.

75
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,680
But that's the only way to
actually process it because
you're just hanging on it.

76
00:04:03,681 --> 00:04:07,890
And until you let go of that shit, it's
always going to block you from getting,

77
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:11,610
finding that default that is happens.
Bring awareness to it.

78
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,790
Don't run away from it.
Let it come up. And again,

79
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,040
this is hard because our conditioning
to society keeps telling you,

80
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:17,701
run away from pain,

81
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:20,670
went away from pain towards pleasure
to hear it go towards the pain,

82
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,170
let it come up. Um, embody it fully.

83
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,670
Let go of the resistance around it. And
then of course, actually experience it.
