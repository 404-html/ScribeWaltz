1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,950
Okay, children. Now I want to review
the different sexual positions.

2
00:00:03,951 --> 00:00:06,590
Who can tell me which sexual
positions we talked about

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:11,270
humans sucks you out. We've been
engaging in it since the dawn of time.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,790
Why is something so hardware into our
DNA become a source of moral, ethical,

5
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:17,960
and religious taboo?

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,430
That's right.
Doggy style.

7
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:25,170
We went over pile driver [inaudible] pile,
driver position,

8
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:26,004
good coy

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,460
cultural anthropologists,

10
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,930
Ernest Becker speculates as six became
the source of moral taboo and restriction

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,230
because it taps us into our
most basic animal nature.

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,820
Humans learned to cope
with our own mortality by
embedding ourselves in cultural

13
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:40,660
symbolism.

14
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:46,060
We feel a strong desire to exist as
spiritual beings and these animalistic

15
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:50,200
behaviors threaten the very structure
we use to cope with our own mortality.

16
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,210
Even though we're out of the middle ages,

17
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,630
we're still feeling the ripple effect
of thousands of years of repressed

18
00:00:55,631 --> 00:00:56,490
sexuality.

19
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,240
And the beginning, we were all fish, okay.

20
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:04,250
Swimming around in the water and then one
day a couple of fish had a retard baby.

21
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,060
So retard fish goes on and
make more retard babies.

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,530
And then that had a retard baby,
which was a monkey fish frog.

23
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,700
So there you go.

24
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,630
You're the retarded offspring of five
monkeys haven't butt sex with a fish.

25
00:01:17,631 --> 00:01:18,950
Squirrel.
Congratulations.

26
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,180
We've had a lot of social
progress over the last 50 years.

27
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,930
We've evolved past the,
I love Lucy Macho man house.

28
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:29,730
My paradigm in the fifties in the sixties
and seventies men began to embrace the

29
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:33,490
long hair, colorful clothes
and a more carefree lifestyle.

30
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,710
Women were doing just the opposite.

31
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,980
There were magnifying their
inner masculine direction,

32
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,930
clarity of purpose and vision.

33
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,620
No masculine or feminine does
not mean male or female. Either.

34
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:46,240
Gender can take on both roles.

35
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,560
And in recent years we've become more
and more focused on being less rigid in

36
00:01:50,561 --> 00:01:54,580
our gendered roles while are focused
on a quality has led to a lot of social

37
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:58,180
progress and no one is arguing
that equality is a bad thing.

38
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,980
We have reached a sort of 50 50
stage. Listen, uh, quality is great,

39
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:07,180
but our society has started to smooth
out our natural masculine and feminine

40
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:10,870
differences. And this has seeped
into most people's relationships.

41
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,010
Sexual similarities.

42
00:02:12,011 --> 00:02:16,570
One of the major causes of unhappiness
and intimacy is led to social and

43
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:20,050
economic equality,
but also in sexual neutrality.

44
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,570
Bank accounts are balancing
ball passions are fizzling out.

45
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,160
The key to sexual attraction
is based on sexual polarity.

46
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,420
This is the force of passion that flows
between masculine and feminine polls.

47
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,650
The polls between people create the flow
of sexual feelings. If you want passion,

48
00:02:36,651 --> 00:02:39,230
you need a rabbi Asher in a rabbit sheet.
Otherwise,

49
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:41,960
you have two buddies who
decided to rub genitals and bed.

50
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,980
There's a scale of sexual polarity that
everyone will fall into with most people

51
00:02:45,981 --> 00:02:50,150
having either a more masculine or more
feminine pole with a minority of people

52
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:53,540
having a more neutral polarity
or androgynous sexual essence.

53
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,040
It is important to realize that masculine
or feminine isn't male or female,

54
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,540
either gender take on both roles,
but for simplicity sake,

55
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,720
we're going to focus on sexual
polarity between a man and a woman.

56
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,700
Real sexual attraction will come when
there was a natural arc and flow between

57
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:14,230
the two poles. As a generation
of men grow weaker and weaker,

58
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,380
thus having a kind of neutered
expression of their masculine core.

59
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,890
Women tend to have to express their
masculine energy more and more.

60
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,000
Ask any women actively dating in
the world right now and often?

61
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:27,610
Their biggest complaint will be
that men these days are soft,

62
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,730
pussies or unable to take
lead and take charge.

63
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,150
A new term has even been
coined for him in like this.

64
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,020
Knowing where you sit on this scale is
important because you will always find

65
00:03:39,021 --> 00:03:41,540
yourself the most attracted
to your sexual reciprocal.

66
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,290
This is why people who are closer to the
androgynous part of the scale will be

67
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,260
attracted to other people
with a more neutral sexuality.

68
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,820
While extremely masculine men will often
be seen with extremely feminine women.

69
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:58,580
This strong arc between the two Poles is
where the most passion, drama, emotion,

70
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,910
love, hate, tears, and
joy are going to happen.

71
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,020
This is why every love story features
two people on opposite poles.

72
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,560
You rarely see a passionately
androgynous love story.

73
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,960
The bottom line up today's
50 50 relationship is this.

74
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,140
If we cling to a politically
correct sameness,

75
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,310
even in moments of intimacy than
sexual attraction disappears.

76
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,980
The love and friendship may still exist,

77
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,610
but sexual polarity fades
and true passion is dead.

78
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,490
We have a Roni slowly begun to deny,

79
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,270
smooth out and neutralize our
masculine and feminine differences.

80
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,710
Because of this, people often end up
denying their deepest core desires.

81
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,690
Women complain about men who are wimps.
They have no purpose, no direction,

82
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,410
and an inability to have a spine to
go for what they really want. In Life,

83
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,370
men complain about women who
are ball busters. We need rest.

84
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,760
The spirit is willing with the
flashes spongy and bruised,

85
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,600
so how do we inject that love,

86
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,870
passion and sexual polarity
back into our relationships?

87
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,700
It can only come from creating a focus
on emphasizing our masculine and feminine

88
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:10,620
traits instead of repressing them.

89
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:15,390
Be completely unapologetic falling what
you feel in the core of your being.

90
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,800
Masculine energy tends to be more logical,
more in their head.

91
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,330
The feminine is more emotional,
more in the moment because as a man,

92
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:27,270
you tend to become lost in
your thoughts and your goals.

93
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,440
One of the main gifts your women can
offer is getting you into your body into

94
00:05:31,441 --> 00:05:32,340
the present moment.

95
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,010
The main gift the masculine can give is
to offer guidance out of her moods and

96
00:05:38,011 --> 00:05:41,400
into openness.
If she feels unfulfilled,

97
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:44,610
you should be able to figure out
what is missing when she is upset.

98
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,780
Manual train logically,

99
00:05:45,781 --> 00:05:49,140
figure out what the problem is and
then create a logical solution for it.

100
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,310
They will then get frustrated when
there is no logical reason for her being

101
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:57,470
upset. The Feminine is free to flow
with the emotions they feel in moment.

102
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,580
You cannot use the same problem solving
logic you use at work in a relationship.

103
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,500
Instead of trying to argue with her
logically, pick her up spinner around,

104
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,760
dance with her. Make her laugh.
Change her mood, not her mind.

105
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,180
Don't analyze what upset her.
Let her feel your love.

106
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:19,340
Almost every time she is upset it is
stemming from her feeling unloved.

107
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,080
Learn to enjoy her anger, her
tears, her silent hardness,

108
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,900
the full expression of her feminine core.

109
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,620
Learn how to crack her shell of
harness and get your love inside.

110
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,420
There was no difference between
entering your woman's feminine heart and

111
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:37,010
entering fully into the world.
