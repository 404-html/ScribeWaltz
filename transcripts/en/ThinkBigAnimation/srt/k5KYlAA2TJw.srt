1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,690
The good place is one of the most
interesting shows on television.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,840
Not only does it explore morality ethics
and what it takes to live a good life,

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,240
but it features one of the greatest
twists in all of television.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,550
I can't believe you figured it out.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,770
This is going to be a
massive spoiler by the way.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,880
Eleanor shells trap wakes up in the
afterlife, which we soon find out.

7
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:25,590
Consists of a good place and a bad
place around the good. As Michael,

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,270
the architect of her paradise
will neighborhood soon
explains pretty much every

9
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:31,980
religion got the afterlife wrong.

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,150
The closest to being right apparently
was a guy named Doug force set who

11
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:40,860
described the afterlife with 95% accuracy
while he was high on acid. One time.

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,460
Life runs on a point system
in every single thing you do,

13
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,040
adds or subtracts from your overall score,

14
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,410
get enough points and you get to heaven.

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,090
Don't earn enough and it's time to prepare
for an eternity of butthole spiders

16
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:55,170
in the bad place.

17
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,460
Each neighborhood is perfectly designed
to fit its residents based on how they

18
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:02,310
lived on earth and each of them
is paired up with their soulmate,

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,420
but it doesn't take long for us to learn
that Eleanor has been sent to the good

20
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:11,220
place by mistake in her real life. She
was a nightmare of a person to be around.

21
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,430
Eleanor reveals this to
or fig soulmate cheaty,

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,240
which puts him in a very
awkward position on earth.

23
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,380
She was a professor of moral philosophy
and the last time he told a lie,

24
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:24,600
it tortured him for three years.

25
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,260
Now he is faced with an
impossible moral dilemma.

26
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,810
He can either lie to
everyone in the neighborhood,

27
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,870
possibly condemning himself
to hell in the process,

28
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,700
or he can turn Eleanor in dooming her to
an eternity of aforementioned butthole

29
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:42,900
spiders. Eleanor begs cheaty to
teacher how to be a better person,

30
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,200
swearing that she will earn
her spot in the good place.

31
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,020
This promise to be better is
immediately challenged who died,

32
00:01:50,021 --> 00:01:54,390
who loved Aristotle,
incharge of ethics. Plato.

33
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,080
Eleanor hates being around people who
think they are better than her and in the

34
00:01:58,081 --> 00:02:01,320
afterlife everyone seems
to be her moral superior,

35
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,970
her neighbors Tahani and her soulmate
Gian you, for instance, to honey,

36
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:09,390
raise billions of dollars for charity.
In her years of philanthropy,

37
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,070
and Jianyu was a Tibetan monk who spent
nearly his entire life in a vow of

38
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:14,904
silence,

39
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,620
except it turns out Jianyu like Eleanor
has been brought here by mistake.

40
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,830
His real name was Jason and he was a petty
criminal from Jacksonville and he's a

41
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:27,240
moron fearing he will break their cover.

42
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,720
Eleanor persuades shitty to
teach Jason ethics as well.

43
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,010
All these mistakes happen because it
is the first neighborhood Michael has

44
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:38,490
designed and the errors have
some massive side effects.

45
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,660
This presents an even stronger moral
dilemma for cheating and Eleanor,

46
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,390
who's deception is tearing
apart the neighborhood.

47
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,110
As this not have moral
uncertainty reaches its climax.

48
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:53,880
We finally get the big reveal that Michael
is actually an architect for the bad

49
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:57,360
place and the four of them have been
brought here to torture each other.

50
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,420
Looking back on it. There were plenty of
clues from the moment the show begins.

51
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:04,090
Everything is not quite right in paradise.

52
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,930
There are stores on every corner with
frozen yogurt instead of ice cream.

53
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,050
Pizza parlors that only
serve pizza with pineapple,

54
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,120
and if you want some refreshments,

55
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,060
residents can stop by the
fountain of Clam Chowder.

56
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,770
It is tough to say which version of
hell would be worse if we died and were

57
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:22,090
immediately brought to hell.

58
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:25,030
We would probably be resigned
to our feet pretty quickly,

59
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:30,210
but having paradise within our grasp
and never being able to reach it would

60
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:35,080
drive us insane. Actually, the butthole
spiders would probably be way worse,

61
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:39,010
but this idea of torturing ourselves
and each other calls to mind.

62
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:43,600
A great quote from John Milton's
epic paradise lost where he says,

63
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,950
the mind is its own place and in
itself can make a heaven of Hell,

64
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,050
a hell of heaven.

65
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,970
What is being suggested in this passage
is that heaven and hell both coexist in

66
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:59,560
the mind. He's putting the emphasis on
this life and how some people make their

67
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:04,150
surroundings seem heavenly despite the
sorrows and difficulties they face while

68
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:06,640
others bring hell with
them wherever they go.

69
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,950
The show itself is based on a play by
John Paul Sartre called no exit in which

70
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:15,910
three deceased characters are punished
by being locked into a room together for

71
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:16,744
eternity.

72
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:21,310
It is in starches play that we get
the famous line hell is other people.

73
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,490
A quote that he says is
constantly being misunderstood.

74
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,880
He is not saying that people
are inevitably cruel and evil.

75
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,900
He is saying that we cannot really know
ourselves without taking how we are

76
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:34,060
regarded by others into account.

77
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,040
Other people are so important
to us because we cannot
complete the puzzle of who

78
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,600
we are without them.

79
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,440
Much of the plot is focused on how
the characters torture each other,

80
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,610
but what they found in each other was
simply an amplification of those aspects

81
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:51,280
which they despised most in themselves.

82
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,540
They're torment came from the fact that
the afterlife was a continuation of the

83
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:59,950
same self destructive patterns, vetted,
kept each of the miserable on earth,

84
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,210
cocaine and escape train already.

85
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,260
If each character had remained trapped
within their own self sabotage,

86
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,070
then it is likely that the torture
would've lasted forever. But Michael,

87
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:16,510
his grand plan fails as it all rested
on his certainty that Eleanor would

88
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:19,420
selfishly do anything to
avoid being found out,

89
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,560
but she is able to break out of herself
centered ways and confesses to being

90
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:27,610
brought to the good place by mistake
throwing a wrench in the entire plan.

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,600
Michael is forced to repeatedly wipe
their memories to see if he can keep the

92
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:34,810
torture going longer.
But the same thing keeps happening.

93
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,950
Eleanor constantly figuring out their
situation can be interpreted as her

94
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:42,580
ability to consciously
recognize her own self sabotage.

95
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:47,730
And by doing this she is able to break
free of its hold on her for Eleanor.

96
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:52,270
Learning about ethics actually works
and it seems to be the catalyst for her

97
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:53,590
becoming a better person.

98
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,130
Was that her lessons on ethics that made
the difference or could it have been

99
00:05:58,131 --> 00:06:02,960
the initial decision to truly
devote herself to living
a better life and reading

100
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:06,380
about moral philosophy was simply
her vehicle for pursuing that.

101
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,790
It is unclear whether reading about
ethics actually makes you a better person.

102
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,200
One of the running jokes on the show is
how much people hate moral philosophers.

103
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,910
Cheese spent his entire life devoted
to living a virtuous life and the end

104
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:24,911
result was that it made himself and
the people around him miserable and is

105
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,680
clearly a parody as most philosophy
students don't spend two hours deciding

106
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,740
which brand of muffin would
be the most ethical choice,

107
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,820
but there was a stage and
learning philosophy where
you need to immerse yourself

108
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:39,890
in every philosophical viewpoint,

109
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,920
and this can actually make you
more confused than you were before,

110
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,720
but people who stick with it will likely
find themselves accepting some views

111
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,130
and rejecting others.

112
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,020
Students and philosophy professors are
uncertain about all kinds of things,

113
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,970
but having some principles for making
decisions in hard situations can make you

114
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:02,000
more decisive.
The question of how to be good.

115
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:05,570
It's such an abstract idea and
because life is so complicated,

116
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,300
any rigid worldview is bound to fail.

117
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:12,740
Each character shows how devoting yourself
to one limited branch of philosophy

118
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:13,970
is doomed to failure.

119
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:19,420
Take utilitarianism which says that it
is only the consequences of your actions

120
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,840
and not your intentions that matter.
If this were the pinnacle of virtue,

121
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,560
then Tahani would have been sent
to heaven and not to hell. Instead,

122
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,970
she ends up in the bad place because
all the good she did was for selfish

123
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:32,804
reasons.

124
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:37,280
We've already discussed how civies strict
obedience to the principles of content

125
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:39,260
has made a miserable cons.

126
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,890
Unconditional honesty would
seem ridiculous to most of us.

127
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,080
We would probably feel okay morally if we
lied to the Gestapo to hide our family,

128
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,340
or if we lied to a bunch of demons to
save our friends from an eternity of

129
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:55,730
torment,
but she still feels like this is wrong.

130
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,740
Jason shows us that ignorance of moral
values is not an excuse to be bad.

131
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,640
In the end,
it is Eleanor who rejects moral absolutes.

132
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,700
To live is to be confronted with problems,

133
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,740
each of them infinitely
and uniquely complex and we
almost never have the luxury

134
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:17,180
to sit down and map out every
possible consequence of our actions.

135
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,010
Take cheaty for example,

136
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,480
he is probably not the only student of
philosophy to spend hours dissecting the

137
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:27,650
famous trolley problem in a hilarious
scene where he was forced to enact this

138
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:28,760
problem in real life.

139
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,890
He realizes how useless all this
contemplation really was. Side Note,

140
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,790
I wonder how Michael an immortal demon
would answer the trolley problem.

141
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:42,620
So I would dangle a sharp blade out the
window to slice the neck of a guy on the

142
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:45,890
other track. As we smaller,
Sharp, our main guard,

143
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:48,830
oh,

144
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:53,600
Eleanor's case is particularly interesting
because her initial motivations to

145
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:57,330
save herself from eternal
damnation are not ideal.

146
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,470
But even though she takes up the task
of living a better life for selfish

147
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:02,304
reasons,

148
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:07,200
going through the motions
and internalizing what it
means to be good seems to

149
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:08,034
make her good.

150
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,870
It is Eleanor who takes these principles
and makes them the way she lives her

151
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:13,704
life.

152
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,520
She is the one who knows when to throw
out what it says in the book and follow

153
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:19,050
her intuition.
In the end,

154
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:23,190
it is Eleanor who proves she has broken
out of her self destructive patterns

155
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,970
when she is the only one of the four
to pass her test to get into heaven.

156
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,620
She truly shows how far her transformation
has come when she lies to the others

157
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:33,210
and says she failed the test.

158
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,740
She does this because they had made a
pact that either all of them or none of

159
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:41,280
them would get into the good place
knowing they would force her to go if they

160
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:46,020
knew the truth. Eleanor hides this in
order to keep her promise to her friends.

161
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,240
Eleanor was able to rise above herself
destructive behavior and because of this,

162
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:55,590
the people around her ceased to be hell
and instead became her greatest source

163
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,730
of inspiration.

164
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,590
If this video inspired you guys to pick
up one of those dusty old philosophy

165
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:04,770
books, but you're not sure where
to start, try Plato's republic.

166
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,090
Plato was so influential that Alfred
North Whitehead said that all of western

167
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:11,820
philosophy was simply footnotes to Plato.
