1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,793
Okay

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,340
for thousands of years. The central
narrative which has guided human behavior.

3
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,880
What's the beliefs that are world rest
of the center of the Cosmos designed

4
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:19,790
specifically for our
human story to unfold.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,250
At the dawn of the Copernican revolution,

6
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:26,450
this worldview came crashing down to
earth and we now struggle to find meaning

7
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:30,650
in a world that no longer explains
itself before these discoveries of our

8
00:00:30,651 --> 00:00:31,610
scientific age.

9
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:36,110
It was the stories we told that guided
US provided a reason for why we are here,

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,260
where we came from and what
happens once we are gone.

11
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,520
It is often thought that a culture is
mythology indicates the striving and self

12
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:44,990
examination of that culture.

13
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,580
What do the stories we tell the day say
about who we are, how we see the world,

14
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:51,830
and how we view our place in the cosmos?

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,060
What does it say about the drastic
change of our worldview and the last 100

16
00:00:56,061 --> 00:01:00,760
years when our most popular and perhaps
only myth we have left is the myth that

17
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:02,450
has become the most enduring,

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,070
expressive and consummate metaphor for
our current crisis in meaning the myth

19
00:01:07,071 --> 00:01:09,800
that stands for every
conceivable human failing.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,700
The Myth of the Zombie

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,980
tragedy was one of the most noble
art forms of Ancient Greece.

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,180
It was common for the
suffering of characters like
Oedipus to be preordained by

23
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:27,810
fate, fate that even the gods
were incapable of altering.

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,250
One of the key themes of stories like
the Oedipus cycle was his redemption.

25
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,510
That all his suffering was not in vain,
that it had purpose and meaning.

26
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,830
Tragedy dignifies the events of
suffering by giving them significance.

27
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,190
The Zombie apocalypse is the anti tragedy.

28
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,460
It immerses us in a story
and denies US closure.

29
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,810
Most Zombie stories in the same way
that is if they ended all the camera

30
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:54,400
ambiguously fades away.

31
00:01:54,401 --> 00:01:57,820
As we realize that there is no
redemption for the survivors.

32
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:03,100
No silver bullet, no stake in the heart,
no action the protagonist can take,

33
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,560
which will lead to the
salvation of their world.

34
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,060
Most cultural interpretations of the
Zombie begin with the premise that in some

35
00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:12,580
pivotal way zombies are us.

36
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,350
The are the fictionally distorted
self-reflected version of modern man.

37
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,710
Zombies do represent us,
but more specifically,

38
00:02:20,711 --> 00:02:25,150
they represent the deterioration of
our uniquely human ability to make and

39
00:02:25,151 --> 00:02:29,860
sustain meaning in our lives.
Monsters are not a new phenomenon,

40
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,530
though their names and faces
have changed throughout time.

41
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,910
They all seem to stand to some degree
for the dark and instinctual drives of

42
00:02:36,911 --> 00:02:37,744
human nature.

43
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,460
The most pervasive and consistent monster
of the 20th century was the alien,

44
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,390
a perfect representation of our
20th century fear of the foreigner.

45
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,210
At the height of our conflict
with the Soviet Union,

46
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,260
extinction by a foreign invader was at
the forefront of everyone's mind and it

47
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:56,080
became one of the most
enduring trends in pop culture.

48
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:01,690
Many things have changed in our post
Cold War and new monster has emerged a

49
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:04,240
monster with traits never seen before.

50
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,720
They aren't mute or reticent. They simply
have no language. They don't transmit,

51
00:03:12,721 --> 00:03:16,920
just have conversation. They do
the opposite. They communicate.

52
00:03:16,921 --> 00:03:18,480
They're in comedic ability.

53
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,490
The most common reason we refer to someone
as a Zombie is that he doesn't seem

54
00:03:23,491 --> 00:03:26,640
fully conscious.
He's not aware of himself.

55
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,870
He does not notice the
world go by the spoken word.

56
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,920
The ability to think,
strive and urine is what makes us human.

57
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,420
Clear and distinct.

58
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,260
Intellectual perception is with stands
at the center of the mind's ability to

59
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,570
recognize and reflect back on itself.

60
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,890
This is the individual's awareness
of himself, his existence,

61
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,900
his capacity to think and therefore
to be the lack of an interior.

62
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:54,330
Reality means that the Zombie
cannot connect to the world.

63
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,590
It cannot affirm its own realness and
it cannot affirm the realness of its

64
00:03:58,591 --> 00:03:59,424
environment.

65
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,990
Zombies do not have layers,
ness, coffins, castles or caves.

66
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,380
They do not retreat anywhere.
As the sun breaks the horizon,

67
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,990
zombies drift.

68
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,820
There is nothing whatsoever about a Zombie
that appears to belong to this world.

69
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,210
There's a crucial difference
between a house and a home.

70
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,820
A house is simply a structure we inhabit.

71
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,470
A home is transforming that structure
into a place where we truly feel like we

72
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:32,570
belong at a greater level.

73
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,540
The culture we live in is meant
to provide that sense of home,

74
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,600
of belonging to a place into a people.

75
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,260
This is why it can be deeply distressing
to experience something like culture

76
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:42,830
shock.

77
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:47,300
Losing that feeling of at
homeness undermines the way
we make sense of the world

78
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,010
while it has beneficial to travel and
learn about new cultures and new ways of

79
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:56,060
life. When this sense of loss
happens within our own society,

80
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,230
when we our culture shocked
within our own culture,

81
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,990
suddenly there was no
place for us to retreat.

82
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:08,350
We cannot return home because there's
no home to return to that sense of

83
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,960
connectedness with our
environment is lost. Alienation,

84
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:16,961
depression and anxiety soon follow it
is not so much a sense of fear but of

85
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:19,880
horror like the feeling when would have,

86
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:24,560
if they were experiencing a slow and
inescapable descent into madness.

87
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,270
What better way to capture that feeling
than with a monster that is constantly

88
00:05:29,271 --> 00:05:31,880
decaying but never dies?

89
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,990
Walkers,

90
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:42,050
flesh eaters dead on dead
to name something is to
accept and become aware of it

91
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,770
in stories of vampires,
werewolves or monsters of every kind.

92
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,950
As soon as you come to grips with
what you are facing, you can fight it.

93
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,410
Naming the monsters,

94
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,500
what guides the actions of the
protagonist to name the Zombie brings no

95
00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:58,160
empowerment.
Just despair.

96
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,720
Killing a Zombie does nothing to solve
the larger conflict that you are facing.

97
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,160
Even in the few exceptions where the
survivors do call the Zombie by name,

98
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,390
it is done in a way that
simply reemphasizes the
hopelessness of their situation.

99
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,230
Their name is not spoken with awe or
reverence because there is nothing

100
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:19,430
supernatural about a Zombie.
They have no new Munis or magical quality,

101
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,340
no mysterious backstory surrounding them.

102
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,820
That is what makes the
Zombie a monster of nihilism.

103
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,980
The appear for no reason as a seemingly
self evident and inevitable consequence

104
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:32,780
of our modern sensibilities.

105
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,800
If the world we live in is
fundamentally without meaning.

106
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,220
Why would the end of that
world need to explain itself

107
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,640
instead of the process of
assimilating food for energy?

108
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,390
The Zombie is insatiable zombies
like the properties of mine.

109
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:53,690
We think fundamentally human,
yet they want to acquire mind.

110
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:58,670
In the most literal sense,
the brain is a symbol for intelligibility.

111
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,350
The devouring of the brain indicates the
devouring of that intelligibility and

112
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,520
all it affords.

113
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,930
The fact that the brain is driving the
consumption of brain is a deeply complex

114
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:12,680
symbolic occurrence.
Culture is devouring culture.

115
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,930
Mind is devouring mind.

116
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,740
Humanness is devouring humanness.

117
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,720
This tells us that the Zombie is not
an external threat but an internal one.

118
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,190
The Zombie craze with such singularity
of purpose that this craving becomes its

119
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:31,430
nature. It will feed itself
for as long as it is able,

120
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:35,480
but it does not incorporate
or gain nourishment from
anything that it consumes.

121
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,590
It is constantly filling
but never gets full.

122
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,600
What does our modern world desire
to consume more than anything else?

123
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,330
Information and connectivity.

124
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,490
We feel that by devouring each other's
minds we can somehow regain that sense of

125
00:07:52,491 --> 00:07:56,900
connectedness to the people around us,
but it never works.

126
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:02,230
We never gain nourishment and our
craving never subsides as brain is eating

127
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:03,860
brain.

128
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,860
The instrument we use to make meaning
in the world is devouring itself,

129
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,200
the gathering,
an incredibly large numbers,

130
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:17,650
but these gatherings have
no aim and no purpose.

131
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,640
There is no history between any of them.
There is no structure,

132
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:25,750
no culture and no cooperation
or organization of any kind.

133
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,370
They're surrounded by each other but
somehow remain in total isolation.

134
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,890
Lacking the ability to
reach out to one another.

135
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,640
To feel alone in a crowd full of
people is a very modern problem.

136
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,980
We have always been
surrounded by strangers,

137
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,440
but they have never been
as strange as they are now.

138
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,090
We must be able to interact with
something in order to understand it and

139
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:45,924
objective,

140
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,050
factual understanding of something is
not the same as an intimate and deeply

141
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:54,910
personal knowing we feel and interact
with the world around us by touching the

142
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,990
around us.
The world in turn touches us,

143
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,430
makes us feel that we're a part of it.
The Zombie has a cold,

144
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,920
purely objective
interaction with the world.

145
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:10,080
It no longer feels it has one purpose
in anything else is relegated to

146
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:11,190
meaninglessness.

147
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,810
When a person's grasp
of reality is slipping,

148
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:22,500
we see that they are losing touch
because touch is how we make sense of the

149
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:26,760
world. The objects we have
handled, the emotions we have felt,

150
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,280
the intimate relationships we have held.

151
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,040
These are the things we
take to be most real.

152
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:37,560
The Zombie represents a crisis
of intimacy. Every person
is a Zombie and waiting.

153
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,400
It's contact with the world spreads.
It's conditioned like a plague.

154
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,830
The more we encountered
the unfeeling mess,

155
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,200
the more we become the unfeeling mass.

156
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,450
Our modern world discourages contact in
all its forms and treating everyone like

157
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:54,840
a stranger is the only
way to avoid infection.

158
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,070
We are surrounded in yet stranded,
inundated,

159
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,680
well utterly alone

160
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,990
in cities all around the world.

161
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,260
A strange sort of ritual
enact may is taking place.

162
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,890
Zombie walks represent a form
of mystical participation,

163
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:18,480
a return to primitive psychology in
which we find no trace of the concept of

164
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:19,440
individuality.

165
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:24,340
Instead we find a collective relationship
which French ethnologist levy broke

166
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:26,250
called participation mystique.

167
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,420
It is described as a psychological
connection in which the subject could not

168
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:34,260
clearly distinguish himself from
an external situation, your object,

169
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,060
the form of partial identity,
which the individual is bound to.

170
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:44,400
Very similar to what we call mob
mentality. At one of these Zombie walks,

171
00:10:44,401 --> 00:10:48,240
there was an emergency situation and a
doctor was trying to get help from one of

172
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:51,990
the participants, but that person
would only respond as a Zombie.

173
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:57,480
The doctor is trying to get
them to realize that this
is the real world and this

174
00:10:57,481 --> 00:11:00,780
person needs help,
but they refuse to break character.

175
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:05,850
Their commitment to the role,
which day point of possession

176
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,400
we tell ourselves

177
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,800
we had a walking dead.
