Speaker 1:          00:02          Sure.

Speaker 2:          00:11          Throughout our entire lives we are in search of some creed. We seek certainty and somewhere to belong, someone to rely upon. You come to these things out of fear. I mean even with videos like these, you probably watched them seeking some kind of certainty. You're looking for someone to tell you how to live. You're probably looking for that one video to tell you exactly what to do. The video that will make everything click. You seeking certainty. It's the hearing, but there is no such thing. Um, with that being said, please keep watching my videos. Hashtag I love you

Speaker 2:          00:49          encouraged by Osho. He would like to make us more insecure, more uncertain, because that is how life is a truly alive. Men will always feel insecure if anyone knew what was going to happen. Each moment in life is just a dead mechanical process waiting to be played out. A secure life would be worse than death. When you say you are certain, you declare your death, you've committed suicide, and I know one thing, this, I'll get a lot of comments from people like, oh well then should I just quit my job? And go live on the streets. And the answer I'd give is, I don't know, man. Maybe there isn't really a cookie cutter answer. Each situation is a unique life is not a stagnant pond. If the dynamic flowing river with constantly changing circumstances. Now obviously being stable and having security is not totally a bad thing.

Speaker 2:          01:41          I talk a lot in my videos against consumerism and materialism, but that doesn't necessarily mean enjoying the materialistic things of the world is bad. Oh, show himself the spiritual guru. Oh 98 Rolls Royces 98 so obviously he had an enjoyment for the material things in life. Does that make him incapable of being someone you can take wisdom and advice from with this? I've experienced both sides of the spectrum. When I was 19 I landed the secure, comfy, cushy sales job. I thought I hit the lottery all my life. The bar for a successful life was a good job that you can retire on and just like that, I already had it. I was making more money than I knew what to do with. And Luckily I had some good family around me teaching me how to be frugal. Friends told me how jealous they were of me.

Speaker 2:          02:31          Family was telling me how proud they were that I was successful and I was so happy. I had taken a risk, moved from my small town and had all worked out there was going to be a happily ever after. But soon the novelty wore off and everyday started to look like the last and three years past in a blur, I knew I needed a change. I started to spend every day at work reading about people who are living on the edge, people who are bold, taking risks and making like an adventure. I read about people saying, fuck the standards of society. People would sleep in their truck or van that would airbnb and couch surf and travel and go with their heart desired. So eventually I got fired from this job. I wonder why I decided to take all my savings and spend a year sleeping out of my truck and doing nothing but surf and train martial arts all day. It was scary, but a risk I wanted to take.

Speaker 1:          03:29          Okay.

Speaker 2:          03:29          And suddenly it's like I had life breathed back into me everyday scene, brand new, different from the last, every day was a question of where would I sleep, what would I do and where would I go?

Speaker 2:          03:44          Until soon routine took over, the novelty wore off and every day seemed to be like the last I felt exactly like I did in that stuff to professional workplace. I just had less space, less things and more time and it was never a question of having money or not having money, having free time, not having free time. It was always a question of mine awareness. It's not bad to see comfort. It's not bad to seek the material things. It's always a question of the place it's coming from. Is it coming from a place of compulsion of seeking completion? It didn't matter if I was at the cushy job or living in the truck. It was only a question of my awareness in each moment. I wasn't necessarily more happy living out of the truck. I felt happier because the danger and novelty forced my attention into the present moment. What is the right thing to do when each moment

Speaker 2:          04:45          it is that which is harmonious with nature and with existence? What does this even mean? What is right? It can't be described. This is why you must stay alert in each moment. What is right? One moment is wrong than that, and you cannot depend on ready made answers. You must maintain awareness to respond to a changing life. This is why it is critical to live a life of courage, a life on the edge who is more aware that the man on the edge of a cliff keep your awareness and listen for the unknown. Gather courage to move into it. You will not need to seek the new for. It will come to you in a thousand ways. If you have the eyes to see it, you cannot keep rejecting. The new for the old has not given you what you seek. No effort is needed. Just courage.
