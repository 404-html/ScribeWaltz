Speaker 1:          00:09          Let's see. You work for southwest airlines and you see a huge number of customers requesting different food choices like a Greek chicken salad on flights. If you brought this request to the CEO of the company, he would probably show you this quote southwest the low fare airline. How will offering a Greek salad on our flights help keep us as the low fare airline? This is the core of the southwest business model broken down to its simplest possible element. If it doesn't help keep us as the low fare airline, we are not going to do it in this way. Every decision can be put through the filter of how will it affect our core message. You might notice that many workers at southwest are able to be more lighthearted and have fun. If you want to sing a song over the inner calm, it doesn't affect our core, but if you decided to throw confetti after every landing requiring a cleanup crew, now you are affecting the core of the business.

Speaker 1:          01:01          When making a complex idea simple, you need to make it as compact as possible while maintaining the core of the idea when done correctly. This can be incredibly powerful. The idea of a proverb captures this concept perfectly. It condenses lessons from a lifetime of experience into a phrase like a burden. The hand is worth two in the bush. A phrase that takes five seconds to read could take years to really implement in your life, but how do we get to the core of an idea without dumbing it down and making it meaningless? The book takes us through an exercise of trying to memorize letters. Try and remember as many letters as you can. J. F, K, F, B. I. N. T, O, u. P. S. N. A. S. A. I. R. S. Now listen to the same exact letters in the same order, but just read a little bit differently. J. F, k, F. B. I. N. A. T. O. U. P. S. N. A. S. A. I. R. S. Now you could probably memorize a lot more with the first sequence you're trying to remember rod data with the second you are memorizing concepts. There is no way the concept of JFK is more simple than the letters Kjf, but your tapping into a deeply internalized concept of JFK. The memory work has already been done here. A complex idea is chunked as one concept. Well Keiji F makes our brain trying to remember three unrelated concepts.

Speaker 1:          02:45          If you find yourself stuck, deciding between conveying accuracy or accessibility, always go for accessibility. It's like when a teacher tries to explain the concept of electrons to a six year old, they will teach them by comparing it to the orbits of planets. Even though is not totally accurate. That is because the concept of orbiting planets is already accessible in their minds. This is not dumbing down the message, but stripping the idea to its main essence. When you're doing creative work, it can be painful to leave out incredibly valuable information that is not the core message. Learn to relentlessly prioritize and make your ideas as profound and compact as you can. Try to create proverbs with your work.
