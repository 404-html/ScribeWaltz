Speaker 1:          00:09          It's like we're building our society from an etch a sketch. We were given a solid foundation in a warning of what dangers to avoid. At some point, someone came in long, Andrew Dix all over our etch a sketch. We are afraid to lose our work for had such potential, but it is dead. It has been hijacked and we need to shake it clean. George Orwell's stated that the best books are the ones that tell you what you already know. 1984 will tell you what you already know, that there was something very wrong with our culture. Okay. War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength. These were the three slogans of ink sock. The totalitarian party, which controlled the superstate of Oceania in George Orwell's dystopian novel, 1984 these slogans were precisely chosen to create cognitive dissonance in the citizen's minds. Each slogan uses words directly contradictory to one another.

Speaker 1:          01:16          It was a concept known by party members as double think to hold paradox school views of reality. Simultaneously. In your mind, you were asked to completely disregard your own perception and be completely dependent on the state's definition of reality. If the party needed you to believe that two plus two equals five do you have to find some way to resolve the fact that you know that equals four it is not just enough to say the words. The party was very sophisticated in observing when you were faking it. You needed to actually believe when a party member holds up two and two fingers, you are truly seeing five. Furthermore, if the party puts you in a situation where two plus two must equal for for the sake of science and practicality, you must find a way to resolve these two paradigms as the party soffit. Sometimes the answer was five, sometimes it was three and sometimes it was all of them at once.

Speaker 1:          02:10          The party specifically denies this such a thing as the truth even exists. The objective truth is whatever suits their needs at the time in soc controls all records, all memories of past events, and they control your entire reality. There would be no loyalty but loyalty to the party. There'd be no love but love for big brother. The validity of the human experience and the very existence of external reality itself was denied by their philosophy. The greatest of all Harris's was common sense and the most terrifying thing about this proposition was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise. What was truly terrifying was what if they were rights first common sense, truth like two plus two equals four or the existence of gravity or that the past is if these ideas exist only in the mind and the mind is controllable, what happens then?

Speaker 1:          03:07          The truth becomes whatever those empower want it to be. The way this manifested in Orwell's nightmarish reality was this. If someone you knew disappeared, they were no longer a person and in fact never existed, any record of them was wiped out. Any memory you had of them was false. It was your imagination and speaking about them could lead to your own sudden disappearance. The State of Oceania had two main rivals, Eurasia and East Asia. Whoever they were at war with in this moment was who they had always been at war with. Even if you had a memory of being at war with East Asia four weeks ago. Right now we are at war with your ratio and had always been at war with your ratio, any piece of news that had ever said otherwise, it was altered. Anyone who spoke to the contrary, was it criminal? Okay. When the planes hit the two towers on nine 11 it was very clear what we needed to do. We needed to find who was responsible and crushed them. Osama bin Laden was responsible. Osama bin Laden had always been responsible. This led to a war in Afghanistan. Afghanistan had always been behind the terror attacks on nine 11

Speaker 1:          04:19          so as the war with Iraq waged on, we knew they had always had weapons of mass destruction. We all knew we had to rid this evil totalitarian country of these weapons. So this is the war in Afghanistan continued. We came to the realization to Iraq. Never had weapons of mass destruction, but this was okay. That had never been the reason for going to war in the first place. What I rack really needed.

Speaker 2:          04:45          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:47          Was the regime change? Whoever controls the present controls the past and thus controls the future. Those who control our history books are able to control our perception of the past. Like most kids in America, I was taught that no matter which war we were fighting, the United States was on the sight of God, truth and justice.

Speaker 3:          05:07          This,

Speaker 1:          05:09          but history proves to be much more complex than our linear way of learning in schools allows us to understand,

Speaker 3:          05:17          okay,

Speaker 1:          05:17          every historical subject and we learned gets condensed into a narrow lens, usually portraying and imposing on us a belief of American exceptionalism. God's chosen people who've been burdened with the task of enlightening other cultures of their primitive ways.

Speaker 1:          05:33          And the 241 years since 1776 the United States has been engaged in some type of war for 224 of them wore in reality, by definition should be something that inevitably comes to an end. There was a clear enemy. We fight. We go until there was a clear victor, then the war ends. The wars between Oceania, East Asia, Eurasia. We're not battles over resources. War was enacted to keep a labor force within its own boundaries in Orwell's novel by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist. Each willpower stockpiles atomic weapons and points the met each other, planning and plotting for the right moment. Of course, this moment never comes and the leaders of instock never want it to come. None of the three powers ever attempt any maneuver which involves the risk of serious defeat in this way, big battles and wars are being fought. It could be true, it could be a lie.

Speaker 1:          06:31          The citizens of Oceania have no way of knowing. The real truth is that each superstate is nearly identical to one another with only slight differences in way of life in ideology. This is why each superstate does not want to conquer one another. If you were to conquer a new territory, what would you do with its people? You can either have a mass genocide or you can assimilate these people into your own society. That would be almost unthinkable if the residents of Oceania actually mingled with the enemy that had been propped up for so long. Soon they would come to realize that they are more similar to themselves then they could have ever imagined in Orwell's reality. War is waged by each ruling class against its own subjects. The object of war is not to take your perfect conquest of territory, but to keep the very structure of society in tact.

Speaker 1:          07:23          A hierarchical society requires a certain way of thinking, particularly a feeling of scarcity and lack that's drink too far from the herd will result in death. When war becomes literally continuous, there was no such thing as military necessity. The war becomes merely an imposter. It becomes like a battle between two animals live set their horns at such an angle that they are incapable of hurting one another. This is not to say that many people won't die. Certainly they will, but the foundation of these superpowers, the way of life is never endanger for even an instinct. Though it is just an act. It is not meaningless. War eats up the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society requires. A state of perpetual war has become nearly identical to a state of perpetual peace

Speaker 4:          08:22          throughout recorded time. There has always been three types of people. The high, the middle, and the low. They have been subdivided many ways, born countless names, but the central structure of society has never changed. Even after enormous upheaval is the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium. The aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable. The aim of the high is to remain where they are. The aim of the middle is to overthrow in change places with the high and the aim

Speaker 1:          08:56          of the low if they have an aim is to abolish all distinctions and create a society where all are equal. Thus a struggle which maintains the same basic outline recurs over and over again. The need for a hierarchical society has always been the doctrine of the high. The high had promised you safety and security and all the riches available in the next slide. All it estin return was everything. All of the riches in this world.

Speaker 1:          09:27          There are four ways in which your ruling class can fall from power. Either it is conquer from without. It governs so poorly that the masses revolts. It allows us strong discontented middle group to develop or a loses self confidence and willingness to govern a ruling class which could guard against all of these would remain in power permanently. The high realizing history was a cyclical process and that the middle and low would always try to usurp their status, chose to find a way to maintain their position permanently. This new group of high was more conscious of what they were doing and more focused on crushing their opposition. This new group of high realized the only way to keep an oligarchy intact was through collectivism. A society needed to exist with the greater good of the group always had priority over the individual. One of the main mistakes these groups have made in the past was the forming of an aristocracy. The privileged few flaunted themselves. They had slaves. They made it very clear that they were the high and we were the low. Once the high had an overwhelming amount of resources, the middle would inevitably enlist the low to overthrow the high usually to a violent in the key to success needed to be secrecy and shadowed intentions, the new oligarchy, the one that can actually maintain their status as the high. We'll have to learn how to hide their true aims

Speaker 1:          10:54          today. The high are no longer people. They are corporations and institutions, institutions which are too big to fail. They become something like the Federal Reserve, the very name, a brilliant act of double thing. It would suggest to an observer that they are beholden to the federal government and that they hold the reserve of our currency. In reality, they are not a part of the federal government nor do they hold any reserves. They are nameless, faceless shape shifting entity with no loyalty or ties to anyone or anything. Nathan Rothschild once said, give me control of a nation's wealth and I care not who makes its laws. Once you have gained complete control of a nation's wealth, you can then plaster the face of a big brother who is always watching you on to every TV, every street corner, and didn't every home while the high remains truly anonymous.

Speaker 3:          11:48          Okay?

Speaker 1:          11:49          Through collectivism, the hire able to keep up the illusion that we've not been in sleep, people are not productive when we realize our enslavement, our human spirit compels us to break free of our masters. And furthermore, when you knowingly in slave someone, you don't want to educate them for them, they use it to turn against you. So you are only able to take advantage of the muscle of your human farm and not the most valuable asset.

Speaker 4:          12:14          Their minds give them the illusion of freedom. Let them choose their job, where they want to vacation and how they want to spend their free time. They will choose a job that is safe and secure though they have the ability to go as far and for as long as they want. They will vacation where countless people have gone before and will always return home when they are told and inevitably almost all our various forms of entertainment will merely become a way to numb our senses, give them the illusion of choice and they will imprison themselves. Thus, freedom is slavery.

Speaker 4:          12:52          In 1984 the ink sock party was in the middle of implementing a new type of language called quite creatively new speak. It would take time, however, to replace all the unnecessary old speak words with the more useful, efficient, new speak words, words that meant the same thing were thrown away. Words like fantastic, ecstatic and amazing exist when they could be covered by the word good. If something was better, it would be double good. Something bad was simply an good language was simplified as much as possible. The goal of the party was to have any idea divergent from the ink sock doctrine. Literally unthinkable. All ambiguity and shades of meaning were purged out. Newspeak was designed to limit the range of thought and there would be no room for philosophical discussion. In a world like this. How could one fight back when the thoughts and words that have a revolution couldn't even be thought or spoken?

Speaker 4:          13:52          Look at this example from Orwell's article politics in the English language, which shows the path modern day English is heading down. He takes a verse from ecclesiastics and translates it into a more modern day English type of writing. I returned and saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise nor yet riches to men of understanding nor yet favor to men of skill, but time and chance happiness to them all. Let's look at how the same sentence would be written in a more modern day English type of writing. Objective considerations of contemporary phenomena compelled the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commiserate with the neat capacity, but then a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account. The first sentence contains 49 words, but only 60 syllables and all its words those of everyday life.

Speaker 1:          14:52          The second contains 38 words of 90 syllables. Every form of imagery and concrete illustration has dissolved into these vague phrases and just by its 90 syllables, it gives us only a shortened version of the meaning contained in the first yet without a doubt, it is the second kind of sentence which is gaining ground in modern English. This type of writing is youthful. If one wants to hide their meaning and in political language, this is everything. For those who claimed a power must always portray their reasons for doing so as noble, they did it for truth, God and justice. This is rarely true. Power has always been acquired for power's sake or will realize this and realize that this trick is often masked by language leaders, politicians and media, often new soft language to mask a brutal reality. British rule in India, the Russian purges and deportations under stolen, the dropping of the atom bombs in Japan can be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face and which do not align with the professed aims of the political parties. Euphemism is what makes up the majority of our political language deficits. Villages are bomb from the air, the inhabitance driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine gun in the home set on fire. This was called pacification. Such phrase, knowledge is needed if one wants to name things without calling a mental pictures of them. This is the trick. You youth a nice name for a horrific thing. Political writing and speech is often a defense of the indefensible. Very often the words chosen directly contradict the ideas they represent.

Speaker 1:          16:30          This kind of speech is not hard to recognize, so the speaker is dependent on one key fact about human nature, and that is the individual's desire to deceive himself.

Speaker 1:          16:43          We all have a story, a sort of internal narrative which shapes our identity and molds our perception. In 1984 the narrative was that big brother was omnipotent and the party was infallible, but because big brother was not omnipotent and the party was not infallible, there was need for an unwavering moment to moment flexibility in the treatment of facts. One needed control over their own mental processes as complete as that of a contortionist over his body in new speak. This is called double think. Double think less is the very heart of ink sock way of life since the essential act of the party is to use conscious deception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty, to tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in it. This brings up the question, why must reality be distorted in this manner?

Speaker 3:          17:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:37          Why must the narrative pervade every layer of the societal structure? It is important to realize that power is in the collective alone. Every human being will fail because every

Speaker 4:          17:50          human being is doomed to die, but if he can make complete utter submission, if he can escape his identity, if you can immerse himself into the parties that he is the party, then he is all powerful and a mortal. You see then why you must never lose faith in the infallibility of your country or political group. These things make up the foundation of how you interpret the world and if they collapse, your entire structure of beliefs will collapse with it. This is why above all the story, the narrative and the mythologies must remain intact and why you will follow your culture down whatever path it leads you. We tend to think of an oppressive regime is containing two categories of people. The oppressive rule in class and the innocent people who are being oppressed. We think of tyranny is something which comes from the top down, but a system like that simply would not function.

Speaker 4:          18:47          Regimes like that have stolen or Hitler required the willing participation of a mass amount of people. This is not fit very well with our perception of what happened. It is much easier to look at history as a case of black and white, right and wrong or good and evil, and each of us would like to believe if we were put in that situation, we would take the side of good. If only it were that simple. If only there were some unmistakable mark of evil, we could simply separate the good from the bad. But the line between good and evil does not pass through political parties nor states nor social classes, but right through every human heart. This runs absolutely counter to what we would like to believe. We lack our villains out in the open where they can be easily identified, but it was not good men or bad men who were behind the horrors of Auschwitz and Soviet Russia. It was ordinary men, people just like you and me. To truly understand Nazi Germany or Stalin's Russia is to understand the ordinary people, meaning you and I. If we were put in that situation, we would have done what ordinary people did.

Speaker 4:          20:06          What every totalitarian state had in common was the layer of deceit and bed within its culture and within his language and a willingness of the individual to accept an act out in lists lies. This is what Orwell so eloquently brought to light and politics in the English language. Speaking in an imprecise man, or at least the groundwork for society built unconscious deception and it starts at the level of the individual. We can not lay responsibility at the feet of another. For the enemy is not some dictator in a far away land. When we realize the enemy lies within our own hearts, suddenly one becomes too. We have found the enemy and he is us.

Speaker 2:          20:58          Okay.
