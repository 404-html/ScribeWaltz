Speaker 1:          00:09          Harry Potter in the Church. Needless to say,

Speaker 2:          00:12          spin rate. What have been plucked out of warlocks

Speaker 1:          00:19          organized book burnings, nationwide bands, and I even heard a story of a child in a Christian orphanage with nothing left in the world, but it's Harry Potter books who's forced to burn them because they promoted witchcraft. What is it about our own imaginations that can be so terrifying? I had a very active imagination as a child. I also happen to live in a house with nine kids. They'll, keeping track of me was impossible one step outside and I was in another universe, so real and vivid that it was almost indistinguishable from reality like mini children. My imagination was easily swept off into the world of fiction. Naturally, the stories I like best, we're about knights and quests and slaying dragons. They were about King Arthur, Luke Skywalker, and of course Harry Potter. As soon as the new Harry Potter book was available in the library, it was a mad rush to be the first one to check it out.

Speaker 1:          01:10          Unfortunately, I was told these books say tannic witchcraft and I was never allowed to read them. Of course, the fact that the books were forbidded only made them that much more attractive. I read them anyway, hiding them all around the house and getting caught all the time. Mr. Smith. Oh yeah. Just masturbating. The books clearly accomplished something amazing. They had fifth graders reading five, six and 700 page books and my own love for reading to this day can be traced back to that time in my life. In my 11 year old mind. I simply couldn't understand how something which provided me with so much joy and wonder could be evil. I've come to believe that it is precisely the amount of joy we received that caused this kind of backlash and it is not hard to see why. What are we doing when we get lost in a novel?

Speaker 1:          01:56          It is more than just fantasy and escape isn't. We are creating detailed images in our mind, bringing them to life and blurring the lines between fantasy and reality. That is magic. Like seriously getting that immersed in something. It's truly a religious experience and unfortunately it's all too common. The churches in the business of preventing religious experience rather than mediating it. Look closely and you will see at its core, the Harry Potter series is about a religious transformation that's tyrannical king becomes paranoid about a new miracle child. The child is then driven out of the magical kingdom only to return later as the savior sound familiar. Both were crucified for telling people the truth. They did not want to hear both willingly face death to save the ones they love and both died and were reborn. The story of Harry Potter is his oldest time. It is the endless battle of good versus evil.

Speaker 1:          02:52          When Adam and eve ate of the tree of knowledge, the tension of opposites came into being and it became apparent that the key to heaven light and renouncing, ignoring and suppressing our most base in evil desires, but that which we suppressed does not simply go away. Voldemort is a clear representation of the young Ian Shadow. Carl Young stated that we all have a persona. This is the mask that we put on for the world. It encompasses all those traits we deem worthy and socially acceptable. Then we have the shadow, the part of ourselves. We hide from the world, the basement of our psyche, which stores every repressed memory and every skeleton of our past. These disowned parts of ourselves are extremely valuable and cannot be discarded without a cost. If channeled properly, they can fill our life with meaning if ignored, they will always find a way to express themselves often in unforeseen and destructive ways.

Speaker 1:          03:47          We all have a two sided nature. Voldemort is the other side of Harry and their lives aren't inescapably woven together, but it is emphasized time and again that it was the choices Harry made that set them apart. Voldemort is often translated as flight from death. That is what everyone does. They refused to speak his name, refuse to acknowledge their own two sided nature, refuse to see the darkness that exists within themselves. Everyone refuses to look except for Harry in his first two encounters with the pace of evil, he can only look at it indirectly. First is reflection. Then is nothing more than a memory in a diary. While he meets the face of evil courageously, he's clearly outmatched. This is a part of himself. He does not yet understand three words in the goblet of fire change everything

Speaker 1:          04:41          up to this point. These were child like adventure stories where the hero always conquered. This all changes. When Harry has his first direct look into the face of evil, he sees death, an experience which changes him completely. He now sees the world in a way his friends cannot something which causes him to question himself and his sanity, but confrontation with the shadow was actually what guides here. He's life. He says, his aim to become an or and to join the order of the Phoenix. It provides his life with purpose and meaning the strongest parts of himself. His capacity for love and friendship are discovered in his most vulnerable moments. Those who are reading Harry in the Bible are experiencing the same thing. There's a reason the death and rebirth theme has survived in our storytelling for thousands of years. It speaks to something deeply embedded within the human experience, and it is the reason the story of a young wizard has been able to successfully reach the hearts and minds of billions of people.
