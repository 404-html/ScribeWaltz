Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay, children. Now I want to review the different sexual positions. Who can tell me which sexual positions we talked about

Speaker 2:          00:06          humans sucks you out. We've been engaging in it since the dawn of time. Why is something so hardware into our DNA become a source of moral, ethical, and religious taboo?

Speaker 1:          00:19          That's right. Doggy style. We went over pile driver [inaudible] pile, driver position, good coy

Speaker 2:          00:26          cultural anthropologists, Ernest Becker speculates as six became the source of moral taboo and restriction because it taps us into our most basic animal nature. Humans learned to cope with our own mortality by embedding ourselves in cultural symbolism. We feel a strong desire to exist as spiritual beings and these animalistic behaviors threaten the very structure we use to cope with our own mortality. Even though we're out of the middle ages, we're still feeling the ripple effect of thousands of years of repressed sexuality.

Speaker 1:          00:56          And the beginning, we were all fish, okay. Swimming around in the water and then one day a couple of fish had a retard baby. So retard fish goes on and make more retard babies. And then that had a retard baby, which was a monkey fish frog. So there you go. You're the retarded offspring of five monkeys haven't butt sex with a fish. Squirrel. Congratulations.

Speaker 2:          01:19          We've had a lot of social progress over the last 50 years. We've evolved past the, I love Lucy Macho man house. My paradigm in the fifties in the sixties and seventies men began to embrace the long hair, colorful clothes and a more carefree lifestyle. Women were doing just the opposite. There were magnifying their inner masculine direction, clarity of purpose and vision. No masculine or feminine does not mean male or female. Either. Gender can take on both roles. And in recent years we've become more and more focused on being less rigid in our gendered roles while are focused on a quality has led to a lot of social progress and no one is arguing that equality is a bad thing. We have reached this sort of 50 50 stage. Listen, uh, quality is great, but our society has started to smooth out our natural masculine and feminine differences. And this has seeped into most people's relationships.

Speaker 2:          02:10          Sexual similarities. One of the major causes of unhappiness and intimacy is led to social and economic equality, but also in sexual neutrality. Bank accounts are balancing ball passions are fizzling out. The key to sexual attraction is based on sexual polarity. This is the force of passion that flows between masculine and feminine polls. The polls between people create the flow of sexual feelings. If you want passion, you need a rabbi Asher in a rabbit sheet. Otherwise, you have two buddies who decided to rub genitals and bed. There's a scale of sexual polarity that everyone will fall into with most people having either a more masculine or more feminine pole with a minority of people having a more neutral polarity or androgynous sexual essence. It is important to realize that masculine or feminine isn't male or female, either gender take on both roles, but for simplicity sake, we're going to focus on sexual polarity between a man and a woman. Real sexual attraction will come when there was a natural arc and flow between the two poles. As a generation of men grow weaker and weaker, thus having a kind of neutered expression of their masculine core. Women tend to have to express their masculine energy more and more. Ask any women actively dating in the world right now and often? Their biggest complaint will be that men these days are soft, pussies or unable to take lead and take charge. A new term has even been coined for him in like this.

Speaker 2:          03:36          Knowing where you sit on this scale is important because you will always find yourself the most attracted to your sexual reciprocal. This is why people who are closer to the androgynous part of the scale will be attracted to other people with a more neutral sexuality. While extremely masculine men will often be seen with extremely feminine women. This strong arc between the two Poles is where the most passion, drama, emotion, love, hate, tears, and joy are going to happen. This is why every love story features two people on opposite poles. You rarely see a passionately androgynous love story.

Speaker 2:          04:13          The bottom line up today's 50 50 relationship is this. If we cling to a politically correct sameness, even in moments of intimacy than sexual attraction disappears. The love and friendship may still exist, but sexual polarity fades and true passion is dead. We have a Roni slowly begun to deny, smooth out and neutralize our masculine and feminine differences. Because of this, people often end up denying their deepest core desires. Women complain about men who are wimps. They have no purpose, no direction, and an inability to have a spine to go for what they really want. In Life, men complain about women who are ball busters. We need rest. The spirit is willing with the flashes spongy and bruised, so how do we inject that love, passion and sexual polarity back into our relationships? It can only come from creating a focus on emphasizing our masculine and feminine traits instead of repressing them.

Speaker 2:          05:11          Be completely unapologetic falling what you feel in the core of your being. Masculine energy tends to be more logical, more in their head. The feminine is more emotional, more in the moment because as a man, you tend to become lost in your thoughts and your goals. One of the main gifts your women can offer is getting you into your body into the present moment. The main gift the masculine can give is to offer guidance out of her moods and into openness. If she feels unfulfilled, you should be able to figure out what is missing when she is upset. Manual train logically, figure out what the problem is and then create a logical solution for it. They will then get frustrated when there is no logical reason for her being upset. The Feminine is free to flow with the emotions they feel in moment. You cannot use the same problem solving logic you use at work in a relationship. Instead of trying to argue with her logically, pick her up spinner around, dance with her. Make her laugh. Change her mood, not her mind. Don't analyze what upset her. Let her feel your love. Almost every time she is upset it is stemming from her feeling unloved. Learn to enjoy her anger, her tears, her silent hardness, the full expression of her feminine core. Learn how to crack her shell of harness and get your love inside. There was no difference between entering your woman's feminine heart and entering fully into the world.
