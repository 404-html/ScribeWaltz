Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:08          No,

Speaker 3:          00:09          that's going to be assume like, it's so scary because you think if you'd like to that pit of unhappiness, like the lowest get your defaults and happiness, but when I let go, I realize like it wasn't happiness, it was happiness and this. I was like, Holy Shit. You know, it's like we're literally all hanging onto the side of a cliff and you know someone's billows like, let go. I'll catch you. You're like, no, if I let go, I'll die. And then you actually do let go. But he requires so much to just like go cause again, you've been hanging on your entire fucking life. Everything you've been doing has been reinforcing it. Assumption upon assumption upon assumption, belief, belief. It's like, hang on or I will die. And you think that the journey is just to keep hanging on. It's like let go. Easier said than done.

Speaker 3:          00:49          It's easy to do but hard to do. You make that false assumption that our default is unhappy. Wrong. Okay. That false assumption is the cause of every bad thing in your life and a that's huge. Consciously, it's not as hard to let go. While your problems, it's not as hard to let go of that wrong assumption because you're conscious of it. The hard part is this assumption is buried deep down in your subconscious and that's the tough part. It's sitting down and diving into it and this is the shit that's fucking terrifying. This is the shit that's the scariest thing you'll do in your entire fucking life. It's sitting down and diving into it. Bad Memories. Do you want to be aware of different bad memories? Do you want to be aware of every fucking rejection you experienced Carol? Stuffing in your subconscious? Do you want to be aware of different emotions?

Speaker 3:          01:43          You're angry, you feel guilty. You shoved that in your subconscious. Different emotional traumas as you're growing up. Shove that in your subconscious. We're just shoving all this shit and stuff. It's like the trash bin of her fucking mind. I was like, just throw it in the trash. Never focused on like never be aware of it again, but just cause we shoved it there. Just cause we're not focusing on it doesn't mean it goes anywhere. It's still there. You're just not aware of, you know, Eckhart toll calls, this pain body attack for example, something happens and you get extremely mad more than you logically slash consciously think you shouldn't be mad about right. That's when Shit that you've been stuffed down kind of pops out. It kind of takes over, but it's not just anger because we think, oh pain body, it's anything that's painful. What's another one? [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          02:26          logically we know it doesn't fucking make sense to be that scared something takes over. Fear of rejection. Is that like a logical like from a conscious perspective like is it make sense to me that fucking scared? No, that is a pain body attack and that's like the process is like sitting down and being like, what have I store down there? Again, it's not running away from it. It's like stopping facing it and like bringing that shit up and experiencing it and that's why it's like so fucking hard and that sort of so stubborn. It's like we just don't want to just fucking keep putting it off no matter what it takes. Thinking that maybe someday it'll just magically click them all. Just be happy. New. Okay. You cannot run away from the pain. You got to run through it. Focus. Next time you have that little pain, body attack, next time something's triggered.

Speaker 3:          03:14          Maybe someone says something that upsets you more than it should instead of what do we all do? As I said before, we tried to escape it instead of running away from it. Go into that. Like again, you break up with your girlfriend. There's another one, like all this trauma kicks in. Don't go for the fucking drink. Don't go for the drugs. Don't go for the party. Don't go for the movie. Don't go for the video game. Don't go for the food. Don't try to escape it. Go into that shit. That's the way there. And uh, again, you're fighting experience resistance. She'll probably have to go into the resistance first on. You're probably gonna be scared shitless to cause you think if you let a little bit of it out, everything will fucking come out. And that is true. Everything will come out like you'll, you'll be in fuck tears.

Speaker 3:          03:55          It'll just be absolute hell. That will happen. But that's the only way to actually process it because you're just hanging on it. And until you let go of that shit, it's always going to block you from getting, finding that default that is happens. Bring awareness to it. Don't run away from it. Let it come up. And again, this is hard because our conditioning to society keeps telling you, run away from pain, went away from pain towards pleasure to hear it go towards the pain, let it come up. Um, embody it fully. Let go of the resistance around it. And then of course, actually experience it.
