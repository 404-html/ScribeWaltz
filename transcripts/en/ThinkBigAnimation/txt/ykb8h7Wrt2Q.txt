Speaker 1:          00:05          A teacher is helping one of his students who was stuck trying to complete a reading assignment. The same is write a 500 word story about her hometown and she can't write a single word. Her town seem so small, so insignificant. How could she ever find something interesting enough to write about? The teacher thinks about this and he decides to change the assignment. Okay. He says, your new assignment is to write about the opera house outside the classroom. In fact, start with the upper lefthand brick. The student is so confused how is she ever going to write about a brick? But she didn't really have any other choice but to get started, once she sat down to write this exercise destroyed her writer's block and she seemed to have endless creativity. She came to class the next day with 20 inspired pages.

Speaker 1:          00:58          When Josh was first starting his journey in chess, the first instructor he had did things a little bit different than most. He took nearly all the pieces off the board and had him practice with just a king and upon versus a king. A little counter intuitive as most people will start from the beginning and work their way through the whole game. But in the beginning there's too much to focus on and most people will become lost by the sheer number of options they have. What Josh has teacher did instead was having focused on less this way. His mind wasn't hindered by countless options and he was able to internalize high level chest principles. We basically have two approaches we can take to learning the first and most common in our add society to try and cram more and more information into our head to try to recite more facts and learn more technique. So we appear to have more knowledge, but this is a very surface layer knowledge. A good example of this would be to click on Facebook right now is go through the 500 different gurus, philosophers and stoics, who all seem to have the perfect philosophy on how you should live your life. Probably based on the last Oprah episode they saw. The second approach is to narrow your focus to one or two things to do less, but to do it incredibly well.

Speaker 2:          02:15          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:16          to focus on depth over breadth through Josh's approach to learning with just a few pieces on the board. It gave is my room to think and completely internalized how each piece moods. He would then move on to a king and a night, then a king in a rook until he deeply internalized every single piece on the board. Now when you actually dove back into the complex, middle and opening game positions, the chaos seems slowed down. He could see the intricacies of each piece. He learned more by focusing on less, what do you call, discovering the macro by diving into the micro and does his knowledge grew, he was able to chunk new information faster and faster. Chunking the ability to take a large amount of information and group it together under a certain principle or pattern where can now be accessed as a single piece of information.

Speaker 2:          03:07          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:08          This creates something called a carved neural pathway in the brain. Imagine it is having to cut your way through a dense jungle with nothing but a machete.

Speaker 2:          03:16          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:16          In the beginning, this will take an incredible amount of time. You will have to monotonicity Plod your way through, but once you carved out a path, anything that fits on that path can get through almost instantaneously. As you learn, you will be able to discover organizing principles that allow you to access new information with increasing ease.

Speaker 1:          03:38          A man wants to walk across the land, but the earth is covered in thorns. He's two options. One is to try and pave a road to try and tame nature into compliance. The other is to make sandals. Making Sandals represents creating an internal solution. It represents a mind that is working in this soft softsoap. It does not require a submissive world to be successful. Instead of does a state of mind that relies on preparation and resilience and resilience is a trait that can be built up over time by planning setbacks, distractions, and adversity into your practice.

Speaker 1:          04:18          There are certain people you run into who you just know. No matter what. We'll always find an excuse to not get something done. They can't do it because they're sick. They can't do it because their girlfriend broke up with them. Do you think Michael Jordan is going to skip practice because he's not feeling good? Do you think Michael Phelps is not going to go slam because his girlfriend broke up with him? No. If anything, they are able to take distractions, pain and setback as fuel to work harder. It actually makes them perform at a higher level. Nothing is going to stop them from completing their work. This is because they have cultivated a mind that lives and breathes in the soft zone. To become a master, you have to train and perfect your art no matter what. If you have a mind that is operating in the hard zone, you were saying, I have no control over my fate and I need the world to cooperate in order for me to get my work done. On the other hand, if your mind is operating in the soft zone, you will either completely ignore external pressure or actually use it to enhance your creativity.

Speaker 1:          05:21          Cultivating a practice in the soft zone, we'll give you an internal locust of control, not just in learning but in life. You can create a proactive, like when that you build from the inside out, you're not reactive to whatever stimulus you happen to be exposed to. You're not going to become a lawyer because mommy and daddy always wanted it. Even though deep down you always wanted to be an artist. You were going to live a life that is true to yourself. True Learning and growth comes when we act in the outer reaches of our ability. You're like a hermit crab that is constantly outgrowing it. Shell, the only way the crab will grow bigger is by abandoning the safety and comfort of his former shell. Now, he has to take a soft, mushy body out into the world. At times you might outgrow certain comforts, certain practice routines, certain teachers you are now like a soft, mushy buddy crab. At times like this, you have to go out and test yourself. Otherwise you become like an anorexic crab that refuses to grow, so he doesn't have to leave his show.
