Speaker 1:          00:00          Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:08          today we are going to be looking at some VI uplifting writing, an Edgar Allen Poe syndicate, red death, illimitable dominion over. Wow, that's depressing. Let's tone it down a bit on some fun on bidding on I ponder the weekend weary over many acquainting. Curious volume move, forgotten on. I nodded, nearly napping. Suddenly there came a tapping as if someone gently rapping, rapping it in my chamber door to some visitor. I muttered tapping at my chamber door only this and nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:46          So the ominous mood set for one of the most famous poems ever written, coming from a generation of horror stories like Stephen King. It is very interesting to look back at someone like Edgar Allen Poe, who's riding while much more subtle than we are used to. It's still capable of sending chills down your spine.

Speaker 1:          01:02          I'm going to first look at the structure of the Raven as it is a very carefully organized poem. The rhyme scheme scene in the first stanza is repeated throughout the poem as well as the internal rhyme scheme. That is the rhymes within the same line. It feels impossible not to be swept off by the hypnotic rhythm, which like a drum beat slowly built in speed and intensity until it reaches a fever pitch where you can imagine this speaker yelling at the top of his lungs, Podo, something very interesting on the second, fourth and fifth lungs. Each line ending with the rhyme or is one syllable shorter than the other two and we can clearly see the final line is much shorter than the rest. The result is that when the raven enters and utters the ominous word, never more, it hangs in the reader's mind emphasizing and exaggerating how this word repeatedly spoken by the Raven, slowly burrows its way into the speaker's mind, driving him to the brink of insanity. What starts out as a story of a talking raven quickly spirals into a story of a man descending into his own personal hell. I told you this would be cheerful, so not much is happening at the start just to man sitting alone reading old books. We find out the room is filled with Purple Silk Curtains and velvet line chairs in a library of old sophisticated books. It is the creepy house in every ghost story and it seems like the perfect place for someone to sit and brood

Speaker 3:          02:22          distinctly. I remember it was in the bleak Duesenberg and it's separate dying ember Reuters ghost upon the floor eagerly. I wish the moral Vinnie had I sought to borrow from my books. So Cecil sorrow, sorrow for the [inaudible], for the Rem Radian meeting, the angel's name, nameless here for ever more.

Speaker 1:          02:47          So we find out the man is trying to bury his sorrow due to his loss of a love. A woman named Lenore. We don't know who she is or what happened to her. All we know is that this man is desperately trying to relieve the pain of losing her and we know the best way to get over a girl is to brood and get all my chemical romance about it. He starts to have hallucinations about her perfume filling the room and longingly remembers her ass print on the velvet cushions. Little weird, but we all take heartbreak a little differently.

Speaker 3:          03:13          I'm the silicon said, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me fill me with fantastic terros. Never felt before.

Speaker 1:          03:22          Most of us probably know the feeling of watching a horror movie and having every creak of the house set. Our nerves are on edge. That seems to be what is happening to our speaker here. Then there's a rapping at the door. This could represent a great many things. First off, it is the unknown is the introduction of the stranger. The Stranger is not a person, but rather a category of experience. It is the introduction of anomaly and uncertainty, which shakes up the status quo. The stranger fills us with both hope and dread. He can inspire us, shower us with gifts, or he can kill us. In this case, the tapping at the door appears as a disruption of the serene state within this man's comfortable chamber.

Speaker 3:          04:02          Presently, my soul grows stronger, hesitating then no longer

Speaker 1:          04:06          so finally built up the courage to open the door, only to find darkness and nothing back

Speaker 3:          04:13          the chamber turning all my soul within the burning sooner. Ghana hood at tapping somewhat louder than before.

Speaker 1:          04:21          Soon he realizes the tapping is coming from the window and he tries to comfort himself,

Speaker 3:          04:26          does the wind and nothing more open. Here I flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter in the step to state the Raven of the saint need days of Yore, not the least of basins made he let a minute stop to a statey, but with mean of Lord or lady perched above my chamber door, perched upon the bust of partners just above my chamber door pitched and sat and nothing more.

Speaker 1:          04:53          And what do you do when a bird flies into your house? Obviously you start talking to it. If you're a crazy person

Speaker 3:          05:00          though the Crespi shown and shaven though I said, I sure know craven gas, the grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore. Tell me what the law, the name is on the nights Plutonian shore quote, the Raven Nevermore.

Speaker 1:          05:17          It is clear. This is no ordinary bird. He calls it a stately raven of the days of Yore and he's clearly approaching it with awe and respect, as you probably know from reading Norse mythology. Okay, who are we kidding? As you probably know from the movie anchorman, the Norse God. Odin has two companion Raven's named Hugans and Muninn roughly translated to thought and memory whom Odin gave the power of speech just as Hugans and Muninn pry beneath the surface of the world in order to bring hidden truth to Oden's ears. So to does our speaker pry into the hidden knowledge he believes the Raven to possess the Raven has purchased self atop the bust of palace. Another name for the Greek Goddess Athena, most commonly known as the goddess of even more connection to the Raven as a source of knowledge and insight. And there was another mythological reference when he says the night's Plutonian shore Pluto, who you'll probably know better as Haiti's was god of the underworld.

Speaker 1:          06:09          A Raven often depicts it, a top skeletons or scavenging a field of human corpses seems exactly like the kind of beast that would occupy our nightmares. It also perfectly sets the mood for this dark and brooding pool of a man alone in his room or depending on how you look at it alone in his mind with nothing to occupy him but his own disturbing thoughts and memories. Now, the communication between the man and the refund continues. The question starts simple. He first asked the ravens name. He then asks if on the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before. Then the bird said never more.

Speaker 3:          06:46          Then upon the velvet seeking, I took myself to linking fancy on the fancy thinking, what? This ominous bird of yours, what this grim on game day gasoline gone an ominous burden of your meant and cooking and nevermind.

Speaker 1:          07:01          He keeps posing more and more serious questions to the Raven. The main already knows the answer to each question. It's still he holds on hope that the raven will tell him something different, but soon as he digs deeper, the answers we'll begin to peck and pry on comfortably at his mind. He asks if the thing he most longs for to see his loss, Lynn nor will ever come to be

Speaker 3:          07:22          quote the Raven nevermore profit I thing of evil profits to live Berto would devil a temptress sandal weather tempest tossed Thedo shore Deslie jet all on daunted Nanda. This desert land and chanted on this home by a horror haunted telling me truly I implore is there is the bomb and kill had tell me, tell me. I implored.

Speaker 1:          07:50          Is there bombing Giliad is just a fancy pants way of asking if you will ever find relief from his sorrow.

Speaker 3:          07:55          Quote the Raven nevermore be that word I sign of partying. Brutal feeding. Nice shrieked upstarting get the back into the tempest and the knights Plutonian shore leave. No black plume as a token of that lied I sold, have spoken. Lead my loneliness unbroken. Quit the buster above my door. Take ty beak from out my heart and take life form and what my door caught. The never mom,

Speaker 1:          08:24          the speaker is blaming all his pain and sorrow on the appearance of the Raven and shrieks for it to go. But the Raven refused. It is the old adage, wherever you go, there you are. The Raven now appears to be a dark fragment within the man's soul and something he's completely incapable of escape. No matter how hard we tried to banish them, the ravens have our own thoughts and memories will forever remain is our constant companions.

Speaker 3:          08:52          And the Raven never flooding. Still is sitting,

Speaker 2:          08:56          still is sitting on the pallet bust of palace just above my chamber door and his eyes have all the seeming of demons that is dreaming and the lamp light oil in streaming throws his shadow on the floor. And my soul amount, that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted. Never.
