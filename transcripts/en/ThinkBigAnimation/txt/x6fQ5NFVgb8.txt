Speaker 1:          00:05          No Mcdonald has had a lot of well wishes recently and a lot of people that would like to throw him down. One, uh, well they want to murder him.

Speaker 2:          00:12          Well,

Speaker 1:          00:17          seems a bit harsh, but old turd Ferguson is found himself in a bit of hot water recently and I have been racking my brain to try and find out why was it for whipping out his dirty cock for an Oprah. Was it for killing his wife and a waiter? Nope. Instead it was for his incredibly ill advised decision to speak honestly and an interview with the Hollywood reporter. I had initially planned this video to be an analysis and tribute to norm, but I now feel the need to address this crazy stolen Essex show trial. He's just been dragged through for his incredibly innocuous comments. But first I want to explain to the folks at home my norm, Macdonald is possibly the greatest comedic mind in the entire universe.

Speaker 3:          00:58          Great Star got blessing world, great people. This is wonderful. Being here at the home

Speaker 2:          01:04          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:07          Don Rickles was the master of the old timey rose, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Frank Sinatra. Nobody was safe from the sharp tongue of Mr. Warmth. It seems so effortless because funny was simply who he was. It was just dawn being done. The roasts of today are very different. The punchline has become almost irrelevant and shock factor seems to be all that matters. When norm as the producers of comedy central, what to talk about on a roast, they told him exactly that to be as shocking as possible. Of course, norm knew right away the most shocking performance he could give and it gave us one of the greatest moments in comedy history.

Speaker 3:          01:44          Yes, but of course he was famous for being a vegetarian. Hey, she may be a vegetarian, but you're still full of Bologna in my book. That's a beautiful face. Like a flower. Yeah, Cali flower, no offense, but your face looks like a collie flower.

Speaker 1:          02:16          This moment is still talked about in the world of comedy is one of the ballsiest things any performer has ever done. The audience expects, even demands profanity and nastiness. Then norm walks up to the podium with all the confidence in the world and begins delivering dad jokes. So exquisitely hokey that they cross over into the realm of genius to those who just know norm from weekend update or his hilariously strange appearances on late night talk show this. It can seem like he is slowly turning into that senile old man. He's always been pretending to be despite the fact that he is one of the most intelligent, well read people in the world of comedy. Norm is okay with giving off this persona of the crazy rambling uncle and for a very good reason, his what

Speaker 4:          03:00          he should be doing as being funny. That should be his goal. Your friend Bill Maher for instance, you know, he wants to be seen as an intellectual, this Miller, Dennis Miller, but a Letterman, but Letterman understands he's smarter than both of them. He understands. Play the dumb guy, you know, play the play, the play, the every man. Nobody likes a guy smarter than them. That's the worst. The worst guy. You can be a guy smarter than the audience. They're going to hate you, you know? Yeah. It's a very good observation

Speaker 1:          03:35          and just in case you thought he really was that. See now old man, he often seems to be, feel free to test his wit off the cuff

Speaker 3:          03:42          and I slept at the parking lot. Oh, the comedy store and I had no money and I was broke. Both. Yeah. You are making a movie with carrot top right? I made a movie with carrot top. Okay. All right. It's like nine and a half weeks, but carrot top.

Speaker 2:          04:04          Wow.

Speaker 3:          04:06          I got to check out that movie you called nine and a half seconds movie going to be called. I know it's going to be called. Yep.

Speaker 2:          04:15          What's that?

Speaker 3:          04:18          If it's got carrot top and it, you know what a good name for it. B. What's that? Norm box office poison from Mcdonald's. God bless. You're watching. Your set was like watching Henry Fonda pick blueberries. Why? I don't think there's a person in here there would not love to watch Henry Fonda.

Speaker 2:          04:43          Big Boy

Speaker 3:          04:47          movie coming out. Yes, title undetermined at this point. Chairman of the board. Wow. All right. Do something with that. You can breed. I, I've had the board is spelled Bor.

Speaker 2:          05:02          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:09          If you try and tell your favorite norm McDonald joke to a friend where you will find as you stand there in awkward silence is the norms. Delivery is one of the most important factors to a success. He's mastered the ability to keep the audience off balance. You're expecting a short joke. He gives you a long one. You're expecting a clever punchline. He gives you a simple one. You're expecting him to be dumb. He makes it profound and sincere statement norm has devoted his entire life to finding out what it will take to delight and surprise the audience. Every pause, every expression, every delivery he makes is always with the punchline in mind. When you launched into his joke and most of the credit is wondering if this guy has any idea what he's doing, those who know him understand that the innocent looking smile means that he is an absolute control of what's happening.

Speaker 1:          05:57          If you watch norm long enough, you will have no choice but to conclude the, he's one of the most loving and caring people in all of show business. If you want to see evidence of this, you need only to look at him tearing up in his last appearance on Letterman or watch him crash. The set of Conan, not long after Conan learns that he's losing the tonight show to Jay Leno. According to someone who is at the show. Conan was shaking the entire time when the band spoon played. He held up their vinyl to introduce him and he was shaking even more. Didn't nor makes his surprise appearance.

Speaker 3:          06:25          Well, I want to drop by show my respects, you know. Well, you know, for you to bring up a basket commemorating sort of the, the, the tough situation I'm in is really nice.

Speaker 2:          06:37          Hello Salad.

Speaker 3:          06:38          That is well, what, what, what does this basket or this is an older basket. I a I procrastinate as you know, and uh, this is a basket. I got you back in June.

Speaker 2:          06:50          No,

Speaker 3:          06:51          you've had this basket since June. Yeah, I've seen you. You've been on the show like three times. Why didn't you ever give me the basket? I kept forgetting, but I wanted you to know I bought it. It was $60. I wouldn't open it. I think it would smell.

Speaker 2:          07:08          Okay.

Speaker 3:          07:08          Why does a card also I, yeah, I see that assess. Congrats. That's, that's terrific. Oh, I don't know if that, can I read it? Yeah. Why not? Congratulations Conan and finally securing your place as permanent host of the tonight.

Speaker 2:          07:23          Sure.

Speaker 3:          07:32          That's something that could never take away. It is perhaps the shrewdest programming decision ever. It made me see a brain trust. Sure. The pressure is on, but if I know you, Conan O'brien, miserable failure is not an option yet.

Speaker 2:          08:01          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          08:02          The new late night. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          08:08          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:10          He delivers this absolutely hilarious bit and is able to make a hard situation so much lighter through laughter after seeing how kind norm can beat. It's so hard to see him being dragged in front of the view to apologize for his comments, which were so much less controversial than the ones made by that Holocaust denying sidekick of his in the Hollywood reporter interview. He first says that he's happy. The me too movement has slowed down a bit and felt that people like Chris Hardwick got the raw end of the stick. He also talks about how we set up a call between Lucy Keen Roseanne because they had the unique experience of having the careers ended in one fell swoop and that the victims did not experience the same thing. Twitter, a place which has mastered the art of interpreting everything in the worst possible way took this to mean that norm thinks Louie and Rosanne had it worse than the me two victims. He may have been guilty of a poor choice of words, but if you allow him to explain himself, that is very clearly not what he meant. He simply felt bad for his friend Roseanne and didn't know who could relate to her situation other than Louie. What happens after this? His appearance on the tonight show was canceled after Jimmy Fallon staffers were apparently in tears. Come on, man, as a brittle spirit and he had to go under the view, not only to apologize, but to apologize for his previous apology on Howard Stern.

Speaker 4:          09:21          I said, not many of us have gone through this and and so you should talk to each other because you've you. And then the guy said, what about the victims? And I said, well, the victims haven't gone through this. I was talking about this particular event. Of course the victims have gone through worse than that, but I want to get a victim to phone Roseanne. No, but that's a good clarification. I don't want to be tossed in with people that actually did not crimes, but since our, you know, I, uh, no, I barely have consensual sex.

Speaker 1:          10:01          I can't believe nor for apologizing because none of us know what it's like to feel that kind of social pressure being put on you. And most of the people hitting on norm by saying he cooks out by apologizing or the same people who would crumble if they had to step on stage for even an open mic night. It takes insane balls to do it. Norm has done throughout his career. But getting the apology from him is crucial for those who are trying to drag the names of norm and others through the mind. The best analogy I can make us to Arthur Miller's play the crucible. It is set in the hysteria of the Salem witch trials. The accused are given two options, admitted their crimes in live or deny wrongdoing and be executed. The people who signed the false confessions to save their life soon. Find out that those holding the trials are using the confessions as validation and proof that the trials being held are just, and their decision to confess is actually helping them condemn their friends who are denying the charges levied against them.

Speaker 1:          10:53          Let us throw open the floor to a wild accusations. There are three steps which take place in these media and Twitter. Witch hunts. Step one, the person must have something to lose. They must believe that not admitting guilt will land them in a worse situation than there are now. Step two, you get them to confess to their wrongdoing, which gives validation to the inquisition that is being held by his admission of guilt. Your actions as accuser have now been justified in the mind of the public. You can either proceed with the planned execution in this case that would be protesting his show until it's canceled or by your own mercy. You will allow him to soak back with his spirit thoroughly crushed if he promises now, were you thinking twice before?

Speaker 2:          11:35          Yeah, and it gets out of your mouth.

Speaker 1:          11:41          The beauty of someone like norm is that he says exactly what comes to his mind without thinking about how his words will be interpreted. If this man loses his will to speak freely out of fear of repercussions, it would be a travesty and we would have destroyed perhaps the greatest comedian of our generation. The firestorm quickly died this time, but it doesn't mean that others will be so lucky in the future. I'm glad to see the most, the internet seems to be on norm side with this as a man of true comedic integrity, he has always refused to compromise and has constantly risked everything to tell the truth. And while it may have held him back from the stardom, he could have attained, it has earned him a permanent place as one of comedies all time greats,

Speaker 4:          12:20          woody Allen. And they went on stage and a lot of the people did much better than him. And he was upset and his manager said, no, no, it's what you leave on a stage. That was his remark upon woody Allen. And so, uh, I always thought, well, I guy like Andrew dice clay would destroy, you know, and have me hitting the wall, as you say. But then afterwards, maybe it feel a little queasy, whereas you kill and then you leave something nice on the stage. You know, it's one thing to make people laugh. It's another to make people smile. Wow.
