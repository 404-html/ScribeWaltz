12
00:00:41.891 --> 00:00:43.870
<v Speaker 1>of stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about a lot of things,</v>

13
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.260
<v Speaker 1>but there's always these great goofs </v>
<v Speaker 1>laughs and gaffs and boobs even.</v>

14
00:00:49.391 --> 00:00:53.110
<v Speaker 1>I would even venture to say a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>booths that fall through the crack.</v>

15
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.363
<v Speaker 1>They're great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we just didn't have time to get to </v>

16
00:00:56.621 --> 00:00:57.454

<v Speaker 1>and even myself to go through all of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>documents over the course of the past </v>

18
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.403
<v Speaker 1>year and to salvage to save our fallen </v>
<v Speaker 1>meme brothers who have fallen behind </v>

19
00:01:11.111 --> 00:01:12.460
<v Speaker 1>enemy lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we've said,</v>

21
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.500

<v Speaker 1>These deserve to be aired.</v>

22
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.440
<v Speaker 1>And so that is what we are here to do </v>

<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>

35
00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:53.260
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was your first episode?</v>

36
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.700
<v Speaker 2>The first episode was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what the first episode was,</v>

37
00:01:57.701 --> 00:01:59.860
<v Speaker 2>Joey Salads?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

38
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.980
<v Speaker 2>How was that as like an introduction?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were,</v>

39
00:02:02.981 --> 00:02:05.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you were fans of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you knew who we were.</v>

40
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.771
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

41
00:02:05.771 --> 00:02:08.460
<v Speaker 2>I was a fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched the show or the,</v>

42
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.150
<v Speaker 2>the main channel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

43
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.013
<v Speaker 2>pretty regularly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I knew Joey Salads and that was </v>

44
00:02:12.881 --> 00:02:13.714
<v Speaker 2>definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was definitely a weird thing to </v>

45
00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:17.650
<v Speaker 2>step into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think the second week with Steevo,</v>

46
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.660
<v Speaker 2>which was fucking awesome to get to meet</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

47
00:02:19.661 --> 00:02:22.180
<v Speaker 2>So that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a good introduction.</v>

48
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.730
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the producer we cherish and love.</v>

49
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.073
<v Speaker 2>We were a bit of a mess here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Dan was like a great recommendation </v>

50
00:02:29.411 --> 00:02:31.900
<v Speaker 2>from somebody through twitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

51
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we're like,</v>

52
00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:35.620
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to just work full time?</v>

53

<v Speaker 2>well yeah.</v>

54
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.590

55
00:02:41.591 --> 00:02:42.390
<v Speaker 2>And we're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

70
00:03:11.971 --> 00:03:13.840
<v Speaker 4>times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it bears being repeated because it's</v>

71
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 4>such a great cause that we get a lot of </v>

<v Speaker 4>Now was that a technique I have to ask,</v>

93
00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:10.414
<v Speaker 4>what were you reading?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Other people's similar emails because </v>

<v Speaker 4>Not really actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you said keep trying.</v>

105
00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:36.964
<v Speaker 4>the people out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That persistence is truly the key to </v>

106
00:04:40.721 --> 00:04:45.460
<v Speaker 4>either success or prison depending on </v>
<v Speaker 4>how weird you are fighting your case.</v>

107
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.220
<v Speaker 4>Success restraining order.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

108
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.690
<v Speaker 4>One or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

109
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.970

<v Speaker 4>But not all of us have that gift.</v>

110
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.830
<v Speaker 4>And Ian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to say a,</v>

<v Speaker 4>He's blossomed into so much more.</v>

114

<v Speaker 4>Alex Hirsch and Dana terrorists.</v>

130
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.180
<v Speaker 4>I blanked.</v>

131
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.270
<v Speaker 4>and Joey Salads,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we're trying to think how can we,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>involve Joey Salads in this?</v>

133
00:05:51.311 --> 00:05:53.650
<v Speaker 4>And we were thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well we already pepper sprayed him.</v>

134
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.500
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we can shoot them with a nonlethal</v>
<v Speaker 4>bein bad.</v>

135
00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.450

<v Speaker 1>That'd be fine.</v>

136
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.660

168
00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:16.664
<v Speaker 1>the Turkish food segment and this is one</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I have personally been working on </v>

169
00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:24.890
<v Speaker 1>for a long time and you guys have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of working along with me to collect</v>

194
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.640
<v Speaker 1>translation for 16 months and tripe </v>
<v Speaker 1>belly fat cheese open and tasted for the</v>

195
00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:01.824
<v Speaker 1>wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was quite heavy and couldn't even </v>

196
00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:07.980
<v Speaker 1>stand the smell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a very special and delicious cheese.</v>

197
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in general,</v>

198
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:11.514
<v Speaker 1>the families for consumption at home </v>
<v Speaker 1>such as pressing out the room and we're </v>

199
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:16.430
<v Speaker 1>not coincide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

200
00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:17.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this gets,</v>

201
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:18.450
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that clears it all.</v>

202
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:23.970
<v Speaker 1>It just says wildlife but not what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal barely fats.</v>

203
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Well it sounds like it was fermented and</v>
<v Speaker 1>an actual belly,</v>

204
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.960
<v Speaker 1>but I love this line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even stand the smell.</v>

205
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.950
<v Speaker 1>Very special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

206
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.840
<v Speaker 1>So there you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But would that being said,</v>

207
00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:41.070
<v Speaker 1>let's jump right into this Turkish food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what we have here.</v>

208
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.333
<v Speaker 1>So one thing I've noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because in Israel obviously there's </v>

209
00:09:47.641 --> 00:09:48.474
<v Speaker 1>rules of kosher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means you cannot mix meat and </v>

210
00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:52.044
<v Speaker 1>cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the Turks almost in a way of being </v>

211
00:09:53.761 --> 00:09:58.761
<v Speaker 1>like sucks to be Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go all out on the cheese and meat.</v>

212
00:10:00.411 --> 00:10:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Like even in America I've never seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

213
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:07.020
<v Speaker 1>It would take a look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought they were kosher in,</v>

214
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.630
<v Speaker 1>in Turkey as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's,</v>

215
00:10:09.631 --> 00:10:12.330
<v Speaker 1>hello Dan is what it's called and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

216
00:10:12.331 --> 00:10:15.690
<v Speaker 1>hello?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can mix meat and cheese.</v>

217
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.870
<v Speaker 1>They cannot drink alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are not,</v>

218
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.600
<v Speaker 1>they share a lot of the similarities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they don't eat pig.</v>

219
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.003
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

220
00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:26.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they plant food and shellfish.</v>

221
00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Shellfish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

222
00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>

223
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.590
<v Speaker 1>But they can do the dairy and the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they are like,</v>

224
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.920
<v Speaker 1>God bless them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took their like praise be to a law.</v>

225
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.580
<v Speaker 1>We're going all out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's dairy and meat.</v>

226
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As you should so happy.</v>

227
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:43.710
<v Speaker 5>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

228
00:10:43.711 --> 00:10:44.544
<v Speaker 5>what is this whole method of cooking is </v>
<v Speaker 5>bananas to me so that he cooked it and </v>

229
00:10:48.301 --> 00:10:50.960
<v Speaker 5>like a pile of sand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

230
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:53.610
<v Speaker 5>He takes out this unbelievably tender </v>
<v Speaker 5>rack of ribs,</v>

231
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.340
<v Speaker 5>loved the music management,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Spiderman and elsewhere.</v>

232
00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.513
<v Speaker 5>Those bones slide right out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is a incredibly beautifully </v>

233
00:11:02.611 --> 00:11:05.400
<v Speaker 5>cut piece of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now here's where it gets insane.</v>

234
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:06.803
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he took a what looks like 10 pounds </v>

235
00:11:09.181 --> 00:11:14.181
<v Speaker 5>of cheese and put it on top 10 pounds of</v>
<v Speaker 5>cheese on top and just without any grief</v>

236
00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.460
<v Speaker 5>at all,</v>

<v Speaker 1>So sometimes what they make such an </v>

328
00:15:10.581 --> 00:15:14.840
<v Speaker 1>obscene amount of food that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it literally doesn't make sense.</v>

329
00:15:14.841 --> 00:15:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't even know how he uses all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

330
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:17.743
<v Speaker 1>So a restaurant I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even still like [inaudible] it is a </v>

331
00:15:21.861 --> 00:15:25.370
<v Speaker 1>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks like he's on the older equals.</v>

332
00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.430
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

333
00:15:29.431 --> 00:15:32.410
<v Speaker 5>Ray William Johnson took a weird twist </v>
<v Speaker 5>of Glasgow,</v>

334
00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.950
<v Speaker 5>so he flips upside down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was probably 20 or 30 pounds of food,</v>

335
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.580
<v Speaker 5>a food that frankly doesn't even look </v>
<v Speaker 5>like it belongs together.</v>

336
00:15:41.581 --> 00:15:45.930
<v Speaker 5>But right off the bone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right off the bones.</v>

337
00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.290
<v Speaker 5>This is their mood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They juggle it.</v>

338
00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:54.660
<v Speaker 5>I know it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing.</v>

339
00:15:54.661 --> 00:15:55.494
<v Speaker 5>Like stuffed pepper looks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd hit that if it was cooked to meet </v>

340
00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.140
<v Speaker 5>my mom cook separately.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

380
00:18:09.661 --> 00:18:10.494
<v Speaker 5>the top,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the beat like I feel is almost </v>

381
00:18:12.601 --> 00:18:15.840
<v Speaker 5>trolling the American crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's what you want is,</v>

<v Speaker 1>But it's Turkish people watching it.</v>

384
00:18:18.311 --> 00:18:20.920
<v Speaker 1>It's not Americans is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the only American watching this.</v>

00:18:22.931 --> 00:18:24.850
<v Speaker 1>The comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what I thought too.</v>

387
00:18:24.851 --> 00:18:25.631
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

00:18:25.631 --> 00:18:28.240
<v Speaker 1>look at how what these Americans eat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>these Turkish people are like,</v>

389
00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.750
<v Speaker 1>like making us look like amateur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't ever seen,</v>

391
00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stop watching porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just watch when he dipped,</v>

392
00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.193
<v Speaker 1>pours that cheese on that steak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's enough to get me rock hard every </v>

393
00:18:40.741 --> 00:18:43.030
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

394
00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:43.983
<v Speaker 1>what else we got?</v>

395
00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.053
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

396
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:47.370
<v Speaker 5>this one is so weird,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

397
00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.770
<v Speaker 5>I'm wondering what you guys are going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>think about this.</v>

398
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.900
<v Speaker 5>So he starts with the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got a huge hammer tank.</v>

399
00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:55.743
<v Speaker 5>It's got a mallet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a massive hammer and a witch's </v>

400
00:18:58.921 --> 00:19:01.500
<v Speaker 5>cauldron.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

401
00:19:01.501 --> 00:19:03.990
<v Speaker 5>he's doing this classic little shake </v>
<v Speaker 5>meat off the bone.</v>

402
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.450
<v Speaker 5>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what's on the bottom there,</v>

403
00:19:09.451 --> 00:19:11.040
<v Speaker 5>but I'm down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So now he takes it.</v>

404
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:16.340
<v Speaker 5>He's got meat and tomato paste and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>huge hammer and he's liquid eye.</v>

405
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.390
<v Speaker 5>He's smashed it all into it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Looks like reefer.</v>

406
00:19:21.391 --> 00:19:22.310
<v Speaker 5>I advanced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

407
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.153
<v Speaker 5>it looks like our re fried beans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never seen cooking like this my </v>

408
00:19:26.911 --> 00:19:31.911
<v Speaker 5>whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So now somehow this chicken and meat,</v>

409
00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.620
<v Speaker 5>it's turned into a paste and he's the </v>
<v Speaker 5>line,</v>

410
00:19:35.621 --> 00:19:36.454
<v Speaker 5>the bottom of the pan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now he's just covering it with </v>

411
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:39.533
<v Speaker 5>boiling oil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you told me there was meat in </v>

412
00:19:44.821 --> 00:19:46.530
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't have no idea.</v>

413
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell was that?</v>

414
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:52.500
<v Speaker 1>That one has me scratching my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that wild or what?</v>

415
00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:54.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it looks like.</v>

416
00:19:54.601 --> 00:19:56.970
<v Speaker 1>You could like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like asphalt at the end.</v>

417
00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:01.050
<v Speaker 1>He could pay for road with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you start with this really succulent</v>

418
00:20:01.051 --> 00:20:03.150
<v Speaker 1>beautiful meat and then you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:00.803

474
00:23:02.091 --> 00:23:04.520
<v Speaker 1>college random beats it into a pace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

475
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.080
<v Speaker 1>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a two parter.</v>

476
00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So back to Salt Bay.</v>

479
00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:19.970
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was kind of,</v>

480
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.440
<v Speaker 1>I have to say a little bit disillusioned</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I saw salt bays actual content,</v>

481
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:25.723
<v Speaker 1>because as you'll see in this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does not display the best cooking </v>

482
00:23:28.731 --> 00:23:32.180
<v Speaker 1>prowess that swatch.</v>

483
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:38.070
<v Speaker 3>So he has a sausage that's pretty rap </v>
<v Speaker 3>cuts.</v>

484
00:23:38.071 --> 00:23:43.071
<v Speaker 3>It very dramatically feels off rapping </v>
<v Speaker 3>like he wants to fuck it.</v>

485
00:23:45.951 --> 00:23:46.784
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Sasha's cuts it in half.</v>

487
00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:52.010
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

488
00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:57.110

625
00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:05.280
<v Speaker 4>Falling one ditch was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the genesis may have been Kelsey</v>

626
00:31:05.281 --> 00:31:06.750
<v Speaker 4>grammer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to play it from here.</v>

<v Speaker 4>No problem.</v>

631
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:18.490

<v Speaker 4>We had put that video in the,</v>

632
00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.770
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>let me grab that here.</v>

635
00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:28.230

636
00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:38.230
<v Speaker 8>she set this up with a little bit with </v>
<v Speaker 8>some context.</v>

637
00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:40.371
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he,</v>

638
00:31:40.371 --> 00:31:41.204
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was doing a speech at a Disney </v>

639
00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.790
<v Speaker 4>Disneyland I think or just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

640
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:47.780
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was Disney.</v>

641
00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:50.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or he was at California adventure.</v>

642
00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:02.080
<v Speaker 8>All bad things happen at small world.</v>

<v Speaker 4>the good Lord Ward backdrop.</v>

645
00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:16.360
<v Speaker 4>He's pretty defeated about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

646
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.260
<v Speaker 4>I've often wondered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

647
00:32:18.261 --> 00:32:21.830
<v Speaker 4>there's this gag and family guy where </v>

<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>

649
00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:27.320

<v Speaker 4>inspired by this clip because he kind of</v>

650
00:32:27.321 --> 00:32:29.120
<v Speaker 4>does that here.</v>

<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

664
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.540
<v Speaker 4>I think his father was targeted by </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone.</v>

665
00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:22.850
<v Speaker 4>I read that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then his sister was,</v>

<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

00:33:26.481 --> 00:33:27.150
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

669
00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:29.980

<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>

670
00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:34.070
<v Speaker 4>And then both of his half brothers died </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a scuba diving accident.</v>

671
00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:37.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His whole family perished.</v>

672
00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:37.791
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

673
00:33:37.791 --> 00:33:40.860
<v Speaker 4>All in different times of years apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is,</v>

674
00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:44.000
<v Speaker 4>that is unbelievably tragic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't leave the house if I was him.</v>

675
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.790
<v Speaker 4>And then there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where he has fallen off the stage.</v>

676
00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is his first time.</v>

677
00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:50.203
<v Speaker 4>There was a weird coincidence where the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the name of the guy who killed his </v>

678
00:33:54.711 --> 00:33:56.720
<v Speaker 4>father,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whose last name was niles,</v>

679
00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.760
<v Speaker 4>which is the name of his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

680
00:33:58.761 --> 00:33:59.594
<v Speaker 4>the brother and brother and frazier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the name of the guy who killed </v>

681
00:34:03.321 --> 00:34:04.880
<v Speaker 4>his sister.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His name was,</v>

682
00:34:04.881 --> 00:34:06.470

<v Speaker 4>simulation or I don't know the word </v>

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:16.683
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

708
00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:19.283
<v Speaker 4>So what happened here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess they came up with the feds to </v>

709
00:35:23.171 --> 00:35:25.040
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I caught on someone's horn or something.</v>

710
00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:29.600
<v Speaker 4>Apparently she was supposed to take the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cape off earlier,</v>

711
00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:32.870
<v Speaker 4>but it was tied too tightly and she </v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't get it off.</v>

712
00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:34.330
<v Speaker 4>Wardrobe malfunction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

713
00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:36.820
<v Speaker 4>Let's see that one again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

714
00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:37.950
<v Speaker 4>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was quite,</v>

715
00:35:37.951 --> 00:35:40.320
<v Speaker 4>the tumble there does not mean she knew </v>
<v Speaker 4>it was coming.</v>

716
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:44.460
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the trying to get it off right.</v>

717
00:35:44.461 --> 00:35:48.180
<v Speaker 4>Somebody pulled in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone yanked her ass off the stage.</v>

718
00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:53.040
<v Speaker 4>But the answers are all pros.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just like keep going.</v>

719
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.910
<v Speaker 4>I think one of them may have been trying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to help her get it off.</v>

720
00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:00.310
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he yanked her ass off the stage.</v>

721
00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:01.163
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause he gave it up really good tug and </v>

722
00:36:03.121 --> 00:36:04.680
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck this kid.</v>

<v Speaker 4>she responded to it.</v>

725

<v Speaker 4>Armani hooked me up.</v>

<v Speaker 4>She's like a mega fall there.</v>

730
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.050
<v Speaker 4>Nothing can bring her down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did she say?</v>

731
00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:29.483
<v Speaker 4>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

732
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:31.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's pretty big hole.</v>

740
00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:05.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

741
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:08.960

<v Speaker 4>giant hole in it.</v>

745
00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:16.940
<v Speaker 4>show up from the hole,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

<v Speaker 4>really special moment.</v>

884
00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:01.823

<v Speaker 4>Let's see.</v>

887
00:44:07.921 --> 00:44:09.680
<v Speaker 4>Fast forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>

888
00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:11.540
<v Speaker 4>Quarter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quarter speed in corridor.</v>

889
00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go ultra slow here.</v>

890
00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:15.450
<v Speaker 4>So here we have a</v>

891
00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:18.540
<v Speaker 9>this faith,</v>

892
00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:25.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure why he thought this was </v>
<v Speaker 5>great at wwf and body.</v>

893
00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:32.183
<v Speaker 5>What a pro.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'll notice that she falls to the </v>

894
00:44:34.171 --> 00:44:38.070
<v Speaker 5>ground and associated with the dark </v>
<v Speaker 5>hair,</v>

895
00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:39.523
<v Speaker 5>the dark hair right here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then the blonde girl girls like his </v>

896
00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:48.120
<v Speaker 5>music sounds even better.</v>

897
00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:52.683
<v Speaker 4>And apparently I found this article </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they said he was told not to do </v>

898
00:44:56.361 --> 00:44:59.480
<v Speaker 4>the jump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He asked him before if he could and they</v>

899
00:44:59.481 --> 00:45:00.314
<v Speaker 4>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't do it.</v>

900
00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:01.633
<v Speaker 4>And he went for it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And was there any consequence of that </v>

901
00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.273
<v Speaker 4>while they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Felipe?</v>

902
00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:08.233
<v Speaker 4>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I found this was immediately after </v>

903
00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:11.593
<v Speaker 4>backstage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He brought the girl that hit the deck </v>

904
00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.220
<v Speaker 4>backstage to apologize</v>

905
00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:19.730
<v Speaker 2>and then he did an interview with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously there's a little bit of a,</v>

906
00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:21.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you give it your all when you're onstage</v>

907
00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:27.460
<v Speaker 2>icing her elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

908
00:45:28.351 --> 00:45:28.640
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

909
00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:29.473
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately we met under not the best </v>

910
00:45:34.281 --> 00:45:37.630
<v Speaker 2>circumstances trying to quarter,</v>

911
00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:41.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this is a setup for a day,</v>

912
00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:44.080
<v Speaker 4>not the best circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll just kick you in the head</v>

913
00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:45.401
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know what happened?</v>

916
00:45:46.721 --> 00:45:47.120
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

917
00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:47.953
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

<v Speaker 4>the other girl that got hit actually did</v>

935
00:46:32.411 --> 00:46:34.340
<v Speaker 4>sue him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did she win?</v>

<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll use this as an opportunity to get </v>

945
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:58.210
<v Speaker 4>to meet my idol or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

946
00:46:58.720 --> 00:46:59.553
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was definitely keeping it ambiguous </v>

947
00:47:00.971 --> 00:47:03.180
<v Speaker 4>for legal reasons as scripture.</v>

948
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.570
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what her representation,</v>

949
00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:10.270
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>instead of taking her to get her checked</v>

950
00:47:10.271 --> 00:47:11.104
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you brought her to go do a quick </v>

951
00:47:12.041 --> 00:47:13.730
<v Speaker 4>interview.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like that,</v>

952
00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't really appreciate that.</v>

953
00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:19.570
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God flows terrific stuff.</v>

954
00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:22.270
<v Speaker 4>And that was the last of the stage </v>
<v Speaker 4>falls.</v>

955
00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:23.663
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It shouldn't be as funny as it is to </v>

956
00:47:26.441 --> 00:47:29.040
<v Speaker 4>watch people follow this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

957
00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:31.060
<v Speaker 4>Is it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's great because it's,</v>

958
00:47:31.061 --> 00:47:31.894
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>watching someone fall just by itself is </v>

959
00:47:35.261 --> 00:47:36.990
<v Speaker 4>already great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

960
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.190
<v Speaker 4>But then when you see like a famous </v>
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>

961
00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:40.473
<v Speaker 4>like these idols that people look up to </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are like untouchable larger than </v>

962
00:47:43.511 --> 00:47:48.511
<v Speaker 4>life falling through a hole in the stage</v>
<v Speaker 4>contrast shot of mine to I believe is,</v>

963
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:52.150
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's humanizing,</v>

964
00:47:52.151 --> 00:47:52.984
<v Speaker 4>I guess in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just see that they're just people they </v>

965
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:55.990
<v Speaker 4>eat shit.</v>

1140
00:56:41.921 --> 00:56:44.800
<v Speaker 10>can't read it from the article you had </v>

<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So he was served on the city council,</v>

1142
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:54.370
<v Speaker 10>which made recommendations about how the</v>
<v Speaker 10>city should grow.</v>

1143
00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:55.773
<v Speaker 10>And he had a pretty high up job.</v>
<v Speaker 10>He's a well respected member of the </v>

1144
00:56:58.571 --> 00:56:59.580
<v Speaker 10>community.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

1145
00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:05.640

<v Speaker 10>public sidewalk and Australia,</v>

1146
00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:11.020

<v Speaker 1>That's too perfect.</v>

1148
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:23.200
<v Speaker 1>So I think the story is</v>

1149
00:57:23.410 --> 00:57:24.243
<v Speaker 10>not stage.</v>
<v Speaker 10>The guy that took this picture actually </v>

1150
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:31.950
<v Speaker 10>was planning it for like a year because </v>
<v Speaker 10>they kept getting this like human shit</v>

1151
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:36.800
<v Speaker 1>on this street</v>

1152
00:57:38.350 --> 00:57:39.183
<v Speaker 10>and it was like not even,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it was clear that it wasn't an accident </v>

1153
00:57:41.621 --> 00:57:44.910
<v Speaker 10>cause sometimes you would even like </v>
<v Speaker 10>toilet paper and next to them he left,</v>

1154
00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:48.790
<v Speaker 10>he brought to the paper with him.</v>
<v Speaker 10>He went there to get outside.</v>

1155
00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:49.631
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 10>Pre murder.</v>

1157
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:52.023
<v Speaker 10>Premeditated kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And so over time the people that leave </v>

1158
00:57:56.531 --> 00:57:57.364
<v Speaker 10>them,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that area we're trying to figure out </v>

1159
00:57:58.721 --> 00:58:03.721
<v Speaker 10>like when he was doing it to find the </v>
<v Speaker 10>schedule is something and then they were</v>

1160
00:58:03.881 --> 00:58:08.881
<v Speaker 10>trying to get a picture of him so they </v>
<v Speaker 10>could reveal who it was and it took them</v>

1161
00:58:09.131 --> 00:58:09.964
<v Speaker 10>about a year until they figured out and </v>
<v Speaker 10>like the time that it was usually doing </v>

1162
00:58:13.601 --> 00:58:14.434
<v Speaker 10>it and then they left.</v>
<v Speaker 10>They tried living like caroline has in </v>

1163
00:58:17.171 --> 00:58:18.004

00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:27.630
<v Speaker 10>eventually this guy was waiting for him </v>
<v Speaker 10>with the camera and when he was about to</v>

1165
00:58:27.941 --> 00:58:28.774
<v Speaker 10>snap the picture there was like a red </v>
<v Speaker 10>dot on the camera and he saw it and </v>

1166
00:58:31.961 --> 00:58:34.270
<v Speaker 10>looked and that's when he took the </v>
<v Speaker 10>picture.</v>

1167
00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:41.760

1289
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:24.490
<v Speaker 2>Think he's hitting like there's lower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1290
01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1291
01:04:25.811 --> 01:04:27.430
<v Speaker 2>everyone at home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to,</v>

1292
01:04:27.431 --> 01:04:30.520
<v Speaker 2>your path to stardom is very clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very simple.</v>

1293
01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:31.413
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you gotta do is on there you have </v>

1294
01:04:33.911 --> 01:04:34.241
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1295
01:04:34.241 --> 01:04:36.760
<v Speaker 2>that one's pretty straight forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now we'll get into the,</v>

1296
01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:38.270
<v Speaker 2>to the hardship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>

1297
01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:39.430
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1298
01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.950
<v Speaker 2>this guy guerard Dani,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1299
01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:42.813
<v Speaker 2>now he evidently has since broken the </v>
<v Speaker 2>record since this video I'm about to </v>

1300
01:04:45.461 --> 01:04:46.720
<v Speaker 2>show you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is no,</v>

1301
01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:50.410
<v Speaker 2>there's no video of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a guinness verified thing,</v>

1302
01:04:50.830 --> 01:04:51.663
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1303
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:55.410
<v Speaker 3>there is apparently a record that </v>
<v Speaker 3>exists.</v>

1304
01:04:55.411 --> 01:04:57.720
<v Speaker 3>He's a dream diocese.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was on a German television show.</v>

1305
01:04:57.721 --> 01:05:02.721
<v Speaker 3>We did it most number of plungers stuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>to someone's back.</v>

1306
01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.420
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that even a category?</v>

1307
01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:08.970
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this is where it starts to get,</v>

1308
01:05:08.971 --> 01:05:10.640
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the beginning of the gate.</v>

1309
01:05:10.641 --> 01:05:14.050
<v Speaker 3>Farnam here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1312
01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:24.490
<v Speaker 3>And that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only is there a record for this,</v>

1313
01:05:24.491 --> 01:05:25.324
<v Speaker 3>but the record in 60 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I guess this is more of just a </v>

1314
01:05:28.751 --> 01:05:29.584
<v Speaker 3>demonstration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this guy does have the record and </v>

1315
01:05:30.851 --> 01:05:32.500
<v Speaker 3>the record is 15.</v>

<v Speaker 2>old clips?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this viral cause if it's fake,</v>

<v Speaker 4>it looks real.</v>

1671
01:24:20.930 --> 01:24:21.763
<v Speaker 4>I have a feeling it's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really like the one time only thing </v>

1672
01:24:26.051 --> 01:24:26.884
<v Speaker 4>seems suspicious to me now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would you only be able to do it </v>

1673
01:24:29.051 --> 01:24:31.380
<v Speaker 4>once?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 4>and thank you for supporting me in this </v>

<v Speaker 4>Goofs and what?</v>

1677
01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:47.920
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's this same reporter,</v>

1678
01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:51.790
<v Speaker 4>another live broadcast with the ice </v>
<v Speaker 4>sculpture.</v>

1679
01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:53.433
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How I saw that first few days I was </v>

1680
01:24:54.971 --> 01:24:55.421
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

01:24:55.421 --> 01:24:57.970
<v Speaker 4>this is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is real.</v>

1682
01:24:57.971 --> 01:24:58.804
<v Speaker 4>This is real stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I saw this clip and threw </v>

1683
01:25:02.561 --> 01:25:07.270
<v Speaker 4>everything into question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here we go.</v>

1684
01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:09.750
<v Speaker 4>Your prize possessions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1685
01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:11.110
<v Speaker 4>This is a Barocas Cherub.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1686
01:25:11.111 --> 01:25:12.850
<v Speaker 4>it's actually been a very tough piece to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

1687
01:25:12.851 --> 01:25:14.530
<v Speaker 4>We've been working on it for about eight</v>
<v Speaker 4>hours right now.</v>

1688
01:25:14.531 --> 01:25:16.240
<v Speaker 4>We still got quite a ways to go on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful.</v>

1689
01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:20.570
<v Speaker 13>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Can I take a closer look at this?</v>

1690
01:25:20.571 --> 01:25:21.910
<v Speaker 13>Because why is this your,</v>
<v Speaker 13>Oh,</v>

1691
01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:24.620
<v Speaker 13>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 13>I am so sorry.</v>

1692
01:25:24.710 --> 01:25:26.760
<v Speaker 13>So intentional.</v>
<v Speaker 13>I'm so sorry.</v>

1693
01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:30.380
<v Speaker 13>I'm so sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It was just an accident.</v>

1694
01:25:31.650 --> 01:25:32.870
<v Speaker 13>We'll talk to management</v>

1695
01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:38.370
<v Speaker 3>fake or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking hilarious.</v>

1696
01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:40.590
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But watch his hand.</v>

1697
01:25:40.591 --> 01:25:41.424
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now he puts his hand and he seems to </v>

1698
01:25:44.461 --> 01:25:46.740
<v Speaker 4>really push it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

1699
01:25:47.550 --> 01:25:51.210
<v Speaker 4>I am so sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love how he puts the mic in his face,</v>

1700
01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:52.680
<v Speaker 4>like he get his answer.</v>

1701
01:25:52.970 --> 01:25:54.610
<v Speaker 13>So sorry dude,</v>
<v Speaker 13>are you serious?</v>

1702
01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:57.100
<v Speaker 13>I'm so sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It was just an accident.</v>

1703
01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:03.380
<v Speaker 13>We'll talk to management.</v>
<v Speaker 13>I'm tired of guys out of here.</v>

1704
01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:05.631
<v Speaker 1>We'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

1705
01:26:05.631 --> 01:26:10.631
<v Speaker 1>we'll get this taken care of and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly anyway with a smile on my face.</v>

1706
01:26:11.361 --> 01:26:14.930
<v Speaker 1>So I'll send it back to you at an a on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the same guy.</v>

1707
01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Same Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1708
01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:22.250
<v Speaker 1>So one theory that I've worked on is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the first one was real,</v>

1709
01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:25.760
<v Speaker 1>second one was a fake to try to turn it </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a thing.</v>

1710
01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:28.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

1711
01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:29.960
<v Speaker 1>That's his thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1712
01:26:30.170 --> 01:26:34.970
<v Speaker 1>That being said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first one,</v>

1713
01:26:34.971 --> 01:26:35.804
<v Speaker 1>there seemed to be a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 1>humiliation and shame and there was so </v>

1714
01:26:38.931 --> 01:26:41.060
<v Speaker 1>much with all the buildup to yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1715
01:26:41.061 --> 01:26:44.750
<v Speaker 1>And there was tons of people there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just some local news channel.</v>

1716
01:26:44.751 --> 01:26:49.250
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of moving parts.</v>

1717
01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:50.600
<v Speaker 1>It would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you know,</v>

1718
01:26:50.601 --> 01:26:52.390
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big,</v>

1719
01:26:52.391 --> 01:26:56.180
<v Speaker 1>a big effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just for a little gag regardless.</v>

1720
01:26:56.181 --> 01:26:58.240
<v Speaker 1>It is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what you said,</v>

1721
01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:01.880
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the original probably was real.</v>

1722
01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:02.773
<v Speaker 1>And then it just became his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his signature thing to fuck shit up </v>

1723
01:27:06.050 --> 01:27:06.883
<v Speaker 1>cause he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way he handled it the second time </v>

1724
01:27:08.541 --> 01:27:09.374
<v Speaker 1>was very different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although he is a pro at this point of </v>

1725
01:27:11.301 --> 01:27:14.330
<v Speaker 1>ruining things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now I have a bonus,</v>

1726
01:27:14.331 --> 01:27:15.164
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bonus clip for you all and you can </v>

1727
01:27:16.551 --> 01:27:18.650
<v Speaker 1>tell me if you think this one is real or</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake.</v>

1728
01:27:18.651 --> 01:27:19.484
<v Speaker 1>And it's another classic by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just checked and stress warrant </v>

1729
01:27:22.641 --> 01:27:23.840
<v Speaker 1>record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't pay.</v>

1730
01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:26.870
<v Speaker 1>They weren't giving us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't pay.</v>

1731
01:27:27.050 --> 01:27:29.870
<v Speaker 1>What does those nut guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't even cover expenses.</v>

1732
01:27:31.230 --> 01:27:33.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh you have to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1733
01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:36.040
<v Speaker 1>We were trying to get again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person out for something we did.</v>

1734
01:27:36.290 --> 01:27:39.800
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The va number of shirts.</v>

1735
01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:40.873
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vein were to make like the biggest </v>

1736
01:27:43.971 --> 01:27:46.610
<v Speaker 1>vape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh right.</v>

1737
01:27:46.611 --> 01:27:49.040
<v Speaker 1>The thing is you have to pay them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come out.</v>

1738
01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:52.130
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which I guess makes sense.</v>

1739
01:27:52.290 --> 01:27:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Said some of it is people look pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>broke on it.</v>

1740
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:56.143
<v Speaker 1>That's like the nuts to have table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I was with Guinness </v>

1741
01:28:01.221 --> 01:28:02.330
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The the not one.</v>

1742
01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:02.751
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1743
01:28:02.751 --> 01:28:03.584
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1744
01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:06.250
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had the banner behind them.</v>

1745
01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:07.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no there were,</v>

1746
01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:10.850
<v Speaker 1>that was officially sanctioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost paid to be there.</v>

1747
01:28:12.110 --> 01:28:15.680
<v Speaker 1>But that being said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got a really classic,</v>

1758
01:28:52.151 --> 01:28:52.984
<v Speaker 14>blocks.</v>
<v Speaker 14>It took over two weekends to build and </v>

1759
01:28:56.681 --> 01:28:58.810
<v Speaker 14>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I'm really excited because next week,</v>

<v Speaker 14>looking forward to that.</v>

1762
01:29:06.210 --> 01:29:08.330
<v Speaker 14>What?</v>
<v Speaker 14>Hello?</v>

1763
01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:19.060
<v Speaker 14>I'm too much of a scratch off.</v>
<v Speaker 14>I feel like even this holds vague.</v>

1764
01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:22.480
<v Speaker 14>Are you about this?</v>
<v Speaker 14>He thinks,</v>

1767
01:29:27.150 --> 01:29:30.180

<v Speaker 1>I think if it's fake that they built it,</v>

1768
01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:34.790
<v Speaker 1>had the purpose of it though it off and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they wanted to,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1770
01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:41.760

<v Speaker 1>And the</v>

1819
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:01.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1820
01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:06.900
<v Speaker 2>that's 21st December 1st and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>joey sells it and I'm going to ask if he</v>

1821
01:32:07.541 --> 01:32:10.060
<v Speaker 2>wants to crack some nuts with his head </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause that'd be amazing.</v>

01:32:10.990 --> 01:32:13.010
<v Speaker 2>I'll give a shot to one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1823
01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:16.480
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm going to regret that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have,</v>

1824
01:32:16.481 --> 01:32:17.314
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I have the will to </v>
<v Speaker 2>overcome the urge to not slam your head </v>

1825
01:32:21.641 --> 01:32:23.620
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not as hard as you can.</v>

1826
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:25.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think if you,</v>

1827
01:32:25.450 --> 01:32:27.340
<v Speaker 2>if you hesitate at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to hurt way worse.</v>

1828
01:32:27.341 --> 01:32:29.080
<v Speaker 2>It's like breaking a board if you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever done that.</v>

1829
01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:31.090
<v Speaker 2>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you pull your punch at all,</v>

1830
01:32:31.091 --> 01:32:33.230
<v Speaker 2>you break your knuckles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you just go for it,</v>

1831
01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:34.150
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're all good.</v>
