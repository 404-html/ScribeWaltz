<v Speaker 1>by the way?</v>

43
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.740
<v Speaker 1>TheF that fricking mailman's walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>around delivering mail yesterday.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just like decided to work on his own.</v>

51
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it works though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Federal government,</v>

52
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.623
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you just pick up your mail</v>
<v Speaker 1>bag and just start passing out </v>

53
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.240
<v Speaker 1>envelopes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cheryl was a Usbs,</v>

54
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.330
<v Speaker 1>s u s p.</v>

57
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh Isaac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well either way it's like,</v>

58
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>late Labor Day,</v>

59
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 1>everyone who gets labor day off or like </v>
<v Speaker 1>white collar workers,</v>

60
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:02.734
<v Speaker 1>you know the real people that need labor</v>
<v Speaker 1>day off are the ones that are like </v>

61
00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:10.660
<v Speaker 1>slaving away at Amazon and Mcdonald's </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all these shitty jobs.</v>

62
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so funny.</v>

63
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>Labor Day has turned into such as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid day.</v>

64
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.993
<v Speaker 1>Labor Day was originally made to </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrate unions and celebrate like </v>

65
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:19.384
<v Speaker 1>worker rights and shit and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>meanwhile you got the post man and </v>

66
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 1>around envelopes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's enough about Labor Day.</v>

67
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.370
<v Speaker 1>The real takeaway is that diarrhea is </v>
<v Speaker 1>under cooked poop.</v>

68
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.480
<v Speaker 1>That make sense guys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get started.</v>

69
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:38.320
<v Speaker 1>We got a lot to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me Royale is coming to fruition.</v>

70
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 1>Ksi Versus Logan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul.</v>

71
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh that's the fight of the year,</v>

72
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.043
<v Speaker 1>but in the century Nivea in the fight of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the year because we are in the early </v>

73
00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:47.374
<v Speaker 1>stages of organizing what is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>known forever as meme royale 2018 </v>

74
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:55.630
<v Speaker 1>because this my friends is an annual </v>
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>

75
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.280
<v Speaker 1>We've got people that are in so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey Salads,</v>

76
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.443
<v Speaker 1>prank invasion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoon ice there Bradbury's so flow all </v>

77
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:09.220
<v Speaker 1>squaring off hundred thousand dollars of</v>
<v Speaker 1>prizes.</v>

78
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:10.803
<v Speaker 1>I think the big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big fight should be prank invasion </v>

79
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.800
<v Speaker 1>was joey salads and then I think a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>undercard would be shooting ice.</v>

80
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:17.643
<v Speaker 1>Fourth verse Ethan Bradbury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which be the battle of madness because </v>

81
00:04:20.411 --> 00:04:21.244
<v Speaker 1>they're both a little crazy and I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot nice is like over the hill so to </v>

82
00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:25.864
<v Speaker 1>speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he terrifies me and by the way he's </v>

83
00:04:27.551 --> 00:04:28.750
<v Speaker 1>been working on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looks really good.</v>

84
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.820
<v Speaker 1>People are going to place bets like </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

85
00:04:30.821 --> 00:04:31.730
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's loss of it.</v>

86
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm not going to take bets but </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody will,</v>

87
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

88
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:36.724
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there'll be a spread if we so </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys get excited me Maura out 2018 is </v>

89
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:42.064
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see colby person getting his </v>

90
00:04:45.011 --> 00:04:47.720
<v Speaker 1>hands dirty.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I would like to see koby vs like Mo </v>

93
00:04:52.981 --> 00:04:53.814
<v Speaker 1>cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was originally thinking and then they </v>

94
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:58.960
<v Speaker 1>see tv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's a good matchup.</v>

95
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.250
<v Speaker 1>I originally wanted to pit Ethan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bradbury verse Moe Bradbury,</v>

96
00:05:03.251 --> 00:05:06.190
<v Speaker 1>like the the boys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>

97
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.730
<v Speaker 1>I think Ethan would smash him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't contend with the smell,</v>

98
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.570
<v Speaker 1>that pure madness that is behind his </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>

99
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.673
<v Speaker 1>Like you even see in their videos when </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethan's like intimidating Mo and I was </v>

100
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:18.971
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

101
00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:19.804
<v Speaker 1>he would never have a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'd have to pit moe against someone </v>

102
00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:23.080
<v Speaker 1>like Dennis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Super excited about that.</v>

104
00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:28.660
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

108
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.530
<v Speaker 1>altercation with prank invasion.</v>

<v Speaker 1>openly admit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that makes me less of a man that God </v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

166
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:30.583
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be surprised at all if that </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy went to prison for a sexual crime </v>

167
00:08:32.751 --> 00:08:36.590

<v Speaker 1>That's not defamation.</v>

168
00:08:36.591 --> 00:08:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The joke,</v>

169
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:45.140
<v Speaker 1>cause I could see some people start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see some rumors starting to pile</v>

170
00:08:45.141 --> 00:08:48.950
<v Speaker 1>up that Chris went to prison for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual crime.</v>

171
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris went to prison for a sexual crime.</v>

172
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Mila,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a joke.</v>

173
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.310
<v Speaker 1>He didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't be surprised.</v>

174
00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.060
<v Speaker 1>That's all I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think I'm insane?</v>

175
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.073
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's my skill that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would get in a ring with you and fight </v>

176
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:03.930
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's veins were like searching.</v>

178
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:08.683
<v Speaker 1>It's like what did you do to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>imprisoned for the past two years to be </v>

179
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:13.500
<v Speaker 1>that lucky?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sees that as a compliment.</v>

180
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:14.363
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thinks I'm so jackie themselves in </v>

181
00:09:16.051 --> 00:09:18.390
<v Speaker 1>prison for two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well at any rate,</v>

182
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:19.224
<v Speaker 1>Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would definitely like to play you for </v>

183
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:21.894
<v Speaker 1>a quick game for a quick cast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that could be a special </v>

184
00:09:24.091 --> 00:09:24.924
<v Speaker 1>segment at meme royale in 2018 quick </v>
<v Speaker 1>game for a quick kiss bonus edition or </v>

185
00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:33.750

<v Speaker 1>paper,</v>

186
00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:36.570
<v Speaker 1>scissors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine kissing Chris?</v>

187
00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:40.170
<v Speaker 1>His breath is probably so gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you hear his tonsil stones.</v>

188
00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:42.843
<v Speaker 1>I was just worried about the noise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more than anything a host stay in </v>

189
00:09:46.901 --> 00:09:47.734
<v Speaker 1>with people just listening to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think that I'm gonna make that </v>

190
00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:53.980
<v Speaker 1>noise with Emmylou naive.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know how you have these a ringside </v>
<v Speaker 1>models at boxing matches.</v>

193
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.170
<v Speaker 1>If we brought one of these girls to do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>quick game for a quick Kessler then into</v>

194
00:10:02.171 --> 00:10:04.960

<v Speaker 1>You'd scare the hell out of me.</v>

199
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:24.530
<v Speaker 1>Now interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey Salads is on the phone.</v>

200
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Who was gone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>

<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

202
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.800
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to be a really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

205
00:10:37.371 --> 00:10:40.520
<v Speaker 1>It took some finagling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have actually lined them up and I</v>

206
00:10:40.521 --> 00:10:42.980
<v Speaker 1>think this is something that is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

207
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:44.203
<v Speaker 1>At first it was really hard to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had answered in response to this </v>

<v Speaker 1>It goes to the winner.</v>

214
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Winner takes all those guys are going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be out for blood.</v>

215
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:12.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a morale 2018 where were you when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the salads fell?</v>

216

<v Speaker 1>on the line till the winter.</v>

220
00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:29.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying one is better than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

<v Speaker 1>actually hurt each other.</v>

223

<v Speaker 1>Joey Salads sent me this dm and I </v>

226
00:11:47.351 --> 00:11:49.840
<v Speaker 1>cleared it with everybody to get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>permission to show this.</v>

227
00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:53.410

<v Speaker 1>and to having fight.</v>

228
00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:54.244

<v Speaker 1>he went to prison for a sexual crime </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the next couple of months.</v>

270
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:18.950
<v Speaker 4>It just sounds stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fight to the death.</v>

271
00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.410
<v Speaker 4>I told them at least let's do the boxing</v>
<v Speaker 4>match first and then fight today.</v>

272
00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:28.640
<v Speaker 4>Now what do you think now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's your take on preservation?</v>

273
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.180
<v Speaker 4>Joe?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think he's being serious?</v>

274
00:14:31.181 --> 00:14:32.014
<v Speaker 4>What has happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because he's winning from Kissing </v>

275
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.090
<v Speaker 4>Cutie's on the boardwalk to literally </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanting to have a death match.</v>

276
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.130
<v Speaker 4>What has happened in the world of Prank </v>
<v Speaker 4>invasion?</v>

277
00:14:39.131 --> 00:14:40.030
<v Speaker 4>Joey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can you tell us?</v>

278
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.863
<v Speaker 4>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't tell cause I was friends with </v>

279
00:14:43.721 --> 00:14:46.040
<v Speaker 4>him for like a week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like two years ago.</v>

280
00:14:46.041 --> 00:14:48.340
<v Speaker 4>I friends with him for a week and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>seemed kind of normal.</v>

281
00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:52.060
<v Speaker 4>But then he was telling me he uh,</v>

282
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.020
<v Speaker 5>he suffered from low testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we needed a,</v>

283
00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:59.300
<v Speaker 5>the bouncer on an enhancement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think he just started taking those</v>

284
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.670
<v Speaker 5>and that might be making a move this </v>
<v Speaker 5>down mine.</v>

285
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.863
<v Speaker 5>Cause I know some people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they lose their minds when they started </v>

286
00:15:04.581 --> 00:15:07.730
<v Speaker 5>taking my performance enhancing stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

287
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:08.653
<v Speaker 4>so you're dealing with science possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They think he's learned this </v>

288
00:15:11.001 --> 00:15:14.060
<v Speaker 4>testosterone to levels that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>unstable.</v>

289
00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:17.060
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I believe.</v>

290
00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:17.933
<v Speaker 4>That is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now are you going to be able to contend </v>

291
00:15:19.501 --> 00:15:21.810
<v Speaker 4>with that massive overload of male </v>
<v Speaker 4>testosterone?</v>

292
00:15:21.811 --> 00:15:22.644
<v Speaker 4>Joey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you going to have to come around </v>

293
00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:25.610
<v Speaker 4>with your own testosterone and Steroids </v>
<v Speaker 4>Brown?</v>

294
00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:26.573
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

295
00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.000
<v Speaker 5>I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got my own necessity.</v>

296
00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:30.990
<v Speaker 5>Softer on that should be sufficient.</v>

297
00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.250
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had told me an anecdote about how he</v>

298
00:15:34.251 --> 00:15:35.084
<v Speaker 4>has a secret technique that he did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He beat up a bunch of dudes on camera </v>

299
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.760
<v Speaker 4>reset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't want to show you the video.</v>

300
00:15:40.761 --> 00:15:43.370
<v Speaker 4>Do you have my information on that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you could stop washing dishes,</v>

301
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:48.970
<v Speaker 4>that would be good for the show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You kept me on the live in 30 minutes.</v>

302
00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.990
<v Speaker 4>I started cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now I gotta clean my daily.</v>

<v Speaker 4>As much as I'd love to hear more.</v>

317
00:16:22.741 --> 00:16:24.540
<v Speaker 4>I did ask,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's enough of that.</v>

318
00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:27.060
<v Speaker 4>I've heard enough of your meal tech </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

319
00:16:27.061 --> 00:16:29.460
<v Speaker 4>Tell me about this video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That creek invasion.</v>

320
00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:30.533
<v Speaker 4>He says there's a secret video of him </v>
<v Speaker 4>beating up several people by himself </v>

321
00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:35.821
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joey,</v>

322
00:16:35.821 --> 00:16:36.960
<v Speaker 4>tell me about this video.</v>

323
00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.093
<v Speaker 5>I would give him $1,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>cash if you would send it to me cause I </v>

324
00:16:41.711 --> 00:16:42.544
<v Speaker 5>don't think it exists</v>

325
00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.590
<v Speaker 4>cause you had asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>send me the video.</v>

326
00:16:44.591 --> 00:16:45.424
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want you to see my sacred </v>

327
00:16:46.481 --> 00:16:48.280
<v Speaker 4>technique.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said that verbatim,</v>

328
00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:49.293
<v Speaker 4>which made me think that it's kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>kissing prank thing of like my secret </v>

329
00:16:52.451 --> 00:16:53.284
<v Speaker 4>technique.</v>

330
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:55.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it kind of sounded like,</v>

331
00:16:55.941 --> 00:17:00.680
<v Speaker 5>I think maybe what he did was he tried </v>
<v Speaker 5>to get into a fight with someone and try</v>

332
00:17:00.681 --> 00:17:02.360
<v Speaker 5>and kissing them and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then just ran away.</v>

333
00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.940
<v Speaker 4>Very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Third technique to do.</v>

334
00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:08.853
<v Speaker 4>Is there any other closing words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any words that you have for Prank </v>

335
00:17:11.441 --> 00:17:12.274
<v Speaker 4>invasion?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anthony would like to say we'd like to </v>

336
00:17:13.541 --> 00:17:14.374

<v Speaker 4>Any accusations and slander about him </v>

337
00:17:17.261 --> 00:17:21.020
<v Speaker 4>being a sex criminal that's been in </v>
<v Speaker 4>prison for the last one.</v>

338
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.280
<v Speaker 4>Would you like to add before we say </v>
<v Speaker 4>goodbye and let you cook your meal there</v>

339

<v Speaker 5>I'm going to be pissed and you're going </v>

341
00:17:32.721 --> 00:17:36.090
<v Speaker 5>to be a bitch because he's been kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>flaky with this whole thing.</v>

342
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:39.520
<v Speaker 5>Trying to go from boxing to taste,</v>
<v Speaker 5>death,</v>

<v Speaker 5>fighting.</v>

344
00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.120

<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

345
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:46.170
<v Speaker 5>I can't tell if he's trolling or if he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually that weird.</v>

346
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.800
<v Speaker 4>So there's $100,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the line and I got to Chris.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Now just to summarize joey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's thinks he's going to win.</v>

392
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:51.593
<v Speaker 1>I think Joey's going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has accused prank agent of taking </v>

393
00:19:55.350 --> 00:20:00.350
<v Speaker 1>testosterone which has made him kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say a rage filled mania hasn't</v>

394
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:04.253
<v Speaker 1>resulted in and he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has called out prank of Asian and </v>

395
00:20:06.961 --> 00:20:10.650
<v Speaker 1>said if you flake you're a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

396
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.360
<v Speaker 1>and I believe something else.</v>

397
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.633
<v Speaker 1>Something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that he's flagging cause we </v>

398
00:20:15.991 --> 00:20:18.780
<v Speaker 1>tried to do it then know your meme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like right,</v>

399
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he never responded.</v>

400
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:21.953
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what we need to do next is </v>

401
00:20:23.191 --> 00:20:24.024
<v Speaker 1>basically draft a contract between these</v>
<v Speaker 1>two that locks them in a obligates and </v>

402
00:20:28.771 --> 00:20:29.604
<v Speaker 1>basically if he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if brank invasion backs out of the </v>

403
00:20:32.191 --> 00:20:35.430
<v Speaker 1>contract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen is that I'm going</v>

404
00:20:35.431 --> 00:20:36.264
<v Speaker 1>to be in contact with his probation </v>
<v Speaker 1>officer and we're going to make sure </v>

405
00:20:39.151 --> 00:20:39.984
<v Speaker 1>that those sexual crimes he has </v>
<v Speaker 1>committed or not going to be expunged </v>

406
00:20:42.801 --> 00:20:46.590
<v Speaker 1>and are going to remain on the sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>offender website for a long,</v>

407
00:20:46.591 --> 00:20:48.670
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a joke.</v>

408
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.730
<v Speaker 1>But we should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should get a contract with,</v>

409
00:20:51.731 --> 00:20:54.130
<v Speaker 1>they'll go with the guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

410
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.820
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is even with the outbreak </v>
<v Speaker 1>invasion,</v>

411
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:57.663
<v Speaker 1>we still have a great fight because </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoon ice is going to tear someone's </v>

412

<v Speaker 1>head off their body.</v>

00:22:12.691 --> 00:22:13.524
<v Speaker 1>for Ted Cruz to hit a slam dunk.</v>

00:26:11.091 --> 00:26:15.770

<v Speaker 1>likely to be lactose intolerant.</v>

509
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:16.820
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I did do 23 me and I learned a lot about</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

511
00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.473
<v Speaker 1>Sadly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't help fix the things that </v>

512
00:26:21.831 --> 00:26:22.664
<v Speaker 1>you've found wrong with yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is interesting and the case of </v>

513
00:26:24.561 --> 00:26:25.394
<v Speaker 1>lactose intolerance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find that out every morning when I </v>

<v Speaker 1>I am lactose intolerant,</v>

515
00:26:30.801 --> 00:26:33.050
<v Speaker 1>but it is good to have the science to </v>
<v Speaker 1>back it up.</v>

516
00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.110
<v Speaker 1>Now it's easy to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You simply spit in a tube,</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's a guy in the lab,</v>

523
00:26:54.031 --> 00:26:56.250
<v Speaker 1>he just throws in his mouth and squashes</v>
<v Speaker 1>it around.</v>

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

657
00:33:19.321 --> 00:33:23.340
<v Speaker 5>I was a freshman at State University of </v>
<v Speaker 5>New York at Albany,</v>

<v Speaker 5>the cancellation of one of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 5>student events by changing himself to a </v>

661
00:33:31.951 --> 00:33:34.260
<v Speaker 5>fountain in the middle of our campus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>and he didn't eat for,</v>

663
00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:38.483
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was probably at least four or five </v>

664
00:33:39.271 --> 00:33:40.060
<v Speaker 5>days.</v>

665
00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you tell me why?</v>

666
00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.193
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

667
00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:48.880
<v Speaker 5>So the biggest party of the year at that</v>
<v Speaker 5>school is a,</v>

668
00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.890
<v Speaker 5>it was fountain day when they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>turned on the fountain in the spring.</v>

669
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:54.890
<v Speaker 5>Everybody would go in and it's a good </v>
<v Speaker 5>giant pool party.</v>

670
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:57.530
<v Speaker 5>But for Saint Patrick's day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's another,</v>

671
00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.753
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unsanctioned event called the kegs in </v>

672
00:34:00.201 --> 00:34:01.400
<v Speaker 5>eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

673
00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:02.323
<v Speaker 5>which is just basically everybody wakes </v>
<v Speaker 5>up at eight o'clock in the morning and </v>

674
00:34:04.791 --> 00:34:06.440
<v Speaker 5>starts drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

675
00:34:06.441 --> 00:34:10.550
<v Speaker 5>so long story short,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a few police cars were flipped over.</v>

676
00:34:10.551 --> 00:34:12.770
<v Speaker 5>People were on top of cars playing </v>
<v Speaker 5>bagpipes,</v>

677
00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:15.260
<v Speaker 5>real shit show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

678
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:19.150
<v Speaker 5>so they ended up actually canceling the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Fountain Day Event and Shoe Nights,</v>

679
00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.290
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who claim to be a student,</v>

680
00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:24.230
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tandem stuff to the fountain.</v>

681
00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:28.040
<v Speaker 5>And nobody really at that time kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>knew who he was.</v>

682
00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.170
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know if he had the </v>
<v Speaker 5>following.</v>

683
00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:31.610
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm going to be had the following </v>
<v Speaker 5>now,</v>

684
00:34:31.611 --> 00:34:32.444
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

685
00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:34.110
<v Speaker 1>I am slightly confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>

686
00:34:34.111 --> 00:34:37.410
<v Speaker 1>he protesting the event or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancellation of the event,</v>

687
00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.520
<v Speaker 5>the cancellation of the event,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

688
00:34:40.521 --> 00:34:44.060
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he claimed to be a student would shove</v>

689
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.433
<v Speaker 1>with a little bit interesting because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can sell you the most of the </v>

690
00:34:47.211 --> 00:34:48.044
<v Speaker 1>students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you said he changed himself and he </v>

691
00:34:49.941 --> 00:34:53.600
<v Speaker 1>shit himself in a diaper and fasted for </v>
<v Speaker 1>four to five days.</v>

692
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:56.210
<v Speaker 1>What did he achieve a success in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunger strike?</v>

693
00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:01.000
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he was actually forcibly removed</v>

694
00:35:01.001 --> 00:35:01.220
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

695
00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

721
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:13.670
<v Speaker 7>Joe Is the weirdest thing shooting and </v>

<v Speaker 7>not normal.</v>

725
00:36:23.511 --> 00:36:25.520
<v Speaker 7>Vaginal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There is a distinction.</v>

726
00:36:25.521 --> 00:36:30.521
<v Speaker 7>I want you to be aware of being tampon </v>
<v Speaker 7>soaked and hot sauce joe or see a bar of</v>

727
00:36:33.591 --> 00:36:35.960
<v Speaker 7>deodorant.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The choice is yours,</v>

728
00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.093
<v Speaker 7>Joe.</v>

729
00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:39.980
<v Speaker 5>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The weirdest.</v>

730
00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:40.910
<v Speaker 5>That's objective.</v>

731
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:45.020
<v Speaker 7>That is hit and his opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is in his</v>

732
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.983
<v Speaker 8>opinion.</v>

733
00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:50.100
<v Speaker 7>Well you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your job is not to seek truth.</v>

734
00:36:50.101 --> 00:36:51.420
<v Speaker 7>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I remind you,</v>

735
00:36:51.421 --> 00:36:54.330
<v Speaker 7>it is to get into the mind of the shoe </v>
<v Speaker 7>himself.</v>

736
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.720
<v Speaker 7>That what size is that shoe and does </v>
<v Speaker 7>your head fit into it?</v>

737
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:59.760
<v Speaker 7>That's the strip.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We are running out of time.</v>

738
00:36:59.761 --> 00:37:01.140
<v Speaker 7>You have 20 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Joe.</v>

739
00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:07.320
<v Speaker 5>I pumped and Pantheon was blood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm going to say the deodorant.</v>

740
00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:12.230
<v Speaker 7>See the weirdest thing shooting ice has </v>
<v Speaker 7>ever eaten.</v>

741
00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.750
<v Speaker 7>See Deodorant.</v>

742
00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.513
<v Speaker 1>This is really anticlimactic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have the folder open with </v>

743
00:37:20.681 --> 00:37:24.440
<v Speaker 1>that answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just uh,</v>

744
00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:27.190
<v Speaker 1>just everyone chilled back.</v>

745
00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:34.890
<v Speaker 5>I ever ate was probably a tube of k.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why Jelly?</v>

746
00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:39.840
<v Speaker 5>Anal lubricant close first with three </v>
<v Speaker 5>tampons dipped in a hot dog.</v>

747
00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:41.243
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to say I'm somewhat disappointed </v>

748
00:37:45.251 --> 00:37:50.251
<v Speaker 1>that a bar of deodorant sat next to anal</v>
<v Speaker 1>lube and a tampon soaked in hot sauce.</v>

749
00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:54.480
<v Speaker 1>They found the deodorant feed the least </v>
<v Speaker 1>bizarre or the most bizarre,</v>

750
00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:55.323
<v Speaker 1>the three of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that just shows what a decent kind </v>

751
00:37:56.961 --> 00:38:00.220
<v Speaker 1>hearted a man you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I remind you,</v>

752
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:03.340
<v Speaker 1>the objective is to get into the shoe </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

753
00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:08.120
<v Speaker 1>So going forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got more questions.</v>

754
00:38:08.121 --> 00:38:09.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got to get into the shoe,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

1110
00:55:19.771 --> 00:55:23.810

<v Speaker 1>videos all the time on it.</v>

1113
00:55:29.071 --> 00:55:30.510
<v Speaker 1>lot of people and it's just,</v>

00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:32.520
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what really pisses me off about</v>

1115
00:55:32.521 --> 00:55:33.354
<v Speaker 1>it is like before the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feed on everybody's publicity and </v>

1116
00:55:37.561 --> 00:55:40.410
<v Speaker 1>everybody's talking about and before the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight fair use.</v>

1117
00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1118
00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Talk about it all you want after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

1119
00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:48.360
<v Speaker 1>Talk for 22 minutes and don't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking show the footage.</v>

1120
00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:53.260
<v Speaker 1>And we're going to block a worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God there's a case for like a</v>

1121
00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:58.380
<v Speaker 1>class action lawsuit because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>abusive.</v>

1122
00:55:59.270 --> 00:56:00.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean they haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1123
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:03.060
<v Speaker 1>no exploited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no right to remove it.</v>

1124
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:04.920
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I said.</v>

1125
00:56:04.921 --> 00:56:05.754
<v Speaker 1>I said don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said you have absolutely no right to </v>

1126
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:08.543
<v Speaker 1>block.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just how the tools work so they </v>

1127
00:56:10.441 --> 00:56:11.540
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1128
00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:15.090
<v Speaker 1>I think youtube needs to modify the </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems that you dispute it.</v>

1129
00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:16.013
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the videos back up and now if you </v>

1130
00:56:18.481 --> 00:56:21.450
<v Speaker 1>want to strike my video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to put your money where your</v>

1131
00:56:21.451 --> 00:56:24.520
<v Speaker 1>mouth is and make a legal claim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then go right ahead.</v>

1132
00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:27.010
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1133
00:56:27.010 --> 00:56:28.240
<v Speaker 1>It's so frustrating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1134
00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:31.150
<v Speaker 1>And for me it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that big of a deal because it's</v>

1135
00:56:31.151 --> 00:56:33.340
<v Speaker 1>just one highlight of a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

1136
00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:35.170
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it had 300,000</v>

1137
00:56:35.171 --> 00:56:39.730
<v Speaker 1>views and like half a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if that's your main content and they</v>

1138
00:56:39.731 --> 00:56:42.700
<v Speaker 1>can just stomp on you like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just fucked up.</v>

1139
00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:45.430
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Happy about that.</v>

1140
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:46.353
<v Speaker 1>That really pissed me off and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>intentionally just sit it going to sit </v>

1141
00:56:49.001 --> 00:56:52.210
<v Speaker 1>on it for 30 days because they want </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to go buy the paper view.</v>

1142
00:56:53.050 --> 00:56:55.030
<v Speaker 1>That's so stupid and it doesn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>make sense.</v>

1143
00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:57.760
<v Speaker 1>No one is going to watch our highlight </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of that.</v>

1144
00:56:58.210 --> 00:57:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Well there was no capitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1145
00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:03.430
<v Speaker 1>If anything is going to make people want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go watch.</v>

1146
00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole thing.</v>

1147
00:57:05.021 --> 00:57:05.854

<v Speaker 1>You'll receive response within 30 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about three days?</v>

1170
00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:28.713
<v Speaker 1>How about they have 24 hours and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>the video goes back up and they can </v>

1171
00:58:31.151 --> 00:58:34.870
<v Speaker 1>decide in 30 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you on the Dick of abusers?</v>

1172
00:58:34.871 --> 00:58:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Youtube like it's time to do this </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>

1173
00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:41.800
<v Speaker 1>They have been improving though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1174
00:58:41.801 --> 00:58:43.540
<v Speaker 1>I think you had to have been less </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive.</v>

1175
00:58:43.570 --> 00:58:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Like we had this video on anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniella,</v>

1176
00:58:46.330 --> 00:58:47.163
<v Speaker 1>where we react to this lady like dancing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hip hop and it was apparently </v>

1177
00:58:51.491 --> 00:58:53.890
<v Speaker 1>attempted to be removed by Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said no.</v>

1178
00:58:54.070 --> 00:58:56.830
<v Speaker 1>So they'll send you an email saying this</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

1179
00:58:57.490 --> 00:58:58.960
<v Speaker 1>there was an attempt about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we said,</v>

1180
00:58:58.961 --> 00:58:59.794
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually I have to give huge credit to </v>

1181
00:59:01.871 --> 00:59:04.870
<v Speaker 1>that department.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That used to never happen that,</v>

1182
00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:07.900
<v Speaker 1>that's actually happened several times </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we got an email being like,</v>

1183
00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:10.750
<v Speaker 1>and the best part is they say who tried </v>
<v Speaker 1>to take it down.</v>

1184
00:59:11.290 --> 00:59:15.010
<v Speaker 1>It's for some reason when someone tries </v>
<v Speaker 1>to take it down and they rejected,</v>

1185
00:59:15.011 --> 00:59:16.540
<v Speaker 1>I see their email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their phone number,</v>

1186
00:59:16.541 --> 00:59:17.500
<v Speaker 1>their name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the channel.</v>

1187
00:59:17.830 --> 00:59:19.840
<v Speaker 1>I get their social security number </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>

1188
00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>

1189
00:59:21.981 --> 00:59:22.814
<v Speaker 1>this idiot at this address tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>remove your video and we gave him the </v>

1190
00:59:26.511 --> 00:59:29.150
<v Speaker 1>middle finger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But somehow when these assholes do it,</v>

1191
00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:33.740
<v Speaker 1>it's a total fucking shot in the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it's not,</v>

1192
00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:34.693
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I honestly want to blame these guys </v>

1193
00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:39.920
<v Speaker 1>because they know what they're doing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever put this together,</v>

1194
00:59:39.921 --> 00:59:41.590
<v Speaker 1>no day there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tubers,</v>

1195
00:59:41.610 --> 00:59:42.443
<v Speaker 1>Dane know how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're willfully abusing the systems </v>

1196
00:59:45.351 --> 00:59:46.184
<v Speaker 1>that youtube has put in place that </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally work pretty well most of the </v>

1197
00:59:48.891 --> 00:59:51.790
<v Speaker 1>time and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so late.</v>

1198
00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:54.680
<v Speaker 1>Especially Ksi because he does react to </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>

1199
00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:56.930
<v Speaker 1>He relies on other people's content.</v>

1200
00:59:58.260 --> 00:59:58.570
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

1201
00:59:58.570 --> 00:59:59.403
<v Speaker 1>the Paul brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't expect anything from them </v>

1202
01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:02.860
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

1203
01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:03.853
<v Speaker 10>You guys know the law better than most </v>
<v Speaker 10>because of the lawsuit that you went </v>

1204
01:00:06.651 --> 01:00:09.380
<v Speaker 10>through and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 10>The whole 30 day thing,</v>

1205
01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:13.550
<v Speaker 10>is that youtube policy or is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>is that the actual legal law,</v>

1206
01:00:13.551 --> 01:00:15.170
<v Speaker 10>like the DMC a thing?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Oh,</v>

1207
01:00:15.171 --> 01:00:16.004
<v Speaker 10>that's just youtube.</v>

1208
01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1209
01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:17.553
<v Speaker 1>I'm 99% sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just completely unrelated to the </v>

1210
01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:23.313
<v Speaker 1>law week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean youtube put their policies in </v>

1211
01:00:24.431 --> 01:00:25.264
<v Speaker 1>place originally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically they were faced with a huge </v>

1212
01:00:29.051 --> 01:00:34.051
<v Speaker 1>decision when they were in their infancy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people were pirating content all the</v>

1213
01:00:34.961 --> 01:00:35.794
<v Speaker 1>time and putting it on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they had an existential crisis </v>

1214
01:00:38.921 --> 01:00:39.754
<v Speaker 1>where they needed to deal with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue or get sued into oblivion and not </v>

1215
01:00:43.121 --> 01:00:44.410
<v Speaker 1>be a legitimate platform.</v>

1216
01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:48.010
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And so they are very legitimate and they</v>

1217
01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:49.760
<v Speaker 10>do have a pretty good suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm like,</v>

1218
01:00:49.761 --> 01:00:52.330
<v Speaker 10>if you compare it to facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there was no system at all.</v>

1219
01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:54.970
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So Youtube is pretty good.</v>

1220
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:55.833
<v Speaker 10>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's hard to deal with so many people </v>

1221
01:00:58.341 --> 01:01:00.970
<v Speaker 10>and it was always going to be someone </v>
<v Speaker 10>who will abuse it.</v>

1222
01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:02.520
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1223
01:01:02.521 --> 01:01:03.354
<v Speaker 1>this video in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just so frustrating because I </v>

1224
01:01:06.061 --> 01:01:08.940
<v Speaker 1>didn't even show the footage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1225
01:01:08.941 --> 01:01:09.774
<v Speaker 1>We were just talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally explicitly avoided showing </v>

1226
01:01:12.991 --> 01:01:15.000
<v Speaker 1>the footage because I want it to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1227
01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:19.920
<v Speaker 1>And now 30 days and I'm help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do nothing.</v>

1228
01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:25.340
<v Speaker 1>It's just so f up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so whacked,</v>

1253
01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:41.250

<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 1>let's pull up the social blades here for</v>
<v Speaker 1>TV series.</v>

1259
01:02:55.741 --> 01:03:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Now past 30 days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2.1</v>

1261
01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.260
<v Speaker 1>views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1262
01:03:07.070 --> 01:03:09.380
<v Speaker 1>I saw that number and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1263
01:03:09.381 --> 01:03:10.760
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's too many numbers.</v>

1264
01:03:10.761 --> 01:03:14.220
<v Speaker 1>They call us too many digits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1265

<v Speaker 1>million subscribers,</v>

<v Speaker 1>a plus bus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The grade 4.3</v>

1267
01:03:21.351 --> 01:03:24.260
<v Speaker 1>million in the last 30 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their parents would be proud.</v>

1268
01:03:24.261 --> 01:03:26.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compare that with Cutie Pie.</v>

1269
01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>

1270
01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:32.480

<v Speaker 1>So it's a lot.</v>

<v Speaker 1>not a comma and he's under a million.</v>

1274
01:03:41.781 --> 01:03:44.030
<v Speaker 1>So they're on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on subs per month,</v>

1275
01:03:44.031 --> 01:03:49.031
<v Speaker 1>which of course is nothing to scoff at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are on track quickly.</v>

1276
01:03:49.370 --> 01:03:52.430
<v Speaker 1>The past young Felix here and so fun </v>
<v Speaker 1>ended.</v>

<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the hell are they and why are they </v>

<v Speaker 1>getting so many fricking subscribers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>views t series?</v>

1283
01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:16.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer should</v>

1284
01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:17.413
<v Speaker 8>hm</v>

1285
01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:18.633
<v Speaker 1>not surprise you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what these big challenges </v>

1286
01:04:21.041 --> 01:04:22.830
<v Speaker 1>are always so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just an,</v>

1287
01:04:22.850 --> 01:04:27.700
<v Speaker 1>it's like Bollywood Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a bunch of Bollywood Shit.</v>

1288
01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:29.103
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at the population of </v>

1289
01:04:32.681 --> 01:04:35.920
<v Speaker 1>India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These motherfuckers have like 1.4</v>

1290
01:04:35.921 --> 01:04:36.754
<v Speaker 1>billion people in India is there about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the past China as the most populous </v>

1291
01:04:40.601 --> 01:04:41.434
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they are churning out youtube views </v>

1292
01:04:43.181 --> 01:04:48.181
<v Speaker 1>and unprecedented numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was Indian I'd be crushing it,</v>

1293
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:54.400
<v Speaker 1>getting 10 million views a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1294
01:04:54.401 --> 01:04:55.234
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I curated some of their videos to show </v>

1295
01:04:57.041 --> 01:05:00.730
<v Speaker 1>you guys what's going on with t series </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1296
01:05:00.731 --> 01:05:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Let me show you first the channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1297
01:05:02.791 --> 01:05:04.060
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's look at the channel.</v>

1298
01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:06.973
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

1299
01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:11.460
<v Speaker 1>they upload a ungodly amount here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 hours,</v>

1300
01:05:11.461 --> 01:05:12.590
<v Speaker 1>600,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>views,</v>

1301
01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:14.880
<v Speaker 1>nine hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,000.</v>

1302
01:05:14.881 --> 01:05:17.800
<v Speaker 1>So the variance is quite large.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1303
01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:20.710
<v Speaker 1>one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100,000</v>

1304
01:05:20.711 --> 01:05:24.460
<v Speaker 1>views and then you go down a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can see.</v>

1305
01:05:25.890 --> 01:05:30.160
<v Speaker 1>So the views are pretty paltry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then here you see five days ago,</v>

1306
01:05:30.161 --> 01:05:32.170
<v Speaker 1>20 million views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm,</v>

1307
01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:35.260
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm allergic to views.</v>

1308
01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:41.470
<v Speaker 1>And so then you keep going through here </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see this little nuggets like,</v>

1309
01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.690
<v Speaker 1>oh six days ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11 million views.</v>

1310
01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:48.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah know one week ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 million views.</v>

1311
01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:49.013
<v Speaker 1>So these guys are just shitting out so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much bollywood that it's giving my wood </v>

1312
01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:54.573
<v Speaker 1>Bali,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting a Bali hard on right now </v>

1313
01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:59.170
<v Speaker 1>looking at these numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1314
01:05:59.350 --> 01:06:02.590
<v Speaker 1>How is it possible the channel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1315
01:06:03.010 --> 01:06:05.680
<v Speaker 1>cause if it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the views vary so much,</v>

1316
01:06:05.681 --> 01:06:07.150
<v Speaker 1>why do people subscribe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1317
01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:08.233
<v Speaker 1>usually those kind of channels of will </v>
<v Speaker 1>not have subscribers because they just </v>

1318
01:06:11.981 --> 01:06:13.820
<v Speaker 1>kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth is you let,</v>

1319
01:06:13.830 --> 01:06:14.740
<v Speaker 1>and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're right,</v>

1320
01:06:15.110 --> 01:06:17.140
<v Speaker 1>it will be a viral video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mostly not.</v>

1321
01:06:17.170 --> 01:06:18.003
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth is that is correct because if </v>

1322
01:06:20.351 --> 01:06:21.184
<v Speaker 1>you look at the ratio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have over 2 billion views a month </v>

1323
01:06:26.890 --> 01:06:30.460
<v Speaker 1>and they're getting 3 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribers.</v>

1324
01:06:30.461 --> 01:06:34.180
<v Speaker 1>I think puty pies viewed a subscriber </v>
<v Speaker 1>ratio is way higher,</v>

1325
01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:37.450
<v Speaker 1>but he's getting like 20 or 30 less </v>
<v Speaker 1>views per month,</v>

1326
01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:39.393
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's the scope of uses and </v>

1327
01:06:42.181 --> 01:06:43.460
<v Speaker 1>seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like everybody in India,</v>

1362
01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought that was interesting.</v>

1363
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:25.243
<v Speaker 1>We've got more to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was one of their most recent </v>

1364
01:08:28.081 --> 01:08:28.914
<v Speaker 1>uploads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was quite violent if I can say </v>

1365
01:08:31.301 --> 01:08:32.450
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1366
01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:37.480
<v Speaker 1>see this is they're low viewed ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one has 26,000</v>

1367
01:08:37.481 --> 01:08:42.220
<v Speaker 1>views and it was just uploaded today </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually incidentally today,</v>

1368
01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:45.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm only four hours ago actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who knows?</v>

1369
01:08:45.761 --> 01:08:49.450
<v Speaker 1>It could be their next big hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very violent and um,</v>

1370
01:08:51.310 --> 01:08:52.780
<v Speaker 1>quite shocking to be frank.</v>

1371
01:08:58.420 --> 01:08:59.253
<v Speaker 1>Not Noticing Bollywood action movies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that these Bollywood Stars somehow </v>

1372
01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:09.220
<v Speaker 1>always looked like janitors or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is the cause of action star.</v>

1373
01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:15.640
<v Speaker 1>And I guess their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their idea of masculinity is just,</v>

1374
01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:18.610
<v Speaker 1>it's very different from our own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>

1375
01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:20.033
<v Speaker 1>A lot of Kung Fu movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys aren't necessarily like </v>

1376
01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:22.513
<v Speaker 1>handsome leading man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either they look back and this guy </v>

1377
01:09:24.911 --> 01:09:27.100
<v Speaker 1>doesn't look bad at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in my opinion.</v>

1378
01:09:27.101 --> 01:09:30.050
<v Speaker 1>But Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in India he might be king fucking dog.</v>

1379
01:09:33.330 --> 01:09:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't know what's happening.</v>

1380
01:09:36.010 --> 01:09:36.843
<v Speaker 1>So an execution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's really not much preload to this </v>

1381
01:09:41.321 --> 01:09:45.940
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just lots of execution and bullet time.</v>

1382
01:09:46.090 --> 01:09:47.920
<v Speaker 1>And now this janitor is about to kick </v>
<v Speaker 1>ass</v>

1383
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:50.833
<v Speaker 6>Jesus.</v>

1384
01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:54.080
<v Speaker 1>I see what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's gotten like a bad vibe.</v>

1385
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:54.943
<v Speaker 1>I mean he like even if you put them in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gooey and made them look as bad as </v>

1386
01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:02.210
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would still just look like,</v>

1387
01:10:03.890 --> 01:10:05.160
<v Speaker 1>you know the kiosk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy,</v>

1388
01:10:05.190 --> 01:10:08.540
<v Speaker 1>the Kiehl's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he grabbed it as a regular guy.</v>

1389
01:10:08.570 --> 01:10:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Dick slammed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've had the,</v>

1390
01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:14.570
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hat,</v>

1392
01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:17.413

<v Speaker 1>But at that hero and my opinion needs </v>

1393
01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:20.803
<v Speaker 1>like there needs to be something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>back up the fact that he can kill 20 </v>

1394
01:10:24.531 --> 01:10:27.740
<v Speaker 1>guys with his bare hands because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pudgy guy at the kiosk,</v>

1395
01:10:29.150 --> 01:10:32.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm not necessarily believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's got a big heart.</v>

1396
01:10:32.481 --> 01:10:35.720
<v Speaker 1>He's got a big heart and he sliced to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in half and suddenly and a hand right</v>

1397
01:10:35.721 --> 01:10:37.640

1559
01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:54.593
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The literal translation of the word </v>

1560
01:19:55.161 --> 01:19:57.980
<v Speaker 1>Caseta is an innocent enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means little thing.</v>

1561
01:19:58.310 --> 01:20:03.020
<v Speaker 1>The course of this duty is dripping with</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual innuendo and Latin America.</v>

1562
01:20:03.170 --> 01:20:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Dom a Tuco Sita means give me your </v>
<v Speaker 1>reproductive part.</v>

1567
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:23.423
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're saying in Latin America that </v>

1568
01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:27.720
<v Speaker 1>means give me a reproductive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think with like the implication,</v>

1569

<v Speaker 1>featured on the cover of cosmopolitan.</v>

1584
01:21:07.681 --> 01:21:09.900
<v Speaker 1>She's a plus size model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plainly,</v>

1585
01:21:09.901 --> 01:21:14.901
<v Speaker 1>you can see that it's extremely plain to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see [inaudible].</v>

1586
01:21:17.630 --> 01:21:18.463
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1587
01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:24.140
<v Speaker 1>and so this whole thing about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1588
01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:26.540
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to normalize and say </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1589
01:21:26.541 --> 01:21:27.374
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to be and shape or </v>

1590
01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:31.753
<v Speaker 1>supermodel right to be on the cover of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmopolitan or to be an object of </v>

1591
01:21:36.201 --> 01:21:38.390
<v Speaker 1>beauty and admiration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1592
01:21:39.050 --> 01:21:40.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like a healthy at every size kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>

1593
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1594
01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:43.280
<v Speaker 1>and when I saw this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1595
01:21:43.281 --> 01:21:44.114
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to criticize magazines </v>

1596
01:21:46.751 --> 01:21:51.751
<v Speaker 1>for putting anorexic girls on the cover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which promotes an unhealthy lifestyle,</v>

1597
01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:55.393
<v Speaker 1>I don't see that this is any different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you put a morbidly obese person on </v>

1598
01:22:00.261 --> 01:22:05.261
<v Speaker 1>a magazine and glorify it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just as unhealthy as anorexia.</v>

1599
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:07.783
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

1600
01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:08.953
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying she's not beautiful or </v>
<v Speaker 1>that someone would not be attracted to </v>

1601
01:22:12.561 --> 01:22:13.394
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like I don't understand this </v>

1602
01:22:14.961 --> 01:22:15.794
<v Speaker 1>argument of saying somebody is fit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive and work super hard on their </v>

1603
01:22:21.861 --> 01:22:22.970
<v Speaker 1>health and their fitness.</v>

1604
01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:24.013
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have so much respect for people that </v>

1605
01:22:28.190 --> 01:22:29.023
<v Speaker 1>actually maintain their physical body </v>
<v Speaker 1>because rich or poor or wherever you </v>

1606
01:22:33.591 --> 01:22:36.410
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to put in the work.</v>

1607
01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:37.333
<v Speaker 1>There's no shortcuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no work around whoever you are </v>

1608
01:22:41.031 --> 01:22:44.510
<v Speaker 1>from the king to the peasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you want that body,</v>

1609
01:22:44.690 --> 01:22:45.523
<v Speaker 1>it takes raw work and dedication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this does not require that there's </v>

1610
01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:53.870
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing in my mind,</v>

1611
01:22:53.871 --> 01:22:56.330
<v Speaker 1>commendable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing and my,</v>

1612
01:22:56.630 --> 01:22:57.463
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying fuck her because </v>

1613
01:22:58.731 --> 01:23:00.530
<v Speaker 1>she's fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not my point is,</v>

1614
01:23:00.531 --> 01:23:03.860
<v Speaker 1>but that we look at someone who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>physically fit,</v>

1615
01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:04.793
<v Speaker 1>that they have achieved something and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why we admire them and we put </v>

1616
01:23:08.201 --> 01:23:13.201
<v Speaker 1>them on magazines because everybody has </v>
<v Speaker 1>the potential within them to carve their</v>

1617
01:23:14.471 --> 01:23:18.040
<v Speaker 1>body out of marble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

1618
01:23:18.290 --> 01:23:20.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to chisel away through hard work,</v>

1619
01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:23.560
<v Speaker 1>that perfect body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this,</v>

1620
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:25.930
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing admirable.</v>

1621
01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:27.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

1622
01:23:27.911 --> 01:23:29.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>achievement.</v>

1623
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:30.200
<v Speaker 1>There's no</v>

1624
01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:35.200
<v Speaker 10>hard work and sacrifice and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 10>the conversation took a weird turn.</v>

1625
01:23:36.381 --> 01:23:37.790
<v Speaker 10>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 10>instead of saying you don't,</v>

1626
01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:41.720
<v Speaker 10>you can feel eh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>confident,</v>

1627
01:23:41.721 --> 01:23:42.470
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you can,</v>

1628
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:44.780
<v Speaker 10>you don't have to feel horrible about </v>
<v Speaker 10>yourself.</v>

1629
01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:47.180
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And be apply size,</v>

1630
01:23:47.210 --> 01:23:52.010
<v Speaker 10>but you don't need to glorify it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I find it bizarre.</v>

1631
01:23:52.090 --> 01:23:57.090
<v Speaker 1>I find it frankly bizarre to glorify.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1632
01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:02.560
<v Speaker 1>a more morbid illness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1633
01:24:02.561 --> 01:24:04.660
<v Speaker 1>we sat here and talked with Boogie who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was morbidly obese.</v>

1634
01:24:05.090 --> 01:24:05.923
<v Speaker 1>I mean the guy is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing good about being </v>

1635
01:24:09.311 --> 01:24:10.144
<v Speaker 1>morbidly obese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you feel good and happy with </v>

1636
01:24:12.821 --> 01:24:14.500
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God bless.</v>

1637
01:24:14.501 --> 01:24:18.070
<v Speaker 1>But like these are the same people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're saying,</v>

1638
01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:21.430
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these anorexic models are not realistic.</v>

1639
01:24:21.670 --> 01:24:23.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not realistic.</v>

1640
01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:25.780
<v Speaker 1>They're models.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a lot of hard work.</v>

1641
01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:26.793
<v Speaker 1>The look that good physically to get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>six pack and have a fucking crazy ass </v>

1642
01:24:33.071 --> 01:24:35.740
<v Speaker 1>and thighs and be like fit beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1643
01:24:35.741 --> 01:24:37.480
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1644
01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:40.990
<v Speaker 1>It's not realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to do that.</v>

1645
01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:42.413
<v Speaker 12>Hmm.</v>

1646
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:44.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1647
01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:48.720
<v Speaker 1>I think this is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's weird.</v>

1648
01:24:49.290 --> 01:24:51.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

1649
01:24:51.031 --> 01:24:51.864
<v Speaker 1>also I just want to point out to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people always talk about like photoshop </v>

1650
01:24:54.751 --> 01:24:55.650
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1651
01:24:55.651 --> 01:24:57.240
<v Speaker 1>that's not realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's photoshop.</v>

1652
01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:58.433
<v Speaker 1>She is photoshops all the way those </v>
<v Speaker 1>thighs and her chest and her arms and </v>

1653
01:25:05.011 --> 01:25:08.280
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her face is so photoshop.</v>

1654
01:25:08.281 --> 01:25:13.281
<v Speaker 1>Then I have to tell you my hunch is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that unedited video,</v>

1655
01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:15.420
<v Speaker 1>that unedited photo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would look at it and be like,</v>

1656
01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:20.610
<v Speaker 1>that lady's sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Disgusting.</v>

1657
01:25:20.611 --> 01:25:24.060
<v Speaker 1>But I mean like you see what Morbid </v>
<v Speaker 1>obesity looks like.</v>

1658
01:25:24.210 --> 01:25:25.043
<v Speaker 1>They've paint brushed it and brushed it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and made it look beautiful and </v>

1659
01:25:27.361 --> 01:25:31.890
<v Speaker 1>attractive and hey she's got soft skin </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she looks good and she's got tattoos</v>

1660
01:25:31.891 --> 01:25:34.290
<v Speaker 1>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has a little miss piggy on her form.</v>

1661
01:25:34.291 --> 01:25:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Incidentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say that.</v>

1662
01:25:37.141 --> 01:25:37.974
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's right there Mr [inaudible].</v>

1663
01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:38.933
<v Speaker 10>It's on her forearm.</v>
<v Speaker 10>The treatment of the photo is the same </v>

1664
01:25:41.641 --> 01:25:44.370
<v Speaker 10>as the ones they're criticizing anyone </v>
<v Speaker 10>cause she's still got makeup.</v>

1665
01:25:44.371 --> 01:25:47.010
<v Speaker 10>She's exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it was photoshop.</v>

1666
01:25:47.011 --> 01:25:50.730
<v Speaker 10>You can see exactly the shading and </v>
<v Speaker 10>everything is on.</v>

1667
01:25:51.670 --> 01:25:53.130
<v Speaker 10>It must have been touched,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1668
01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:54.053
<v Speaker 10>in Photoshop.</v>

1669
01:25:54.250 --> 01:25:57.790
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've met a lot of morbidly obese people.</v>

1670
01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:00.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fat guy and obviously to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

1671
01:26:00.430 --> 01:26:02.980
<v Speaker 1>But boogie was saying like think </v>
<v Speaker 1>morbidly obese.</v>

1672
01:26:04.290 --> 01:26:05.123
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is like an illness as I understand </v>

1673
01:26:06.711 --> 01:26:07.544
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like there's nothing happy about </v>

1674
01:26:10.401 --> 01:26:12.140
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] I dunno.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>

1677
01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:16.933
<v Speaker 1>I think as dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we as a society need to stop </v>

1678
01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:21.373
<v Speaker 1>being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I just don't know what's the </v>

1679
01:26:23.601 --> 01:26:24.434
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like I wear over the point where </v>

1680
01:26:28.191 --> 01:26:29.024
<v Speaker 1>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fat and shame on you and </v>

1681
01:26:32.150 --> 01:26:32.983
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like to put someone up who's sick </v>

1682
01:26:35.241 --> 01:26:37.940
<v Speaker 1>and say look there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to glorify it in the same way,</v>

1683
01:26:37.970 --> 01:26:40.220
<v Speaker 1>it just seems hypocritical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1684
01:26:42.170 --> 01:26:45.830
<v Speaker 1>This was a tough one to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their hailing her as a brave.</v>

1685
01:26:45.831 --> 01:26:47.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's brave about,</v>

1686
01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:48.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating ice cream?</v>

1687
01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:55.130
<v Speaker 1>Did I go too far?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1688
01:26:58.190 --> 01:26:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Can I get one of these?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1689
01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:06.350
<v Speaker 1>was waiting for a joke?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1690
01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:07.393
<v Speaker 1>I said nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what does bother me though is </v>

1691
01:27:11.721 --> 01:27:13.730
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get our shit straight.</v>

1692
01:27:13.731 --> 01:27:17.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we've got this shit on,</v>

1693
01:27:17.091 --> 01:27:20.540
<v Speaker 1>but the re I think the real damaging </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that's going in magazines right now</v>

1694
01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:23.420
<v Speaker 1>is these Kim Kardashians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1695
01:27:23.810 --> 01:27:28.160
<v Speaker 1>With fake asses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perform through dangerous procedures.</v>

1696
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:32.660
<v Speaker 1>See that is unobtainable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you've got these glow,</v>

1697
01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:37.720
<v Speaker 1>these poor girls who are working their </v>
<v Speaker 1>ass off to try to obtain an ass like Kim</v>

1698
01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:40.550
<v Speaker 1>Kardashians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is actually literally impossible.</v>

1699
01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Now that is an unrealistic goal to set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean here,</v>

1700
01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:46.280
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me show you these Kim Kardashians.</v>

1701
01:27:46.281 --> 01:27:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Before and after these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

1702
01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:50.570
<v Speaker 1>these Kardashians are fucking twisted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1704
01:27:56.571 --> 01:27:57.404
<v Speaker 1>they used to be and it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I feel like it's so damaging for </v>

1705
01:28:00.890 --> 01:28:05.300
<v Speaker 1>actually for young women who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparing themselves.</v>

1706
01:28:05.301 --> 01:28:07.490
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>she did not need surgery,</v>

1726
01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:24.030
<v Speaker 1>but obsessed with these images of Kim </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kardashians.</v>

1727
01:29:24.031 --> 01:29:27.750
<v Speaker 1>All these woman with fake acid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the strangest phenomenon</v>

1728
01:29:27.751 --> 01:29:31.260
<v Speaker 1>is I would say maybe that's what Indian </v>
<v Speaker 1>people think is weird about white people</v>

1729
01:29:31.290 --> 01:29:32.610
<v Speaker 1>and we'll get an ass surgeries.</v>

<v Speaker 10>everyone's doing it now.</v>

1731
01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So [inaudible] um,</v>

1732
01:29:38.410 --> 01:29:40.500
<v Speaker 1>and it's not only white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but get a load of this.</v>

1733
01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:42.930
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leah Cambridge,</v>

1734
01:29:42.931 --> 01:29:43.764
<v Speaker 1>a 29 year old beautician from Leeds in </v>
<v Speaker 1>England is said to have died this week </v>

1735
01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:52.260
<v Speaker 1>after she underwent the increasingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>popular cosmetic surgery at a clinic.</v>

1736
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:54.690
<v Speaker 1>Was it in Turkey or somewhere?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1737
01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:56.700
<v Speaker 1>the guy was apparently a world renowned </v>
<v Speaker 1>surgeon.</v>

1738
01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:02.240
<v Speaker 1>And what they do is they take the fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>from your other parts of your body.</v>

1739
01:30:04.351 --> 01:30:06.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they inject it into your ass.</v>

1740
01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:07.553
<v Speaker 1>But the catch is that it's actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely dangerous because what </v>

1741
01:30:09.661 --> 01:30:10.494
<v Speaker 1>happened in this case is that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>injected the fat into one of her main </v>

1742
01:30:13.471 --> 01:30:14.304
<v Speaker 1>arteries that went through her ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it went to our heart and our brain </v>

1743
01:30:16.621 --> 01:30:18.090
<v Speaker 1>and she had a fucking stroke.</v>

1744
01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:19.413
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

1745
01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how about that for ridiculous,</v>

1746
01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:23.920
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1747
01:30:23.950 --> 01:30:24.783
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like we should be talking about </v>

1748
01:30:26.411 --> 01:30:29.290
<v Speaker 1>this mental illness that's in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

1749
01:30:29.530 --> 01:30:31.540
<v Speaker 1>People are putting fat in their ass.</v>

1750
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:33.730
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1751
01:30:33.730 --> 01:30:35.060
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>crazy shit.</v>

1752
01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:36.290
<v Speaker 10>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

1753
01:30:36.291 --> 01:30:41.291
<v Speaker 10>Even Cardi B has a story about how she </v>
<v Speaker 10>did and in like a surgery at any illegal</v>

1754
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:46.730
<v Speaker 10>place just in some lady's basement.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

1755
01:30:46.731 --> 01:30:47.564
<v Speaker 10>that's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 10>people can't afford to go to probably </v>

1756
01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:51.500
<v Speaker 10>the legitimate places,</v>

1757
01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:55.690
<v Speaker 1>the procedure costs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1758
01:30:56.710 --> 01:30:57.480
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

1759
01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:58.540
<v Speaker 1>she definitely want cheap.</v>

1760
01:30:58.970 --> 01:30:59.803
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

1761
01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:03.670
<v Speaker 1>The procedure costs 6,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds to 10,000</v>

1762
01:31:03.671 --> 01:31:06.610
<v Speaker 1>pounds in the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the Turkey it costs 3000 pounds.</v>

1763
01:31:06.611 --> 01:31:06.991
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

1764
01:31:06.991 --> 01:31:10.600
<v Speaker 1>I was probably expensive and Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

1765
01:31:10.601 --> 01:31:12.220
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1766
01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:15.040
<v Speaker 1>that's so tragic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Jesus Christ.</v>

1767
01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:18.070
<v Speaker 1>I think we need to be talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1768
01:31:18.810 --> 01:31:19.643
<v Speaker 10>I think guys who talk more to their </v>
<v Speaker 10>girlfriends and tell them they really </v>

1769
01:31:22.951 --> 01:31:23.784
<v Speaker 10>don't need to do it well,</v>
<v Speaker 10>because I feel like it becomes like a </v>

1770
01:31:26.401 --> 01:31:27.234
<v Speaker 10>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But when women and they start to feel </v>

1771
01:31:29.371 --> 01:31:30.204
<v Speaker 10>insecure next to that,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the article said the guy told her she </v>

1772
01:31:32.251 --> 01:31:32.930
<v Speaker 10>didn't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Like,</v>

1773
01:31:32.930 --> 01:31:34.740
<v Speaker 10>well what could he do?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

1774
01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:35.713
<v Speaker 10>I don't know.</v>

1775
01:31:37.190 --> 01:31:39.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so bad I think.</v>

1776
01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:44.420

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1780
01:31:56.730 --> 01:31:57.563

<v Speaker 1>injecting fat in their ass and then </v>

1781
01:32:00.851 --> 01:32:02.950

1785
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:12.980
<v Speaker 1>It's really easy to feel insecure when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you see all those acids.</v>

<v Speaker 1>all the instagram models these days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>pretty insecure and a lot of people are </v>

1806
01:33:21.230 --> 01:33:23.810
<v Speaker 1>and it's the same in Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's why I'm saying it's not,</v>

1807
01:33:24.650 --> 01:33:25.483
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's only here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was a whole discussion about </v>

1808
01:33:29.971 --> 01:33:30.804
<v Speaker 1>body issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I hope that there was something </v>

1815
01:33:49.981 --> 01:33:53.430
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just becomes like a,</v>

1816
01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:55.590
<v Speaker 1>almost like a carrie could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean to me it looks really bad.</v>

1819
01:34:01.930 --> 01:34:02.763
<v Speaker 1>How did she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she shits it must be like a long </v>

1820
01:34:04.211 --> 01:34:05.044
<v Speaker 1>way to the toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was that got a lot of space between </v>

1821
01:34:07.721 --> 01:34:08.554
<v Speaker 1>the ass you cause it's so big she must </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to like either she's spreads open </v>

1822
01:34:13.001 --> 01:34:13.834
<v Speaker 1>the ass cheeks super wide or she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting shit streaks on the inside of </v>

1823
01:34:17.081 --> 01:34:20.660
<v Speaker 1>her cheek and did not think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>

1824
01:34:21.650 --> 01:34:25.040
<v Speaker 1>Also these days you have to have like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>10 inch Dick just to get inside of her.</v>

1825
01:34:25.970 --> 01:34:29.450
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't you love to discuss with her </v>
<v Speaker 1>her wiping?</v>

1826
01:34:30.410 --> 01:34:33.140
<v Speaker 1>You've got Kim condition on the line?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1827
01:34:34.010 --> 01:34:35.570

<v Speaker 1>Like the barrier for entry is like eight</v>

1831
01:34:44.001 --> 01:34:44.834
<v Speaker 1>matrix plus it works like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the fat goes like sideways and </v>

<v Speaker 1>And like maybe two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of years,</v>

1857
01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:05.250
<v Speaker 1>and then the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I got to say?</v>

1858
01:36:05.251 --> 01:36:06.084
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people were upset that he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>the balls to come back and that he </v>

1859
01:36:08.851 --> 01:36:11.790
<v Speaker 1>hadn't been punished and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1860
01:36:12.030 --> 01:36:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Louis C K,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not my angle.</v>

1861
01:36:16.230 --> 01:36:18.090
<v Speaker 1>I think he came back too soon.</v>

1862
01:36:18.570 --> 01:36:22.050
<v Speaker 1>What I what I'm disappointed in as him </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a comedian,</v>

1863
01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:27.250
<v Speaker 1>you can't just come back on stage and do</v>
<v Speaker 1>material like a,</v>

1864
01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:30.330
<v Speaker 1>nothing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't even address it.</v>

1865
01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Like I did hear the material was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1866
01:36:34.410 --> 01:36:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he is very funny.</v>

1867
01:36:36.230 --> 01:36:37.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>

1868
01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:39.630
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had the moment.</v>

1869
01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:42.420
<v Speaker 1>The moment had to be perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1870
01:36:42.510 --> 01:36:43.343
<v Speaker 1>He had to come out after a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and when people almost forgot it </v>

1871
01:36:46.470 --> 01:36:48.000
<v Speaker 1>and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how about them dog years?</v>

1872
01:36:48.001 --> 01:36:48.601
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or whatever.</v>

1873
01:36:48.601 --> 01:36:52.110
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was way too soon.</v>

1874
01:36:52.290 --> 01:36:56.140
<v Speaker 1>Just people need enough time to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1875
01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:58.830
<v Speaker 1>it was too thin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just the news.</v>

1876
01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:01.950
<v Speaker 1>But then someone had a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it?</v>

1877
01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:03.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember who brought it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it Dan?</v>

1878
01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:05.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can someone take shredder out?</v>

1879
01:37:07.220 --> 01:37:10.980
<v Speaker 1>He's got your hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Treader it's his birthday and all.</v>

<v Speaker 1>flaming neon.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We said it was shredded birthday at the </v>

1882
01:37:15.721 --> 01:37:16.290
<v Speaker 1>top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1883
01:37:16.290 --> 01:37:17.123
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to cook them a Philemon </v>

1884
01:37:17.950 --> 01:37:21.770

<v Speaker 1>I'm most excited for me to eat a flaming</v>

1885
01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:23.220
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1886
01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:28.930
<v Speaker 10>I just think,</v>
<v Speaker 10>oh,</v>

1887
01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:30.940
<v Speaker 10>I forget who said this,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but they're like,</v>

1888
01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:34.660
<v Speaker 10>he's probably so depressed and </v>
<v Speaker 10>borderline,</v>

1889
01:37:34.661 --> 01:37:37.600
<v Speaker 10>even suicidal.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I don't know if that's true or not,</v>

1890
01:37:37.690 --> 01:37:38.800
<v Speaker 10>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>yeah,</v>

1891
01:37:38.810 --> 01:37:40.840
<v Speaker 10>that,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that was me saying that and yeah.</v>

1892
01:37:40.841 --> 01:37:41.674
<v Speaker 10>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it makes me wonder a lot of these </v>

1893
01:37:43.181 --> 01:37:45.430
<v Speaker 10>comedians that you guys have even talked</v>
<v Speaker 10>to you on the show.</v>

1894
01:37:45.431 --> 01:37:48.010
<v Speaker 10>Just talk about how like therapeutic </v>
<v Speaker 10>even for you,</v>

1895
01:37:48.011 --> 01:37:48.611
<v Speaker 10>Ethan,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1896
01:37:48.611 --> 01:37:51.490
<v Speaker 10>when you come and do the podcast and </v>
<v Speaker 10>everything and you know,</v>

1897
01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:52.480
<v Speaker 10>Louie,</v>
<v Speaker 10>his life,</v>

1898
01:37:52.481 --> 01:37:55.030
<v Speaker 10>his stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So yeah.</v>

1899
01:37:55.110 --> 01:37:56.270
<v Speaker 10>Makes me wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's like I,</v>

1900
01:37:56.271 --> 01:37:58.950
<v Speaker 10>I agree that I think it's way too soon </v>
<v Speaker 10>for him to come back,</v>

1901
01:37:58.951 --> 01:38:03.060
<v Speaker 10>but I almost wonder if he was just </v>
<v Speaker 10>sitting at home alone and like,</v>

1902
01:38:03.150 --> 01:38:05.520
<v Speaker 10>I gotta get out there and do this,</v>
<v Speaker 10>or I don't know what I'm going to do,</v>

1903
01:38:05.650 --> 01:38:06.483
<v Speaker 10>you know?</v>

1904
01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1905
01:38:09.151 --> 01:38:09.984
<v Speaker 1>His situation is a tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just mostly weird to just not </v>

1906
01:38:13.501 --> 01:38:15.090
<v Speaker 1>even acknowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1907
01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:15.953
<v Speaker 1>that's what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm disappointed because I </v>

1908
01:38:18.451 --> 01:38:19.284
<v Speaker 1>don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was so much pressure on that </v>

1909
01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:21.990
<v Speaker 1>opening line of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

1910
01:38:21.991 --> 01:38:22.824
<v Speaker 1>Louise back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like he should have waited until </v>

1911
01:38:25.231 --> 01:38:28.140
<v Speaker 1>everyone almost forgot it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even that me too was a thing like it was</v>

1912
01:38:28.141 --> 01:38:29.970
<v Speaker 1>settled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1913
01:38:29.971 --> 01:38:30.804
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you too.</v>

1914
01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:32.773
<v Speaker 1>You too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then wait another year and then </v>

1915
01:38:37.201 --> 01:38:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Louie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his opening line would be something like</v>

1916
01:38:39.221 --> 01:38:40.054
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1917
01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:40.880
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

1918
01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Anyone want to see my deck right close </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the north.</v>

1919
01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Anyone in here want to see me </v>
<v Speaker 1>masturbate.</v>

1920
01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You own it to Saint Louis.</v>

1921
01:38:57.020 --> 01:38:58.400
<v Speaker 1>That would have been a great opening </v>
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

1922
01:38:58.401 --> 01:39:00.440
<v Speaker 1>What did not have got out there and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>whipped it out.</v>

1923
01:39:00.620 --> 01:39:01.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't even,</v>

1924
01:39:02.570 --> 01:39:03.403
<v Speaker 1>he goes like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lock the doors and then he takes his </v>

1925
01:39:05.091 --> 01:39:08.570
<v Speaker 1>dick out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would have killed.</v>

1926
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:11.900
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my 2 cents on that.</v>

1927
01:39:12.110 --> 01:39:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the correct opinion zone.</v>

1928
01:39:14.150 --> 01:39:16.340
<v Speaker 1>You wash these Tuesday episodes for my </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion,</v>

1929
01:39:16.370 --> 01:39:18.200
<v Speaker 1>which are correct and relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every top,</v>

<v Speaker 1>keep watching.</v>

1931
01:39:20.151 --> 01:39:22.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to lose you as a viewer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just know that you are wrong.</v>

1932
01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:24.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1933
01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:32.280
<v Speaker 1>the celeb hacker who hacked a Jennifer </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lawrence and all the celebrities who got</v>

1934
01:39:33.071 --> 01:39:34.720
<v Speaker 1>all their nudies leaked out into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

1935
01:39:35.890 --> 01:39:40.360
<v Speaker 1>the fat burning as it were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has pleaded guilty.</v>

1936
01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:41.253
<v Speaker 1>Admitting that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's what shocked me about this </v>

1937
01:39:43.631 --> 01:39:44.464
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sent emails to the victims while </v>

1938
01:39:46.331 --> 01:39:47.164
<v Speaker 1>posing as members of onlines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apple's online security personnel in </v>

1939
01:39:50.441 --> 01:39:52.540
<v Speaker 1>order to obtain their username and </v>
<v Speaker 1>passwords.</v>

1940
01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:53.733
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this amazing hacker that got all these </v>

1941
01:39:55.721 --> 01:39:58.330
<v Speaker 1>nudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just doing a phishing scam.</v>

1942
01:39:59.080 --> 01:39:59.913
<v Speaker 1>It's all it takes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought this was some like slick </v>

1943
01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:03.610
<v Speaker 1>underground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy hacker.</v>

1944
01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:04.493
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just a guy who sent the email to </v>

1945
01:40:06.371 --> 01:40:07.660
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer Lawrence and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1946
01:40:07.661 --> 01:40:08.494
<v Speaker 1>please log into your apple account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost feel like that is what happen </v>

1947
01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:17.950
<v Speaker 1>is like 90% of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1948
01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:21.250
<v Speaker 1>Like how often did they actually have </v>
<v Speaker 1>your password?</v>

1949
01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh I thought it was some crazy thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he,</v>

1950
01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:28.620
<v Speaker 1>he had like dozens of of celebrity nudes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

1951
01:40:31.580 --> 01:40:33.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just a fricking phishing scam.</v>

1952
01:40:33.781 --> 01:40:35.430
<v Speaker 1>So there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get inspired you guys.</v>

1953
01:40:35.970 --> 01:40:36.803
<v Speaker 1>I think this is an inspiring twist on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this story to everyone out there who's </v>

1954
01:40:38.941 --> 01:40:41.220
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see Jennifer Lawrence nude.</v>

1955
01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:42.220
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll know,</v>

1956
01:40:42.290 --> 01:40:44.730
<v Speaker 1>you know I'm saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that specifically,</v>

1957
01:40:44.731 --> 01:40:49.410
<v Speaker 1>but like anything is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you will go to jail.</v>

1958
01:40:49.470 --> 01:40:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will go to jail.</v>

1959
01:40:50.461 --> 01:40:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Obviously there's consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the more,</v>

1960
01:40:52.630 --> 01:40:53.463
<v Speaker 1>the moral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story is not to steal people's </v>

1961
01:40:54.281 --> 01:40:56.680
<v Speaker 1>nudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that anything is possible.</v>

1962
01:40:56.950 --> 01:41:00.670
<v Speaker 1>Did you think that you could see </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer Lawrence nude by simply sending</v>

1963
01:41:00.671 --> 01:41:03.730
<v Speaker 1>her a login credentials and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Can you log in now?</v>

1965
01:41:05.951 --> 01:41:10.951
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just saying get inspired because</v>

1966
01:41:11.021 --> 01:41:16.021
<v Speaker 1>this guy had a simple idea that he took </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way to prison and I'm saying it,</v>

1967
01:41:16.531 --> 01:41:19.750
<v Speaker 1>it's inspiring in a weird twist away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should never had done that.</v>

1968
01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Shame on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1969
01:41:21.490 --> 01:41:23.440
<v Speaker 1>privacy matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1970
01:41:23.850 --> 01:41:24.683
<v Speaker 1>they should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should have never come out and I </v>

1971
01:41:25.811 --> 01:41:28.510
<v Speaker 1>should have never looked at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that being said,</v>

1972
01:41:30.190 --> 01:41:31.023
<v Speaker 1>get inspired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you look into getting </v>

1973
01:41:33.131 --> 01:41:33.964
<v Speaker 1>inspired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should subscribe to tc or is </v>

1974
01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:41.050
<v Speaker 1>plugging into theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need all the help.</v>

1975
01:41:41.051 --> 01:41:43.280
<v Speaker 1>They can get bumped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

1976
01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:46.823
<v Speaker 1>I'm not enough subscribers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel awful for those slip that that </v>

1977
01:41:49.961 --> 01:41:50.794
<v Speaker 1>was a huge violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to make clear that I was a huge </v>

1978
01:41:52.631 --> 01:41:55.690
<v Speaker 1>violation and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1979
01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:59.050
<v Speaker 1>a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real wacky shame,</v>

1980
01:41:59.051 --> 01:42:00.120
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Hey,</v>

1981
01:42:00.850 --> 01:42:02.170
<v Speaker 1>there's something inspiring there </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

1982
01:42:02.171 --> 01:42:03.520
<v Speaker 1>You have to admit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>

1983
01:42:04.150 --> 01:42:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Just a little piece of shit that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to,</v>

1984
01:42:07.551 --> 01:42:08.800
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what he did?</v>

1985
01:42:08.801 --> 01:42:13.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pursuit of happiness with will smith</v>

1986
01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:16.600
<v Speaker 1>where he had like the Rubik's cube and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that got him the job.</v>

1987
01:42:17.410 --> 01:42:18.243
<v Speaker 1>It's like the simple plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get you all the way and that's what's </v>

1988
01:42:22.361 --> 01:42:26.680
<v Speaker 1>inspiring and went on and to follow </v>
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>

1989
01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:28.413
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's move on.</v>

1994
01:42:36.571 --> 01:42:37.404

<v Speaker 1>I wonder if we should move some of this </v>

1995
01:42:38.261 --> 01:42:40.090
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could skip.</v>

1996
01:42:40.270 --> 01:42:42.670
<v Speaker 1>We've got Ariana groped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got,</v>

1997
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:43.623

2008
01:43:24.341 --> 01:43:27.100
<v Speaker 1>It reminds me of this clip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We watched him w Lou Walsh grabbing that</v>

2009
01:43:27.101 --> 01:43:27.934
<v Speaker 1>girl's ass on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they have a secret society </v>

2010
01:43:30.701 --> 01:43:33.300
<v Speaker 1>where they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2012
01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:36.370
<v Speaker 1>they like push the boundary with each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

2013
01:43:36.490 --> 01:43:41.110
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to grow up a famous person and</v>

2014
01:43:41.111 --> 01:43:41.944
<v Speaker 1>what are they going to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even about the famous person </v>

2015
01:43:45.611 --> 01:43:47.110
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not there anymore because it's,</v>

2016
01:43:47.111 --> 01:43:48.670
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a sick mind.</v>

2017
01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're daring each other to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get away with the</v>

2018
01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:53.353
<v Speaker 8>stunt.</v>

2019

2020
01:43:55.270 --> 01:43:57.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't look at it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's,</v>

2021
01:43:58.430 --> 01:44:00.650
<v Speaker 1>it's just like what is going on in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>head?</v>

2022
01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:02.270
<v Speaker 1>So here it is anyway,</v>

2023
01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:06.373
<v Speaker 13>because</v>

2025
01:44:16.510 --> 01:44:18.880

<v Speaker 10>at Taco Bell.</v>

01:44:29.290 --> 01:44:32.070
<v Speaker 1>the most thing that he's doing with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand is something stolen.</v>

2030
01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Unnatural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enjoy this icon here.</v>

<v Speaker 1>closely.</v>

2033
01:44:42.431 --> 01:44:45.010

<v Speaker 1>I was hugging everyone anyway.</v>

2058
01:45:51.041 --> 01:45:52.720
<v Speaker 1>I apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was basically just that</v>

2059
01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:54.553
<v Speaker 10>said,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it would never be my intention to touch </v>

2061
01:45:58.150 --> 01:46:01.390
<v Speaker 10>I guess I put my arm around her.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Maybe I crossed the border.</v>

2062
01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:03.880
<v Speaker 10>Maybe I was too friendly or familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But again,</v>

2063
01:46:03.881 --> 01:46:05.650
<v Speaker 10>I apologize.</v>

2067
01:46:11.450 --> 01:46:14.690
<v Speaker 13>I apologize because</v>

2068
01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:18.640
<v Speaker 10>I have to brush up.</v>
<v Speaker 10>My 20 year old daughter tells me,</v>

2069
01:46:18.641 --> 01:46:20.320
<v Speaker 10>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you are old and 16</v>

2070
01:46:23.340 --> 01:46:24.173
<v Speaker 14>fan</v>

2071
01:46:25.190 --> 01:46:27.110
<v Speaker 1>girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they give you all your respect?</v>

2072
01:46:30.510 --> 01:46:35.510
<v Speaker 14>I certainly want to apologize to Ariana </v>
<v Speaker 14>and to her fans and to our family and to</v>

2073
01:46:36.450 --> 01:46:37.283
<v Speaker 14>entire community.</v>
<v Speaker 14>If what I say said was taken on the </v>

2074
01:46:40.501 --> 01:46:41.970
<v Speaker 14>wrong way,</v>
<v Speaker 14>and Alyssa,</v>

2075
01:46:42.110 --> 01:46:43.760
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's talking about the Taco bell comment</v>

2076
01:46:44.710 --> 01:46:48.410
<v Speaker 1>to the tick groping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet he's got a lot to answer for.</v>

2077
01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:50.080
<v Speaker 14>Maybe it's just</v>

2078
01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:50.913
<v Speaker 1>a joke that went bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're doing the program for </v>

2079
01:46:52.931 --> 01:46:55.360
<v Speaker 1>nine hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know and tried to keep it lively,</v>

2080
01:46:55.361 --> 01:46:58.300
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to make some funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>references and what have you.</v>

2081
01:46:58.630 --> 01:46:59.463
<v Speaker 1>I love everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody that knows the visibility and </v>

2082
01:47:01.570 --> 01:47:04.270
<v Speaker 1>greater reason than those that we love </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody and listen,</v>

2083
01:47:04.630 --> 01:47:07.540
<v Speaker 1>it's not about whether I meant or didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean it,</v>

2084
01:47:08.230 --> 01:47:09.910
<v Speaker 1>but whether somebody took it the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

2085
01:47:10.450 --> 01:47:14.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm the one that said it and if it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken up to be an offensive statement,</v>

2086
01:47:14.710 --> 01:47:18.010
<v Speaker 1>I apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the easiest thing for me to do,</v>

2087
01:47:18.011 --> 01:47:18.844
<v Speaker 1>the right thing for me to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I certainly hope that she would </v>

2088
01:47:21.181 --> 01:47:22.014
<v Speaker 1>forgive me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the last thing you want to do is to </v>

2089
01:47:23.861 --> 01:47:24.694
<v Speaker 1>be a distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't address the Franklin meaning of </v>

2090
01:47:27.131 --> 01:47:28.540
<v Speaker 1>soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all about her.</v>

2091
01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:32.680
<v Speaker 1>It's not about me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm so sorry if I inserted myself in</v>

2092
01:47:32.681 --> 01:47:34.240
<v Speaker 1>a way that took away from this.</v>

2093
01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:38.740
<v Speaker 1>So I apologize Ariana and to her </v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

2094
01:47:38.830 --> 01:47:42.900
<v Speaker 1>he never addressed the tick grab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He addressed the top of Bell Rondae.</v>

2095
01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:44.033
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comment.</v>

2096
01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:45.453
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the thing is I've only seen it and </v>

2097
01:47:48.670 --> 01:47:51.100
<v Speaker 1>like a clip of it that I thought was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>reference,</v>

2098
01:47:51.101 --> 01:47:51.934
<v Speaker 1>but I watched the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't even address the fricking tit </v>

2099
01:47:54.551 --> 01:47:57.940
<v Speaker 1>dig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is when you grab a lady here,</v>

2100
01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:01.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if she was wearing a wire </v>
<v Speaker 1>bra,</v>

2101
01:48:01.061 --> 01:48:03.130
<v Speaker 1>but first of all there's a wire that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>so obvious,</v>

2102
01:48:03.370 --> 01:48:04.203
<v Speaker 1>but even if not like this motion here is</v>
<v Speaker 1>really like he was getting sexual </v>

2103
01:48:10.481 --> 01:48:11.314
<v Speaker 1>gratification from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you trying to massage her tit and </v>

2104
01:48:14.261 --> 01:48:15.100
<v Speaker 1>turn her on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2105
01:48:15.101 --> 01:48:17.890
<v Speaker 1>what are you trying to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is it just a weird,</v>

2106
01:48:17.891 --> 01:48:20.050
<v Speaker 1>creepy old world power play of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2107
01:48:20.530 --> 01:48:22.400
<v Speaker 1>I can do this and get away with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2108
01:48:23.470 --> 01:48:25.210
<v Speaker 1>so weird as shit.</v>

2109
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:27.863
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2110
01:48:28.330 --> 01:48:29.970

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2111
01:48:30.030 --> 01:48:33.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm sick of these fucking holy men.</v>

2112
01:48:34.170 --> 01:48:37.670
<v Speaker 6>Like anyway,</v>

2113
01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:39.430
<v Speaker 1>anything else to add to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll</v>

2114
01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:40.893
<v Speaker 6>nope.</v>

<v Speaker 1>on live TV during a funeral.</v>

2116
01:48:49.281 --> 01:48:50.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she can't say anything.</v>

2117
01:48:50.570 --> 01:48:53.310
<v Speaker 1>She was recoiling from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>because it's not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like right on the line.</v>
