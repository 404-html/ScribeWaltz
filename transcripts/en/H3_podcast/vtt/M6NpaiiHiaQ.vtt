<v Speaker 2>it is two or fewer.</v>

13
00:00:41.861 --> 00:00:43.930
<v Speaker 2>I like to get out some of the east coast</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

14
00:00:43.931 --> 00:00:47.080
<v Speaker 2>They see a tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

15
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.520
<v Speaker 2>and I'm always like a different word </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's wrong.</v>

16
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.810
<v Speaker 2>They say tournament tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say yeah,</v>

17
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.050
<v Speaker 2>like keep me up to be one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

18
00:00:56.051 --> 00:00:56.884
<v Speaker 2>I have friends from philly that go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to stay for the tournament </v>

19
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.170
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like the tournament and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

20
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.290
<v Speaker 2>It's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that's not the right word.</v>

21
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.840
<v Speaker 2>I think it's completely wrong to say it </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

22
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.733
<v Speaker 2>Am I missing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the spelling I guess could lead you </v>

23
00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:11.081
<v Speaker 2>to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>to tournaments to say tournament.</v>

28
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.770

<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've gone more than a day </v>

85
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 2>without accumulating maybe since I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a day.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the competence.</v>

91
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.640
<v Speaker 2>Kramer has this great line that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>resonated with me since I heard it.</v>

92
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.500
<v Speaker 2>She says masturbating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

93
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.770
<v Speaker 2>that has red.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about it every day.</v>

94

<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elaine wants to join the competition,</v>

95
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.400

<v Speaker 2>She says,</v>

96
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:18.920
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

97
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.980
<v Speaker 2>masterminds like shaving your legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she says,</v>

98
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:22.690
<v Speaker 2>I shaved my shaving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She says,</v>

99
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:24.910
<v Speaker 2>I shaved my legs and Kramer says not </v>
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>

100
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.013
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

101
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.333
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

102
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.860
<v Speaker 2>Well that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now let me ask you something though,</v>

103
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 2>because I'm assuming you guys aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting it in every day.</v>

104
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.710
<v Speaker 2>Marital loves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So are you.</v>

105
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Where do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are you doing your thing?</v>

106
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.170
<v Speaker 2>Is it the shower bathroom?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

107
00:04:41.171 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 2>not where you're going to notice me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>

108
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:45.160
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't keep it a secret then something.</v>

109
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.780
<v Speaker 2>Have you been caught?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have ever been caught?</v>

110
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.070
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

111
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.440
<v Speaker 2>I cannot wait to catch him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never been called.</v>

112
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.550
<v Speaker 2>I think I was caught once by my vehicle </v>
<v Speaker 2>was under the blanket.</v>

113
00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.013
<v Speaker 2>It was more embarrassing than dramatic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but either will never catch me </v>

114
00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:04.800
<v Speaker 2>masturbating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

115
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.910
<v Speaker 2>Why you buy this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

116
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.360
<v Speaker 2>This is the bed detective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you?</v>

117
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.460
<v Speaker 2>Are you trying to walk in now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The detective's going to come out though</v>

118
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.290
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not safe.</v>

119
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.713
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be like in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be really close and </v>

120
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.500
<v Speaker 2>you're held me back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then just to see her face like Linda</v>

121
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.810
<v Speaker 2>through a door can be in the reflection </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the monitor watching porn.</v>

122
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.963
<v Speaker 2>But you don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can go a week without even thinking </v>

123
00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:37.810
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

124
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.640
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think about it a lot,</v>

125
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.590
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes I'll go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing to men,</v>

126
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:45.370
<v Speaker 2>we got two kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One's a real little one.</v>

127
00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:47.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like your sleep and,</v>

128
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.260
<v Speaker 2>and you know when you have a busy </v>
<v Speaker 2>schedule,</v>

129
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.840
<v Speaker 2>like we know we were all doing a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

130
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's like,</v>

131
00:05:54.491 --> 00:05:56.240
<v Speaker 2>it's literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

132
00:05:56.241 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 2>I just got to bed and I'm so tired.</v>

133
00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.330
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

134
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:01.550
<v Speaker 3>it's morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could do it right now.</v>

135
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.750
<v Speaker 3>And I will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

136
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 3>or night in the shower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shower.</v>

137
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.213
<v Speaker 3>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm saying sometimes like that I'll </v>

138
00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:12.860
<v Speaker 3>be like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this going to be a good one?</v>

139
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.480
<v Speaker 3>Or you don't mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because there's ones who were like,</v>

140
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:16.310
<v Speaker 3>that was a disappointing one at this </v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

141
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:18.700
<v Speaker 3>They're all disappointing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How has it discipline?</v>

<v Speaker 3>the system,</v>

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:28.283
<v Speaker 2>come up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's been times I that even </v>

236
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:35.010
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean like indigestion?</v>

237
00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:36.500
<v Speaker 2>Not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>

238
00:10:36.501 --> 00:10:37.334
<v Speaker 2>you don't even know you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She so doesn't even understand what </v>

239
00:10:40.111 --> 00:10:42.420
<v Speaker 2>puking it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember once we were at a party,</v>

240
00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:44.160
<v Speaker 2>she over drank and she was feeling </v>
<v Speaker 2>nauseous.</v>

241
00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:44.994
<v Speaker 2>It's about to Alice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoving my fingers down her throat and </v>

242
00:10:47.311 --> 00:10:50.770
<v Speaker 2>she couldn't have a gag reflex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

243
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:55.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she does know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you've never ever done it with booze</v>

244
00:10:56.131 --> 00:10:57.630
<v Speaker 2>and it came up in voluntarily?</v>

245
00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:58.470
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

246
00:10:58.471 --> 00:11:03.360
<v Speaker 2>I blacked out a few times from alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would still not dangerous.</v>

247
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.300
<v Speaker 2>But regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's serving you well.</v>

248
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.220
<v Speaker 2>And because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

249
00:11:08.221 --> 00:11:11.670
<v Speaker 2>I got to say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this funny moment where before</v>

250
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.830
<v Speaker 2>we knew she was pregnant and she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

251
00:11:13.831 --> 00:11:14.570
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

252
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.730
<v Speaker 2>this pizza's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Started eating food,</v>

253
00:11:17.731 --> 00:11:18.840
<v Speaker 2>enjoying food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or we're like,</v>

254
00:11:18.841 --> 00:11:19.674
<v Speaker 2>what the hell is going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then like a couple days later I </v>

255
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:26.000
<v Speaker 2>found out she was pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when I tell you,</v>

256
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:30.540
<v Speaker 2>after I gave birth to our second son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>food just tasted like cardboard.</v>

257
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:31.403
<v Speaker 2>Like I lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm afraid of because when </v>

258
00:11:33.391 --> 00:11:34.224
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're pregnant it's like you're </v>

259
00:11:34.741 --> 00:11:37.050
<v Speaker 2>hot and you just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't stop eating.</v>

260
00:11:37.051 --> 00:11:41.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm like enjoying food for the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>time in a long time.</v>

261
00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:43.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

262
00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:49.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't want it to sound depressing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm enjoying food click rate.</v>

263
00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:50.003
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess like when you're high and what </v>

264
00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:53.740
<v Speaker 2>are you eating the most of?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you crave?</v>

265
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:58.240
<v Speaker 2>I was just telling you I don't crave </v>
<v Speaker 2>meat,</v>

266
00:11:58.540 --> 00:11:59.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

267
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.360
<v Speaker 2>I can't normally like Meta or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

268
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.210
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like this is more than usual.</v>

269
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:08.470
<v Speaker 2>More kind of aversion because usually </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the opposite.</v>

270
00:12:08.471 --> 00:12:13.471
<v Speaker 2>Women get aversion to like salads when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're hot trimester because parents,</v>

271
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:19.270
<v Speaker 2>because your show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no note.</v>

<v Speaker 2>sweetest fucking bitch.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like a midlife crisis and you guys walk </v>

275

<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that a lot of people,</v>

351
00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:10.040
<v Speaker 3>like they'll realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

352
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.113
<v Speaker 3>the American medical journals have </v>
<v Speaker 3>debunked that entertained for a while </v>

353
00:16:15.921 --> 00:16:19.480
<v Speaker 3>and then I actually did a valid study on</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and yeah.</v>

354
00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.473
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are we not all walking around with </v>

355
00:16:21.831 --> 00:16:24.430
<v Speaker 3>autism?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are we all not great?</v>

356
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:25.363
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all,</v>

357
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.920
<v Speaker 3>we're all vaccinated and smallpox has </v>
<v Speaker 3>gone,</v>

358
00:16:27.921 --> 00:16:31.160
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I guess we are a little autistic.</v>

359
00:16:31.161 --> 00:16:31.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

360
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.473
<v Speaker 3>look at what's going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I might have something to do </v>

361
00:16:35.601 --> 00:16:38.180
<v Speaker 3>with new jacket every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every day.</v>

362
00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.253
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to leave clues relate to </v>

363
00:16:41.211 --> 00:16:44.020
<v Speaker 3>find what's the little nut trail now?</v>

364
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.260
<v Speaker 3>The detective's gonna catch you man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I wish I jerked off less,</v>

365
00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.890
<v Speaker 3>but I can't just know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Part of your thing,</v>

366
00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:52.843
<v Speaker 3>it's just your daily downside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do I do have concern that it is a </v>

367
00:16:56.001 --> 00:16:57.830
<v Speaker 3>compulsive behavior?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might be true.</v>

368
00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:01.160
<v Speaker 3>Let me ask you this because there was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>comic who I won't sell out,</v>

369
00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:05.270
<v Speaker 3>but a comic told me that we were going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do a show and he was like,</v>

370
00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:06.390
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

371
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:07.223
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I jerk off like in the hotel before </v>

372
00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:10.700
<v Speaker 3>shows and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

373
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:14.270
<v Speaker 3>I would not do that at all because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>would make me too tired.</v>

374
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:15.583
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to feel tired to go do the </v>

375
00:17:16.521 --> 00:17:17.960
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The opposite.</v>

376
00:17:17.961 --> 00:17:21.140
<v Speaker 3>I would like to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would do it after a show,</v>

377
00:17:21.141 --> 00:17:26.060
<v Speaker 3>like get back to the room and easy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then Romance,</v>

378
00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.760
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to spend time with me.</v>

379
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:31.520
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but does it not?</v>

380
00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:33.000
<v Speaker 3>Can you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then like,</v>

381
00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.900
<v Speaker 3>are you the type that it kind of knocks </v>
<v Speaker 3>you out or you're like,</v>

382
00:17:35.901 --> 00:17:36.950
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can just go out.</v>

383
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.823
<v Speaker 3>It depends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

384
00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:41.170
<v Speaker 3>I found that jerking off in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 3>is generally a bad idea really,</v>

385
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:42.223
<v Speaker 3>because it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could slow your day down so much </v>

386
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:47.420
<v Speaker 3>because once you jerk off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're going to be on your phone,</v>

387
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:49.450
<v Speaker 3>if you had like a big event,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I don't know you,</v>

388
00:17:49.451 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 3>you had to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

389
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.430
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

390
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:51.680
<v Speaker 3>I won't do it right before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>

391
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:52.733
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I was.</v>

392
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:57.740
<v Speaker 3>No Way skype performs jerker generally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a night jack.</v>

393
00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:00.870
<v Speaker 3>He was keeping notes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aren't you guys together?</v>

394
00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:02.670
<v Speaker 3>I assume you're watching your shows at </v>
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>

395
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.890
<v Speaker 3>You're married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I fall asleep first book.</v>

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:06.960
<v Speaker 3>There's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

397
00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:09.900

<v Speaker 3>This is something that just happens.</v>

398
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:10.711
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

399
00:18:10.711 --> 00:18:13.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my clothes were.</v>

<v Speaker 3>into an acquisition.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'll use the phone.</v>

405
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:25.913
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever do that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done this where like you kind of </v>

406
00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:31.440
<v Speaker 3>pay attention to how deeply she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>sleeping and you're like,</v>

407
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.370
<v Speaker 3>I think I can do it right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

408
00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:34.580
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

409
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:35.423
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are so sick and then you have </v>

410
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.330
<v Speaker 3>masturbated in the bed when Tom was </v>
<v Speaker 3>sleeping.</v>

411
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.940
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you don't think so.</v>

412
00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.180
<v Speaker 3>You have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

413
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:50.750
<v Speaker 3>There's no shame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

414
00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:52.230
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get so embarrassed.</v>

415
00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:53.064
<v Speaker 3>Look at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucked.</v>

416
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.533
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling everybody about my </v>
<v Speaker 3>compulsive masturbating jerking off one </v>

417
00:18:58.141 --> 00:19:02.130
<v Speaker 3>time in the bed when you guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not afraid of being caught.</v>

418
00:19:02.131 --> 00:19:05.190
<v Speaker 3>I think the fear of being caught so </v>
<v Speaker 3>thrill though,</v>

419
00:19:05.191 --> 00:19:06.480
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not For me.</v>

420
00:19:06.481 --> 00:19:07.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't like being afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

421
00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.013
<v Speaker 3>I'm not afraid of being caught in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so confident that I'm not going to </v>

422
00:19:14.431 --> 00:19:15.264
<v Speaker 3>be caught here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like asking for me to find I know what </v>

423
00:19:17.431 --> 00:19:18.264
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't want to catch me know too </v>

424
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:21.720
<v Speaker 3>because I noticed that like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

425
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:25.080
<v Speaker 3>my morning shower is not usually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not usually not.</v>

426
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:27.210
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you always go like,</v>

427
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.930
<v Speaker 3>is it cool to come in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

428
00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:29.843
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck you're doing in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've a couple of times I've been </v>

429
00:19:32.101 --> 00:19:36.300
<v Speaker 3>choking my chicken and you came in but </v>
<v Speaker 3>you were like a wreck.</v>

430
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:37.913
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was able to position myself kind </v>

431
00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:44.490
<v Speaker 3>of like hey baby was also enough steam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

432
00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:46.000
<v Speaker 3>so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the thing?</v>

433
00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.930
<v Speaker 3>We moved to a new house recently and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bathroom,</v>

434
00:19:48.931 --> 00:19:49.764
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any privacy there because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's connected with the bedroom and so </v>

435
00:19:52.411 --> 00:19:53.244
<v Speaker 3>I'm really afraid to go for the shower </v>
<v Speaker 3>these days because if you walk in it's </v>

436
00:19:56.581 --> 00:19:59.730
<v Speaker 3>going to be so obvious that I'm like </v>
<v Speaker 3>concealing my toner.</v>

437
00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.130
<v Speaker 3>You guys have a new game though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This can be a fun game.</v>

438
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:03.413
<v Speaker 3>You'll continually jerk off every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what altered off and you could </v>

439
00:20:07.531 --> 00:20:10.890
<v Speaker 3>be watching tv if that's cool with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not gonna Bother.</v>

440
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.350
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we're a little strange.</v>

441
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.620
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're watching like a 90 day </v>
<v Speaker 3>fiance and I'm just beating off.</v>

442
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.790
<v Speaker 3>Is that a problem?</v>
<v Speaker 3>While we were watching?</v>

443
00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:20.100
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be weird.</v>

444
00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just get up and kitting,</v>

445
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:26.580
<v Speaker 3>like taking a dump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just get up and take it down.</v>

446
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:30.330
<v Speaker 3>90 Day fiance you watched that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We started to.</v>

447
00:20:30.331 --> 00:20:32.850
<v Speaker 3>And then we forgot about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

448
00:20:32.851 --> 00:20:33.750
<v Speaker 3>What's the.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's so weird.</v>

455
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.030
<v Speaker 3>Which is funny because.</v>

456
00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:53.030
<v Speaker 2>And they roasted the day especially for </v>
<v Speaker 2>being such a fucking Weirdo.</v>

457
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.070
<v Speaker 2>This is such a great show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It never got picked up.</v>

458
00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.850

<v Speaker 2>the line somehow.</v>

459
00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:05.140
<v Speaker 2>Speaker roster is nothing but like obese</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

<v Speaker 2>They follow people that have</v>

462
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.580
<v Speaker 4>nothing inherently interesting about </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

463
00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.660
<v Speaker 4>Other than that they look unusual.</v>

465
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.823
<v Speaker 4>do them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I'm bored I go straight to TLC and </v>

466
00:21:26.391 --> 00:21:29.720
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you I got sucked in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was watching this one about my 600 lb.</v>

467
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:31.730
<v Speaker 4>Life been there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

468
00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:34.300
<v Speaker 4>And actually it surprised me because </v>
<v Speaker 4>there was actually a lot of,</v>

469
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:35.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you what,</v>

470
00:21:35.961 --> 00:21:39.860
<v Speaker 4>it shocked me because I was expecting </v>
<v Speaker 4>something really superficial,</v>

471
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.530
<v Speaker 4>but they followed this lady for like 10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

472
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.900
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

473
00:21:44.901 --> 00:21:45.770
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she'd make it out.</v>

474
00:21:45.771 --> 00:21:46.551
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unbelievable.</v>

475
00:21:46.551 --> 00:21:48.290
<v Speaker 4>She passed away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

476
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:49.050
<v Speaker 4>She didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

477
00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:51.410
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why I made that joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's because he was pregnant.</v>

478
00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:52.880
<v Speaker 4>It's like a dad joke.</v>

479
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:55.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were becoming a dad.</v>

480
00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.500
<v Speaker 2>I'll make a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:09.020
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty mild.</v>

486
00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>doesn't affect the child.</v>

548

<v Speaker 2>that like in the months leading up to </v>

552
00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.753
<v Speaker 2>the delivery who would do checkups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need to do more and more </v>

553
00:25:09.591 --> 00:25:10.424
<v Speaker 2>checkups and then as you get close to </v>
<v Speaker 2>they become weekly checkups and she </v>

554
00:25:13.431 --> 00:25:15.830
<v Speaker 2>would go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what is the deal when,</v>

555
00:25:15.831 --> 00:25:19.340

<v Speaker 2>that's right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're gonna fucking make sure the </v>

560
00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.600

561
00:25:29.601 --> 00:25:30.650
<v Speaker 2>Like she blocked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So I'm saying you got to ask your doc </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're going to give you the meds </v>

582
00:26:30.741 --> 00:26:34.310
<v Speaker 2>because there are some doctors that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>evil and won't give a woman the epidural</v>

583
00:26:34.311 --> 00:26:39.160
<v Speaker 2>until she's so much dilated or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want you to be further along before</v>

584
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.930
<v Speaker 2>because it can stop contractions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>slow it down and keep it going.</v>

585
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:42.793
<v Speaker 2>They want to make sure you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressing enough before they give you </v>

586
00:26:44.611 --> 00:26:46.710
<v Speaker 2>pain meds because it can slow everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

587
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:51.640
<v Speaker 2>Just make sure you get someone to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pregnancies last.</v>

588
00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:53.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

589
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:55.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know how to say that.</v>

590
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:55.690
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

591
00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:58.070
<v Speaker 2>You know what you mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like eight,</v>

592
00:26:58.210 --> 00:26:59.790
<v Speaker 2>17,</v>
<v Speaker 2>18 hours top to bottom.</v>

593
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.100
<v Speaker 2>That's not 17.</v>
<v Speaker 2>18 actively.</v>

594
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:02.401
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

595
00:27:02.401 --> 00:27:03.840
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take of the hospital.</v>

596
00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So first for my son came on his due date</v>

597
00:27:06.721 --> 00:27:08.850
<v Speaker 2>and like literally I had contractions at</v>
<v Speaker 2>two in the morning.</v>

598
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.760
<v Speaker 2>We were at the hospital by what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four?</v>

599
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.450
<v Speaker 2>Five in the morning and then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then there's like,</v>

600
00:27:12.451 --> 00:27:14.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's long periods and dilate.</v>

601
00:27:14.941 --> 00:27:17.790
<v Speaker 2>It takes hours to dilate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They consider that you're in labor,</v>

602
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:20.730
<v Speaker 2>so your body active,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing,</v>

603
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.550
<v Speaker 2>opening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally your cervix is dilating.</v>

604
00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:27.030
<v Speaker 2>Has to get to 10 so that the head can </v>
<v Speaker 2>come out crazy.</v>

605
00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:30.920
<v Speaker 2>It's active labor for you as an hour and</v>
<v Speaker 2>change on the second one.</v>

606
00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:31.933
<v Speaker 2>So then you go into where it's go time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if the baby's going about to come </v>

607
00:27:35.761 --> 00:27:37.620
<v Speaker 2>and then you can end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

608
00:27:37.621 --> 00:27:38.454
<v Speaker 2>there's doctors that won't turn your </v>
<v Speaker 2>epidural down so that you don't feel </v>

609
00:27:40.651 --> 00:27:41.820
<v Speaker 2>pain during the pushing.</v>

610
00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.073
<v Speaker 2>Make sure to ask this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them will be like glued </v>

611
00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:46.530
<v Speaker 2>epidural wore off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No I didn't.</v>

612
00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:49.440
<v Speaker 2>They can keep that drip going and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you to push,</v>

613
00:27:49.441 --> 00:27:50.041
<v Speaker 2>you push,</v>
<v Speaker 2>push,</v>

614
00:27:50.041 --> 00:27:52.260
<v Speaker 2>push and then bang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're lucky,</v>

615
00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had my tank cut twice,</v>

616
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.560
<v Speaker 2>but other than that I didn't feel it </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

617
00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:00.950
<v Speaker 2>You don't feel shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your ass hole one hole.</v>

618
00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.153
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

619
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.000
<v Speaker 2>When that kid grows up and they're old </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to understand,</v>

620
00:28:06.001 --> 00:28:07.350
<v Speaker 2>we need to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

621
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.273
<v Speaker 2>if they're misbehaving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen you little shit in your mom's </v>

622
00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:11.353
<v Speaker 2>asshole.</v>

623
00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.030
<v Speaker 2>I'll make them care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take picture.</v>

624
00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:18.810
<v Speaker 2>I remember the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you mom.</v>

625
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.720
<v Speaker 2>Doctor was Regina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The doctor was like,</v>

626
00:28:21.721 --> 00:28:22.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

627
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:25.410
<v Speaker 2>I got a check here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make sure can you know.</v>

628
00:28:25.411 --> 00:28:26.244
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you mind if I put my finger in your </v>

629
00:28:28.321 --> 00:28:30.780
<v Speaker 2>anus to make sure there's two holes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

630
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd mind if you didn't.</v>

631
00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:33.603
<v Speaker 2>She was selling and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you mind if I put my finger in your </v>

632
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:41.080
<v Speaker 2>fucking leg in there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel anything.</v>

633
00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:43.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take a picture.</v>

634
00:28:43.441 --> 00:28:45.030
<v Speaker 2>That's an a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a crazy thing,</v>

635
00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:50.180
<v Speaker 2>but make it like super close so no one </v>
<v Speaker 2>can tell what it is that in the bay.</v>

636
00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:55.500
<v Speaker 2>The kids every fucking time I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're supposed to be two holes</v>

637
00:28:57.301 --> 00:28:58.320
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

638
00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:01.710
<v Speaker 2>So are you feeling super resentful </v>
<v Speaker 2>already of your body?</v>

639
00:29:01.711 --> 00:29:05.880
<v Speaker 2>And I'm more like I'm knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that it's coming.</v>

640
00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:11.060
<v Speaker 2>Those feelings that I get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get little tastes of resentment.</v>

641
00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:17.580
<v Speaker 2>I think little shadows of resentment now</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes out a little subtle ways.</v>

642
00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:23.550
<v Speaker 2>Like a we're just hanging in bed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then she just looks at me like you fuck.</v>

643
00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:27.300
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

644
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.270
<v Speaker 2>are you alright?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

645
00:29:28.271 --> 00:29:29.220
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's fine.</v>

646
00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:30.803
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I already can't fit in my clothes that </v>

647
00:29:33.241 --> 00:29:37.350
<v Speaker 2>she can see the wave way out there that </v>
<v Speaker 2>go slowly.</v>

648
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:42.110
<v Speaker 2>But I think see he's going to be good </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he adores and you can tell</v>

649
00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:44.980
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of guys that aren't like </v>
<v Speaker 3>he adored,</v>

650
00:29:44.981 --> 00:29:48.310
<v Speaker 3>so you're going to feel the resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're going to be able to navigate.</v>

651
00:29:48.311 --> 00:29:50.800
<v Speaker 3>I feel like somehow that makes her angry</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the times when I'm like,</v>

652
00:29:50.801 --> 00:29:53.050
<v Speaker 3>you're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe you're having this baby.</v>

653
00:29:53.051 --> 00:29:54.280
<v Speaker 3>It's a credit line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

654
00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:56.410
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>

655
00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:02.210
<v Speaker 3>They're like that sometimes you can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>stop.</v>

656
00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.270
<v Speaker 3>There were times too where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't know what's going on.</v>

657
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:09.920
<v Speaker 3>I to know what to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you figure out like that.</v>

658
00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:12.390
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing I can say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just got to shut the fuck up yet.</v>

659
00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.860
<v Speaker 3>That's something you learned in marriage</v>
<v Speaker 3>with them?</v>

660
00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:15.843
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's like I said everything </v>

661
00:30:17.921 --> 00:30:19.270
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did everything right.</v>

662
00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:20.351
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what,</v>

663
00:30:20.351 --> 00:30:21.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what can I tell you?</v>

664
00:30:21.371 --> 00:30:23.920
<v Speaker 3>And Isla is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just leave,</v>

665
00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:28.360
<v Speaker 3>just leave me alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just wake up and I'm bad moon.</v>

666
00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:29.443
<v Speaker 3>So they'll have this thing where </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I just wake up on the wrong </v>

667
00:30:32.741 --> 00:30:33.970
<v Speaker 3>side of the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they call it.</v>

668
00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:38.230
<v Speaker 3>But when you get mad or irritated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

669
00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.650
<v Speaker 3>I always feel like you're mad at me </v>
<v Speaker 3>because when I,</v>

670
00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:45.660
<v Speaker 3>when I get up to that same issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

671
00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.910
<v Speaker 3>upset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't know,</v>

672
00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:52.360
<v Speaker 3>you don't think that I'm upset at him </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>

673
00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:55.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think because I think we just.</v>

674
00:30:55.750 --> 00:31:00.750
<v Speaker 3>And we experienced that feeling </v>
<v Speaker 3>differently because when I'm upset I,</v>

675
00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:02.523
<v Speaker 3>I treat you like my ally intentionally </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't want you to feel that </v>

676
00:31:05.351 --> 00:31:07.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm mad at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's just,</v>

677
00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.610
<v Speaker 3>that's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just,</v>

678
00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.250
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologically that's fast.</v>

679
00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.900
<v Speaker 3>But I know you're not mad at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

680
00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:15.423
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

681
00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:16.361
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see,</v>

682
00:31:16.361 --> 00:31:17.850
<v Speaker 3>I do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you do?</v>

683
00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:20.800
<v Speaker 3>So I understand what you're saying when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're upset.</v>

684
00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:24.190
<v Speaker 3>I was upset at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

685
00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:25.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's upset.</v>

686
00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:30.040
<v Speaker 3>I should stay away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she might might be upset at me.</v>

687
00:31:30.041 --> 00:31:31.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you're upset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're upset.</v>

688
00:31:31.541 --> 00:31:32.374
<v Speaker 3>But then what I'll do is I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>good to leave you alone because I went </v>

689
00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:43.510
<v Speaker 3>in [inaudible] case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't want to fucking see me and I</v>

690
00:31:43.511 --> 00:31:45.250
<v Speaker 3>know that now because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isla,</v>

691
00:31:45.251 --> 00:31:48.730
<v Speaker 3>what's wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he doesn't want to fucking see me.</v>

692
00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:50.503
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>

693
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:52.010
<v Speaker 3>That's how she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

694
00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.910
<v Speaker 3>I just need my coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just something like that.</v>

695
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:56.583
<v Speaker 3>She and I and like the commission is </v>
<v Speaker 3>dirty and I got to clean it and like I </v>

696
00:31:59.531 --> 00:32:01.630
<v Speaker 3>just woke up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that,</v>

697
00:32:01.631 --> 00:32:05.590
<v Speaker 3>like I just don't even want to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you want to be asked.</v>

698
00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:06.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

699
00:32:06.601 --> 00:32:07.810
<v Speaker 3>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I've learned.</v>

700
00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:11.710
<v Speaker 3>It's a counterintuitive with us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She actually doesn't want to fucking see</v>

701
00:32:11.711 --> 00:32:12.990
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyway.</v>

702
00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:14.001
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand.</v>

703
00:32:14.001 --> 00:32:14.834
<v Speaker 3>But some people process stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>differently so she might need that time </v>

704
00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.350
<v Speaker 3>to do her coffee and get collect </v>
<v Speaker 3>herself.</v>

705
00:32:20.351 --> 00:32:22.750
<v Speaker 3>And maybe you're more of an introvert </v>
<v Speaker 3>with that stuff.</v>

706
00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.610
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm like that when I'm upset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

707
00:32:24.611 --> 00:32:29.590
<v Speaker 3>you're the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're avoidant or you don't want to get</v>

708
00:32:29.591 --> 00:32:30.424
<v Speaker 3>in your mind a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then understand this emotion because I </v>

709
00:32:31.871 --> 00:32:34.480
<v Speaker 3>don't understand what the Ila kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I don't feel that way.</v>

710
00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:35.523
<v Speaker 3>So you're upset at not Christina.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously something completely </v>

711
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:40.130
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

712
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:40.963
<v Speaker 4>so you're just in a bad mood and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>somehow that negative energy is just </v>

713
00:32:44.241 --> 00:32:44.510
<v Speaker 4>direct.</v>

714
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:46.830
<v Speaker 2>Did to whatever is in front of you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

715
00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he'll get mad at like,</v>

716
00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.690
<v Speaker 2>why are there stains on the couch?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'll be like,</v>

717
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:54.070
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

718
00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.970
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that's directed towards me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely not.</v>

719
00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:57.843
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know that rationally it agitates </v>

720
00:33:00.221 --> 00:33:01.510
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah Fuck.</v>

721
00:33:01.511 --> 00:33:06.030
<v Speaker 2>He's mad about reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're totally reversed.</v>

722
00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.740
<v Speaker 2>But then you'll also do [inaudible] you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

723
00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:09.753
<v Speaker 2>too much psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like fucking stains on the couch </v>

724
00:33:12.431 --> 00:33:13.190
<v Speaker 2>and you'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

725
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.750
<v Speaker 2>what are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will?</v>

726
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:14.261
<v Speaker 2>She'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

727
00:33:14.261 --> 00:33:15.280
<v Speaker 2>Are you really mad?</v>

728
00:33:15.281 --> 00:33:17.830

<v Speaker 2>And then she was like,</v>

729
00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.220
<v Speaker 2>let's talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like the stains are not going away.</v>

730
00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:23.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See.</v>

731
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:25.150
<v Speaker 2>But where I'm real direct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

732
00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:27.220
<v Speaker 2>we have two dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One's a shelter dog,</v>

733
00:33:27.221 --> 00:33:28.054
<v Speaker 2>ones a pure bred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The shelter dog can live without the </v>

734
00:33:30.821 --> 00:33:33.310
<v Speaker 2>other one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The purebred is a lovey machine.</v>

735
00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:35.740
<v Speaker 2>I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like that pure bred lovey machine.</v>

736
00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.090
<v Speaker 2>Bitsy,</v>

<v Speaker 2>FIFA.</v>

740
00:33:42.541 --> 00:33:43.360
<v Speaker 2>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

741
00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.490
<v Speaker 2>Whenever I'm doing my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I'm upset though,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That.</v>

744
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:53.180
<v Speaker 4>Let's go to a break.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're over.</v>

745
00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:55.090
<v Speaker 4>We're going to continue this </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>

746
00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:56.043
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are just at the tip of the iceberg </v>

747
00:33:57.671 --> 00:33:59.290
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're psychologically breaking it down.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Guys.</v>

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:09.100
<v Speaker 4>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>magical,</v>

752
00:34:09.101 --> 00:34:13.270
<v Speaker 4>mythical toothbrush that is changing the</v>
<v Speaker 4>game of dental hygiene?</v>

753
00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:14.253
<v Speaker 4>One of the most important things we can </v>
<v Speaker 4>do for our health everyday is brushing </v>

754
00:34:16.271 --> 00:34:17.104
<v Speaker 4>our teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yet most of us aren't doing it properly </v>

755
00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:20.740
<v Speaker 4>and you're walking around like you just </v>
<v Speaker 4>had a Turd.</v>

756
00:34:20.741 --> 00:34:21.574
<v Speaker 4>Sandwich quip is a better electric </v>
<v Speaker 4>toothbrush created by dentists and </v>

757
00:34:24.971 --> 00:34:27.790
<v Speaker 4>designers to make brushing your teeth </v>
<v Speaker 4>more simple,</v>

758
00:34:27.791 --> 00:34:28.624
<v Speaker 4>affordable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and dare I say this Isla Fun and </v>

759
00:34:30.491 --> 00:34:32.260
<v Speaker 4>enjoyable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

760
00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.780
<v Speaker 4>it's that good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

761
00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:36.040
<v Speaker 4>this okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here.</v>

762
00:34:36.041 --> 00:34:37.330
<v Speaker 4>Let me tell you about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

763
00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:40.360
<v Speaker 4>I have sensitive gums as most of us do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and gums,</v>

764
00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:42.070
<v Speaker 4>they do not heal back.</v>

765
00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:43.083
<v Speaker 4>You need to find soft,</v>
<v Speaker 4>correct bristles that are not going to </v>

766
00:34:46.601 --> 00:34:48.910
<v Speaker 4>corrode your gums because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming back,</v>

767
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:50.980
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what this is.</v>

768
00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.390
<v Speaker 4>It's soft,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's rubbery.</v>

769
00:34:52.450 --> 00:34:55.500
<v Speaker 4>It's the best head I've ever found and </v>
<v Speaker 4>no offense.</v>

770
00:34:55.530 --> 00:35:00.530
<v Speaker 4>Isla is get enough on your sensitive </v>
<v Speaker 4>guns.</v>

771
00:35:03.761 --> 00:35:08.230
<v Speaker 4>People brush too hard at some electric </v>
<v Speaker 4>toothbrushes are way too abrasive.</v>

772
00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:10.540
<v Speaker 4>It's got a built in timer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what this is,</v>

773
00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:13.900
<v Speaker 4>and every 30 seconds it reminds you to </v>
<v Speaker 4>switch sides,</v>

774
00:35:13.901 --> 00:35:17.860
<v Speaker 4>helping guide a fall and even claim up </v>
<v Speaker 4>to 90 percent of us.</v>

775
00:35:17.861 --> 00:35:20.920
<v Speaker 4>Don't brush for two full minutes and </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't even clean evenly.</v>

776
00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:24.670
<v Speaker 4>That's what helps you achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

777
00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:25.773
<v Speaker 4>so that's why I love quip.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Angeles area.</v>

810
00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:19.883
<v Speaker 4>And I think that what deters people more</v>
<v Speaker 4>than anything is single rink now have </v>

811
00:37:24.631 --> 00:37:25.860
<v Speaker 4>you see they've got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

812
00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:26.903
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a doorbell that has a motion </v>

813
00:37:28.621 --> 00:37:30.690
<v Speaker 4>sensor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when somebody approaches the door at,</v>

814
00:37:30.691 --> 00:37:31.524
<v Speaker 4>sends you a mobile notification and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>saves the video and immediately uploads </v>

815
00:37:35.401 --> 00:37:36.234
<v Speaker 4>it to the cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we've got one at the doorbell and </v>

816
00:37:38.281 --> 00:37:39.114
<v Speaker 4>then we've got security cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 4>floodlights that instantly activate and </v>

817
00:37:42.511 --> 00:37:45.750
<v Speaker 4>blast with light and record the same way</v>
<v Speaker 4>all around the house.</v>

818
00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:46.913
<v Speaker 4>So in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's almost no way to approach the </v>

819
00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:53.790
<v Speaker 4>house without us being notified and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>checking the video.</v>

820
00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:57.430
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter like even alarm </v>
<v Speaker 4>systems can fail you if you don't have a</v>

821
00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.640
<v Speaker 4>shatterproof,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a shatter detector,</v>

822
00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:02.790
<v Speaker 4>they could break it through the window </v>
<v Speaker 4>at leave without even being seen.</v>

823
00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:04.440
<v Speaker 4>Motion detectors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll go off.</v>

824
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:05.303
<v Speaker 4>Even if your alarm goes off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the police aren't gonna arrive for </v>

825
00:38:06.571 --> 00:38:09.090
<v Speaker 4>another 30 minutes because they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to call you a bunch of times with</v>

<v Speaker 4>And you could call the police </v>

828
00:38:13.681 --> 00:38:15.150
<v Speaker 4>immediately.</v>

<v Speaker 3>time too,</v>

903
00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.870
<v Speaker 3>which affects the kid.</v>

905
00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.300
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

906
00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.610
<v Speaker 3>but I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you guys are.</v>

907
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm a garth brooks fan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love Garth Brooks.</v>

908
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:12.250
<v Speaker 3>He's such an interesting character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is he not Hashtag Hashtag there together</v>

909
00:42:13.151 --> 00:42:16.360
<v Speaker 3>at your Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

910
00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.233
<v Speaker 3>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is winning first for all of our </v>

911
00:42:19.461 --> 00:42:20.294
<v Speaker 3>viewers?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's First Watch garth brooks to give </v>

912
00:42:21.771 --> 00:42:22.604
<v Speaker 3>you all a little taste and then we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of try to get inside his head </v>

913
00:42:25.191 --> 00:42:29.060
<v Speaker 3>because garth Brooks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand what's going on.</v>

914
00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:30.470
<v Speaker 3>I can't get a read on this too.</v>

915
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:33.710
<v Speaker 3>I think it's important because we talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it when we talk about him.</v>

916
00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:34.903
<v Speaker 3>It's important for people not in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>note because it's fair that there's </v>

917
00:42:38.391 --> 00:42:39.224
<v Speaker 3>different genres and you don't know who </v>
<v Speaker 3>knows what to recognize how </v>

918
00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:46.670
<v Speaker 3>inconceivably famous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy is good.</v>

919
00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:49.550
<v Speaker 3>It is out of this world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bonkers.</v>

920
00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:51.230
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I may be wrong,</v>

921
00:42:51.231 --> 00:42:52.940
<v Speaker 3>but last time we were talking about him </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the show,</v>

922
00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:57.410
<v Speaker 3>he's like the number two or maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 3>number one best selling.</v>

923
00:42:58.350 --> 00:42:59.780

<v Speaker 3>But you know that he was,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

937
00:43:34.041 --> 00:43:35.840
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

938
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:37.340
<v Speaker 3>most people release these when they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>dead.</v>

939
00:43:37.341 --> 00:43:38.174
<v Speaker 3>That's no fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just puts out raised Christ Jesus </v>

940
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:47.200
<v Speaker 3>Christ because you fucking hillbilly </v>
<v Speaker 3>slapped him in the face and in his eyes,</v>

941
00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:51.320
<v Speaker 3>you fucking monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't curse.</v>

942
00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:51.891
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

943
00:43:51.891 --> 00:43:55.040
<v Speaker 3>she didn't say it like Ellen too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I find her fascinating.</v>

944
00:43:55.041 --> 00:43:55.431
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

945
00:43:55.431 --> 00:43:57.180
<v Speaker 3>but also super famous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's.</v>

946
00:43:57.181 --> 00:43:58.014
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it really fucks with you to be </v>

947
00:43:58.761 --> 00:44:00.770
<v Speaker 3>that famous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so too.</v>

948
00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.570
<v Speaker 3>I think so too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

949
00:44:02.571 --> 00:44:03.404
<v Speaker 3>but garth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's why we find him fascinating </v>

950
00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:06.133
<v Speaker 3>because I look and no one's disputing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's very talented and he's very </v>

951
00:44:09.771 --> 00:44:12.230
<v Speaker 3>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not dumping on this guy for that.</v>

952
00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:15.530
<v Speaker 3>But it's that there's something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't read,</v>

953
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:18.130
<v Speaker 3>like don't understand the man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

954
00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:20.420
<v Speaker 3>You know what it is.</v>

955
00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:24.580
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's Ethan like,</v>

956
00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:26.720
<v Speaker 3>what's he like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which Christina like and you go,</v>

957
00:44:26.721 --> 00:44:27.554
<v Speaker 3>this is kind of their personality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with him it feels like a </v>

958
00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:34.110
<v Speaker 3>manufactured personality in the social </v>
<v Speaker 3>media posts.</v>

959
00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:35.123
<v Speaker 3>It always feels like we're saying the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right thing at the right time and it </v>

960
00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:41.970
<v Speaker 3>feels that reads to a lot of people as </v>
<v Speaker 3>inauthentic.</v>

961
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:46.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that necessarily is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he reads like this can mean if,</v>

962
00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:51.620
<v Speaker 3>if it's just like a four is you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

963
00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:54.690
<v Speaker 3>is he just euphoric?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

964
00:44:54.691 --> 00:44:56.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's a creep.</v>

965
00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:00.540
<v Speaker 3>I think by the way he's in the videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just like,</v>

966
00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:03.180
<v Speaker 3>thank God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank God for my life.</v>

967
00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:06.030
<v Speaker 3>Like he's just this euphoric guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe that's just who he is.</v>

968
00:45:06.031 --> 00:45:11.031
<v Speaker 3>I think if maybe I want world peace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what happens too is you do these</v>

969
00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:18.650
<v Speaker 3>three hour plus shows to 80 100,000</v>

<v Speaker 3>you're the gray like that many people.</v>

971
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:24.510
<v Speaker 3>Your your the same bet that he walks </v>
<v Speaker 3>around like,</v>

972
00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:25.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

973
00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:28.440

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>oh my life's about to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's the real guy.</v>

1166
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:57.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

1167
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:58.050
<v Speaker 3>I bet.</v>

1168
00:54:58.050 --> 00:54:59.190
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really like.</v>

1169
00:54:59.191 --> 00:55:02.880
<v Speaker 3>That is a control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a dictator,</v>

1170
00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:03.743
<v Speaker 3>is the way I think he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the guy whose music never ended </v>

1171
00:55:05.251 --> 00:55:08.250
<v Speaker 3>up on Itunes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get an exclusive deal with Walmart.</v>

1172
00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:11.340
<v Speaker 3>That means he's business savvy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's also really in control.</v>

1173
00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:14.760
<v Speaker 3>Really calling the shots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also let's talk about his alter ego.</v>

1174
00:55:14.761 --> 00:55:18.720
<v Speaker 3>Chris Gaines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy is a gold mine.</v>

1175
00:55:18.721 --> 00:55:19.554
<v Speaker 3>It's just bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This gains is one of the weirdest thing </v>

1176
00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:24.990
<v Speaker 3>that ever happened to one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>weirdest things ever happened for people</v>

1177
00:55:24.991 --> 00:55:25.824
<v Speaker 3>they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got so famous and board being garth </v>

1178
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:30.090
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He created an Australian,</v>

1179
00:55:30.091 --> 00:55:32.780
<v Speaker 3>I think alter ego's very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aaron died.</v>

1180
00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:34.650
<v Speaker 3>Let me throw up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's the other thing.</v>

1181
00:55:34.651 --> 00:55:35.484
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>savagery of this is that Chris was </v>

1182
00:55:39.421 --> 00:55:40.254
<v Speaker 3>almost wiped entirely to internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know how hard it is to do that </v>

1183
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:48.180
<v Speaker 3>damn near?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really very little out there.</v>

1184
00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:51.510
<v Speaker 3>He's coming back because people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about Chris Gay dude.</v>

1185
00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:52.403
<v Speaker 3>He.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This whole kind of Garth Brooks' name </v>

1186
00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:56.813
<v Speaker 3>that's brewing is going to be something </v>
<v Speaker 3>new for him because you cannot fight </v>

1187
00:56:01.590 --> 00:56:02.670
<v Speaker 3>against me more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fair.</v>

1188
00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:06.750
<v Speaker 3>What if it went like this for a while </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then like it built it,</v>

1189
00:56:06.751 --> 00:56:08.760
<v Speaker 3>built it pissed him off and then they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>

1190
00:56:08.790 --> 00:56:12.000
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Garth Brooks has 10 bodies buried on his</v>

1191
00:56:12.001 --> 00:56:13.320
<v Speaker 3>fucking land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like He.</v>

1192
00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:14.410
<v Speaker 3>That would make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1193
00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:16.560
<v Speaker 3>he's makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you talk about that?</v>

1194
00:56:16.561 --> 00:56:19.470
<v Speaker 3>When he did Chris Gaines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a photo shoots,</v>

1195
00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:20.573
<v Speaker 3>he would suck his cheeks and because </v>
<v Speaker 3>Chris wasn't supposed to be as big as </v>

1196
00:56:22.531 --> 00:56:24.530
<v Speaker 3>Garth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's why I.</v>

1197
00:56:25.410 --> 00:56:27.600
<v Speaker 3>So you can see us do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a vampire.</v>

1198
00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:30.930
<v Speaker 3>I think it looks cute as Chris Gaines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm digging Chris Gaines actually,</v>

1199
00:56:32.010 --> 00:56:34.180
<v Speaker 3>he's Kinda Gotten Kinda hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's cool.</v>

1200
00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:36.850
<v Speaker 3>It is an odd choice though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1201
00:56:36.851 --> 00:56:37.684
<v Speaker 3>To be so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's essentially like ever never been </v>

1202
00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:40.810
<v Speaker 3>anything like that.</v>

1203
00:56:40.830 --> 00:56:42.520
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the biggest star in music.</v>

1204
00:56:42.521 --> 00:56:43.354
<v Speaker 3>But like I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do this realize because I </v>

1205
00:56:45.041 --> 00:56:47.980
<v Speaker 3>was reading so much garth stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 3>when he did this,</v>

1206
00:56:47.981 --> 00:56:49.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one could talk them out of it.</v>

1207
00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:51.280
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think his manager,</v>

1208
00:56:51.281 --> 00:56:53.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about this don't do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was like,</v>

1209
00:56:53.381 --> 00:56:54.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm Chris got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing it,</v>

1210
00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:57.550
<v Speaker 3>and then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it did poorly,</v>

1211
00:56:57.610 --> 00:56:58.720
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it wasn't.</v>

1212
00:56:59.650 --> 00:57:00.483
<v Speaker 3>It was a disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still just people knowing that it </v>

1213
00:57:03.281 --> 00:57:07.270
<v Speaker 3>was him doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I want to say it moved somewhere</v>

1214
00:57:07.271 --> 00:57:10.360
<v Speaker 3>close to a million still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's still like,</v>

1215
00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:11.730
<v Speaker 3>that's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1216
00:57:11.731 --> 00:57:12.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he was like,</v>

1217
00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:14.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm still 25 million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure just what I do.</v>

1218
00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:16.270
<v Speaker 3>And then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1219
00:57:16.271 --> 00:57:17.800
<v Speaker 3>I only sold a million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

1220
00:57:17.801 --> 00:57:18.634
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sucks.</v>

1221
00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:23.620
<v Speaker 3>But I think it's part of that crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>insane ego.</v>

1222
00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:27.490
<v Speaker 3>Ego's ism where he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go make pop music.</v>

1223
00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:29.230
<v Speaker 3>Can be an email singer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1224
00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:31.150
<v Speaker 3>that's exceeded that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just looked it up.</v>

1225
00:57:31.151 --> 00:57:33.130
<v Speaker 3>His Chris Gaines album went double </v>
<v Speaker 3>platinum,</v>

1226
00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:35.953
<v Speaker 3>filtered a tremendous failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is how successful that guy's used </v>

1227
00:57:39.431 --> 00:57:40.450
<v Speaker 3>to being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

1228
00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:41.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually I remember reading,</v>

1229
00:57:41.801 --> 00:57:44.770
<v Speaker 3>and correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had like this huge release and they</v>

1230
00:57:44.771 --> 00:57:45.604
<v Speaker 3>bought tons of albums and it was filling</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the music stores and while he did </v>

1231
00:57:49.391 --> 00:57:52.050
<v Speaker 3>sell a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a little bit.</v>

1232
00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:54.040
<v Speaker 3>Overstock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Overstock for sure.</v>

1233
00:57:55.810 --> 00:57:57.880
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm just reeling.</v>

1234
00:57:57.881 --> 00:58:00.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm also thinking of rock stars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

1235
00:58:00.371 --> 00:58:01.204
<v Speaker 3>Actors that became rock stars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm not really successful in </v>

1236
00:58:05.291 --> 00:58:06.124
<v Speaker 3>this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's fuck that up by trying to </v>

1237
00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:11.500
<v Speaker 3>coordinate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's list who we can think of.</v>

<v Speaker 3>She does that.</v>

1239
00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:16.770
<v Speaker 3>She's like actually still touring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great though.</v>

1240

00:58:33.941 --> 00:58:35.710
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1246
00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:39.880
<v Speaker 3>This is really something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was one billy Bob Thorton,</v>

1247
00:58:39.881 --> 00:58:42.580
<v Speaker 3>I dunno if you guys recall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was very serious about that.</v>

1248
00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:43.960
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's another one.</v>

1249
00:58:43.961 --> 00:58:46.370
<v Speaker 3>He went on a late night show I recall </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were,</v>

1250
00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:48.850
<v Speaker 3>and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm only here to talk about my music.</v>

1251
00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:57.460
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Murphy a murder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that guy has an amazing voice,</v>

1252
00:58:57.461 --> 00:58:59.180
<v Speaker 3>but somehow it was just the corniest </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing ever.</v>

1253
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:01.360
<v Speaker 3>It was awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

1254
00:59:01.361 --> 00:59:05.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even he joined twitter,</v>

1255
00:59:05.350 --> 00:59:08.830
<v Speaker 3>I want to say he joined twitter to put </v>
<v Speaker 3>out a music video.</v>

1256
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:11.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people were like that.</v>

1257
00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:14.140
<v Speaker 3>He was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going about my album now.</v>

1258
00:59:14.141 --> 00:59:14.974
<v Speaker 3>I will say the person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one person I can think of who it </v>

1259
00:59:16.781 --> 00:59:19.240
<v Speaker 3>really worked for was Donald Glover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1260
00:59:19.241 --> 00:59:20.530
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's childish.</v>

1261
00:59:20.531 --> 00:59:22.280
<v Speaker 3>Gambino.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drake.</v>

1262
00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:26.390
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I was a lesbian before,</v>

1263
00:59:26.391 --> 00:59:31.391
<v Speaker 3>but this is like Donald Glover can </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually really do all those things.</v>

1264
00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:34.790
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can.</v>

1265
00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:35.623
<v Speaker 3>He's really good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think some of the other guys were </v>

1266
00:59:37.521 --> 00:59:41.180
<v Speaker 3>talking about like 15 plus years of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being a movie star.</v>

1267
00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:44.360
<v Speaker 3>Like you're a household name a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

1268
00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:45.620
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See you saying,</v>

1269
00:59:45.621 --> 00:59:46.730
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wasn't shit.</v>

1270
00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:48.950
<v Speaker 3>I want to ask you guys about a story </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

1271
00:59:49.050 --> 00:59:51.020
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't know what to make of it.</v>

1272
00:59:51.050 --> 00:59:53.150
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the most bizarre things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1273
00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:54.650
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let me,</v>

1274
00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:56.120
<v Speaker 3>let me start here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1275
00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:57.373
<v Speaker 3>There was a teacher who is in a hot </v>
<v Speaker 3>water after getting into a fistfight </v>

1276
01:00:02.361 --> 01:00:06.320
<v Speaker 3>with a 14 year old student after the </v>
<v Speaker 3>student berated him,</v>

1277
01:00:06.321 --> 01:00:09.110
<v Speaker 3>calling him the n word and throwing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>basketball at him.</v>

1278
01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:11.300
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now there's a video.</v>

1279
01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:15.140
<v Speaker 3>There's a video of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what's so crazy to me.</v>

1280
01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:18.020
<v Speaker 3>Let let me show you the video first and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'll tell you about the aftermath,</v>

1281
01:00:18.021 --> 01:00:18.854
<v Speaker 3>which is really what's perplexing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's enjoy this a right in our </v>

1282
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:28.750
<v Speaker 3>American school system and they'll skip </v>
<v Speaker 3>forward to where the good stuff happens.</v>

1283
01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:35.103
<v Speaker 2>You could tell this kid's a little piece</v>
<v Speaker 2>of shit all day nine and if you're the </v>

1284
01:00:45.691 --> 01:00:46.524
<v Speaker 2>one lying bro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you said that shape right here </v>

1285
01:00:53.610 --> 01:00:58.610
<v Speaker 2>at home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want me to wait first of all this?</v>

1286
01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:04.453
<v Speaker 3>It is still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is insane that for me that a student </v>

1287
01:01:08.781 --> 01:01:09.614
<v Speaker 3>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like in front of the class saying </v>

1288
01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:13.330
<v Speaker 3>that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what leads to this,</v>

1289
01:01:13.550 --> 01:01:14.660
<v Speaker 3>but it's crazy to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1290
01:01:14.661 --> 01:01:19.661
<v Speaker 3>apparently the backstory is that this </v>
<v Speaker 3>teacher was beloved by the school and he</v>

1291
01:01:22.041 --> 01:01:25.610
<v Speaker 3>is meant to be very calm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice guy.</v>

1292
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:26.743
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I guess something just snaps in him </v>

1293
01:01:28.491 --> 01:01:31.060
<v Speaker 3>in this moment as you'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this kids like him,</v>

1294
01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:33.650
<v Speaker 3>he's the shit and he's trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>under them.</v>

1295
01:01:33.651 --> 01:01:35.940
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think they have a history together</v>

1296
01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:36.973
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>

1297
01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:43.900
<v Speaker 2>These schools are rough though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like cuts.</v>

1298
01:01:57.030 --> 01:02:02.030
<v Speaker 8>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he,</v>

1299
01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:21.030
<v Speaker 8>he broke them in.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean it's obviously not okay at all.</v>

1300
01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:22.133
<v Speaker 8>But I think that kid,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he's probably been doing that for a </v>

1301
01:02:25.531 --> 01:02:26.140
<v Speaker 8>while.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

1302
01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:28.870
<v Speaker 8>that's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's crazy to see.</v>

1303
01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:33.300
<v Speaker 8>He really goes after and feel me just </v>
<v Speaker 8>one that's a grown ass man.</v>

1304
01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:37.500
<v Speaker 8>And now here he act like he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 8>remember what happened.</v>

1305
01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he's.</v>

1306
01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:47.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's panicking.</v>

1307
01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:48.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's playing.</v>

1308
01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.620
<v Speaker 2>He's playing a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

1309
01:02:50.621 --> 01:02:51.510
<v Speaker 2>who hit him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

1310
01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:52.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1311
01:02:52.061 --> 01:02:52.780
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No that was it.</v>

1312
01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:55.330
<v Speaker 2>That was mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we missed it.</v>

1313
01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:58.780
<v Speaker 2>Just prior to where you started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was when he had a basketball.</v>

1314
01:02:58.781 --> 01:03:01.040
<v Speaker 2>The kid threw it at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1315
01:03:02.110 --> 01:03:05.080
<v Speaker 2>He actually did instigate the physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspect of it.</v>

1316
01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:07.413
<v Speaker 2>Did I miss?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's when it's still vertical </v>

1317
01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:11.893
<v Speaker 2>basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the kid throws the basketball per </v>

1318
01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:16.850
<v Speaker 2>teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1319
01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:19.830
<v Speaker 2>So here's the part where it gets really </v>
<v Speaker 2>surprising.</v>

1320
01:03:19.831 --> 01:03:22.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well what do I feel bad for everybody?</v>

1321
01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:24.720
<v Speaker 2>It's a rough school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

1322
01:03:24.721 --> 01:03:25.820
<v Speaker 2>Like where?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where is life?</v>

1323
01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:27.450
<v Speaker 2>Where it's in La?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's here in la.</v>

1324
01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:28.520
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what I read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1325
01:03:28.570 --> 01:03:29.403
<v Speaker 2>Portola.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Junior high.</v>

1326
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:31.890
<v Speaker 2>He's a music teacher of all things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1327
01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:35.010
<v Speaker 2>You went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to,</v>

1328
01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:39.330
<v Speaker 2>but I did go to public school or two of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them in La and they're pretty horrible.</v>

1329
01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:40.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones I went to anyways,</v>

1330
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:42.630
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty much some shit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

1331
01:03:42.631 --> 01:03:43.464
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see some really bad homes and </v>

1332
01:03:46.891 --> 01:03:48.600
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to deal with a kid like</v>

1333
01:03:48.601 --> 01:03:49.434
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1334
01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:52.020
<v Speaker 2>But regardless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now,</v>

1335
01:03:52.021 --> 01:03:54.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>opinions are deeply divided.</v>

1336
01:03:54.990 --> 01:03:56.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1337
01:03:57.610 --> 01:04:00.460
<v Speaker 2>and here this is the part that blew me </v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:01.353
<v Speaker 2>This guy is a pro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's definitely going to be </v>

1339
01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:03.940
<v Speaker 2>fired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1340
01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:04.953
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's definitely going to have to think </v>

1341
01:04:05.951 --> 01:04:06.784
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then now there's a go fund me for </v>

<v Speaker 2>Where's maywood?</v>

1350
01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:32.200
<v Speaker 2>Maywood Academy High School.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He was sent to jail.</v>

1352
01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:36.620
<v Speaker 2>He assaulted a child.</v>

1353
01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:39.763
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

1354

1355
01:04:43.841 --> 01:04:44.674

<v Speaker 2>And sadly he was handcuffed and sent to </v>

1356
01:04:46.711 --> 01:04:48.840
<v Speaker 2>jail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which does make sense.</v>

1357
01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:50.013
<v Speaker 2>I mean kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he assaulted as we kick the shit </v>

1358
01:04:54.911 --> 01:04:56.290
<v Speaker 2>out of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't really do that.</v>

1359
01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.240
<v Speaker 2>Like if he threw one punch I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like,</v>

1360
01:04:58.270 --> 01:04:59.560
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was threatened.</v>

1361
01:04:59.561 --> 01:05:02.110
<v Speaker 2>But then he's beat the shit out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

1362
01:05:02.111 --> 01:05:04.510
<v Speaker 2>I understand kids trigger the shit out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of you,</v>

1363
01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:07.070
<v Speaker 2>but you can't hit them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1364
01:05:07.090 --> 01:05:07.930
<v Speaker 2>he really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1365
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:12.990
<v Speaker 2>he went after that kid is may and </v>
<v Speaker 2>started beating like La South La,</v>

1366
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.050
<v Speaker 2>south La Belle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1367
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:18.903
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think everyone relates to that </v>

1368
01:05:20.530 --> 01:05:21.363
<v Speaker 10>teachers</v>

1369
01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.490
<v Speaker 4>feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you just.</v>

1370
01:05:23.491 --> 01:05:25.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you're the EDC you can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm doing.</v>

1371
01:05:26.770 --> 01:05:28.050
<v Speaker 4>And so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

1372
01:05:28.051 --> 01:05:28.531
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1373
01:05:28.531 --> 01:05:30.690
<v Speaker 4>I feel bad for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then when I saw that they had raised</v>

1374
01:05:30.691 --> 01:05:32.370
<v Speaker 4>150,000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that blew me away.</v>

1375
01:05:32.371 --> 01:05:33.204
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is why it happened to the kid and </v>

1376
01:05:34.711 --> 01:05:37.560
<v Speaker 4>the kid can't get in anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no news.</v>

1377
01:05:37.561 --> 01:05:40.800
<v Speaker 4>It's just Mr Riley is a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did.</v>

1378
01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:43.140
<v Speaker 4>They did actually expel the kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did.</v>

1379
01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well the PR,</v>

1380
01:05:45.170 --> 01:05:46.003
<v Speaker 4>they're transferring to a different </v>
<v Speaker 4>school to try and cut down on the drama </v>

1381
01:05:49.201 --> 01:05:49.921
<v Speaker 4>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1382
01:05:49.921 --> 01:05:52.080
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing is popping off five,</v>

1383

<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

1387
01:05:59.810 --> 01:06:02.790
<v Speaker 4>You know how to really think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just you can punch me in the phase right</v>

1388
01:06:02.791 --> 01:06:05.940

<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

1389
01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.930
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if people will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1390
01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:11.820
<v Speaker 4>we got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got to help out at a step up for Tom.</v>

1391
01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:14.020
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen a teacher had a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've.</v>

1392
01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:15.821
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

1393
01:06:15.821 --> 01:06:18.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one time I had saw a teacher.</v>

1394
01:06:18.401 --> 01:06:19.800
<v Speaker 2>CIOCCA kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1395
01:06:19.801 --> 01:06:21.250
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pine.</v>

1396
01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:22.373
<v Speaker 2>It was a nice private school I went to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in kindergarten and this kid </v>

1397
01:06:25.691 --> 01:06:27.910
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't stop eating roly polies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1398
01:06:27.911 --> 01:06:30.080
<v Speaker 2>those little bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1399
01:06:30.550 --> 01:06:35.060
<v Speaker 2>I think her name was ms dot darlene </v>
<v Speaker 2>choked him once in a while.</v>

1400
01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:38.560
<v Speaker 2>It was wildly throw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a 1980.</v>

1401
01:06:39.810 --> 01:06:40.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was it.</v>

1402
01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:44.080
<v Speaker 2>I've now I'm just remembering this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she choked him and he turned red.</v>

1403
01:06:44.110 --> 01:06:45.320
<v Speaker 2>I remember how she,</v>

1404
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:47.590
<v Speaker 4>that'll teach you not to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rolling,</v>

1405
01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:52.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was having flashbacks now to have.</v>

1406
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:57.560
<v Speaker 4>We had a principal and he wasn't fired </v>
<v Speaker 4>for this and I found it quite traumatic.</v>

1407
01:06:57.620 --> 01:07:01.160
<v Speaker 4>There was this girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was just seemed fine,</v>

1408
01:07:01.161 --> 01:07:05.810
<v Speaker 4>but she was really anti authority and </v>
<v Speaker 4>this was like in fifth grade and he came</v>

1409
01:07:05.811 --> 01:07:09.200
<v Speaker 4>into the class and he whispered </v>
<v Speaker 4>something to her like,</v>

1410
01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:10.063
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need you to come into that office and </v>

1411
01:07:11.121 --> 01:07:12.530
<v Speaker 4>we're all watching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like a whole scene.</v>

1412
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:13.341
<v Speaker 4>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1413
01:07:13.341 --> 01:07:16.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm not getting up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he grabs her arm and he yanks are so</v>

1414
01:07:16.851 --> 01:07:17.684
<v Speaker 4>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That desk falls over and he drank and </v>

1415
01:07:20.330 --> 01:07:22.820
<v Speaker 4>she drags her by the arm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What age?</v>

1416
01:07:23.330 --> 01:07:27.580
<v Speaker 4>We weren't fifth grade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what the fuck dude?</v>

1417
01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:30.680
<v Speaker 4>And he wasn't fired for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They thought that was all good.</v>

1418
01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:34.270
<v Speaker 4>That's different time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His name was Mr Monday mine,</v>

1419
01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:37.020
<v Speaker 4>which makes sense because everybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking hates Monday.</v>

1420
01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:38.920
<v Speaker 4>We hated that guy.</v>

1421
01:07:43.570 --> 01:07:45.060
<v Speaker 2>I remembered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

1422
01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:45.953
<v Speaker 10>I remember hearing up things.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I never saw a teacher really do </v>

1423
01:07:49.531 --> 01:07:53.990
<v Speaker 10>something that crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but I do remember seeing we have trouble</v>

1424
01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:54.853
<v Speaker 10>like a troublemaker kid and in high </v>
<v Speaker 10>school and he was fucking off and like </v>

1425
01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:00.493
<v Speaker 10>one of the administration people came in</v>
<v Speaker 10>the room and a big guy and the way that </v>

1426
01:08:06.871 --> 01:08:09.540
<v Speaker 10>he yelled at this kid who was already a </v>
<v Speaker 10>bad kid,</v>

1427
01:08:09.541 --> 01:08:11.850
<v Speaker 10>we were all like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>holy shit man.</v>

1428
01:08:11.851 --> 01:08:14.030
<v Speaker 10>I feel like I turned like just.</v>
<v Speaker 10>He goes,</v>

1429
01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:16.250
<v Speaker 10>you're never gonna amount to shit.</v>

1430
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:17.770
<v Speaker 3>You're nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>

1431
01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:20.420
<v Speaker 3>nobody lectured them like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it just got really aggressive.</v>

1432
01:08:20.421 --> 01:08:21.254
<v Speaker 3>We were all like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck to hear an adult yell at a kid who </v>

1433
01:08:25.501 --> 01:08:26.334
<v Speaker 3>is already problematic and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to amount to shit and </v>

1434
01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:31.410
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we were like,</v>

1435
01:08:32.750 --> 01:08:33.670
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was way.</v>

1436
01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:34.543
<v Speaker 3>It was more brutal than I'm think seeing</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody get hit just because he just </v>

1437
01:08:38.090 --> 01:08:39.680
<v Speaker 3>tore him down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1438
01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:41.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is I actually,</v>

1439
01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:45.350
<v Speaker 3>now that I'm a little more mature and </v>
<v Speaker 3>having a baby soon,</v>

1440
01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:50.980
<v Speaker 3>I understand that kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these kids are already kind of like a.</v>

1441
01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:55.580
<v Speaker 3>They came up in a bad place that's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up,</v>

1442
01:08:55.581 --> 01:08:57.880
<v Speaker 3>so they are blameless in in a sense that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he likes.</v>

1443
01:08:57.890 --> 01:09:00.530
<v Speaker 3>He got it right with this guy too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so fucked up.</v>

1444
01:09:00.850 --> 01:09:04.370
<v Speaker 3>Kid was a piece that you followed him </v>
<v Speaker 3>since and while that was happening,</v>

1445
01:09:04.371 --> 01:09:05.070
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna,</v>

1446
01:09:05.070 --> 01:09:06.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if he's right now.</v>

1447
01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:08.570
<v Speaker 3>So follow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a piece of shit.</v>

1448
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:10.760
<v Speaker 3>It didn't go well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't turn out well.</v>

1449
01:09:10.830 --> 01:09:12.920
<v Speaker 3>The question is would he be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he didn't get that,</v>

1450
01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:15.370
<v Speaker 3>maybe he was destined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was.</v>

1451
01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:16.223
<v Speaker 3>It was going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was always going to be rough for him </v>

1452
01:09:17.610 --> 01:09:18.230
<v Speaker 3>and it ended up</v>

1453
01:09:18.230 --> 01:09:20.030
<v Speaker 2>being pretty rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So true man.</v>

1454
01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:21.590
<v Speaker 2>All those kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up with two,</v>

1455
01:09:21.591 --> 01:09:22.424
<v Speaker 2>there was one kid that used to flip his </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyelids and right on his arm and </v>

1456
01:09:25.041 --> 01:09:28.910
<v Speaker 2>permanent marker and he was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>hyperactive and crazy like he grew up to</v>

1457
01:09:28.911 --> 01:09:32.710
<v Speaker 2>be a drug dealer and you can lose her to</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of know when they're losers.</v>

1458
01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:35.150
<v Speaker 2>Kids even I can tell a preschool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dropped my kid off,</v>

1459
01:09:35.151 --> 01:09:36.470
<v Speaker 2>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my kid's a fucking loser.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1461
01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:41.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Problem is they have shitty parents.</v>

1462
01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:42.980
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the kid.</v>

1463
01:09:43.690 --> 01:09:44.523
<v Speaker 2>It's a shitty parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to pay attention to those </v>

1464
01:09:45.891 --> 01:09:46.500
<v Speaker 2>parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You still,</v>

01:09:47.721 --> 01:09:48.554
<v Speaker 2>You'll start to key on it more now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you do like go to a park or </v>

1467
01:09:51.441 --> 01:09:54.320
<v Speaker 2>something and you look at the adult and </v>

<v Speaker 2>whole new world,</v>

<v Speaker 2>my mistake,</v>

<v Speaker 2>turns out it's just like a fucking </v>

1476
01:10:14.661 --> 01:10:15.494
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you work in an office and </v>

<v Speaker 2>you're like 90 percent of these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>suck it really hard and maybe there's </v>

<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1489
01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:45.973
<v Speaker 3>And it feels like so unique and special </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you realize that everybody's </v>

<v Speaker 3>My mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd say a lot of people are like that </v>

1497
01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:07.550
<v Speaker 3>and they just treat it like no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it just really,</v>

1498
01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:10.250
<v Speaker 3>I think mean Ila got so lucky in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>timing of it.</v>

1499
01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:13.700
<v Speaker 3>We've got everything in the right place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see if I,</v>

1500
01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:16.140
<v Speaker 3>if I had a baby when I was 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that baby be fucked.</v>

1501
01:11:16.141 --> 01:11:19.860
<v Speaker 3>So I think about that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That baby would be fucked.</v>

1502
01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:20.843

<v Speaker 3>I'd be fucked.</v>

1505
01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:28.253

<v Speaker 3>old son right now.</v>

1512
01:11:40.890 --> 01:11:41.723

01:11:43.771 --> 01:11:44.550
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1519
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:04.710
<v Speaker 3>protection.</v>

1526
01:12:22.510 --> 01:12:26.700
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a firm number.</v>

1527
01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:27.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

1529
01:12:29.521 --> 01:12:30.840
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can ballpark it.</v>

1530
01:12:30.841 --> 01:12:32.450
<v Speaker 3>Here's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that high.</v>

1531
01:12:32.490 --> 01:12:34.320
<v Speaker 3>What it is is this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the truth.</v>

1532
01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:37.770
<v Speaker 3>I W I didn't have many relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's like.</v>

1533
01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:40.020
<v Speaker 3>I'll think of the numbers and I'll be </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1534
01:12:40.021 --> 01:12:40.950
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that high,</v>

1535
01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.480
<v Speaker 3>and then as I'm counting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1536
01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:43.373
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was that beach week where I met </v>

1537
01:12:45.301 --> 01:12:46.134
<v Speaker 3>that chick so well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't even tell what race she was </v>

1538
01:12:48.850 --> 01:12:51.330
<v Speaker 3>like before I became monogamous with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Isla.</v>

1539
01:12:51.570 --> 01:12:52.403
<v Speaker 3>I did all this and I have like a from </v>
<v Speaker 3>rough estimate in my head and obviously </v>

1540
01:12:57.031 --> 01:13:01.950
<v Speaker 3>that accountant has not given up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm around 10.</v>

1541
01:13:05.050 --> 01:13:07.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm not much more high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Higher above that.</v>

1542
01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:12.720
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you just guess that is where I</v>
<v Speaker 3>know I'm saying changes every five years</v>

1543
01:13:13.710 --> 01:13:16.820
<v Speaker 3>when I asked how I'm out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

1544
01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:18.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

1545
01:13:18.450 --> 01:13:18.850
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

1546
01:13:18.850 --> 01:13:19.480
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

1547
01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:20.820
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's.</v>

1548
01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:21.773
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's somewhere between 14 and </v>

1549
01:13:24.211 --> 01:13:25.920
<v Speaker 3>19.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1550
01:13:25.921 --> 01:13:27.410
<v Speaker 3>That's a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1551
01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:28.253
<v Speaker 3>I guess you do have some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are some weekends in college and </v>

1552
01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:35.250
<v Speaker 3>my cognitive thing is there are some you</v>
<v Speaker 3>forget for sure there are.</v>

1553
01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:36.650
<v Speaker 3>How are you forgetting who you are?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jacket,</v>

1554
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:40.830
<v Speaker 3>hooking up with people you're in </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationships with and I didn't want to.</v>

1555
01:13:40.831 --> 01:13:42.540
<v Speaker 3>I wanted it to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's up bitch?</v>

1556
01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:44.730
<v Speaker 3>Just take her back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

1557
01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:45.733
<v Speaker 3>But I already crunched the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really thought about it one day and I </v>

1558
01:13:49.621 --> 01:13:50.490
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

1559
01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:51.333
<v Speaker 3>there was no.</v>

1560
01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:58.220
<v Speaker 3>They were all almost all bad by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like random hooking up was always</v>

1561
01:13:58.591 --> 01:14:00.240
<v Speaker 3>just so fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't.</v>

1562
01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:05.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm not built for dating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a monogamous all the way.</v>

1563
01:14:06.230 --> 01:14:09.510
<v Speaker 3>I could not survive in today's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>disposable human.</v>

1564
01:14:09.511 --> 01:14:11.470
<v Speaker 3>Like swiping left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We actually,</v>

1565
01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.600
<v Speaker 3>we can make a loop there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we could probably figure it out.</v>

1566
01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:16.340
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So done.</v>

1567
01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:19.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1568
01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:22.000
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we can.</v>

1569
01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:24.400
<v Speaker 3>I think I really do think it's like 15 </v>
<v Speaker 3>or something,</v>

1570
01:14:24.670 --> 01:14:28.020
<v Speaker 3>but I just haven't really hammered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing crazy man.</v>

1571
01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:30.430
<v Speaker 3>50 pluses.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's very small.</v>

1574
01:14:33.701 --> 01:14:36.250
<v Speaker 3>Very small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like less than five.</v>

1575
01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:37.293
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Rusty and ashy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I will give you credit for this.</v>

<v Speaker 3>But looking back I think a lot of like </v>

1596
01:15:45.131 --> 01:15:47.550
<v Speaker 3>the one night stands I had was just like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1597
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:49.143
<v Speaker 3>you know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that I was always looking for </v>

1598
01:15:51.941 --> 01:15:56.941
<v Speaker 3>monogamy but it was always just almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a confidence thing.</v>

1599
01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:01.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm secure and you just want to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel desirable.</v>

1600
01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:04.360
<v Speaker 3>This is why we are fucking one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm exactly the same.</v>

1601
01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:05.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1602
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:07.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was the same way,</v>

1603
01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:13.110
<v Speaker 3>I was looking for a relationship and </v>
<v Speaker 3>lack the confidence to insecure and then</v>

1604
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:14.531
<v Speaker 3>I would just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1605
01:16:14.531 --> 01:16:17.200
<v Speaker 3>do that and then half the time I swear </v>
<v Speaker 3>to you,</v>

1606
01:16:17.201 --> 01:16:18.034
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd think I was the guy that was like </v>

1607
01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:21.940
<v Speaker 3>hooking up later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1608
01:16:21.941 --> 01:16:23.920
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing later?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the girl would be like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I want to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm cute.</v>

1657
01:18:36.930 --> 01:18:38.420
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we?</v>

1658
01:18:38.421 --> 01:18:41.450
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now we're waiting.</v>

1659
01:18:43.610 --> 01:18:44.990
<v Speaker 2>So how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I look?</v>

1660
01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:54.060
<v Speaker 2>How do you show them that you love?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's your coffee in the morning?</v>

1661
01:19:01.290 --> 01:19:02.123
<v Speaker 2>I'm defending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wants me to coffee and that's very </v>

1662
01:19:04.131 --> 01:19:06.260
<v Speaker 2>sweet always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But sometimes I go downstairs,</v>

1663
01:19:06.261 --> 01:19:08.000
<v Speaker 2>I make it and I'm bringing it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1664
01:19:08.001 --> 01:19:09.920
<v Speaker 2>I want to clarify that you're not doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this everyday.</v>

1665
01:19:09.921 --> 01:19:10.754
<v Speaker 2>Isla isn't going down to cooking </v>
<v Speaker 2>breakfast and like taking care of </v>

1666
01:19:12.530 --> 01:19:15.050
<v Speaker 2>sometimes and sometimes it's me by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1667
01:19:15.051 --> 01:19:15.884
<v Speaker 2>I just want to make this picture clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes he'll surprise me with coffee </v>

1668
01:19:20.481 --> 01:19:22.120
<v Speaker 2>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's very sweet.</v>

1669
01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:25.160
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when she used to do that.</v>

1670
01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:31.310
<v Speaker 2>She didn't say it was good before we had</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second baby.</v>

1671
01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:32.233
<v Speaker 2>I was bringing you coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I got to run down to that </v>

1672
01:19:34.491 --> 01:19:35.890
<v Speaker 2>second baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you look Super Fox.</v>

1673
01:19:35.891 --> 01:19:38.900
<v Speaker 2>Who was like my glasses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mom eyes.</v>

1674
01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:41.870
<v Speaker 2>I like it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is great.</v>

1675
01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:42.943
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like the Valentine's Day </v>

1676
01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:49.860
<v Speaker 2>episodes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have to say Tom's been doing.</v>

1677
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:56.090
<v Speaker 2>He will make marital love and then he'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>

1678
01:19:56.091 --> 01:19:58.930
<v Speaker 2>I didn't fart that whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You usually drink sex?</v>

1679
01:19:58.970 --> 01:19:59.840
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never do,</v>

1680
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:04.310
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying sometimes I look for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit of approval for doing that.</v>

1681
01:20:04.311 --> 01:20:05.144
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you realize that I had to Fart the </v>

1682
01:20:06.021 --> 01:20:07.690
<v Speaker 2>whole time and I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1683
01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 2>not</v>

1684
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.340
<v Speaker 3>right away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a few minutes later.</v>

1685
01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:10.993
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I would fart what I feel </v>

1686
01:20:15.301 --> 01:20:16.134
<v Speaker 3>like I would because I have a personal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a principle that I will never hold </v>

1687
01:20:21.421 --> 01:20:23.490
<v Speaker 3>a car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will never hold a fart.</v>

1688
01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:25.113
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you said you like you didn't even </v>

1689
01:20:25.951 --> 01:20:28.640
<v Speaker 3>know I was starting there and no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't noticed too far.</v>

1690
01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:30.570
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember specific times,</v>

1691
01:20:30.571 --> 01:20:33.090
<v Speaker 3>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I on principle do not hold farson.</v>

1692
01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:36.520
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a good move to hold them in</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably during sex.</v>

1693
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:38.490
<v Speaker 3>So you think you would just let it go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1694
01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:40.770
<v Speaker 3>really think she'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

1695
01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:42.030
<v Speaker 3>maybe let's take a break.</v>

<v Speaker 3>so far pay.</v>

1697
01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:49.620
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even a sex break for a second.</v>

1698
01:20:49.621 --> 01:20:51.060
<v Speaker 3>And she'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's air this thing out.</v>

1699
01:20:51.061 --> 01:20:52.550
<v Speaker 3>Let's pick this up next week.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying that I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I generally am not.</v>

1703
01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:06.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm against holding cards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I choose my principle in life.</v>

1704
01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:11.900
<v Speaker 3>One of my guiding principles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>timelines it when I buy him stuff.</v>

1705
01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:13.590
<v Speaker 3>You like presence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1711
01:21:25.201 --> 01:21:27.270
<v Speaker 3>guess that is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're kind of saying like,</v>

1712
01:21:27.271 --> 01:21:30.560

<v Speaker 3>everyone watching.</v>

1715

<v Speaker 3>If you're with your significant other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see what they do for you when they're </v>

<v Speaker 3>greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1724
01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:00.173
<v Speaker 3>I love so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being in a good monogamous relationship </v>

1725
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:05.550
<v Speaker 3>is the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

1726
01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:08.400
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to funk.</v>

1727
01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:12.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was obviously single before that and I</v>

1728
01:22:12.811 --> 01:22:14.300
<v Speaker 3>don't think it was for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1729
01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:15.830
<v Speaker 3>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think um,</v>

1730
01:22:16.590 --> 01:22:17.423
<v Speaker 3>but I feel much more grounded and normal</v>
<v Speaker 3>and everything in a committed </v>

1731
01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:26.040
<v Speaker 3>relationship literally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even more so with babies and stuff.</v>

1732
01:22:26.130 --> 01:22:29.430
<v Speaker 3>I was going to say that actually it </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't until we had children.</v>

1733
01:22:29.431 --> 01:22:31.520
<v Speaker 3>I think that you really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1734
01:22:31.710 --> 01:22:35.890
<v Speaker 3>I just see you really happy now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Alice,</v>

1735
01:22:36.090 --> 01:22:38.680
<v Speaker 3>our son is almost three years old and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1736
01:22:38.850 --> 01:22:41.430
<v Speaker 3>they play together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the cutest thing ever.</v>

1737
01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:43.260
<v Speaker 3>It's really nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really fun.</v>

1738
01:22:43.470 --> 01:22:44.590
<v Speaker 3>It's really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1739
01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:47.003
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is dance has stopped futzing with </v>

1740
01:22:49.801 --> 01:22:50.910
<v Speaker 3>your mic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It keeps going.</v>

1741
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.340
<v Speaker 3>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you.</v>

1742
01:22:53.341 --> 01:22:58.341
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden my grandma bought some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

1743
01:23:00.130 --> 01:23:01.020
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the best.</v>

1744
01:23:01.021 --> 01:23:03.520
<v Speaker 3>Monogamy is the best thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remembered the cricket.</v>

1745
01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:05.740
<v Speaker 3>Cricket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1746
01:23:05.770 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 3>Let's</v>

1747
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:10.980
<v Speaker 10>let people know.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So a cricket obviously is,</v>

1748
01:23:12.010 --> 01:23:16.780
<v Speaker 10>it's cold as Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's so fucking mean to drop.</v>

1749
01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:17.890
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1750
01:23:17.890 --> 01:23:20.210
<v Speaker 10>it's funny among friends but I'm saying </v>
<v Speaker 10>in real life to do,</v>

1751
01:23:20.330 --> 01:23:21.190
<v Speaker 10>to do quick,</v>
<v Speaker 10>they'll do that.</v>

1752
01:23:21.191 --> 01:23:22.570
<v Speaker 10>Like on,</v>
<v Speaker 10>on radio,</v>

1753
01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:24.010
<v Speaker 10>somebody bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1754
01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:24.873
<v Speaker 10>like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that's like that's me reeling in that </v>

1755
01:23:27.731 --> 01:23:29.320
<v Speaker 10>moment that,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that feel bad.</v>

1756
01:23:29.410 --> 01:23:30.610
<v Speaker 10>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It feels bad,</v>

1757
01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:31.630
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>
<v Speaker 10>The universal.</v>

1758
01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:32.800
<v Speaker 10>Your bombing.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

1759
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:37.950
<v Speaker 10>So I was working at a comedy club and to</v>
<v Speaker 10>be like real clear,</v>

1760
01:23:38.801 --> 01:23:42.040
<v Speaker 10>like the comics are obviously separate </v>
<v Speaker 10>from all staff.</v>

1761
01:23:42.370 --> 01:23:43.203
<v Speaker 10>Like there's no such thing really as </v>
<v Speaker 10>staff unless there's a long history </v>

1762
01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:49.863
<v Speaker 10>getting in on the joking right.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And there was this guy and he wasn't </v>

1763
01:23:54.250 --> 01:23:55.083
<v Speaker 10>very good and he was trying to stand up </v>
<v Speaker 10>definitely later than he should have </v>

1764
01:23:59.141 --> 01:24:01.690
<v Speaker 10>been trying,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but he started at like,</v>

1765
01:24:03.870 --> 01:24:04.703
<v Speaker 10>I know he,</v>
<v Speaker 10>he started at like in like he was a </v>

1766
01:24:06.821 --> 01:24:08.710
<v Speaker 10>corporate guy,</v>
<v Speaker 10>let me talk in like a suit,</v>

1767
01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:09.880
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and he's,</v>

1768
01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:10.713
<v Speaker 10>and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and he's,</v>

1769
01:24:11.050 --> 01:24:12.460
<v Speaker 10>he's all of a sudden gets this thing I </v>
<v Speaker 10>want to do,</v>

1770
01:24:12.461 --> 01:24:16.120
<v Speaker 10>stand up and he works out a deal where </v>
<v Speaker 10>like these clubs,</v>

1771
01:24:16.150 --> 01:24:16.983
<v Speaker 10>he would do provide some service like on</v>
<v Speaker 10>the business side and then they would </v>

1772
01:24:20.531 --> 01:24:22.420
<v Speaker 10>let him host shows.</v>

1773
01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:24.160
<v Speaker 10>It was a bad deal for both.</v>

1774
01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:27.750
<v Speaker 3>So that's almost a betrayal to him </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you cut,</v>

1775
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.220
<v Speaker 3>earned that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1776
01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:29.830
<v Speaker 3>Doom.</v>

1777
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:30.663
<v Speaker 10>That was really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 10>He was taking spots from like working </v>

1778
01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:33.310
<v Speaker 10>comics.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It was weird.</v>

1779
01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:37.840
<v Speaker 10>So I do a weekend where he is hosting </v>
<v Speaker 10>the show and he's,</v>

1780
01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:39.880
<v Speaker 10>I mean you look,</v>
<v Speaker 10>he's not the worst but he's just not.</v>

1781
01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:40.783
<v Speaker 10>It's not good and you can tell it's </v>
<v Speaker 10>probably isn't going to pan out and the </v>

1782
01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:45.693
<v Speaker 10>the Dj,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the sound guy from the Dj booth during </v>

1783
01:24:49.691 --> 01:24:53.740
<v Speaker 10>this guy set in front of a packed house,</v>

1784
01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:58.710
<v Speaker 3>the guy would hit a joke and the Dj </v>
<v Speaker 3>would play crickets and I was,</v>

1785
01:24:58.711 --> 01:25:02.660
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my brain loaded.</v>

1786
01:25:02.670 --> 01:25:04.170
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

1787
01:25:04.290 --> 01:25:05.123
<v Speaker 3>Because it was so cruel and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also like kind of ballsy like the </v>

1788
01:25:09.001 --> 01:25:12.360
<v Speaker 3>guy in a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't deserve that he deserved being</v>

1789
01:25:12.361 --> 01:25:13.194
<v Speaker 3>fucked with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like the whole thing is burned into </v>

1790
01:25:15.901 --> 01:25:18.800
<v Speaker 3>my memory because I also felt for him </v>
<v Speaker 3>onstage.</v>

1791
01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:21.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that to him,</v>

1792
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:23.460
<v Speaker 3>but that's how much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

1793
01:25:23.461 --> 01:25:25.290
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck you man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

1794
01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:26.133
<v Speaker 3>he snapped back and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember I was sitting in the </v>

1795
01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:29.323
<v Speaker 3>bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1796
01:25:29.670 --> 01:25:31.370
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen the fence.</v>

1797
01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:34.950
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen the guy be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck this comment.</v>

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:22.120
<v Speaker 2>We to ask the nurse to come out and help</v>
<v Speaker 2>us in the hospital.</v>

1872
01:29:22.121 --> 01:29:22.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hi.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you've been giving.</v>

1875
01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:29.273
<v Speaker 2>You gave birth 24,</v>
<v Speaker 2>48 hours before and now you've got this </v>

1876
01:29:31.811 --> 01:29:33.340
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we did shifts.</v>

1877
01:29:33.610 --> 01:29:34.443
<v Speaker 2>It's so terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember we were watching a star wars </v>

1878
01:29:37.031 --> 01:29:37.660
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>

1879
01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:38.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we,</v>

1880
01:29:38.561 --> 01:29:39.394
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like six days later and we were </v>

1881
01:29:42.071 --> 01:29:44.530
<v Speaker 3>15 minutes into the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would walk.</v>

1882
01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:45.413
<v Speaker 3>Then you'd think I'm gonna wash it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've watched like a minute you're </v>

1883
01:29:46.661 --> 01:29:47.161
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1884
01:29:47.161 --> 01:29:47.994
<v Speaker 3>you just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you'd wake up because the baby </v>

1885
01:29:49.811 --> 01:29:51.030
<v Speaker 3>woke up and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1886
01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:52.660
<v Speaker 3>it'd be like 3:30</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she'd be like,</v>

1887
01:29:52.661 --> 01:29:53.494
<v Speaker 3>go to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd go to bed and she'd be on the </v>

1888
01:29:54.570 --> 01:29:55.403
<v Speaker 3>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were you guys just like off during that </v>

1889
01:29:57.641 --> 01:29:58.474
<v Speaker 3>time?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was kind of great because it was </v>

1890
01:30:00.491 --> 01:30:01.360
<v Speaker 3>December.</v>

1891
01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:03.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>near December 14th.</v>

1892
01:30:03.331 --> 01:30:05.450
<v Speaker 2>I came to Ellis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was right before the holidays.</v>

1893
01:30:05.451 --> 01:30:06.860
<v Speaker 2>So it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was your birthday you though.</v>

1894
01:30:06.930 --> 01:30:08.380
<v Speaker 2>It was a nice number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twelve is mine,</v>

1895
01:30:08.381 --> 01:30:09.810
<v Speaker 2>but cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1896
01:30:09.970 --> 01:30:10.803
<v Speaker 2>but you're going to have a summer baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of even better because </v>

1897
01:30:12.511 --> 01:30:13.344
<v Speaker 2>you're not in the cold and flu season.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They read you the don't take the baby </v>

1898
01:30:15.961 --> 01:30:16.794
<v Speaker 2>end of the mall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna catch this airborne diseases </v>

1899
01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:21.570
<v Speaker 2>and that's nice because in the summer </v>
<v Speaker 2>the days are longer so it's.</v>

1900
01:30:21.690 --> 01:30:23.950
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be easier for you guys.</v>

1901
01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:25.950
<v Speaker 2>We're going to take like two weeks off </v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1902
01:30:25.951 --> 01:30:27.830
<v Speaker 2>I think it will take longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just hope so.</v>

1903
01:30:28.570 --> 01:30:29.470
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

<v Speaker 10>I mean it was like one of those like ocd</v>

1952
01:32:14.321 --> 01:32:16.390
<v Speaker 10>kind of things where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>did I,</v>

1953
01:32:16.391 --> 01:32:18.370
<v Speaker 10>did I lock the door?</v>
<v Speaker 10>And I locked the door.</v>

1954
01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:19.510
<v Speaker 10>Like it was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I just,</v>

1955
01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:20.111
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I was like,</v>

1956
01:32:20.111 --> 01:32:20.680
<v Speaker 10>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 10>he's all right.</v>

1957
01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:23.110
<v Speaker 10>I just had to double check even though,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know.</v>

1958
01:32:23.790 --> 01:32:24.280
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 10>yeah.</v>

1959
01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:25.870
<v Speaker 4>Pull over real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1960
01:32:26.130 --> 01:32:27.040
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a thing.</v>

1961
01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:30.640
<v Speaker 4>So you spend the night in the hospital </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a day or two.</v>

1962
01:32:30.690 --> 01:32:33.870
<v Speaker 2>So it depends on the delivery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have an easy peasy,</v>

1963
01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:36.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever delivery,</v>

1964
01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:37.673
<v Speaker 2>delivery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>delivery it comes out if a blaster your </v>

1965
01:32:39.301 --> 01:32:41.250
<v Speaker 2>vehicle and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

1966
01:32:41.251 --> 01:32:42.084
<v Speaker 2>and there's no complications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can be out of the hospital within </v>

1967
01:32:44.041 --> 01:32:45.450
<v Speaker 2>like 48 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1968
01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:46.673
<v Speaker 2>If you have a c section,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might keep you there from like </v>

1969
01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:49.980
<v Speaker 2>three to five days from what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

1970
01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.330
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a lot.</v>

1971
01:32:51.390 --> 01:32:53.300
<v Speaker 2>They monitor you because they want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure,</v>

1972
01:32:53.310 --> 01:32:55.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no internal bleeding or problems</v>

1973
01:32:55.501 --> 01:32:58.410
<v Speaker 2>with you and the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just depends on how easy it is.</v>

1974
01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:03.900
<v Speaker 2>Pretty incredible how one would just </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to fucking die.</v>

1975
01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:05.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terrifying.</v>

1976
01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:07.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then what happened was women used to</v>

1977
01:33:07.531 --> 01:33:12.531
<v Speaker 2>deliver before the discovery of soap and</v>
<v Speaker 2>washing your hands between delivery.</v>

1978
01:33:12.781 --> 01:33:13.614
<v Speaker 2>Women would die on the birthing table </v>
<v Speaker 2>because physicians didn't know to wash </v>

1979
01:33:16.621 --> 01:33:19.920
<v Speaker 2>their hands going in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you mind if I finger you?</v>

1980
01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:21.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1981
01:33:22.250 --> 01:33:24.240
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine.</v>

1982
01:33:24.241 --> 01:33:24.740
<v Speaker 2>I like him.</v>

1983
01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:27.000
<v Speaker 4>Like now having a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't,</v>

1984
01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:30.010
<v Speaker 4>we don't assume that it's risky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gender or,</v>

1985
01:33:30.050 --> 01:33:31.240
<v Speaker 4>or life threatening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1986
01:33:31.850 --> 01:33:32.540
<v Speaker 4>gender.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1987
01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:36.080
<v Speaker 4>We'd always done it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't ever assume a gender are you?</v>

1988
01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:36.973
<v Speaker 4>I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had an idea for a funny youtube video </v>

1989
01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:40.010
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I'm going to do it,</v>

1990
01:33:40.011 --> 01:33:42.440
<v Speaker 4>but I'm going to tell you guys the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were going to do it.</v>

1991
01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:43.760
<v Speaker 4>You know how people do these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1992
01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:47.300
<v Speaker 4>gender reveals the balloons and pink and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the blue.</v>

1993
01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:51.680
<v Speaker 4>So when we found out the gender,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was going to do a video on our youtube</v>

1994
01:33:51.681 --> 01:33:55.160
<v Speaker 4>channel and the balloons pop and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>white and I look at the camera.</v>

1995
01:33:55.161 --> 01:33:57.310
<v Speaker 4>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How dare you expect me to,</v>

1996
01:33:57.810 --> 01:34:00.350
<v Speaker 4>to assume that gender my baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shame on.</v>

1997
01:34:01.490 --> 01:34:03.460
<v Speaker 4>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it'd be vetoed.</v>

1998
01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:04.850
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't.</v>

1999
01:34:04.850 --> 01:34:05.940
<v Speaker 4>Should I start like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Funny.</v>

2000
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.823
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it's really now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it had been such a great two </v>

2001
01:34:09.551 --> 01:34:11.720
<v Speaker 4>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Little cute little one.</v>

2002
01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:14.490
<v Speaker 4>How dare you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how dare you sick.</v>

2003
01:34:14.550 --> 01:34:16.070
<v Speaker 4>You're the pro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're everything wrong.</v>

2004
01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:17.103
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now are you the kind of people that </v>

2005
01:34:18.110 --> 01:34:21.760
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna wait until you have it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know the gender or do you want to know?</v>

2006
01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:23.080
<v Speaker 2>I always wanted to</v>

2007
01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:26.710
<v Speaker 10>the thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 10>because you see couples in the,</v>

2008
01:34:27.290 --> 01:34:28.123
<v Speaker 10>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

2009
01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:33.160
<v Speaker 10>in the hospital posing with the baby,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I always fantasize that in the room,</v>

2010
01:34:33.711 --> 01:34:34.544
<v Speaker 10>next door was like a black family and </v>
<v Speaker 10>that I was allowed that they would let </v>

2011
01:34:37.521 --> 01:34:38.354
<v Speaker 10>me</v>

2012
01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:41.130
<v Speaker 2>close,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but be like,</v>

2013
01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:46.180
<v Speaker 2>really disappointed dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely somebody else.</v>

2014
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:49.100
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a lactation consultant,</v>

2015
01:34:49.101 --> 01:34:49.934
<v Speaker 2>that's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they come around and make sure </v>

2016
01:34:51.531 --> 01:34:54.860
<v Speaker 2>you're eating well and squeeze and </v>
<v Speaker 2>squeeze those tits.</v>

2017
01:34:56.930 --> 01:34:58.050
<v Speaker 2>Slap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2018
01:34:59.050 --> 01:35:01.340
<v Speaker 3>And she told me that she goes today at a</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty crazy day.</v>

2019
01:35:01.341 --> 01:35:01.881
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened?</v>

2020
01:35:01.881 --> 01:35:04.250
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the baby came out and it wasn't the same</v>

2021
01:35:04.251 --> 01:35:07.850
<v Speaker 3>color as both the parents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

2022
01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:10.160
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they did that.</v>

2023
01:35:10.270 --> 01:35:11.103
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did a paternity test for that in </v>

2024
01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:18.470
<v Speaker 3>our children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They look like you.</v>

2025
01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:23.640
<v Speaker 3>The older boy looks just like you say </v>
<v Speaker 3>you ask for paternity.</v>

2026
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was,</v>

2027
01:35:24.650 --> 01:35:25.483
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy looks just like you don't see </v>

2028
01:35:26.271 --> 01:35:27.104
<v Speaker 3>any me in this system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Since David fucked up things in the </v>

2029
01:35:32.691 --> 01:35:36.850
<v Speaker 3>world though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a woman like raises someone else's dudes</v>

2030
01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:39.790
<v Speaker 3>child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We imagine being like actively less.</v>

2031
01:35:39.791 --> 01:35:44.390
<v Speaker 3>The thing is like for that lady,</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly she was actively probably,</v>

2032
01:35:44.391 --> 01:35:45.630
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to get pregnant.</v>

2033
01:35:45.631 --> 01:35:46.420
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2034
01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:48.680
<v Speaker 3>I'll just hop on one other dixie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens there too?</v>

2035
01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:54.010
<v Speaker 3>That has been cheating like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's got to happen both ways,</v>

2036
01:35:55.370 --> 01:35:58.160
<v Speaker 3>but she had to know that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>chance that was gonna be a black baby.</v>

2037
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:59.780
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please God,</v>

2038
01:35:59.781 --> 01:36:03.470
<v Speaker 3>please don't tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2039
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:05.010
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2040
01:36:05.210 --> 01:36:09.200
<v Speaker 3>The doctor is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got a black baby during delivery.</v>

2041
01:36:09.201 --> 01:36:10.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like everyone's like,</v>

2042
01:36:10.371 --> 01:36:10.911
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2043
01:36:10.911 --> 01:36:12.050
<v Speaker 3>and they're like cheered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they're like,</v>

2044
01:36:12.530 --> 01:36:14.210
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is it so quiet?</v>

2045
01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:19.363
<v Speaker 3>But all the little things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when we had the first ultrasound </v>

2046
01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:21.853
<v Speaker 3>that doctors like we can do screening or</v>
<v Speaker 3>with new invasive testing or we put a </v>

2047
01:36:24.921 --> 01:36:28.340
<v Speaker 3>needle and we squeezed and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

2048
01:36:28.341 --> 01:36:28.830
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

2049
01:36:28.830 --> 01:36:31.700
<v Speaker 3>don't do blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2050
01:36:31.701 --> 01:36:33.080
<v Speaker 3>they can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

2051
01:36:33.970 --> 01:36:35.690
<v Speaker 3>What he said is this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2052
01:36:35.691 --> 01:36:37.010
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would I want to do that?</v>

2053
01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:42.240
<v Speaker 3>The screening is 95 percent certain and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then I guess the invasive testing is 90.</v>

2054
01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:47.360
<v Speaker 3>Is it certain?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll take the.</v>

2055
01:36:47.450 --> 01:36:48.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's even,</v>

2056
01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:50.300
<v Speaker 3>it's expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's,</v>

2057
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:53.390
<v Speaker 3>there's blood tests now that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>screening is unbelief.</v>

2058
01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:55.770
<v Speaker 3>They could do it within 10 days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't,</v>

2059
01:36:55.820 --> 01:36:56.601
<v Speaker 3>I give,</v>
<v Speaker 3>given that option.</v>

2060
01:36:56.601 --> 01:37:01.130
<v Speaker 3>Was it like ridiculous?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called Tara.</v>

2061
01:37:01.970 --> 01:37:05.270
<v Speaker 3>That's what we had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're on 12 weeks or 14 weeks.</v>

2062
01:37:05.271 --> 01:37:06.104
<v Speaker 3>They do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they take like 15 vials of blood can </v>

2063
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:10.160
<v Speaker 3>tell you everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2064
01:37:10.250 --> 01:37:14.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm to color their pubes are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this basement,</v>

2065
01:37:14.710 --> 01:37:17.760

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2071
01:37:26.361 --> 01:37:27.194

<v Speaker 3>genetic markers for anything that you </v>

2072
01:37:30.471 --> 01:37:32.150
<v Speaker 3>would worry about.</v>

01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:41.533
<v Speaker 3>like we'll tell them this is like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>major genetic defect because like </v>

2077

<v Speaker 3>it's too weird.</v>

2085
01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:03.390
<v Speaker 3>He tells me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

2086
01:38:03.730 --> 01:38:06.990
<v Speaker 3>That is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the thing is he's got a big ear lobe.</v>

2087
01:38:06.991 --> 01:38:08.430
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you flush that out?</v>

2088
01:38:08.490 --> 01:38:10.800
<v Speaker 3>That we'll start over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want.</v>

2089
01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:11.693
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how some people are color the </v>

2090
01:38:13.291 --> 01:38:15.630
<v Speaker 3>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brown Brown.</v>

2091
01:38:15.631 --> 01:38:20.631
<v Speaker 3>Like my shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when I Shit actually what's working</v>

2092
01:38:20.830 --> 01:38:25.710
<v Speaker 3>the most likely have blue eyed babies </v>
<v Speaker 3>because Eli has blue eyes and my dad has</v>

2093
01:38:25.711 --> 01:38:27.990
<v Speaker 3>blue eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't that mean 75 percent.</v>

2094
01:38:28.170 --> 01:38:30.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget how that shit works.</v>

2095
01:38:30.130 --> 01:38:34.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm alerted in 10th grade because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pool is recessive,</v>

2096
01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:39.390
<v Speaker 3>but it's so dominant because the brown </v>
<v Speaker 3>always wins out.</v>

2097
01:38:39.391 --> 01:38:40.890
<v Speaker 3>But there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

2098
01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:43.020
<v Speaker 3>If she has blue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blue,</v>

2099
01:38:43.021 --> 01:38:43.471
<v Speaker 3>blue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blue,</v>

2100
01:38:43.471 --> 01:38:44.610
<v Speaker 3>blue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and her line,</v>

2101
01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:45.823
<v Speaker 3>then that becomes dominant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm assuming your dad didn't have blue </v>

2102
01:38:48.241 --> 01:38:50.190
<v Speaker 3>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had like Hazel Brown,</v>

2103
01:38:51.630 --> 01:38:52.463
<v Speaker 3>Hazel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that blue light angels have blue </v>

2104
01:38:54.781 --> 01:38:57.540
<v Speaker 3>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know that blue angels,</v>

2105
01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:02.970
<v Speaker 3>blue angels had fluid like a tough biker</v>
<v Speaker 3>gang eyes.</v>

2106
01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:07.500
<v Speaker 3>You guys want to rob this place?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me see your eyes.</v>

2107
01:39:08.270 --> 01:39:10.530
<v Speaker 3>Your doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You trust your doctor and stuff.</v>

2108
01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:13.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know.</v>

2109
01:39:14.010 --> 01:39:16.260
<v Speaker 3>It's like a new dog there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He seemed cool,</v>

2110
01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:20.430
<v Speaker 3>some cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't have a background with him.</v>

2111
01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:22.910
<v Speaker 3>Kaiser.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2112
01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:26.340
<v Speaker 3>He seemed nice though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got,</v>

2113
01:39:26.341 --> 01:39:28.190
<v Speaker 3>he had a nice little joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

2114
01:39:28.191 --> 01:39:29.024
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing this for 12 years and </v>

2115
01:39:31.081 --> 01:39:33.240
<v Speaker 3>you could trust me when I say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are pregnant.</v>

2116
01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:36.240
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2117
01:39:36.290 --> 01:39:37.123
<v Speaker 3>if you don't like him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely now's the time to judge </v>

2118
01:39:39.870 --> 01:39:42.840
<v Speaker 3>because he's going to be with you at one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the craziest moments of your life.</v>

2119
01:39:42.850 --> 01:39:45.690
<v Speaker 3>But if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who does the delivery part?</v>

2120
01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:46.753
<v Speaker 3>Your ob really generally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there is a possibility that your ob </v>

2121
01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:53.313
<v Speaker 3>would not be an extensible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most likely they'll know what </v>

2122
01:39:57.541 --> 01:39:58.780
<v Speaker 3>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2123
01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:04.820
<v Speaker 3>I figure but he will have the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a front row seat to the front row seat.</v>

2124
01:40:09.090 --> 01:40:11.970
<v Speaker 3>Did you don't see that deal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the everything.</v>

2125
01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:13.813
<v Speaker 3>I mean the like the act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the badge blessed when the grenade went </v>

2126
01:40:17.281 --> 01:40:21.690
<v Speaker 3>off and watching that exact moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like I watched that thing,</v>

2127
01:40:22.140 --> 01:40:22.973
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched the air pump into it and I </v>

2128
01:40:24.241 --> 01:40:28.380
<v Speaker 3>watched it swell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like air pumping because when you start,</v>

2129
01:40:28.381 --> 01:40:32.100
<v Speaker 3>when the baby starts coming out right </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

2130
01:40:32.101 --> 01:40:32.934
<v Speaker 3>you see pressure forming down there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you see after a while you just see </v>

2131
01:40:36.091 --> 01:40:38.250
<v Speaker 3>hair coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the scalp,</v>

2132
01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:41.820
<v Speaker 3>like the babies and then you see it push</v>
<v Speaker 3>through a little more.</v>

2133
01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:43.793
<v Speaker 3>Feel that there's pressure there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a giant balloon is going like </v>

2134
01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:51.540
<v Speaker 3>up and then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like this about to pop.</v>

2135
01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:54.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to see the pop was</v>

2136
01:40:54.180 --> 01:40:55.750
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2137
01:40:55.810 --> 01:40:56.643
<v Speaker 2>not really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is a lot of moments where it </v>

2138
01:40:58.271 --> 01:41:03.271
<v Speaker 2>finally clears and like all the fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so let me,</v>

2139
01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:04.633
<v Speaker 2>let me pay you your by her side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fire head and then you would like </v>

2140
01:41:07.601 --> 01:41:09.200
<v Speaker 2>peek,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how does it feel like.</v>

2141
01:41:09.570 --> 01:41:11.350
<v Speaker 2>So if a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her head's here.</v>

2142
01:41:11.410 --> 01:41:13.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one leg.</v>

2143
01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:15.100
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this mic arm is her leg.</v>

2144
01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:20.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm holding the leg here and I got her </v>
<v Speaker 2>foot here in this elbow and leaning back</v>

2145
01:41:21.251 --> 01:41:22.690
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can take a peek.</v>

2146
01:41:22.930 --> 01:41:24.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you go like that and you're like,</v>

2147
01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:25.490
<v Speaker 2>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's good.</v>

2148
01:41:27.010 --> 01:41:28.540
<v Speaker 2>You don't feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have an epidural,</v>

2149
01:41:28.570 --> 01:41:31.390
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you do,</v>

2150
01:41:31.391 --> 01:41:33.640
<v Speaker 2>don't look at my face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the doctor,</v>

2151
01:41:34.650 --> 01:41:35.483
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can like handfuls of Lube and he's </v>

2152
01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:40.660
<v Speaker 2>like losing the baby up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2153
01:41:40.661 --> 01:41:42.010
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's lubing the rim,</v>

2154
01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:44.920
<v Speaker 2>like these luminous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes and he's like,</v>

2155
01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:46.040
<v Speaker 2>oh my goodness.</v>

2156
01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:49.960
<v Speaker 2>I felt like he would push it around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>baby's hat making,</v>

2157
01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:50.853
<v Speaker 2>try to get the hell out so that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also just like stretching it cut my </v>

2158
01:41:55.161 --> 01:41:59.530
<v Speaker 2>badge because it was just so snotty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I have so many questions.</v>

2159
01:41:59.830 --> 01:42:00.663
<v Speaker 2>What do you remember from that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that I got to get some of this </v>

2160
01:42:05.771 --> 01:42:08.420
<v Speaker 2>to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took out a bunch of great.</v>

2161
01:42:09.970 --> 01:42:14.440
<v Speaker 2>Tom had like this whole deal and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot going on that you don't remember.</v>

2162
01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:16.750
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like lots of pushing.</v>

2163
01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:18.850
<v Speaker 2>I remember everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not out of it.</v>

2164
01:42:18.851 --> 01:42:20.710
<v Speaker 2>You're not mentally out of it with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>epidural.</v>

2165
01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:23.880
<v Speaker 2>You're just physically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>physically you're late.</v>

2166
01:42:24.010 --> 01:42:24.843
<v Speaker 2>Can't move your legs and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they put your legs in stirrups when </v>

2167
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:30.330
<v Speaker 2>go time now remember everything you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushed.</v>

2168
01:42:30.370 --> 01:42:32.960
<v Speaker 2>You pushed and lots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they,</v>

2169
01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:36.300
<v Speaker 2>they like to wait until you're at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right at the head.</v>

2170
01:42:36.310 --> 01:42:36.820
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2171
01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:38.560
<v Speaker 2>right at the very end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2172
01:42:38.770 --> 01:42:40.480
<v Speaker 2>And you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you push like you're shitting.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm constipated or it's like a good shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>just keeps coming out.</v>

2174
01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:45.590
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No it,</v>

2175
01:42:45.690 --> 01:42:47.560
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels like a shit that won't come out</v>

2176
01:42:47.561 --> 01:42:48.394
<v Speaker 2>and then all of a sudden like you feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>the head like he's talking about that </v>

2205
01:44:13.191 --> 01:44:16.970

2278
01:47:31.340 --> 01:47:32.173
<v Speaker 3>don't think people would ever guess some</v>
<v Speaker 3>entertainer or a comedian because I </v>

2279
01:47:35.221 --> 01:47:40.221
<v Speaker 3>think I'm really very introverted out in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

2280
01:47:41.210 --> 01:47:42.043
<v Speaker 3>It might not guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all you gotta do is have the guy </v>

<v Speaker 2>we went to Sweden.</v>

2344
01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:14.940
<v Speaker 2>We don't know him personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was like,</v>

2345

<v Speaker 2>they're a friend of a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long have you guys fucked?</v>

<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

2347
01:50:21.231 --> 01:50:22.100
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have kids,</v>

2348
01:50:22.980 --> 01:50:24.740
<v Speaker 2>but at any rate I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2349
01:50:24.741 --> 01:50:25.720
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about you.</v>

2350
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:29.090
<v Speaker 2>I didn't take it seriously in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>

2351
01:50:29.091 --> 01:50:29.924
<v Speaker 2>You'll never have like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard anyone be like I have </v>

2352
01:50:32.330 --> 01:50:33.163
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>because like honestly I don't really </v>

2353
01:50:34.521 --> 01:50:36.310
<v Speaker 2>like them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

2354
01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:38.640
<v Speaker 2>Burke told you this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was great.</v>

2355
01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:42.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will say if you enjoy having a dog and</v>

2356
01:50:42.231 --> 01:50:46.310
<v Speaker 2>I know that a dog and a child is not the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same kind of similar.</v>

2357
01:50:46.340 --> 01:50:49.070
<v Speaker 2>Similar why I'm so excited because </v>
<v Speaker 2>shredder,</v>

2358
01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:52.670
<v Speaker 2>like I have so much love for him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like I see him as a person.</v>

2359
01:50:52.910 --> 01:50:55.650
<v Speaker 2>He's like the heart and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I'm so excited.</v>

2360
01:50:55.870 --> 01:50:56.703
<v Speaker 2>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We also weren't thinking like what was </v>

2361
01:50:58.191 --> 01:50:59.024
<v Speaker 2>my life before I read it now it's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>about all you want to walk in all day </v>

2362
01:51:03.170 --> 01:51:06.710
<v Speaker 2>and that's why I just love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been thinking so much about what it</v>

2363
01:51:06.711 --> 01:51:08.990
<v Speaker 2>is to be apparent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird.</v>

2364
01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:12.050
<v Speaker 2>It's really such an important kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>rite of passage as a person,</v>

2365
01:51:12.051 --> 01:51:12.884
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have to think about who you </v>

2366
01:51:14.661 --> 01:51:17.300
<v Speaker 2>are as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that who you want this person to be,</v>

2367
01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:19.370
<v Speaker 2>what kind of person do you want to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>for them,</v>

2368
01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:20.293
<v Speaker 10>and the other thing on top of everything</v>
<v Speaker 10>you're saying is you do have those </v>

2369
01:51:23.061 --> 01:51:23.894
<v Speaker 10>moments where you really start thinking </v>
<v Speaker 10>about your parents in a different </v>

2370
01:51:26.901 --> 01:51:28.370
<v Speaker 10>capacity because you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>oh,</v>

2371
01:51:28.371 --> 01:51:31.080
<v Speaker 10>they did all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And then you realize like,</v>

2372
01:51:31.330 --> 01:51:32.163
<v Speaker 10>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think you got a lot of forgiveness </v>

2373
01:51:33.321 --> 01:51:34.154
<v Speaker 10>because you go like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>they were just trying to get you this </v>

2374
01:51:35.870 --> 01:51:36.703
<v Speaker 10>chair,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

2375
01:51:36.830 --> 01:51:38.420
<v Speaker 10>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 10>whatever they messed up,</v>

2376
01:51:38.450 --> 01:51:39.530
<v Speaker 10>they didn't try to mess it up.</v>

2377
01:51:39.690 --> 01:51:41.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you realize how shitty your parents</v>

2378
01:51:41.500 --> 01:51:45.690
<v Speaker 2>were saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2379
01:51:45.691 --> 01:51:46.524
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean they really dropped the ball </v>

2380
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:50.180
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2381
01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:51.033
<v Speaker 2>that can happen too if they really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is really amazing how much of a </v>

2382
01:51:56.081 --> 01:51:56.914
<v Speaker 2>life change it seems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That will be the biggest thing is I </v>

2383
01:52:00.161 --> 01:52:03.940
<v Speaker 2>think that sense of responsibility of </v>
<v Speaker 2>caring for another human being.</v>

2384
01:52:03.941 --> 01:52:07.490
<v Speaker 2>It's transformative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you until I,</v>

2385
01:52:07.491 --> 01:52:08.324
<v Speaker 2>at least until I went through it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't feel like a real adult until </v>

2386
01:52:11.310 --> 01:52:14.230
<v Speaker 2>you're your everyday you wake up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're alive.</v>

2387
01:52:14.231 --> 01:52:16.390
<v Speaker 2>That little dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those two dudes were alive,</v>

2388
01:52:16.391 --> 01:52:17.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's levels to this shit.</v>

2389
01:52:18.450 --> 01:52:20.180
<v Speaker 2>He don't say shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2390
01:52:20.190 --> 01:52:21.330
<v Speaker 10>dog is like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

2391
01:52:21.570 --> 01:52:24.390
<v Speaker 10>there's like getting a job.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Do you remember like when you,</v>

2392
01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:25.313
<v Speaker 10>I don't know what if you,</v>
<v Speaker 10>when you remember getting like a </v>

2393
01:52:26.431 --> 01:52:28.650
<v Speaker 10>retirement account,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you have a retirement account.</v>

2394
01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:31.800
<v Speaker 10>It feels like an adult thing.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Buying a house is like the big thing.</v>

2395
01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:32.993
<v Speaker 10>You feel like an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but nothing ever feels as big as being </v>

2396
01:52:36.271 --> 01:52:41.010
<v Speaker 10>like I have a kid who I'm responsible </v>
<v Speaker 10>for everything.</v>

2397
01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:43.860
<v Speaker 10>That is the most adult move ever.</v>
<v Speaker 10>For sure.</v>

2398
01:52:44.070 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 10>Why is it human nature is so fucked up</v>

2399
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:47.930
<v Speaker 2>because you're supposed to have a kid at</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 16,</v>

2400
01:52:47.931 --> 01:52:49.010
<v Speaker 2>17,</v>
<v Speaker 2>18,</v>

2401
01:52:49.730 --> 01:52:53.030
<v Speaker 2>and then if I had a kid at that age I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would fucking ruin that kid's life.</v>

2402
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:56.690
<v Speaker 2>But now I feel like we're in a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>place in our thirties,</v>

2403
01:52:56.720 --> 01:52:57.553
<v Speaker 2>early thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in nature that's kind of like a </v>

2404
01:53:01.110 --> 01:53:01.943
<v Speaker 2>death wish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Delicate at that age you're going to </v>

2405

<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

2430
01:54:06.091 --> 01:54:06.924
<v Speaker 2>that's not really the way to parent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They soak everything because you're so </v>

2431
01:54:10.591 --> 01:54:12.240
<v Speaker 2>triggered up and you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know.</v>

2432
01:54:12.241 --> 01:54:14.070
<v Speaker 2>You don't have that experience of life </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be like,</v>

2433
01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:15.060
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just a trigger.</v>

2434
01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:17.130
<v Speaker 2>This is a childhood thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a thing.</v>

2435
01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:19.740
<v Speaker 2>This isn't about him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is about what happened back here.</v>

2436
01:54:20.490 --> 01:54:24.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of your past and your present</v>

2437
01:54:24.211 --> 01:54:25.320
<v Speaker 2>and everything merges.</v>

2438
01:54:27.990 --> 01:54:28.823
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had been thinking a lot about that </v>

2439
01:54:29.221 --> 01:54:30.054
<v Speaker 2>stuff since I started therapy because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all about like your family and </v>

2440
01:54:33.050 --> 01:54:36.480
<v Speaker 2>asked and big time and I stuff I never </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought about before.</v>

2441
01:54:36.481 --> 01:54:39.360
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you seem happier.</v>

2442
01:54:39.361 --> 01:54:40.194
<v Speaker 2>I think you've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel better or a little more </v>

2443
01:54:42.451 --> 01:54:44.400
<v Speaker 2>relief?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or has it started yet?</v>

2444
01:54:44.650 --> 01:54:46.100
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I've been doing.</v>

2445
01:54:46.130 --> 01:54:50.990
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing as much as I can kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to deal with the depression.</v>

2446
01:54:51.390 --> 01:54:52.223
<v Speaker 4>I started taking antidepressants about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't said that publicly because </v>

2447
01:54:55.041 --> 01:54:58.430
<v Speaker 4>that's kind of waiting to see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

2448
01:54:58.431 --> 01:54:59.264
<v Speaker 4>I did want to talk about it publicly </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I think it's important for </v>

2449
01:55:01.071 --> 01:55:05.270
<v Speaker 4>people to know what it is because I had </v>
<v Speaker 4>such a huge misconception of what it is,</v>

2450
01:55:06.290 --> 01:55:07.123
<v Speaker 4>but I think I've been on it for like two</v>
<v Speaker 4>months now and it definitely helps a </v>

2451
01:55:10.761 --> 01:55:11.840
<v Speaker 4>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

2452
01:55:12.340 --> 01:55:13.173
<v Speaker 4>Like it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's great that you made a decision to </v>

2453
01:55:16.371 --> 01:55:21.371
<v Speaker 4>do that and that it's working well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kinda hit a wall where I was like,</v>

2454
01:55:21.731 --> 01:55:24.740
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything other than this.</v>

2455
01:55:25.370 --> 01:55:28.070
<v Speaker 4>I was putting off it for so long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then I was just like,</v>

2456
01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:31.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything other than whatever this is now</v>

2457
01:55:32.090 --> 01:55:33.710
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but actually it's not,</v>

2458
01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:36.680
<v Speaker 4>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really quite subtle.</v>

2459
01:55:37.700 --> 01:55:39.750
<v Speaker 4>The first two weeks is really tough </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you've,</v>

2460
01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:42.890
<v Speaker 4>you feel it and it's confusing and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know what you're.</v>

2461
01:55:43.470 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

2462
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:44.843
<v Speaker 2>you feel the side effects a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can have a headache and you cannot </v>

2463
01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:49.170
<v Speaker 2>sleep well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you.</v>

2464
01:55:49.260 --> 01:55:51.780
<v Speaker 2>My thing was I was feeling like foggy in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brain.</v>

2465
01:55:51.781 --> 01:55:52.614
<v Speaker 2>That was super frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like the first couple of weeks on </v>

2466
01:55:54.911 --> 01:55:55.744
<v Speaker 2>the medication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starting the meds and then what it kind </v>

2467
01:55:57.781 --> 01:55:59.040
<v Speaker 2>of just evens out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2468
01:55:59.041 --> 01:56:01.330
<v Speaker 2>And then I started to feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you okay?</v>

2469
01:56:01.331 --> 01:56:02.164
<v Speaker 2>Are you on a time crunch?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys got to bounce and go somewhere </v>

2470
01:56:09.090 --> 01:56:12.060

2471
01:56:12.061 --> 01:56:15.600
<v Speaker 2>It's been such a fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a real great moment to bring.</v>

2472
01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:17.160
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>this has been a long.</v>

2474
01:56:20.210 --> 01:56:23.760
<v Speaker 2>That's where will see we could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't this.</v>

2475
01:56:23.770 --> 01:56:25.470
<v Speaker 2>We could have kept talking for over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2476

<v Speaker 2>we definitely could have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you guys are mommies and daddies as </v>

<v Speaker 2>worked well for you.</v>

2480
01:56:35.010 --> 01:56:37.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still miserable.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And I said it's an the other day.</v>

<v Speaker 2>light at the end of the tunnel.</v>

2484
01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:46.060
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all it needs to be.</v>

2485
01:56:46.070 --> 01:56:46.903

<v Speaker 2>way out of it and don't be one of these </v>
