123
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

124
00:04:40.691 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

125
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.870
<v Speaker 2>I realized we've been podcasting for </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the same really because you,</v>

126
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.843
<v Speaker 2>this is what episode is the [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 2>70 [inaudible] 71 71 I think I'm up to </v>

127
00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:50.200
<v Speaker 2>74.</v>

128
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.830
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been like three weeks or three week</v>

129
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.800
<v Speaker 2>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious,</v>

130
00:04:53.801 --> 00:04:57.220
<v Speaker 2>how is podcasting like affected your </v>
<v Speaker 2>stand up in a way?</v>

131
00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.990
<v Speaker 2>Kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been really,</v>

132
00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:02.740
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been really interesting because I,</v>

133
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

134
00:05:03.601 --> 00:05:06.310
<v Speaker 2>I started a podcast after I had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>following.</v>

135
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.881
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

136
00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:09.040
<v Speaker 2>And what would you guys did too?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

137
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

138
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.840
<v Speaker 2>and I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was like,</v>

139
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:14.733
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to do this and see how </v>

140
00:05:17.531 --> 00:05:19.060
<v Speaker 2>long it lasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

141
00:05:19.061 --> 00:05:20.200
<v Speaker 2>everyone's got a part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like,</v>

142
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.153
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really found out through other </v>

143
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:24.730
<v Speaker 2>comedians that if you don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast and you already have a fan base,</v>

144
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.870
<v Speaker 2>you're leaving money on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So beyond that,</v>

145
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:29.704
<v Speaker 2>it's just a great way to connect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I didn't think of it that way until </v>

146
00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:34.390
<v Speaker 2>I started doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

147
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

148
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.573
<v Speaker 2>I wanna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanna make money more money and fuck </v>

149
00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:38.560
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

150
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.880
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

151
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.010
<v Speaker 2>and then I realized once I started doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

152
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.390
<v Speaker 2>how much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

153
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a much smaller way,</v>

154
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.650
<v Speaker 2>for me at least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

155
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a TV,</v>

156
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.440
<v Speaker 2>like the TV show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the when,</v>

157
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.450
<v Speaker 2>when people are watching a TV show and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

158
00:05:55.451 --> 00:05:56.284
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to wait til next week to watch </v>

159
00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>the next TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we,</v>

160
00:05:58.161 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people binge watch now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I was a kid,</v>

161
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:01.334
<v Speaker 2>that's how people used to watch TV and </v>
<v Speaker 2>now people feel connected and they wait </v>

162
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:04.670
<v Speaker 2>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

163
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 2>they feel like they know me more and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they do because,</v>

164
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:09.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

165
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.041
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

166
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 2>me or a version of me on that comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the comedy podcasts.</v>

167
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

168
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

169
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.230
<v Speaker 2>it really like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes them feel like they know you.</v>

170
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:21.040
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of a double edge sword.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you like it,</v>

171
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.890
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

172
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.210
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

173
00:06:24.211 --> 00:06:24.800
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

174
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.633
<v Speaker 2>it as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I might have my opener when he says </v>

175
00:06:29.331 --> 00:06:30.420
<v Speaker 2>you guys listened to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>congratulations before it brings me up.</v>

177
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.433
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chairs are just gotten bigger and </v>

178
00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:35.680
<v Speaker 2>bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger throughout the whole,</v>

179
00:06:35.681 --> 00:06:36.590
<v Speaker 2>throughout the past year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

180
00:06:36.591 --> 00:06:37.870
<v Speaker 2>It's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really crazy.</v>

181
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.850
<v Speaker 2>Your podcast is different than ours and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're just,</v>

182
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.250
<v Speaker 2>it's you and you're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

183
00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:44.084
<v Speaker 2>how was that experience from going from </v>
<v Speaker 2>standup to just like talking into a </v>

184
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:49.820
<v Speaker 2>camera and nobody's there cause you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows you act a lot,</v>

185
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:50.683
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But was that a different skill to learn </v>

186
00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:53.870
<v Speaker 2>or did it kind of translate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

187
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.180
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

188
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.063
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like standup in the way that like </v>

189
00:06:58.821 --> 00:06:59.654
<v Speaker 2>stand up to me is a version of making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I'm at a diner with my </v>

190
00:07:04.971 --> 00:07:05.850
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>late night,</v>

191
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm sometimes like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

192
00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:09.850
<v Speaker 2>doing jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

193
00:07:09.851 --> 00:07:10.341
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

194
00:07:10.341 --> 00:07:11.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're always joking around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>messing around,</v>

195
00:07:11.751 --> 00:07:12.584
<v Speaker 2>but like sometimes I'm just fucking with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them and we're just making jokes and </v>

196
00:07:15.111 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 2>we're doing bits or whatever.</v>

197
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.760
<v Speaker 2>I always felt like before I did stand </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

198
00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:20.594
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I could get to be onstage and treat </v>

199
00:07:23.571 --> 00:07:26.000
<v Speaker 2>the audience like they're the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the diner,</v>

200
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.330
<v Speaker 2>then I'll be able to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'll be able to do it because I,</v>

201
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.183
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally would do that every day of </v>

202
00:07:32.751 --> 00:07:33.401
<v Speaker 2>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

203
00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:34.234
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm obsessed with truck trying to maybe </v>

204
00:07:34.891 --> 00:07:35.724
<v Speaker 2>have a laugh and like trying to and </v>
<v Speaker 2>think of what w what do I think is </v>

205
00:07:38.211 --> 00:07:39.410
<v Speaker 2>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's funny about this situation.</v>

206
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:40.543
<v Speaker 2>And so for podcasting it was the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing except that except like when I'm </v>

207
00:07:46.221 --> 00:07:50.660
<v Speaker 2>in my house and I'm with my dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'll catch myself just like talking</v>

208
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:53.300
<v Speaker 2>about things for no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm a fucking insane person.</v>

209
00:07:53.301 --> 00:07:54.590
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm like,</v>

210
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.240
<v Speaker 2>oh well maybe I'll say that on my end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my end,</v>

211
00:07:56.241 --> 00:07:57.740
<v Speaker 2>my show or my act or whatever.</v>

212
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.830
<v Speaker 2>But then when I started to do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts,</v>

213
00:08:00.831 --> 00:08:02.030
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

214
00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:05.210
<v Speaker 2>this is just that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just like me talking out loud in</v>

215
00:08:05.211 --> 00:08:07.670
<v Speaker 2>my house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I kind of do that anyway.</v>

216
00:08:07.671 --> 00:08:10.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't do it for a full hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an insane person,</v>

217
00:08:10.251 --> 00:08:12.140
<v Speaker 2>but like that's how I come up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>material.</v>

218
00:08:12.141 --> 00:08:15.480
<v Speaker 2>I just start like talking to my house </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think all that's funny.</v>

219
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.620
<v Speaker 2>This is material born from your podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

220
00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:21.710
<v Speaker 2>Does it only start and the podcast and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then goes to the day it has for sure.</v>

221
00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:22.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

222
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:23.340
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

223
00:08:23.341 --> 00:08:24.020
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

224
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also helps me like creatively because</v>

225
00:08:26.751 --> 00:08:28.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't like sit down and like right at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the computer,</v>

226
00:08:28.671 --> 00:08:30.050
<v Speaker 2>my act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like,</v>

227
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

228
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:32.983
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when you do your act as it very </v>

229
00:08:35.391 --> 00:08:36.224
<v Speaker 2>much rehearsed for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go up with an idea that I have and </v>

230
00:08:39.771 --> 00:08:39.890
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

231
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.660
<v Speaker 2>When you do man on fire,</v>

233
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.903
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the act that I've been kind of </v>

234
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:46.241
<v Speaker 2>honing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:53.501
<v Speaker 2>But all of those bits came from and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me going on stage thinking like,</v>

238
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.620
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny when guys work out,</v>

239
00:08:55.621 --> 00:08:57.420
<v Speaker 2>I'll go on stage and start talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

240
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.690
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a wild way to approach it.</v>

241
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:02.190
<v Speaker 2>To kind of just go up there and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

242
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:03.280
<v Speaker 2>let's see what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

243
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

244
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:08.430
<v Speaker 2>I think though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like so much of it is about,</v>

245
00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:09.691
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I say,</v>

246
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:12.810
<v Speaker 2>if I go back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back to like being in a diner with</v>

247
00:09:12.811 --> 00:09:14.640
<v Speaker 2>my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so comfortable with them,</v>

248
00:09:14.641 --> 00:09:16.560
<v Speaker 2>they're my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>

249
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:17.463
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think through years and years of </v>

250
00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:23.280
<v Speaker 2>practicing through thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of shows,</v>

251
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.133
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm able to get into that headspace on </v>

252
00:09:25.551 --> 00:09:25.970
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>

253
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.000
<v Speaker 2>Do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

254
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:29.100
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I love it.</v>

255
00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:30.140
<v Speaker 2>I love doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

256
00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an old saying like,</v>

257
00:09:32.851 --> 00:09:35.150
<v Speaker 2>it's not what you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's how you say it or,</v>

258
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:35.761
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

259
00:09:35.761 --> 00:09:36.300
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

260
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.060
<v Speaker 2>I think it is if you're that confident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

261
00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:41.730
<v Speaker 2>like there's guys who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my buddy Brian calendar,</v>

262
00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:42.564
<v Speaker 2>it goes on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He talks about horse shit for an hour </v>

263
00:09:44.491 --> 00:09:45.510
<v Speaker 2>and it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

264
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.850
<v Speaker 2>And it's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he acts like it is,</v>

265
00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:48.660
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

266
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.820
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

269
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.190

270
00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.490
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a cool way to,</v>

271
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:03.570
<v Speaker 2>to just hone the skill just to get up in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking gauntlet and yeah.</v>

272
00:10:03.571 --> 00:10:05.640
<v Speaker 2>And get it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a onetime dude.</v>

273
00:10:05.641 --> 00:10:07.200
<v Speaker 2>One time I was on a plane.</v>

274
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.320
<v Speaker 2>I shit you not mad if somebody told me </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

275
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.210

<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't believe that,</v>

276
00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:14.730

<v Speaker 2>I know it happened to me.</v>

277
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.940
<v Speaker 2>And it's true because I know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I witnessed it.</v>

278
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.130
<v Speaker 2>This almost sounds like a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

279
00:10:20.131 --> 00:10:23.640
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

280
00:10:23.641 --> 00:10:24.474
<v Speaker 2>is because I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to convince myself it actually </v>

<v Speaker 2>Did you catch a glance in his eyes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

330
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.990

335
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.780
<v Speaker 2>Adam Corolla is so good at that and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was talking about stuff and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>everything already that ever happened.</v>

338
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.110
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you say,</v>

339
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:39.121
<v Speaker 2>if the guy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

340

<v Speaker 2>cute tips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

341
00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:40.301
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

342
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:44.440
<v Speaker 2>thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy's just amazing at it.</v>

343
00:12:44.441 --> 00:12:47.230
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when you're in that comfortable space</v>

344
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.093
<v Speaker 2>where you can just say it like Corolla </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't even need that kid to be sitting </v>

345
00:12:50.771 --> 00:12:51.604
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was interesting if you just </v>

346
00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:54.880
<v Speaker 2>talked for six hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could be like,</v>

347
00:12:54.881 --> 00:12:55.960
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would listen to this.</v>

348
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:58.450
<v Speaker 2>He's a conduit of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always challenge them.</v>

349
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.540
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying I'm as good as that,</v>

350
00:13:01.541 --> 00:13:02.110
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

351
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:02.943
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get into that comfortable space to </v>

352
00:13:04.571 --> 00:13:08.070
<v Speaker 2>where you can just talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what we do as comedians.</v>

353
00:13:08.071 --> 00:13:08.904
<v Speaker 2>So I feel like it was a version of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just had to work through a few </v>

354
00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:13.024
<v Speaker 2>episodes and then I kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think figured it out after like the </v>

355
00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:15.910
<v Speaker 2>third episode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

356
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:16.773
<v Speaker 2>oh I can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really expected to do about three or </v>

357
00:13:17.861 --> 00:13:20.080
<v Speaker 2>four episodes and then just chalk it up </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

358
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:20.740
<v Speaker 2>as a loss.</v>

359
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:24.490
<v Speaker 2>But well guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>check it out like 74 now.</v>

360
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.260
<v Speaker 2>So we'll keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God bless.</v>

361
00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:27.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want,</v>

362
00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:29.980
<v Speaker 2>I know you've probably talked about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many times,</v>

363
00:13:29.981 --> 00:13:34.360
<v Speaker 2>but we've talked about on the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Logan Paul hit me with that Echo.</v>

364
00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.610
<v Speaker 2>Logan Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

365
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.690
<v Speaker 2>We Ms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Logan.</v>

366
00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:39.070
<v Speaker 2>Paul got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me see.</v>

367
00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.600
<v Speaker 2>We got that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

368
00:13:40.601 --> 00:13:42.900
<v Speaker 2>he's something we've talked about a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

369
00:13:42.901 --> 00:13:43.241
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

370
00:13:43.241 --> 00:13:46.600
<v Speaker 2>I saw you got to sell and what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about it and it's like,</v>

371
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:52.320
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that exchange really showed </v>
<v Speaker 2>what a fucking dumb ass he is.</v>

372
00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:59.320
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe even just like how damaged he </v>
<v Speaker 2>is from the whole suicide forest.</v>

373
00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:01.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go over it with,</v>

374
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:01.990
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

375
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:03.100
<v Speaker 2>If you don't mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy to,</v>

376
00:14:03.101 --> 00:14:05.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go over this and I want to get</v>

377
00:14:05.291 --> 00:14:07.360
<v Speaker 2>your thoughts on some of these twitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>exchanges.</v>

378
00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well first of all,</v>

379
00:14:08.831 --> 00:14:12.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious your initial interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

380
00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.220
<v Speaker 2>When he said it's important that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>

381
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:16.210
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not right now.</v>

382
00:14:16.211 --> 00:14:18.490
<v Speaker 2>How did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did Logan Paul come on your radar to</v>

383
00:14:18.491 --> 00:14:22.270
<v Speaker 2>begin with because you are following,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are ready.</v>

384
00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.230
<v Speaker 2>W did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I was fall.</v>

385
00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.290
<v Speaker 2>I may have been following him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think actually I just maybe saw it</v>

386
00:14:29.291 --> 00:14:31.690
<v Speaker 2>because he's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

387
00:14:31.691 --> 00:14:33.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I probably just responded to it.</v>

388
00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.180
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I follow him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

389
00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.220
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

390
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:41.760
<v Speaker 2>so I just write no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't because because of the suicide</v>

391
00:14:42.191 --> 00:14:46.630
<v Speaker 2>forest and how everywhere that will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that will,</v>

392
00:14:46.631 --> 00:14:47.770
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was just bad.</v>

393
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.470
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I just wrote no,</v>

394
00:14:50.471 --> 00:14:53.750
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't because like this fucking shot</v>
<v Speaker 2>him dead body in the forest.</v>

395
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.020
<v Speaker 2>This is important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

396
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.521
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't.</v>

397
00:14:55.521 --> 00:14:56.354
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's less I was trolling them and more </v>

398
00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:59.510
<v Speaker 2>that I was just reacting off of that.</v>

399
00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:00.503
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

400
00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:01.563
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just thought I didn't think </v>

401
00:15:03.561 --> 00:15:04.520
<v Speaker 2>anything of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

402
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:05.931
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

403
00:15:05.931 --> 00:15:07.850
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when he responded,</v>

404
00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:08.684
<v Speaker 2>and let me pull this up actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because this was like damn dog really </v>

405
00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:16.320
<v Speaker 2>fucking tried to make this work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tsunami of fried laughing analogies.</v>

406
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:17.503
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what'd you think when you saw that </v>

407
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:20.263
<v Speaker 2>wave of yellow and blue?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was really confused because I thought </v>

408
00:15:22.701 --> 00:15:23.990
<v Speaker 2>it was a fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

409
00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:28.991
<v Speaker 2>this is not him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I saw the check,</v>

410
00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.490
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

411
00:15:31.491 --> 00:15:36.491
<v Speaker 2>So I guess that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I thought that's so many,</v>

412
00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:41.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>emojis so fucking amused.</v>

413
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:44.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's laughing for a long time.</v>

414
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>

415
00:15:46.491 --> 00:15:47.324
<v Speaker 2>it's not funny anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like after the first two rows </v>

416
00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:50.750
<v Speaker 2>it's getting a little sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

417
00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:51.320
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

418
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.120
<v Speaker 2>After two rows you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh shit man.</v>

419
00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.313
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he's just mentally imbalanced </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's why he thought it was </v>

420
00:15:58.041 --> 00:15:59.330
<v Speaker 2>okay to shoot somebody.</v>

421
00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:00.801
<v Speaker 2>Be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

422
00:16:00.801 --> 00:16:02.000
<v Speaker 2>well at least that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

423
00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:06.650
<v Speaker 2>and then when he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I read it wrong,</v>

424
00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:07.693
<v Speaker 2>I first read it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm laughing because I know why your </v>

425
00:16:09.981 --> 00:16:12.920
<v Speaker 2>comedy career took a dive and not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

426
00:16:12.921 --> 00:16:15.980
<v Speaker 2>I didn't read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm laughing cause now I know why you're</v>

427
00:16:15.981 --> 00:16:19.310
<v Speaker 2>coming here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I thought she knew something I didn't</v>

428
00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:20.660
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

429
00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.900
<v Speaker 2>does this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did I do that I don't know.</v>

430
00:16:23.901 --> 00:16:24.980
<v Speaker 2>That's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

431
00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.100
<v Speaker 2>That's so much about me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm like,</v>

432
00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.400
<v Speaker 2>did I just something like my head is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

433
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.680
<v Speaker 2>because it's such a stupid comment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you almost want to believe that.</v>

434
00:16:33.681 --> 00:16:34.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

435
00:16:34.581 --> 00:16:36.290
<v Speaker 2>does he actually know that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something else,</v>

436
00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:36.751
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

437
00:16:36.751 --> 00:16:37.011
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

438
00:16:37.011 --> 00:16:37.844
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like did he see me literally her first </v>

439
00:16:41.481 --> 00:16:42.440
<v Speaker 2>response then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

440
00:16:42.441 --> 00:16:43.061
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

441
00:16:43.061 --> 00:16:46.580
<v Speaker 2>so not like deserving of anything more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than just,</v>

442
00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

443
00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.150
<v Speaker 2>Or just like at fuck off or whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

444
00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:53.420
<v Speaker 2>But personally like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that response also.</v>

445
00:16:53.421 --> 00:16:56.780
<v Speaker 2>What is it in your response that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

446
00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.080
<v Speaker 2>educated him till now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

447
00:16:59.090 --> 00:16:59.923
<v Speaker 2>like why your comedy career took a dive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there wasn't that much information </v>

448
00:17:03.741 --> 00:17:06.470
<v Speaker 2>encoded in your initial response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

449
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

450
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.033
<v Speaker 2>Now I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I know because I wasn't really </v>

451
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:16.410
<v Speaker 2>trying to make a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just like saying something that's,</v>

452
00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:17.263
<v Speaker 2>I guess like in comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you'd say what he did was </v>

453
00:17:19.161 --> 00:17:20.790
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

454
00:17:20.791 --> 00:17:23.480
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But another thing that's fundamentally,</v>

455
00:17:23.481 --> 00:17:25.550
<v Speaker 2>and I was listening to Bert Kreischer </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about this too.</v>

456
00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:27.770
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

457
00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:32.820
<v Speaker 2>and this sounds defensive and this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>why I have not said this until now in my</v>

458
00:17:33.321 --> 00:17:35.840
<v Speaker 2>comedy career has not taken a dive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

459
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:40.870
<v Speaker 2>Like every year it's been more and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly a wounded child.</v>

460
00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.760
<v Speaker 2>But what Bert was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's right,</v>

461
00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:44.623
<v Speaker 2>there needs to be some kind of truth in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your burn or roast or whatever you want </v>

462
00:17:48.861 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

463
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.660
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

464
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:52.523
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

465
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:53.363
<v Speaker 1>And so I read all that and then I read </v>
<v Speaker 1>it correctly cause like I'm laughing </v>

466
00:17:55.921 --> 00:17:57.910
<v Speaker 1>cause I knew why I now I know why you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming to her.</v>

467
00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:58.561
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

468
00:17:58.561 --> 00:18:00.420
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to act like I was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a joke and whatever.</v>

469
00:18:00.421 --> 00:18:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I kind of,</v>

470
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:06.930
<v Speaker 1>I honestly went right to feeling badly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

471
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.793
<v Speaker 1>Because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well you kind of realize you're </v>

472
00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:13.440
<v Speaker 1>dealing with the child really well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's 24 though.</v>

473
00:18:13.441 --> 00:18:14.274
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But intellectually like how can you </v>

474
00:18:15.841 --> 00:18:18.900
<v Speaker 1>write that and not have the intellect of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a much younger person?</v>

475
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:22.500
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even further than that,</v>

476
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.800
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>

477
00:18:25.801 --> 00:18:30.801
<v Speaker 1>like if you're going to write to </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody who I write to people,</v>

478
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.270
<v Speaker 1>oh dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is fun for me.</v>

479
00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.213
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to fucking clap back and shit </v>

480
00:18:35.941 --> 00:18:37.200
<v Speaker 1>like that to me.</v>

481
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm bored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people are like,</v>

482
00:18:38.551 --> 00:18:40.530
<v Speaker 1>what do you take it personally?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

483
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.720
<v Speaker 1>it's just fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like doing it.</v>

484
00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:44.243
<v Speaker 1>My whole thing is if you say something </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me and you got your 14 followers and </v>

485
00:18:47.011 --> 00:18:48.540

<v Speaker 1>I want to imagine the look on your face </v>

487
00:18:51.931 --> 00:18:53.030
<v Speaker 1>when I read the heat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Load it up,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I love that philosophy.</v>

490
00:18:58.501 --> 00:18:59.334
<v Speaker 1>So fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't appreciate the shit that </v>

491
00:19:02.161 --> 00:19:03.660
<v Speaker 1>you get when you're online.</v>

493
00:19:07.621 --> 00:19:08.710
<v Speaker 1>then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm mad at you.</v>

494
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Like you should have known better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>to put them on blast.</v>

495
00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

497
00:19:14.991 --> 00:19:16.530
<v Speaker 1>but this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

498
00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.320
<v Speaker 1>oh hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the internet.</v>

499
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.190
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the fucking Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you sign up for twitter,</v>

500
00:19:23.191 --> 00:19:24.024
<v Speaker 1>isn't that what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you dream happen that somebody who </v>

501
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.720
<v Speaker 1>gives you attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's why you're here.</v>

502
00:19:28.721 --> 00:19:30.180
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would just browse twitter.</v>

503
00:19:30.181 --> 00:19:31.350
<v Speaker 1>You don't even need an account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

504
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.480
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

505
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.340
<v Speaker 1>so then I kind of felt bad cause I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

506
00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:36.174
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>

507
00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:40.110
<v Speaker 1>I knew exactly what to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

508
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say what I said.</v>

509
00:19:42.511 --> 00:19:43.231
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cozy.</v>

510
00:19:43.231 --> 00:19:45.060
<v Speaker 1>He basically say yo for a coat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

511
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:46.050
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I should,</v>

512
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:48.290
<v Speaker 1>maybe I should leave it alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

513
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:52.170
<v Speaker 1>I can't leave it alone because he kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of took it to the next level.</v>

514
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:54.210
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if there was one row of class.</v>

515
00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:58.050
<v Speaker 1>But then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

516
00:19:58.051 --> 00:19:59.160
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to do it.</v>

517
00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:00.840
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

518
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.580
<v Speaker 1>that's what you write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well here,</v>

519
00:20:02.581 --> 00:20:06.570
<v Speaker 1>let's have a look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least in my career dies.</v>

520
00:20:06.571 --> 00:20:09.810
<v Speaker 1>You can film it and put it on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

521
00:20:09.811 --> 00:20:11.470
<v Speaker 1>When you quote tweet him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't even see.</v>

522
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.260
<v Speaker 1>I actually thought maybe that's why he </v>
<v Speaker 1>did that.</v>

523
00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:16.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

524
00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:18.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

525
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.540
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't see the response or tweeted</v>
<v Speaker 1>how fucking great.</v>

526
00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was such a slam dunk.</v>

527
00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

528
00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:28.810
<v Speaker 1>and look at the likes and likes on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

529
00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not everyone just started.</v>

530
00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.440
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he should have been like,</v>

531
00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well played.</v>

532
00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:39.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go on a shoot day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now he should have known.</v>

533
00:20:39.811 --> 00:20:41.520
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say something like that.</v>

534
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.080
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's the other thing too,</v>

535
00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:45.593
<v Speaker 1>like if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing to somebody who's going to </v>

536
00:20:49.511 --> 00:20:52.060
<v Speaker 1>write back to you who does this for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>

537
00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

538
00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:54.130
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

539
00:20:54.131 --> 00:20:55.900
<v Speaker 1>you're not doing it to Jerry Seinfeld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be like,</v>

540
00:20:55.901 --> 00:20:56.740
<v Speaker 1>who's that kid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

541
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.900
<v Speaker 1>pairs to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to come right back to you</v>

542
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.670
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what I do.</v>

543
00:21:03.671 --> 00:21:04.900
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

544
00:21:04.901 --> 00:21:06.550
<v Speaker 1>I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what's next?</v>

545
00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:09.310
<v Speaker 1>And then he just kept going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not going to lie.</v>

546
00:21:09.311 --> 00:21:11.680
<v Speaker 1>This single tweet is funnier than your </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire Netflix special,</v>

547
00:21:11.681 --> 00:21:13.510
<v Speaker 1>which actually it has a lot of looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

548
00:21:13.511 --> 00:21:14.344
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

549
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:15.423
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was the last is at least </v>

550
00:21:16.391 --> 00:21:19.300
<v Speaker 1>tactically breaking this down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I were a Dork,</v>

551
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:22.540
<v Speaker 1>technically this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

552
00:21:22.541 --> 00:21:23.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

553
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:24.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

554
00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:27.180
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's falling compared to that.</v>

555
00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.133
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he admits he saw my entire Netflix </v>

556
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.850
<v Speaker 1>special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He must not have hated it at that.</v>

557
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.090
<v Speaker 1>And in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way,</v>

558
00:21:37.091 --> 00:21:39.130
<v Speaker 1>it's really a sincere compliment because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

559
00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:43.210
<v Speaker 1>go your Netflix special enough to watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing and this tweet was he?</v>

560
00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

561
00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:48.580
<v Speaker 1>I love everything you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially they came out 10 months ago.</v>

562
00:21:48.581 --> 00:21:50.650
<v Speaker 1>That was great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now you're even,</v>

<v Speaker 1>because of that,</v>

565

<v Speaker 1>but you can't.</v>

567
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:06.880
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't cause I thought of this and I</v>

<v Speaker 1>the Spiderman in the spiderman where </v>

614

617
00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:33.950
<v Speaker 1>That also is like blaming you for our </v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing with him over at twitter when he</v>

<v Speaker 1>was the one to make it into this whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

619
00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Has this been broken down?</v>

<v Speaker 1>arguing with and the insinuation,</v>

625
00:24:58.670 --> 00:24:59.503
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crux of this is that anybody who </v>

626
00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.010
<v Speaker 1>interacts with the shun vlogger.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Kayden in the worst way.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Let's keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

632
00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:22.883
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ask Your fans to have their moms read </v>

633
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:26.350
<v Speaker 1>out loud to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See what they think.</v>

634
00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:31.400
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to make fun of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>youngest fans were,</v>

635
00:25:31.401 --> 00:25:34.800
<v Speaker 1>but I felt like that because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought up the age too.</v>

636
00:25:34.801 --> 00:25:37.210
<v Speaker 1>It was coming of age.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and I bought it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

638
00:25:38.721 --> 00:25:40.250
<v Speaker 1>this is a good enough to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

639
00:25:40.251 --> 00:25:44.090
<v Speaker 1>this is funny enough to bring that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't want to be like stupid.</v>

640
00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:45.830
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just young.</v>

641
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.811
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

642
00:25:46.811 --> 00:25:47.644
<v Speaker 1>and the truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ever do look up like fan meetup </v>

643
00:25:49.641 --> 00:25:51.230
<v Speaker 1>photos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like yeah,</v>

644
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:52.750

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

645
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Can you guys look a pregnant lady?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>

646
00:25:54.501 --> 00:25:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a fan.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

649
00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:06.920
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

650
00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.230
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this may not be right,</v>

651
00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.150
<v Speaker 1>but I think he wanted to have the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>

652
00:26:11.151 --> 00:26:11.984
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't want me to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I was even old people roasting </v>

653
00:26:17.091 --> 00:26:17.924
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

654
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:19.910
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I actually responded to this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm,</v>

<v Speaker 1>symbol is in this situation.</v>

<v Speaker 1>memories become less depressed.</v>

705
00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.660
<v Speaker 1>As you get older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're 38 to,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

707
00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:17.640
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there might have been in it that</v>

708
00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.100
<v Speaker 1>are just so legendary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

709
00:28:20.101 --> 00:28:21.870
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the best things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you something,</v>

710
00:28:21.871 --> 00:28:22.860
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

711
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.390
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

713
00:28:25.441 --> 00:28:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walked around,</v>

714
00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:28.103
<v Speaker 1>I walked around and people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like I did the fucking tonight </v>

715
00:28:32.221 --> 00:28:36.210
<v Speaker 1>show in 1987.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were like that.</v>

716
00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:44.410
<v Speaker 1>It speaks to how much and how much they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much they cared about that thing you</v>

717
00:28:45.301 --> 00:28:47.580
<v Speaker 1>did in the suicide for us.</v>

<v Speaker 1>somewhat funny,</v>

721
00:28:54.931 --> 00:28:58.500
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't why it got so many retweets.</v>

722
00:28:58.501 --> 00:28:59.334
<v Speaker 1>It got so many retweets because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt emotional about the stuff that he </v>

723
00:29:02.131 --> 00:29:03.390
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the weird shit that you're doing on the </v>

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:50.953
<v Speaker 1>your life would be ruined and it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes one rogue guy with a vpn to be </v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't want you to know and I don't </v>

765
00:31:00.371 --> 00:31:04.540
<v Speaker 1>ever want you to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the power of the vpn at Max.</v>

<v Speaker 1>these other boys from picking up your </v>
<v Speaker 1>skirt without buying you dinner,</v>

<v Speaker 1>If you're in a public space and you're </v>

771
00:31:18.761 --> 00:31:19.594

<v Speaker 1>information and bank statements and all </v>

775
00:31:29.501 --> 00:31:32.560
<v Speaker 1>of your private information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without a VPN,</v>

<v Speaker 1>stealing your data and public spaces.</v>

876
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:38.350

<v Speaker 1>You could buy soda water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

878
00:36:41.281 --> 00:36:43.770
<v Speaker 1>That little flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>

879
00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was,</v>

880
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:47.303
<v Speaker 1>when I came out of everything that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>offered you a sip of Cherry flavored </v>

881
00:36:51.891 --> 00:36:52.471
<v Speaker 1>soda.</v>

882
00:36:52.471 --> 00:36:53.830
<v Speaker 1>What it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's,</v>

883
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:57.090
<v Speaker 1>what is it like French and it's got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>French name,</v>

884
00:36:57.091 --> 00:36:59.100
<v Speaker 1>but I heard that Americans are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

885
00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:01.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom Tell us that.</v>

886
00:37:01.441 --> 00:37:05.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not just saying it's a girl like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the crew or some bullshit.</v>

887
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:05.933
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was getting upset because it was </v>

888
00:37:07.441 --> 00:37:10.290
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are the guys who we named it.</v>

889
00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:13.280
<v Speaker 1>He was saying they want it to be called </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Lacroix,</v>

890
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:15.120
<v Speaker 1>like the French way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's like,</v>

891
00:37:15.121 --> 00:37:16.620
<v Speaker 1>but you guys are not French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

892
00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:19.740
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck is a this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

893
00:37:19.741 --> 00:37:20.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It surprised me.</v>

894
00:37:20.521 --> 00:37:21.354
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

895
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.650
<v Speaker 1>you just to speak French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

896
00:37:22.651 --> 00:37:24.360
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>

897
00:37:24.361 --> 00:37:25.260
<v Speaker 1>I know all about drinks.</v>

898
00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:29.940
<v Speaker 1>I think what they did is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an American brand.</v>

899
00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Kids were not drinking soda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Water was the beverage of,</v>

900
00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.190
<v Speaker 1>of all of your dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always hated it.</v>

901
00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:36.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

902
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:36.833
<v Speaker 1>Me Too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it was a perfect timing of </v>

903
00:37:38.461 --> 00:37:39.294
<v Speaker 1>people being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I don't want to drink 50 grams of </v>

904
00:37:41.041 --> 00:37:41.874
<v Speaker 1>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want something more exciting than </v>

<v Speaker 1>water from the garbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

940
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:59.140

941
00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:04.150
<v Speaker 2>when I cut out soda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like 31 and my mom,</v>

942
00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:05.560
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

943
00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:06.393
<v Speaker 2>I was actually doing some kind of a joke</v>
<v Speaker 2>with my family and I lifted my shirt up </v>

944
00:39:09.011 --> 00:39:12.160
<v Speaker 2>as it afforded the joke and my mom was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

945
00:39:12.161 --> 00:39:13.120
<v Speaker 2>you gained some weight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

946
00:39:13.121 --> 00:39:13.954
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I had been one 75 my whole </v>

947
00:39:14.861 --> 00:39:17.050
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

948
00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:17.970
<v Speaker 2>once 75.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's pretty well,</v>

950
00:39:19.151 --> 00:39:20.110
<v Speaker 2>but this was when I was 31.</v>

951
00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:21.280
<v Speaker 2>And so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I have a scale up there.</v>

953
00:39:22.181 --> 00:39:24.550
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you weigh yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was one 95 and I almost passed out</v>

954
00:39:24.551 --> 00:39:25.390
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

955
00:39:25.391 --> 00:39:27.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm 20 pounds heavier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't check but this long.</v>

956
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:29.440
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm tall.</v>

957
00:39:29.441 --> 00:39:32.130
<v Speaker 2>So like it had been down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

958
00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.870
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I stopped drinking soda.</v>

959
00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:37.330
<v Speaker 2>I started drinking diet at first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

960
00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.790
<v Speaker 2>and I fucking hate diet soda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of you get used to it.</v>

961
00:39:39.791 --> 00:39:42.090
<v Speaker 2>I like it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never got used to tell him.</v>

962
00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:43.790
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

963
00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:44.580
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

964
00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:46.490
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it tastes horrible to be,</v>

965
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.250
<v Speaker 2>at first it tastes like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

966
00:39:48.251 --> 00:39:51.010
<v Speaker 2>poison really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] it is.</v>

967
00:39:51.011 --> 00:39:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I'm presented with the choice of do</v>

968
00:39:54.491 --> 00:39:55.324
<v Speaker 2>I want the original or do I want the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically it's do I want to be fat or </v>

969
00:39:59.621 --> 00:40:01.510
<v Speaker 2>don't want to die of cancer or diabetes </v>
<v Speaker 2>or cancer.</v>

970
00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:04.270
<v Speaker 2>It's literally the what you're choosing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

971
00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:06.080
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

972
00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:07.330
<v Speaker 2>he's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

973
00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:09.330
<v Speaker 2>diabetes never tasted so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

974
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:10.743
<v Speaker 2>at least I'll look good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold life even though it will be </v>

975
00:40:14.921 --> 00:40:16.330
<v Speaker 2>shorter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

976
00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:19.090
<v Speaker 2>and that is basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm ever run for mayor,</v>

977
00:40:19.091 --> 00:40:20.710
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm going to use as my </v>
<v Speaker 2>platform.</v>

978
00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:23.020
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like live a shorter life,</v>

979
00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:23.883
<v Speaker 2>but look good the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as Mary you're plugging in diet </v>

980
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:29.560
<v Speaker 2>beverages if they pay me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

981
00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:31.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

982
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:34.450
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stopped drinking diets.</v>

983
00:40:34.451 --> 00:40:36.850
<v Speaker 2>I was like a fuck this diet.</v>

984
00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

985
00:40:37.901 --> 00:40:40.240
<v Speaker 2>and then I would watch like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary is about how I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

988
00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:51.490
<v Speaker 2>and so I started,</v>

00:41:18.701 --> 00:41:21.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to just drink water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Literally you're all going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might as well have me be your </v>

1052
00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:26.420
<v Speaker 2>maximum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on twitter,</v>

1053
00:43:26.421 --> 00:43:28.670
<v Speaker 2>well clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you got into it with Logan,</v>

1054
00:43:28.671 --> 00:43:31.340
<v Speaker 2>but you're very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a good time on twitter.</v>

1055
00:43:31.341 --> 00:43:35.030
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you have a trend where you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people talk some smack,</v>

1056
00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:36.143
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll retweet them and blast into the </v>

1057
00:43:37.071 --> 00:43:37.904
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1058
00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:42.710
<v Speaker 2>But I'm curious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does twitter comments ever like actually</v>

1059
00:43:42.711 --> 00:43:44.720
<v Speaker 2>get to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because sometimes you know,</v>

1060
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:46.400
<v Speaker 2>and my case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1061
00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:49.100
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you know it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot.</v>

1062
00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:53.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like do they ever make me feel bad?</v>

1063
00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:57.110
<v Speaker 2>Like it's about a performance or a stand</v>
<v Speaker 2>up or whatever.</v>

1064
00:43:57.111 --> 00:43:57.861
<v Speaker 2>Like Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1065
00:43:57.861 --> 00:43:58.694
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like what you did if more than </v>

1066
00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:03.020
<v Speaker 2>if it's a genuine thing and not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1067
00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:05.020
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1068
00:44:05.021 --> 00:44:07.490
<v Speaker 2>you select a piece of shit or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if it's like,</v>

1069
00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:09.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know though.</v>

1070
00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:15.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I can't say it never affects me,</v>

1071
00:44:15.681 --> 00:44:16.410
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1072
00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:18.470
<v Speaker 2>a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like I just,</v>

1073
00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:19.970
<v Speaker 2>I kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet is just like,</v>

1074
00:44:19.971 --> 00:44:20.804
<v Speaker 2>you have to adopt the fact that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just Narnia and it doesn't exist or </v>

1075
00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.820
<v Speaker 2>you're going to go fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1076
00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:28.110
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1077
00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:29.593
<v Speaker 2>and my brother also told me someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a kid when I was coming up when I </v>

1078
00:44:32.731 --> 00:44:34.590
<v Speaker 2>was growing up and he's younger than me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1079
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:35.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1080
00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:38.750
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about girls and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about how I,</v>

1081
00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:42.660
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hated when a girl didn't like me and I</v>

1082
00:44:42.661 --> 00:44:43.380
<v Speaker 2>liked her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1083
00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.150
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why does that bother me so much?</v>

1084
00:44:45.151 --> 00:44:46.130
<v Speaker 2>Not Fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1085
00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:47.020
<v Speaker 2>It sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>

1086
00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:50.520
<v Speaker 2>I like to rejection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1087
00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:52.770
<v Speaker 2>And my brother said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1088
00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:55.770
<v Speaker 2>what do you think everybody's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you?</v>

1089
00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:58.170
<v Speaker 2>And I know that so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so simple.</v>

1090
00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:02.070
<v Speaker 2>But that time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for some reason it clicked like that,</v>

1091
00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:04.770
<v Speaker 2>that isn't possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

1092
00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:06.540
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it made it a lot easier.</v>

1093
00:45:06.541 --> 00:45:09.360
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm telling you that was like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>switch.</v>

1094
00:45:09.361 --> 00:45:11.070
<v Speaker 2>And I know it's so simple and I'm not an</v>
<v Speaker 2>idiot.</v>

1095
00:45:11.071 --> 00:45:13.190
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do that already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1096
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:14.063
<v Speaker 2>Just like it was like a perfect time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect way that he said it and it was </v>

1097
00:45:17.311 --> 00:45:17.891
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1098
00:45:17.891 --> 00:45:18.960
<v Speaker 2>I guess fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1099
00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:20.333
<v Speaker 2>plus stand up when you're onstage </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling 400 people that joke and it </v>

1100
00:45:25.981 --> 00:45:27.090
<v Speaker 2>bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1101
00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:32.120
<v Speaker 2>You tend to learn to not care about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the worst thing bombing on stage</v>

1102
00:45:32.461 --> 00:45:33.294
<v Speaker 2>to this day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you,</v>

1103
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:35.410
<v Speaker 2>does that happen still when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>laying on it?</v>

1104
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:39.520
<v Speaker 2>Once you have any sort of fan base,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1105
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:43.710
<v Speaker 2>it becomes tougher to bomb because </v>
<v Speaker 2>people just going to be a generous,</v>

1106
00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:46.590
<v Speaker 2>more generous and they give you the </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit of the doubt.</v>

1107
00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.550
<v Speaker 2>I always say this though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1108
00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:50.393
<v Speaker 2>you're not truly bombing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A comedian doesn't truly bomb on unless </v>

1109
00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:01.760
<v Speaker 2>the comedian feels bad about bombing </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you're on stage,</v>

1110
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:04.080
<v Speaker 2>it's all about the state of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm bombing,</v>

1111
00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:06.630
<v Speaker 2>like if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people aren't laughing and I'm like,</v>

1112
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.120
<v Speaker 2>I fucking fuck you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

1113
00:46:09.121 --> 00:46:11.400
<v Speaker 2>This is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't feel bad for the guy.</v>

1114
00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:12.151
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1115
00:46:12.151 --> 00:46:14.130
<v Speaker 2>he's just having an off night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I'm on stage,</v>

1116
00:46:14.131 --> 00:46:17.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm bombing and he freaking all African.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>

1117
00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:19.201
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1118
00:46:19.201 --> 00:46:20.034
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1119
00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:20.873
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1120
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.823
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you're like,</v>

1121
00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:23.730
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy.</v>

1122
00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:25.553
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So being on the stage is so much about </v>

1123
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:29.100
<v Speaker 2>that confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I,</v>

1124
00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:30.003
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if we've talked about this </v>

1125
00:46:30.301 --> 00:46:32.520
<v Speaker 2>on air off air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we were talking about it before,</v>

1126
00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 20 minutes ago.</v>

1127
00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:35.633
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1128
00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:36.300
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about,</v>

1129
00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:37.133
<v Speaker 2>it's how you say it is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's still tough though sometimes </v>

1130
00:46:39.181 --> 00:46:40.014
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1131
00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:40.740
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1132
00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:43.530
<v Speaker 2>like if I get heck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get heckled a bunch and if,</v>

1133
00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:44.393
<v Speaker 2>if I get heckled and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I dig a hole because I'm like </v>

1134
00:46:46.651 --> 00:46:49.290
<v Speaker 2>telling some guy off and then I tried to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get back into it.</v>

1135
00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:53.100
<v Speaker 2>It's tougher and snap back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happened the other night actually.</v>

1136
00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:55.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what'd he say?</v>

1137
00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:56.423
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I get sometimes I hate </v>

<v Speaker 1>the real yeezys and those same mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuckers,</v>

1281
00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:18.700
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck would a little tiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

1282
00:53:18.701 --> 00:53:19.534
<v Speaker 1>So they don't get sued and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell them to people like on the Silk </v>

1283
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.450
<v Speaker 1>Road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1284
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 1>So there's in betweens and they sell to </v>
<v Speaker 1>America and they're not</v>

1285
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.020
<v Speaker 2>that cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get those for like 100 bucks.</v>

1286
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:30.600
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much can I ask?</v>

1287
00:53:30.601 --> 00:53:31.980
<v Speaker 2>How many of those shoes you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get?</v>

1288
00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:33.233
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on what the market is like </v>

1289
00:53:34.810 --> 00:53:35.460
<v Speaker 2>what are those run?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1290
00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:36.570
<v Speaker 2>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1291
00:53:36.571 --> 00:53:38.550
<v Speaker 2>so here's the interesting about it sells</v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

1292
00:53:38.551 --> 00:53:39.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you're getting my name out.</v>

1293
00:53:39.991 --> 00:53:41.250
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

1294
00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:45.330
<v Speaker 2>200 or something reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1295
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:49.440
<v Speaker 2>And when they came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they shut up and I want it to get them,</v>

1296
00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:51.180
<v Speaker 2>but they were like 700 bucks and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1297
00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:52.043
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the ham.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went up to a thousand and I was </v>

1298
00:53:54.271 --> 00:53:55.880
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to get them going.</v>

1299
00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:56.753
<v Speaker 2>So I paid for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I paid for him a thousand or a thousand </v>

1300
00:53:59.131 --> 00:54:00.270
<v Speaker 2>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the most,</v>

1301
00:54:00.271 --> 00:54:01.200
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever paid for shoes.</v>

1302
00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:05.250
<v Speaker 2>And then the next like month they </v>
<v Speaker 2>rereleased nother,</v>

1303
00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.650
<v Speaker 2>like 400 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's the game though,</v>

1304
00:54:07.651 --> 00:54:08.950
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did the same.</v>

1305
00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:11.460
<v Speaker 2>Kind of did the same thing with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>supreme bag.</v>

<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

1313
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:30.780

<v Speaker 2>is always wearing Gucci.</v>

1314
00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:34.920

00:55:18.571 --> 00:55:19.404
<v Speaker 2>they're popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a little bit of that in me </v>

1333
00:55:22.171 --> 00:55:25.350
<v Speaker 2>because I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that because when I see a shoe,</v>

1334
00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:26.881
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1335
00:55:26.881 --> 00:55:27.714
<v Speaker 2>that's ugly.</v>

1524
01:03:25.011 --> 01:03:29.540
<v Speaker 2>sold on Kendrick is because he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrap in the voice that he talks,</v>

1525
01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:33.770
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

<v Speaker 2>when we were growing up,</v>

1570
01:05:07.850 --> 01:05:12.080
<v Speaker 2>all we did was bust on each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all we did all day long.</v>

1571
01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:13.820
<v Speaker 2>My Mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

1575
01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:21.370
<v Speaker 1>so when people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

1576

<v Speaker 1>why are you making fun of me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which happens every now and then.</v>

1582
01:05:36.461 --> 01:05:37.294
<v Speaker 1>if you are comfortable enough to be you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the most respect you can give to </v>

<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1744
01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:43.850

<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>

1745

<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take off my pants and I'm putting </v>

1774
01:14:04.621 --> 01:14:06.060
<v Speaker 1>my dick out on the web.</v>

01:14:10.201 --> 01:14:12.030
<v Speaker 1>let the conversation begin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just</v>

1777
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:12.873
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Also.</v>

1779
01:14:14.921 --> 01:14:17.580

<v Speaker 2>Everyone on the Internet.</v>

1782
01:14:21.641 --> 01:14:24.460
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think just the buddies way to end your</v>

1783
01:14:24.461 --> 01:14:25.294
<v Speaker 2>video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you think about start and finish </v>

1784
01:14:26.411 --> 01:14:28.920
<v Speaker 2>the day that day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1785
01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:29.973
<v Speaker 2>it's just very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that like a guy can be </v>

1786
01:14:37.810 --> 01:14:41.350
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the thing that fascinates me the</v>

1787
01:14:41.351 --> 01:14:46.351
<v Speaker 2>most out of for humans for since I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been an adult,</v>

1788
01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:48.790
<v Speaker 2>this is the thing that's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most,</v>

1789
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.420
<v Speaker 2>this is also my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my number one nightmare to be</v>

1790
01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:57.350
<v Speaker 2>the way you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not being to come across.</v>

1791
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:59.400
<v Speaker 2>He thinks he's being authentic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1792
01:14:59.510 --> 01:15:02.130
<v Speaker 2>It's the exact opposite is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interest.</v>

1793
01:15:02.210 --> 01:15:04.490
<v Speaker 2>You watch that and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh that's,</v>

1794
01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:05.653
<v Speaker 2>and he doesn't realize it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my biggest nightmare is to walk </v>

1795
01:15:06.921 --> 01:15:08.860
<v Speaker 2>into a role in understand what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1796
01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:11.380
<v Speaker 2>But do you think that he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he's,</v>

1797
01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:13.880
<v Speaker 2>this is clearly extremely rehearsed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1798
01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:17.570
<v Speaker 2>So you think it's possible for someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>to almost be,</v>

1799
01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.640
<v Speaker 2>have that duality of mine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1800
01:15:19.641 --> 01:15:20.474
<v Speaker 2>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1801
01:15:20.570 --> 01:15:21.890
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could be doing that.</v>

1802
01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:22.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he is,</v>

1803
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:26.930
<v Speaker 2>but either way it sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either way.</v>

1804
01:15:26.931 --> 01:15:29.330
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking so funny and crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1805
01:15:29.450 --> 01:15:30.380
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on dude.</v>

1807
01:15:32.010 --> 01:15:34.070

<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1808
01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:36.440
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's cause I'm a comedian and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1809
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:39.890
<v Speaker 2>you have to let people kind of know who </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are for it to work.</v>

1810
01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:42.050

<v Speaker 2>character,</v>

1811
01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:46.770

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:51.880

<v Speaker 1>in front of you.</v>

1858
01:17:51.881 --> 01:17:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Thought you'd bring it up.</v>

1862
01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:05.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm immersed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:11.010

<v Speaker 1>I really wasn't sure about this a bit.</v>

1865
01:18:11.150 --> 01:18:13.530
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine said something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>made all kinds of sense.</v>

1866
01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.800
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just think of it as a conversation.</v>

01:18:17.690 --> 01:18:22.260
<v Speaker 1>I like that you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm already noticing myself is that it's</v>

1868
01:18:22.261 --> 01:18:24.930
<v Speaker 1>whacking away the walls of communication</v>
<v Speaker 1>between you and me.</v>

1869
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:27.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really like that.</v>

1870
01:18:28.590 --> 01:18:31.500

<v Speaker 1>an invitation to,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the whole parking situation cause they </v>
<v Speaker 1>made us park and then put us on a </v>

1985
01:23:45.611 --> 01:23:49.300
<v Speaker 1>shuttle and the shuttle drove literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>for 30 seconds.</v>

1986
01:23:49.330 --> 01:23:50.163
<v Speaker 1>We drove 30 seconds down the road and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they kicked us out of the shuttle </v>

1987
01:23:52.151 --> 01:23:52.601
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>

1999
01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:16.690

<v Speaker 1>to keep secret?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to keep bringing it up,</v>

2088
01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Because he's the center of attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's there.</v>

2089
01:28:23.271 --> 01:28:24.230

<v Speaker 1>like I guess he parties,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2093
01:28:30.071 --> 01:28:31.640
<v Speaker 1>so if your party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different thing.</v>

2094
01:28:31.641 --> 01:28:33.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like when I'm at,</v>

01:28:37.641 --> 01:28:40.610
<v Speaker 1>but like after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to go somewhere.</v>

2098

<v Speaker 1>You're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a young man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>38 year old.</v>

2101
01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:54.020
<v Speaker 1>I sometimes I forget because I'm 33 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of fucking like,</v>

2102
01:28:54.021 --> 01:28:55.910
<v Speaker 1>I probably shouldn't even be talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2103
01:28:56.900 --> 01:28:58.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anything talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2104
01:28:58.790 --> 01:29:00.220
<v Speaker 1>I got one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2105
01:29:00.650 --> 01:29:01.980
<v Speaker 1>actually one thing that I learned about </v>
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

2106
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:04.440
<v Speaker 2>that did intrigue me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is that?</v>

2107
01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:05.341
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

2108
01:29:05.341 --> 01:29:09.210
<v Speaker 2>let me say that I love your bit about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the drunk girls driving and I'm like,</v>

2109
01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:10.073
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy has obviously spent a lot of </v>

2110
01:29:10.921 --> 01:29:11.754
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2111
01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:13.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't actually,</v>

2112
01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:15.870
<v Speaker 2>you don't drink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't use drugs,</v>

2113
01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:19.320
<v Speaker 2>you don't smoke cannabis know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I will say is that,</v>

2114
01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:20.453
<v Speaker 2>have you ever tried these things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now I mean prefaces by saying I </v>

2115
01:29:23.491 --> 01:29:28.491
<v Speaker 2>always have to answer this question four</v>
<v Speaker 2>or five times in a row.</v>

2116
01:29:30.970 --> 01:29:33.540
<v Speaker 2>I've literally never been drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never done,</v>

2117
01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:35.850
<v Speaker 2>I've never smoked weed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never done any drugs,</v>

2118
01:29:35.851 --> 01:29:36.601
<v Speaker 2>never drank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2119
01:29:36.601 --> 01:29:38.380
<v Speaker 2>one of my favorite people ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ever,</v>

2120
01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:41.030
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why surprising.</v>

2121
01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:44.490
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well one of my favorite artists,</v>

2122
01:29:44.491 --> 01:29:45.324
<v Speaker 2>frank Zappa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was like the nerdiest guy of all </v>

2123
01:29:46.900 --> 01:29:47.733
<v Speaker 2>time and the guy that you think was on </v>
<v Speaker 2>acid all the time was completely </v>

2124
01:29:49.981 --> 01:29:50.470
<v Speaker 2>straight edge.</v>

2125
01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:52.980
<v Speaker 2>I refuse to believe work with people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>use drugs.</v>

2126
01:29:53.010 --> 01:29:53.843
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2127
01:29:53.850 --> 01:29:54.683
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2128
01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:56.153
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just curious what's the theory </v>

2129
01:29:58.531 --> 01:30:01.020
<v Speaker 2>behind it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't,</v>

2130
01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:02.940
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2131
01:30:02.941 --> 01:30:04.380
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was young,</v>

2132
01:30:04.381 --> 01:30:05.310
<v Speaker 2>young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2133
01:30:05.311 --> 01:30:09.060
<v Speaker 2>there's a few things I don't like to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that everybody's doing,</v>

2134
01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:10.500
<v Speaker 2>I immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2135
01:30:10.501 --> 01:30:12.120
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why the fuck is everybody doing that?</v>

2136
01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:13.620
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's gotta be weird.</v>

2137
01:30:13.710 --> 01:30:14.543
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when people sort of drinking in high </v>

2138
01:30:16.741 --> 01:30:17.850
<v Speaker 2>school and Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2139
01:30:17.851 --> 01:30:20.010
<v Speaker 2>why is everybody doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take a beat.</v>

2140
01:30:20.550 --> 01:30:22.350
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'll fucking do it later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2141
01:30:22.410 --> 01:30:24.210
<v Speaker 2>So there was that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there was also,</v>

2142
01:30:25.290 --> 01:30:28.740
<v Speaker 2>when I used to watch like the old Batman</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows with Adam West and shit,</v>

2143
01:30:28.741 --> 01:30:31.110
<v Speaker 2>when he would like penguin and joker </v>
<v Speaker 2>would gas people,</v>

2144
01:30:31.111 --> 01:30:31.944
<v Speaker 2>that would scare the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would equate like being drunk to </v>

2145
01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:38.250
<v Speaker 2>another altered state of mind to where </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2146
01:30:38.490 --> 01:30:39.720
<v Speaker 2>like laughing gas was.</v>

2147
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:42.540
<v Speaker 2>So as a kid I was also a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>scared of it.</v>

2148
01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:43.673
<v Speaker 2>After that I grew up and I have a thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I don't ever do anything until I </v>

2149
01:30:48.421 --> 01:30:49.254
<v Speaker 2>regret that I haven't done it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means I didn't lose my virginity </v>

2150
01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:55.560
<v Speaker 2>until I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2151
01:30:55.561 --> 01:30:57.780
<v Speaker 2>I should have had sex that one time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I missed out.</v>

2152
01:30:58.260 --> 01:30:59.093
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause then I know I actually want to do </v>

2153
01:30:59.911 --> 01:31:01.510
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2154
01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:04.890
<v Speaker 2>and same goes with drinking and drugs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just have never felt like I missed</v>

2155
01:31:04.891 --> 01:31:05.910
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't feel compelled.</v>

2156
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.500
<v Speaker 2>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever was curious about it.</v>

2157
01:31:07.501 --> 01:31:09.060
<v Speaker 2>I never felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh man,</v>

2158
01:31:09.061 --> 01:31:09.894
<v Speaker 2>everyone was high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should have done it to the other </v>

2159
01:31:11.130 --> 01:31:11.480
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

2160
01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:13.230
<v Speaker 2>And when I do feel that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will do it.</v>

2161
01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:15.840
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying I'll never do it.</v>

2162
01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:19.650
<v Speaker 2>It's impressive as fuck that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>never even had a beer.</v>

2163
01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:20.663
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

<v Speaker 2>personality for sure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

2292
01:35:57.020 --> 01:35:57.741
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2297
01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:11.673
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I have a couple of things I want to </v>

2298
01:36:12.561 --> 01:36:13.394
<v Speaker 1>ask you first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of become a thing with </v>

2299
01:36:14.860 --> 01:36:16.670
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with our show here.</v>

2300
01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:18.073
<v Speaker 1>So this is something that we happen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk a lot about and I find it </v>

2301
01:36:20.691 --> 01:36:21.524
<v Speaker 1>fascinating because it's so private and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone has their own different </v>

2302
01:36:23.571 --> 01:36:26.810
<v Speaker 1>approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you wipe your ass?</v>

2303
01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:30.920
<v Speaker 1>How do you mean up to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a bad day,</v>

2304
01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:31.873
<v Speaker 1>but you're asking me about a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that I already have severe </v>

2305
01:36:33.711 --> 01:36:35.440
<v Speaker 1>opinions about and the script,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked it.</v>

2306
01:36:35.441 --> 01:36:40.350
<v Speaker 1>So it's like I prepare it well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you wipe,</v>

2307
01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:41.360
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you do it?</v>

2308
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:42.223
<v Speaker 1>Look at all the way that I do it is I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love baby wipes changed my fucking </v>

2309
01:36:46.191 --> 01:36:49.790
<v Speaker 1>life because you go dry drives a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>mess.</v>

2310
01:36:49.791 --> 01:36:50.660
<v Speaker 1>It's just not feasible.</v>

2311
01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:51.740
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't cut it.</v>

2312
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:53.720
<v Speaker 1>You tried to clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2313
01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:54.793
<v Speaker 1>it's like sandpaper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever believe from your asshole from </v>

2314
01:36:57.141 --> 01:36:58.100
<v Speaker 1>wiping too much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2315
01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the fucking worse?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see?</v>

2316
