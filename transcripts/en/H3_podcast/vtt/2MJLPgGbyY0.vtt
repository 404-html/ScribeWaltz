00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.770
<v Speaker 1>Video of bliss.</v>

00:03:42.651 --> 00:03:43.484
<v Speaker 1>fake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have to believe in my soul and </v>

<v Speaker 1>Had a crawfish and it catches it and its</v>
<v Speaker 1>claw.</v>

74
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.490

<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much the only way.</v>

75
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:17.723
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

76
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.190

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.440
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It fucking looks real.</v>

85

<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

97
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:10.924
<v Speaker 1>had to share with you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of my favorite videos to </v>

98
00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:14.890
<v Speaker 1>come from the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these past weeks,</v>

99
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.820
<v Speaker 1>this guy went to city hall and gave an </v>
<v Speaker 1>impassioned speech.</v>

100
00:05:18.821 --> 00:05:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Not about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

103
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.510
<v Speaker 1>this man came with something much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>important and pressing.</v>

104
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.810
<v Speaker 1>He came asking that massage therapists </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to jerk you off.</v>

105
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.500
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you got to go with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you have to go to city hall to</v>

106
00:05:48.501 --> 00:05:49.334
<v Speaker 1>get to fight for your rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't a massage therapist touch my </v>

107
00:05:53.691 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>dick if I pay an extra 20 bucks?</v>

108
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.870
<v Speaker 1>that's probably a good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably more than that.</v>

109
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.133
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

120
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.660
<v Speaker 1>finger men basically finger men all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Basically,</v>

121
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.240
<v Speaker 1>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally finger means assholes all day.</v>

122
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.350
<v Speaker 1>This guy's a hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

123
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.053
<v Speaker 1>don't question him.</v>

124
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:10.403
<v Speaker 2>Rolling.</v>

125
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.633
<v Speaker 1>I love the his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crotch of his argument is what's </v>

126
00:07:19.831 --> 00:07:23.730
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to go back.</v>

127
00:07:23.731 --> 00:07:25.080
<v Speaker 1>Is that really what he argued?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

128
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.500
<v Speaker 1>it's more nasty for the practicality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let just let him jerk him off.</v>

129
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.413
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

130
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.453
<v Speaker 1>He's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the difference you're already </v>

131
00:07:36.601 --> 00:07:37.434
<v Speaker 1>getting in the folds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not just touch his dick along the </v>

132
00:07:39.031 --> 00:07:40.650
<v Speaker 1>way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Compelling argument.</v>

133
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.110
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see a counterpoint made to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

134
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.170
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

135
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:01.093
<v Speaker 2>Amen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brother.</v>

136
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:14.690
<v Speaker 2>What a Patriot and go get one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

137
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

138
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.510
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a full circle right there.</v>

139
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.190
<v Speaker 2>Amen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brother.</v>

140
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:27.740
<v Speaker 2>That guy's definitely a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

141
00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.390
<v Speaker 2>He's got the socks and sandals.</v>

142
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.340
<v Speaker 1>That would truly be a happy ending for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

143
00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Fuck</v>

144
00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.610
<v Speaker 2>Amen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brother Dan,</v>

145
00:08:35.611 --> 00:08:38.430

<v Speaker 2>have you ever had gotten a massage,</v>

146
00:08:38.431 --> 00:08:41.400
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a full body Swedish massage?</v>

147
00:08:41.401 --> 00:08:42.390
<v Speaker 2>Dan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have not.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

149
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:47.910
<v Speaker 1>never done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to ask if like I've gotten a</v>

150
00:08:47.911 --> 00:08:50.370
<v Speaker 1>couple of times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just fucking applause.</v>

151
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:51.263
<v Speaker 1>Sound effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to ask if it's ever moved </v>

152
00:08:52.681 --> 00:08:55.620
<v Speaker 1>when you were getting a massage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

153
00:08:55.621 --> 00:08:57.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say in a professional setting.</v>

154
00:08:57.241 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

155
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:02.570
<v Speaker 1>obviously in private that's a different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a different tale altogether.</v>

156
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.150
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

157
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:07.140
<v Speaker 1>it's too weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

158
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.270
<v Speaker 1>I have like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a weird hang ups about it.</v>

159
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it moves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

160
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a natural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>

161
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Can you do anyway?</v>
<v Speaker 1>God bless to this guy,</v>

162
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Ian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has it ever moved for you?</v>

163
00:09:20.431 --> 00:09:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had a massage and he's off</v>
<v Speaker 1>headset right now.</v>

164
00:09:22.741 --> 00:09:24.810
<v Speaker 1>He's starting to screen calls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

165
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:27.630
<v Speaker 1>let's just say that he has no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

166
00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:29.043
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

167
00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.553
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

168
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:31.763
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I salute this Patriot and I'm all about </v>

169
00:09:34.651 --> 00:09:36.720
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

170
00:09:36.721 --> 00:09:37.710
<v Speaker 1>But that being said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get,</v>

171
00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:41.490
<v Speaker 1>let's get into the main event here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boosie too.</v>

172
00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:42.363
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's like a repeat almost of</v>
<v Speaker 1>last week when we talked about Connie </v>

173
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.640
<v Speaker 1>cannacon just trying to decode and </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain what's happening.</v>

174
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.560
<v Speaker 1>So Fusi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fusi,</v>

175
00:09:52.561 --> 00:09:54.060
<v Speaker 1>tube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you guys don't know who he is,</v>

176
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.420
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

177
00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.420
<v Speaker 1>he can has a prankster and he faked a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of pranks.</v>

178
00:10:00.421 --> 00:10:03.150
<v Speaker 1>He almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he invented almost like the moral,</v>

179
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:06.810
<v Speaker 1>the righteous fake prank where it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

180
00:10:06.811 --> 00:10:08.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

181
00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.890
<v Speaker 1>what was the example you gave me Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he had one word.</v>

182
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:11.753
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

183
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.483
<v Speaker 1>he sends in the street and he's yelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>at people for not having like they're a </v>

184
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.100
<v Speaker 1>seat belt on or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

185
00:10:20.101 --> 00:10:22.530
<v Speaker 1>Just like he's always got to have like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral twist on it.</v>

186
00:10:22.531 --> 00:10:24.930
<v Speaker 1>He kind of invented that whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

187
00:10:24.931 --> 00:10:26.880
<v Speaker 1>he fell off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure he's,</v>

188
00:10:26.881 --> 00:10:27.714
<v Speaker 1>he's been having a lot of mental issues </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it seems like he's in a full blown </v>

189
00:10:29.761 --> 00:10:32.100
<v Speaker 1>manic state right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

190
00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.350
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's start here.</v>

191
00:10:34.351 --> 00:10:39.351
<v Speaker 1>Let's start from the top here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says with 2 million viewers,</v>

192
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:44.760
<v Speaker 1>drake is going to grace the stage of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>concert.</v>

193
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.100
<v Speaker 1>He's only got 2000 likes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a far way off.</v>

194
00:10:50.101 --> 00:10:52.050
<v Speaker 1>2 million views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

195
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.330
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he keeps saying that Drake's going to be</v>

196
00:10:54.331 --> 00:10:55.560
<v Speaker 1>at a show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drake's going to be at a show.</v>

197
00:10:55.561 --> 00:10:57.090
<v Speaker 1>He's never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he never talked to drake.</v>

198
00:10:57.091 --> 00:10:58.470
<v Speaker 1>He's ever known drake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

199
00:10:58.471 --> 00:10:59.304
<v Speaker 1>he sells out the Greek a free show and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he says Drake's going to be there and </v>

200
00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:04.974
<v Speaker 1>obviously drink never shows up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But basically what ensues is a lot of </v>

201
00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:09.234
<v Speaker 1>insanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of confusion and a very little </v>

202
00:11:11.281 --> 00:11:13.320
<v Speaker 1>crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

203
00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:20.340
<v Speaker 1>and him stalking drake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is probably the best,</v>

204
00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:21.453
<v Speaker 1>I mean the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most entertaining and concerning </v>

205
00:11:22.901 --> 00:11:26.210
<v Speaker 1>thing to come out of this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

206
00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.770
<v Speaker 1>this video pretty much sums it all up </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>

207
00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:32.580
<v Speaker 1>Let me throw this up here for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

208
00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:34.750
<v Speaker 1>this video really has it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got stocking.</v>

209
00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:36.370
<v Speaker 1>It's got a Jeroma.</v>

210
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:45.260
<v Speaker 2>Let's hear it quiet.</v>

211
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:51.990
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you turn it up?</v>

212
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:53.973
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>

213
00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:02.710
<v Speaker 2>Do to the people.</v>

214
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.530
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's taken this clip from someone else's</v>

215
00:12:12.531 --> 00:12:13.364
<v Speaker 1>show and upload.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a video on his channel right </v>

216
00:12:16.311 --> 00:12:19.430
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to put it in frame here</v>

217
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:25.283
<v Speaker 2>building,</v>

218
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.033
<v Speaker 1>this is when it gets really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think he probably spent about a </v>

219
00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.010
<v Speaker 1>hundred thousand dollars reserving the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek.</v>

220
00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:44.653
<v Speaker 1>And I will say to his credit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't want to compare it to </v>

221
00:12:46.341 --> 00:12:47.174
<v Speaker 1>Taneka cause with Tana did was basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell supposedly free tickets and didn't </v>

222
00:12:52.311 --> 00:12:56.240
<v Speaker 1>even give on the event or refund people </v>
<v Speaker 1>his was free.</v>

223
00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:57.463
<v Speaker 1>So at least there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the a big separation to be made </v>

224
00:13:00.261 --> 00:13:00.741
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

225
00:13:00.741 --> 00:13:04.010
<v Speaker 1>he's not scamming people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just misleading people,</v>

226
00:13:04.011 --> 00:13:06.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's a free show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's really fascinating,</v>

227
00:13:06.711 --> 00:13:11.711
<v Speaker 1>it's just his clear mental decline here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

228
00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:14.413
<v Speaker 1>watch this.</v>

229
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.960
<v Speaker 2>I want to go over a little bit on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>as hard.</v>

230
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:28.803
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

231
00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Is He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is he,</v>

232
00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean I can't tell if he's just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>cracked out.</v>

233
00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our features on a manic rant.</v>

234
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

235
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:40.563
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

236
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.310
<v Speaker 1>it seems very manic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

237
00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:46.120
<v Speaker 1>It seems very mannequin and isn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He publicly has a history of that.</v>

238
00:13:46.121 --> 00:13:47.710

464
00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.190
<v Speaker 1>There's basically nobody there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

465
00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:08.860
<v Speaker 1>and then someone calls it cause it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's livestreaming it.</v>

470
00:26:17.351 --> 00:26:18.184

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:25.600
<v Speaker 1>they knew what was going to be and </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody called a bomb threat,</v>

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:31.200
<v Speaker 1>which is just like Jerry on top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like I'm not surprised.</v>

473
00:26:34.411 --> 00:26:37.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm not surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are conspiracy theories and I have</v>

474
00:26:37.741 --> 00:26:41.790
<v Speaker 1>to say they're compelling cause you </v>
<v Speaker 1>always have to ask yourself who benefits</v>

475
00:26:41.791 --> 00:26:42.624
<v Speaker 1>the most from this crime bomb threats </v>
<v Speaker 1>called could totally be anyone on the </v>

476
00:26:47.371 --> 00:26:48.570
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is a,</v>

477
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.100
<v Speaker 1>it's a juicy mean,</v>

478
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:56.500
<v Speaker 1>but if Fusi called the bomb threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't at the venue yet.</v>

479
00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:59.980
<v Speaker 1>He was waiting to see how big it got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If drake would just,</v>

480
00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:01.503
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he thinks happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If like drake would just like </v>

481
00:27:02.951 --> 00:27:05.980
<v Speaker 1>materialize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like 2 million,</v>

482
00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if he called it in himself,</v>

483
00:27:09.851 --> 00:27:12.460
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if he was able to get a refund </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be like,</v>

484
00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:14.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show never happened or oh,</v>

485
00:27:14.561 --> 00:27:16.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to be embarrassed because </v>
<v Speaker 1>drake never showed up.</v>

486
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.553
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He kind of benefited the most from that </v>

487
00:27:20.531 --> 00:27:21.364
<v Speaker 1>bomb threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why it's a compelling </v>

488
00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:27.040
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying that.</v>

489
00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:27.963
<v Speaker 1>How dare you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never say or implicate or say </v>

490
00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.830
<v Speaker 1>and make any statement like that as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>

491
00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:35.373
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a thought experiment merely </v>

492
00:27:40.361 --> 00:27:44.620
<v Speaker 1>asking questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Been through enough lawsuits</v>

493
00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.250
<v Speaker 1>won by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's plenty.</v>

494
00:27:48.251 --> 00:27:52.150
<v Speaker 1>That's plenty there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is some sense in it,</v>

495
00:27:52.151 --> 00:27:53.800
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he benefit,</v>

496
00:27:53.801 --> 00:27:55.090
<v Speaker 1>he really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>

497
00:27:55.091 --> 00:27:57.980
<v Speaker 1>Frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see him benefiting from that bond.</v>

498
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:59.920
<v Speaker 1>But like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

499
00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:01.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people get swatted all the time.</v>

500
00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

501
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.620
<v Speaker 1>It could be somebody else just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as silly.</v>

502
00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:06.280
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Easily.</v>

503
00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Whoever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

504
00:28:09.161 --> 00:28:11.020
<v Speaker 1>fuck that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hope they get caught.</v>

505
00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:16.000
<v Speaker 1>If it does end up being food soup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't that be like the greatest twice</v>

506
00:28:16.001 --> 00:28:19.840
<v Speaker 1>in this epic saga ever?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I explaining this?</v>

507
00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:22.570
<v Speaker 1>If people understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this making sense?</v>

508
00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Who gives a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also stupid.</v>

509
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:28.833
<v Speaker 1>There's just another thing of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube has just devolved into such </v>

510
00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:34.900
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is he famous?</v>

511
00:28:34.901 --> 00:28:36.490
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Youtube is,</v>

512
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:38.463
<v Speaker 1>youtube has turned into this like engine</v>
<v Speaker 1>for creating fame for people who should </v>

513
00:28:42.161 --> 00:28:45.280
<v Speaker 1>never had even a taste of fame.</v>

514
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:47.190
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

515
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:50.580
<v Speaker 1>The most Fusi should have ever been </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous for his stocking drake.</v>

516
00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:53.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

517
00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:57.740
<v Speaker 1>like there's so many people and when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>give fame and like cause fame,</v>

518
00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:58.633
<v Speaker 1>it has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a lot of power and frankly a lot </v>

519
00:29:00.471 --> 00:29:01.304
<v Speaker 1>of responsibility that comes with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you give it to somebody like </v>

520
00:29:04.071 --> 00:29:04.904
<v Speaker 1>that and many others on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're given a bazooka to a </v>

521
00:29:08.541 --> 00:29:13.541
<v Speaker 1>monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fusi should not be famous man.</v>

522
00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:15.990
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

523
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:18.180
<v Speaker 1>so many other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cons,</v>

524
00:29:18.181 --> 00:29:20.550
<v Speaker 1>Tana should not be famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My God,</v>

525
00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:25.050
<v Speaker 1>Tana should be working at Wendy's </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically.</v>

526
00:29:25.051 --> 00:29:25.884
<v Speaker 1>Wendy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she does the other fast foods for some </v>

527
00:29:27.631 --> 00:29:32.130
<v Speaker 1>reason don't ring true to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She should be serving up Wendy's.</v>

528
00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:33.790
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

529
00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:38.250
<v Speaker 1>and yet here she is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

530
00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:44.610
<v Speaker 1>Well she might be serving on burgers in </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison.</v>

531
00:29:44.611 --> 00:29:49.611
<v Speaker 1>Pretty soon somebody's got to cook them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think they get burgers and prison?</v>

532
00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:52.530
<v Speaker 1>Maybe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they probably do.</v>

533
00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:56.250
<v Speaker 1>That was pretty dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prison doesn't sound that bad after all.</v>

534
00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.350
<v Speaker 1>Sounds Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

535
00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.970
<v Speaker 1>This is why I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I don't,</v>

536
00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:03.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the podcast because I really feel</v>

537
00:30:03.241 --> 00:30:04.074
<v Speaker 1>like we're doing our own thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just feel like you tuber is </v>

538
00:30:06.751 --> 00:30:09.390
<v Speaker 1>becoming and youtube itself is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

539
00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:11.880
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like always the same shit.</v>

540
00:30:11.881 --> 00:30:16.881
<v Speaker 1>Like this is fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might have been talking about this.</v>

541
00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:23.750
<v Speaker 1>I got to finish this story though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's reality show,</v>

542
00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:26.630
<v Speaker 1>you know it's the same I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

543
00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:30.050
<v Speaker 1>But it's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe it's not worse.</v>

544
00:30:30.051 --> 00:30:31.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you're right.</v>

545
00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:35.390
<v Speaker 1>It is the same impulse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people look at Kim Kardashian.</v>

546
00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess a lot of people look to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them as a role model.</v>

547
00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:39.380
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's the same kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

548
00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:40.723
<v Speaker 1>Not that I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then basically the bomb threat shuts </v>

549
00:30:44.271 --> 00:30:48.650
<v Speaker 1>this whole bitch down and he shows up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets on his,</v>

550
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.780
<v Speaker 1>gets on a car or the uber driver who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>fired by the way after this.</v>

551
00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:57.260
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

552
00:30:57.261 --> 00:30:58.550
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

553
00:30:58.551 --> 00:30:59.384
<v Speaker 1>this isn't the video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not going to bother showing it </v>

554
00:31:00.321 --> 00:31:02.300
<v Speaker 1>too cause it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

555
00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:04.100
<v Speaker 1>give me a fucking break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he says,</v>

556
00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:05.083
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you $50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you let me stand on your car and </v>

557
00:31:07.671 --> 00:31:11.870
<v Speaker 1>deliver a monologue to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

558
00:31:11.871 --> 00:31:13.190
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

559
00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.380
<v Speaker 1>so it goes on the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he makes them hit a blunt,</v>

560
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:19.690
<v Speaker 1>he gets fired obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then food,</v>

561
00:31:19.691 --> 00:31:22.430
<v Speaker 1>see sharing their text messages of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Uber drive being like,</v>

562
00:31:22.431 --> 00:31:23.360
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got fired.</v>

563
00:31:23.361 --> 00:31:25.040
<v Speaker 1>I really need this job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need the money.</v>

564
00:31:25.041 --> 00:31:26.630
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to my accountant.</v>

565
00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:29.660
<v Speaker 1>My accountant's going to hook you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

566
00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:31.790
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell if that's flab or six back.</v>

567
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:37.270
<v Speaker 1>He's got a rolled up though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does he have it rolled up?</v>

568
00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:38.493
<v Speaker 1>What does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're already wearing a wife </v>

569
00:31:39.761 --> 00:31:40.594
<v Speaker 1>beater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the most breathable shirt you can </v>

570
00:31:41.561 --> 00:31:43.510
<v Speaker 1>possibly wear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

571
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:45.700
<v Speaker 1>it makes it look like he's wearing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sports bra.</v>

572
00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:49.460
<v Speaker 1>Does it got some nice teddy's but like </v>
<v Speaker 1>some support,</v>

573
00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:53.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell what's flab or arts muscle,</v>

574
00:31:53.291 --> 00:31:58.291
<v Speaker 1>but he's rolled up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just take it off.</v>

575
00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean take off the fucking shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At that point you're,</v>

576
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:02.733
<v Speaker 1>you've gone 70% of the way training bra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a training bra and for some </v>

577
00:32:06.401 --> 00:32:09.800
<v Speaker 1>luscious breasts you've been grilling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

578
00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:13.240
<v Speaker 1>it sounds weird to say a training bra </v>
<v Speaker 1>and luscious breasts.</v>

579
00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:14.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

580
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:16.070
<v Speaker 1>Next to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

581
00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Was like 10 years apart.</v>

582
00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.553
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

583
00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:21.913
<v Speaker 1>let's move on.</v>

584
00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:31.753
<v Speaker 2>I love that line.</v>

585
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:38.830
<v Speaker 1>It's really not a great insult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heating up my,</v>

588
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:42.853

<v Speaker 1>don't want to drag this out too much by </v>

589
00:32:50.461 --> 00:32:53.580
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His event is called like a hate dies.</v>

987
00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:44.803

<v Speaker 1>everyone on youtube.</v>

990
00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:56.360

<v Speaker 1>youtubers being garbage,</v>

991
00:54:56.480 --> 00:55:00.170
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't be famous.</v>

00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:30.590
<v Speaker 1>a man like this could ever find fame.</v>

1020
00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:39.160
<v Speaker 1>His name came up again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sad to say after posting another</v>

00:56:39.161 --> 00:56:43.420
<v Speaker 1>video of abusing his poor son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I'm sure,</v>

1022
00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:44.453
<v Speaker 1>and I hate to say this about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his son is probably going to shoot up a </v>

<v Speaker 1>He's a sweet guy,</v>

1028
00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:59.530

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:01.673
<v Speaker 1>And I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what my point is because </v>

1188
01:07:04.021 --> 01:07:06.180
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of legit people on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube too.</v>

01:07:07.170 --> 01:07:09.000
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well and,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Now what?</v>

1191
01:07:11.131 --> 01:07:12.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why was he allowed back?</v>

1192
01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:14.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1193
01:07:14.881 --> 01:07:19.170
<v Speaker 1>He is his family of five channel after </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a convicted child.</v>

1194
01:07:19.171 --> 01:07:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Neglect or was allowed to continue.</v>

01:07:22.110 --> 01:07:24.600
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they just shut it down finally.</v>

1196
01:07:24.601 --> 01:07:25.890
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>

1197
01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:26.581
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1198
01:07:26.581 --> 01:07:28.770
<v Speaker 1>I guess better late than never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but shit.</v>

1199
01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:32.520
<v Speaker 1>So give it up to Daddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A five rest in peace.</v>

1200
01:07:32.790 --> 01:07:36.120
<v Speaker 1>I fear for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he loses his livelihood.</v>

1201
01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:41.020
<v Speaker 1>I fear for what will become of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>family speaking frankly point.</v>

1202
01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:44.033
<v Speaker 1>Well we're at the bottom of the show and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had mentioned at the top of the show </v>

1203
01:07:48.421 --> 01:07:49.254
<v Speaker 1>that I'm healers eludes dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>some stuff back home and I didn't want </v>

1204
01:07:53.341 --> 01:07:54.420
<v Speaker 1>to talk about it cause it's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy.</v>

1205
01:07:54.421 --> 01:07:55.254
<v Speaker 1>But I do want to talk about it right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that I'm Ella's dad passed away </v>

1206
01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:01.733
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was probably like three or </v>

1207
01:08:02.641 --> 01:08:06.000
<v Speaker 1>four days ago now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's crazy.</v>

1208
01:08:06.030 --> 01:08:11.030
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she went there for two weeks.</v>

1209
01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:14.850
<v Speaker 1>She planned to go there for two weeks </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when she went there he was,</v>

1210
01:08:15.530 --> 01:08:16.363
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was terminally ill but I mean nobody </v>

1211
01:08:18.891 --> 01:08:22.640
<v Speaker 1>expected that he was going to die during</v>
<v Speaker 1>her stay there.</v>

1212
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he picked her up from the airport.</v>

1213
01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:31.120
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

1214
01:08:31.130 --> 01:08:34.370
<v Speaker 1>it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been really a wild ride for her.</v>

1215
01:08:35.210 --> 01:08:36.043
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she knew her dad was like terminally </v>

1216
01:08:38.181 --> 01:08:39.014
<v Speaker 1>ill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like the day she arrived they were </v>

1217
01:08:41.491 --> 01:08:42.324
<v Speaker 1>giving them radiation treatment because </v>
<v Speaker 1>his lung cancer spread to his brain and </v>

1218
01:08:45.661 --> 01:08:50.070
<v Speaker 1>the doctors like we really need to kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>this tumor with radiation.</v>

1219
01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:55.200
<v Speaker 1>The chance of success is really high and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes eight weeks for it to work.</v>

1220
01:08:55.201 --> 01:08:58.740
<v Speaker 1>So an a week after that he fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>passed away.</v>

1221
01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:00.250
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1222
01:09:00.250 --> 01:09:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Which is so crazy man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

1223
01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:07.493
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

1224
01:09:09.490 --> 01:09:10.323
<v Speaker 1>she's been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's been going through a lot and I do </v>

1225
01:09:12.731 --> 01:09:15.910
<v Speaker 1>want to say about Ilos Dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have talked about them on this podcast</v>

1226
01:09:15.911 --> 01:09:18.130
<v Speaker 1>a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1227
01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:22.930
<v Speaker 1>some wonderful moments I will say fondly</v>
<v Speaker 1>now</v>

1228
01:09:24.130 --> 01:09:29.130
<v Speaker 1>because they were always kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>not taking very seriously.</v>

1229
01:09:29.830 --> 01:09:31.960
<v Speaker 1>The first great one being that he told </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

1230
01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:35.350
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] don't ever let ethan come in</v>

1231
01:09:35.351 --> 01:09:39.490
<v Speaker 1>this house if he's coming over here with</v>
<v Speaker 1>socks and sandals.</v>

1232
01:09:39.670 --> 01:09:40.503
<v Speaker 1>That was my move back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was wearing not just like sliders but </v>

1233
01:09:44.290 --> 01:09:46.420
<v Speaker 1>flip flops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one with the string in the middle.</v>

1234
01:09:46.421 --> 01:09:47.254
<v Speaker 1>So I was wearing a white sock all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way up and the string like shoving the </v>

1235
01:09:51.161 --> 01:09:52.570
<v Speaker 1>socket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was not a good luck.</v>

1236
01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:54.790
<v Speaker 1>And frankly I understand it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassing.</v>

1237
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:59.710
<v Speaker 1>This is my son in law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was funny,</v>

1238
01:10:00.610 --> 01:10:04.180
<v Speaker 1>but he was serious and frankly he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an old school guy.</v>

1239
01:10:04.181 --> 01:10:05.014
<v Speaker 1>He's all about respect and integrity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't wear sandals to the house </v>

1240
01:10:08.561 --> 01:10:09.394
<v Speaker 1>again and frankly I don't do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore because it is pretty insane way </v>

1241
01:10:11.561 --> 01:10:12.460
<v Speaker 1>to walk around the world.</v>

1242
01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:14.100
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1243
01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:17.370
<v Speaker 1>So I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can and retrospect appreciate it</v>

1244
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:24.210
<v Speaker 1>that that was a changing point for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Straighten you out.</v>

1245
01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:29.400
<v Speaker 1>The next great moment yo can on moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>was um,</v>

1246
01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:30.653
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've told the story but it's like back </v>

1247
01:10:32.671 --> 01:10:34.560
<v Speaker 1>in the day when we first started </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube,</v>

1248
01:10:35.730 --> 01:10:40.470
<v Speaker 1>there was this one video called shake </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Dick and it was so obscene.</v>

1249
01:10:40.471 --> 01:10:41.400
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't watch,</v>

1250
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:46.430
<v Speaker 1>it's so vulgar and like our videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't particularly vulgar,</v>

1251
01:10:46.501 --> 01:10:47.334
<v Speaker 1>but this is the one for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that he actually saw and it was </v>

1252
01:10:50.941 --> 01:10:53.130
<v Speaker 1>a parody of shake that ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

1253
01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:54.043
<v Speaker 1>are lots of closeups of me wearing like </v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball shorts without underwear </v>

1254
01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:02.580
<v Speaker 1>shaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Dick was disgusting and obscene.</v>

1255
01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.720
<v Speaker 1>It's legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the funniest videos ever.</v>

1256
01:11:05.190 --> 01:11:06.023
<v Speaker 1>And he saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the one he had to see and he </v>

1257
01:11:08.191 --> 01:11:08.701
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isla,</v>

1258
01:11:08.701 --> 01:11:10.560
<v Speaker 1>if you guys keep making videos like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1259
01:11:10.590 --> 01:11:11.423
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to disown Ethan from being my </v>

1260
01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:15.510
<v Speaker 1>son in law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once again,</v>

1261
01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:19.840
<v Speaker 1>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

1262
01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:21.933
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know why that had to be the </v>

1263
01:11:22.811 --> 01:11:24.610
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the one.</v>

1264
01:11:24.611 --> 01:11:26.770
<v Speaker 1>But that's these a guy that was all </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1265
01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:30.820
<v Speaker 1>he's old school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's all about respect and integrity and</v>

1266
01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:33.040
<v Speaker 1>upholding the family name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I have to say</v>

1267
01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:38.020
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was always good to me.</v>

1268
01:11:38.650 --> 01:11:41.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we moved to Israel for America,</v>

1269
01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:46.600
<v Speaker 1>he's like a really old school dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He let me move in with them.</v>

1270
01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.273
<v Speaker 1>He had never met me before and he let me</v>
<v Speaker 1>come and stay with them and sleep in </v>

1271
01:11:52.241 --> 01:11:53.074
<v Speaker 1>their house and he always treated me </v>
<v Speaker 1>well and he always welcomed me and he </v>

1272
01:11:58.871 --> 01:11:59.704
<v Speaker 1>fed me and he gave me a chance to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be there and work there and make it </v>

1273
01:12:02.681 --> 01:12:03.514
<v Speaker 1>work with Ila.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he definitely could have been like </v>

1274
01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:10.000
<v Speaker 1>weird guy coming saying my house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

1275
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:13.030
<v Speaker 1>that was a huge stretch for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it definitely,</v>

1276
01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:22.200
<v Speaker 1>me definitely gave us a chance that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>made it all work.</v>

1277
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:27.783
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was something that Ella told me </v>

1278
01:12:31.941 --> 01:12:35.270
<v Speaker 1>that was like really I guess </v>
<v Speaker 1>heartbreaking in a way.</v>

1279
01:12:35.271 --> 01:12:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Not Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nice is that,</v>

1280
01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:41.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he from that moment where he was like,</v>

1281
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:43.940
<v Speaker 1>we're saw shake that Dick at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>funeral.</v>

1282
01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:44.803
<v Speaker 1>Every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of his friends and family were </v>

1283
01:12:45.411 --> 01:12:46.280
<v Speaker 1>telling you that.</v>

1284
01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:50.553
<v Speaker 3>Oh God</v>

1285
01:12:57.380 --> 01:12:58.213
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was telling all of the friends and </v>

1286
01:13:02.511 --> 01:13:07.511
<v Speaker 1>family how proud he was of her and us in</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular of of what we've accomplished</v>

1287
01:13:08.961 --> 01:13:09.794
<v Speaker 1>since then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were saying like he was always </v>

1288
01:13:12.351 --> 01:13:14.930
<v Speaker 1>bragging about you guys sharing your </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos on facebook,</v>

1289
01:13:14.931 --> 01:13:19.220
<v Speaker 1>talking about you and with everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we unfriended him after the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the chick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Dick thing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you can't be seeing these.</v>

1293
01:13:24.450 --> 01:13:28.520

<v Speaker 1>we posted a podcast or a video or a post</v>

1294
01:13:28.521 --> 01:13:32.780
<v Speaker 1>or whatever he was re he was sharing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>on his own facebook page too.</v>

1295
01:13:32.781 --> 01:13:36.710
<v Speaker 1>His family is all school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional conservative family.</v>

1296
01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:01.780
<v Speaker 1>This was like the last picture they took</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get together.</v>

1297
01:14:05.150 --> 01:14:05.983
<v Speaker 1>Like right when you went in the hospital</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like a week left and he's got a big </v>

1298
01:14:11.321 --> 01:14:12.154
<v Speaker 1>ass</v>

1299
01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:14.200
<v Speaker 3>fucking smile on his face</v>

1300
01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:17.780
<v Speaker 1>and he's rocking that teddy fresh.</v>

1301
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:19.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1302
01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:20.303
<v Speaker 1>And he is basically one week from death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's in pain all the time and </v>

1303
01:14:24.721 --> 01:14:25.350
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

1304
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:28.080
<v Speaker 1>just the fact that he mustered that big </v>
<v Speaker 1>smile for Ila,</v>

1305
01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:31.830
<v Speaker 1>rocking that teddy fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was,</v>

1306
01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:36.870
<v Speaker 1>he was a great one and it was a true </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporter and he really enabled us to,</v>

1307
01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:42.680
<v Speaker 1>to thrive and succeed in Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I got thinking about like,</v>

1308
01:14:46.530 --> 01:14:50.190
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking a lot about just this</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole concept of like saying goodbye.</v>

1309
01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:52.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1310
01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:54.210
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like we're not ready.</v>

1311
01:14:54.211 --> 01:14:55.044
<v Speaker 1>We're not trained at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we don't ever think about death or </v>

1312
01:14:57.211 --> 01:15:00.630
<v Speaker 1>like how to say goodbye to loved ones or</v>
<v Speaker 1>even for us to say goodbye.</v>

1313
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:03.810
<v Speaker 1>We don't confront death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always like swept under the rug.</v>
