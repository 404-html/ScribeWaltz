<v Speaker 1>but that was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was good.</v>

61
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and then more people did it and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>all from that first 200 likes,</v>

63
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.770
<v Speaker 1>kind of like a steady climb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

64
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.330
<v Speaker 1>I was Kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

65
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.113
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to think that it was inevitable</v>
<v Speaker 1>because your style is so unique and </v>

66
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.000
<v Speaker 1>everything about like your editing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

67
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.530
<v Speaker 1>you have such a refined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific style,</v>

68
00:03:01.531 --> 00:03:02.500
<v Speaker 1>so unique to you.</v>

69
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.980
<v Speaker 1>I think it was inevitable destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very much that's very kind of,</v>

70
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:12.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>metal that.</v>

71
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the strategy.</v>

72
00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>I was doing it for a long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time,</v>

73
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

74
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 1>How long were you doing it before </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody noticed?</v>

75
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started the five day schedule in early</v>

76
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:23.710
<v Speaker 1>2014,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was basically where I just snapped</v>

77
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:24.544
<v Speaker 1>because before that it was like I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do a million things and thought I </v>

78
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 1>could do anything but didn't know how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it together.</v>

79
00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:32.560
<v Speaker 1>But finally somewhere along the line I </v>
<v Speaker 1>just snapped and I just said,</v>

80
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:36.360
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing five days a week video every</v>

81
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.091
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

82
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:39.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to grind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what.</v>

83
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>put all this stuff in my mind,</v>

84
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.990
<v Speaker 1>so I'm just going to force myself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

85
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:44.321
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

86
00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:44.810
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

87
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:45.643
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And unfortunately they have to be very </v>

88
00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 1>short if you do one every single day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why did you decide to.</v>

89
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 1>What did you think the vine was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right medium?</v>

90
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't until.</v>

91
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know about vine yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing it on the website,</v>

92
00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 1>actually just the website for the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>

93
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 1>They'll works.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

94
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone told me,</v>

95
00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:04.781
<v Speaker 1>a friend said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

96
00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:06.460
<v Speaker 1>you're making videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you put them on Youtube?</v>

97
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:08.470
<v Speaker 1>And I say I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

98
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.333
<v Speaker 1>I like it when it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get the file and you can just </v>

99
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:11.674
<v Speaker 1>watch the file,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't really like streaming </v>

100
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:13.834
<v Speaker 1>actually because I like to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pause it and horse it around and really </v>

101
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:18.880
<v Speaker 1>see what you're dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

102
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.550
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really like youtube but,</v>

103
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.660
<v Speaker 1>but he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>

104
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:22.900
<v Speaker 1>you got to be on youtube so okay.</v>

105
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.853
<v Speaker 1>So I did you to boot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So which is a pretty cool but I don't </v>

106
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.240
<v Speaker 1>know him well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you had your break on mine.</v>

107
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.070
<v Speaker 1>That was probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

108
00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:36.904
<v Speaker 1>it was where things started and you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>posting simultaneously to youtube and </v>

109
00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:40.564
<v Speaker 1>vine at the trick was I had already gone</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to two week on youtube and then I </v>

110
00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:46.780
<v Speaker 1>discovered vine and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be,</v>

111
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.200
<v Speaker 1>would be great because you can't go </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer so no one can be mad at,</v>

112
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

113
00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:52.474
<v Speaker 1>And they loop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the best way to watch short videos </v>

114
00:04:53.531 --> 00:04:56.740
<v Speaker 1>anyways to see him over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I figured so I put them there.</v>

115
00:04:56.741 --> 00:04:57.574
<v Speaker 1>I started putting them all there in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order and I had to do a little bit of </v>

116
00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:05.710
<v Speaker 1>editing to square them and in some cases</v>
<v Speaker 1>edit them down to six from,</v>

117
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:07.340
<v Speaker 1>in some cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 seconds down to six.</v>

118
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.680
<v Speaker 1>And that was kinda fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

119
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.593
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put it in there and I wasn't even </v>

120
00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:13.360
<v Speaker 1>going to touch them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I was doing twitter too,</v>

121
00:05:13.361 --> 00:05:15.760
<v Speaker 1>so I had decent following on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone,</v>

122
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.520
<v Speaker 1>someone found me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said it was,</v>

123
00:05:17.521 --> 00:05:19.570
<v Speaker 1>it was someone found me there and then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>

124
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so do you think that that has.</v>

125
00:05:23.321 --> 00:05:27.910
<v Speaker 1>So for this amount of time you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>craning on vine doing a video five times</v>

126
00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:28.744
<v Speaker 1>a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like that was like a really </v>

127
00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:33.070
<v Speaker 1>important creative time in your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

128
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.220
<v Speaker 1>well unfortunately I was desperate to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop as soon as,</v>

129
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.560
<v Speaker 1>as soon as it got going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>

130
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.553
<v Speaker 1>because I already had like at that point</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing two a week on youtube and </v>

131
00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:46.240
<v Speaker 1>then as soon as I discovered the vines </v>
<v Speaker 1>started to do its thing,</v>

132
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.901
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

133
00:05:46.901 --> 00:05:49.780
<v Speaker 1>well I got all of these on hand because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't done uploading them all.</v>

134
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.600
<v Speaker 1>So then I said okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to.</v>

135
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Well hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had a back log?</v>

136
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I had,</v>

137
00:05:54.611 --> 00:05:55.444
<v Speaker 1>because it was like a year after year </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a half after I'd started them five </v>

138
00:05:57.681 --> 00:06:01.440
<v Speaker 1>days a week that I started on vine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you are grant the microwave?</v>

139
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

140
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.113
<v Speaker 1>so you were grinding and grinding and </v>
<v Speaker 1>private and you had this incredible </v>

141
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.450
<v Speaker 1>backlog of content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wasn't private.</v>

142
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:09.880
<v Speaker 1>It was on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

143
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.730
<v Speaker 1>And it was on the website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it hadn't reached a mass audience.</v>

144
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.811
<v Speaker 1>So you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

145
00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:15.644
<v Speaker 1>I've got like a whole library of content</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you were getting followers before </v>

146
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:21.620
<v Speaker 1>you even were forced to make new stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>on vine,</v>

147
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:23.390
<v Speaker 1>but you were editing it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

148
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:24.111
<v Speaker 1>So I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

149
00:06:24.111 --> 00:06:24.944
<v Speaker 1>So I figured I have these on hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would edit them and release them </v>

150
00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:28.034
<v Speaker 1>one a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was easy enough because I was </v>

151
00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:32.780
<v Speaker 1>doing two new ones and seven days a week</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just figured since I have them I'll do</v>

152
00:06:32.781 --> 00:06:33.900
<v Speaker 1>7:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>PM every single day.</v>

153
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.020
<v Speaker 1>So and then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

154
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.063
<v Speaker 1>according to my calculations in two </v>
<v Speaker 1>months I'm going to run out of content </v>

155
00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:41.240
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to have to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>

156
00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:42.074
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to either put the vine</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing down to two a week or accelerate </v>

157
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.863
<v Speaker 1>everything to seven a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was even more than I was doing </v>

158
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:50.234
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was after I was so sick of </v>

159
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:51.854
<v Speaker 1>doing short videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could just cry and I was already </v>

160
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:55.820
<v Speaker 1>thinking about doing much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much bigger things.</v>

161
00:06:55.821 --> 00:06:57.110
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about history at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

162
00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.660
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now I'm stuck doing seven,</v>

163
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.770
<v Speaker 1>seven short videos a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how important was it for you to have</v>

164
00:07:03.771 --> 00:07:06.260
<v Speaker 1>a schedule to really stick to it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

165
00:07:06.261 --> 00:07:08.000
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's life or death really?</v>

166
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.700
<v Speaker 1>Because if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you don't,</v>

167
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 1>you'll drown because you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's infinite.</v>

168
00:07:12.621 --> 00:07:14.090
<v Speaker 1>You could spend infinite time then </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

169
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.373
<v Speaker 1>So wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying the schedule helps you </v>

170
00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:19.280
<v Speaker 1>escape the work or focused on the work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It helps you.</v>

171
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.190
<v Speaker 1>It helps the thing get done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

172
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.730
<v Speaker 1>because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when we started we also for some</v>

173
00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:26.564
<v Speaker 1>reason had this idea that we got to post</v>
<v Speaker 1>a video a week and we were so strict on </v>

174
00:07:29.901 --> 00:07:31.580
<v Speaker 1>that and I don't even know where he came</v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

175
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.530
<v Speaker 1>We just had this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean back in the day?</v>

176
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it was just a personal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a,</v>

177
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.620
<v Speaker 1>it's what kept me motivated and kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>because like you said,</v>

178
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.210
<v Speaker 1>you can focus forever on something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You at a certain point got to cut for so</v>

179
00:07:47.211 --> 00:07:51.170
<v Speaker 1>many reasons why I love the speed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the schedule.</v>

180
00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:52.910
<v Speaker 1>So many reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's life or death.</v>

181
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:54.463
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not true because some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them were done without a schedule and </v>

182
00:07:56.541 --> 00:07:59.150
<v Speaker 1>they need it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I'm off schedule,</v>

183
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.163
<v Speaker 1>I get obsessed with schedules and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>start watching behind the scenes a </v>

184
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.590
<v Speaker 1>seinfeld documentaries behind the scenes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of that.</v>

185
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.560
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen the south park one six </v>
<v Speaker 1>days to air?</v>

186
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.550
<v Speaker 1>I had a while ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just incredible.</v>

187
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.470
<v Speaker 1>I even get addicted to like how stressed</v>
<v Speaker 1>out they get.</v>

188
00:08:15.471 --> 00:08:17.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

189
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.170
<v Speaker 1>not that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

190
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.420
<v Speaker 1>You romanticize that little I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

191
00:08:20.421 --> 00:08:21.171
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I am.</v>

192
00:08:21.171 --> 00:08:22.004
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I'm not on a schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get so obsessed with being on a </v>

193
00:08:23.781 --> 00:08:27.080
<v Speaker 1>schedule because it goes on forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

194
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Especially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're a perfectionist,</v>

195
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm kind of a raging </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectionist so you know there's there.</v>

196
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll go on forever.</v>

197
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:35.913
<v Speaker 1>What was that quite?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've said you're a perfectionist and </v>

198
00:08:37.071 --> 00:08:37.904
<v Speaker 1>that sparked in me comment that Ila </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought that she thought was wonderful </v>

199
00:08:40.341 --> 00:08:41.174
<v Speaker 1>and I was struck question because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a question thread that we put on </v>

200
00:08:44.751 --> 00:08:49.380
<v Speaker 1>our separated people to submit questions</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you and there was a question there.</v>

201
00:08:49.381 --> 00:08:53.390
<v Speaker 1>That was my favorite and it was how did </v>
<v Speaker 1>you kill perfectionism?</v>

202
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

203
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.990
<v Speaker 1>you can use a steam roller or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bulldozer.</v>

204
00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.393
<v Speaker 1>It becomes incredibly important to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you have it as badly as I do </v>

205
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.743
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're never going to get anywhere </v>

206
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:08.370
<v Speaker 1>unless you have a serious strategy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>steam rolling right over professional.</v>

207
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.233
<v Speaker 1>So you start to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one called a Monday good fire </v>

208
00:09:11.581 --> 00:09:12.900
<v Speaker 1>truck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>

209
00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:15.210
<v Speaker 1>that's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I hit the mark the best in terms</v>

210
00:09:15.211 --> 00:09:16.920
<v Speaker 1>of flattening perfectionism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

211
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.593
<v Speaker 1>just just mash it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That satisfies you when you smash your </v>

212
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:26.040
<v Speaker 1>perfection is if it means you can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>something done instead of if not.</v>

213
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:27.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

214
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.910
<v Speaker 1>And after you create a work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you look back and see like,</v>

215
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.440
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could have done this different or that</v>

216
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:33.840
<v Speaker 1>different or that's in the past and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>time to move forward?</v>

217
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.820
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

218
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're happy?</v>

219
00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:36.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

220
00:09:36.981 --> 00:09:39.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't look interesting and so scary.</v>

221
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:43.890
<v Speaker 1>The schedule defeats the perfectionism </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you hit your schedule,</v>

222
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.060
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

223
00:09:45.061 --> 00:09:46.400
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't impede the perfectionism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

224
00:09:46.401 --> 00:09:47.080
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

225
00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.400
<v Speaker 1>it's like a tool to rags you along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

226
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get beat up and cut,</v>

227
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:56.070
<v Speaker 1>but you get there and you get stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

228
00:09:56.071 --> 00:09:57.510
<v Speaker 1>The thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking of which the vine,</v>

229
00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:01.230
<v Speaker 1>when I ran out of vines had to do them </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast and then I was doing,</v>

230
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.123
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started doing a history of Japan and so </v>

231
00:10:04.231 --> 00:10:05.064
<v Speaker 1>I flipped my schedule around and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>started doing a history first in the </v>

232
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.420
<v Speaker 1>earlier in the day and then just wait </v>
<v Speaker 1>until the last two hours to do,</v>

233
00:10:12.421 --> 00:10:13.560
<v Speaker 1>to do the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do the vine.</v>

234
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:18.030
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had some crazy times and I was,</v>

235
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:18.953
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned so many new tricks and </v>

236
00:10:20.011 --> 00:10:22.440
<v Speaker 1>techniques that I never would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned if I didn't have to,</v>

237
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crunch down.</v>

238
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:24.623
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that because you're most productive </v>

239
00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:26.874
<v Speaker 1>in the morning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like your strongest worth because you </v>

240
00:10:28.381 --> 00:10:31.860
<v Speaker 1>said you did the history in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 1>and know the reason for that.</v>

241
00:10:31.861 --> 00:10:34.930
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to get ahead of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>schedule with the,</v>

242
00:10:34.931 --> 00:10:36.390
<v Speaker 1>with the vines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

243
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.700
<v Speaker 1>but that never works because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>deadline is not there.</v>

244
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:39.563
<v Speaker 1>So I would spend six hours doing one </v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I thought I was going as </v>

245
00:10:41.701 --> 00:10:43.020
<v Speaker 1>fast as I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't.</v>

246
00:10:43.021 --> 00:10:43.651
<v Speaker 1>So I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

247
00:10:43.651 --> 00:10:44.484
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to get this history thing </v>

248
00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:48.390
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prioritize that as much as you can first</v>

249
00:10:48.391 --> 00:10:49.830
<v Speaker 1>and then about 4:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

250
00:10:49.831 --> 00:10:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Just run for it and see what you can get</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

251
00:10:51.381 --> 00:10:52.214
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how many hours a day do you </v>

252
00:10:54.051 --> 00:10:55.970
<v Speaker 1>work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds you are incredibly productive.</v>

253
00:10:55.971 --> 00:10:56.804
<v Speaker 1>You are incredibly focused on your work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell by the volume and just in </v>

254
00:11:00.781 --> 00:11:01.614
<v Speaker 1>your website and your work has so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>detail and I mean how much do you do </v>

255
00:11:06.571 --> 00:11:09.870
<v Speaker 1>work and as much as possible how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours as possible,</v>

256
00:11:09.871 --> 00:11:11.250
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is I know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to say.</v>

257
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.420
<v Speaker 1>You're going to say you got to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaks and stuff.</v>

258
00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:13.530
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

259
00:11:13.531 --> 00:11:15.990
<v Speaker 1>most people say that we have as much as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>

260
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.153
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is when the problem is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you work too much and then it </v>

261
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:22.074
<v Speaker 1>starts fucking all of a sudden you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out of bed in the morning or if you </v>

262
00:11:24.631 --> 00:11:28.200
<v Speaker 1>have relationships or other things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do that you are,</v>

263
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:32.100
<v Speaker 1>but if you like what you do and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what gets you out of the bed,</v>

264
00:11:32.101 --> 00:11:33.930
<v Speaker 1>then work as much as you got them all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please.</v>

265
00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:35.103
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I think I naturally tend to take a </v>

266
00:11:37.831 --> 00:11:39.990
<v Speaker 1>break even though I want to admit it </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>

267
00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:42.420
<v Speaker 1>even if it's time crunched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy time crunch.</v>

268
00:11:42.421 --> 00:11:43.254
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I'll just go face down into </v>
<v Speaker 1>bed just for 20 minutes just because I </v>

269
00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:50.040
<v Speaker 1>can't even just face down but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I can't.</v>

270
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.750
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know it's like,</v>

271
00:11:51.751 --> 00:11:52.531
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good to take breaks,</v>

272
00:11:52.531 --> 00:11:54.860
<v Speaker 1>but how long should the breakbeat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how often should the brakes?</v>

273
00:11:54.861 --> 00:11:55.860
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never.</v>

274
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

275
00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.710
<v Speaker 1>He'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I don't admit it.</v>

276
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.990
<v Speaker 1>I never admitted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

277
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:02.824
<v Speaker 1>I had that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My problem is that I'll spend all day </v>

278
00:12:05.531 --> 00:12:09.640
<v Speaker 1>working are all spend all day being </v>
<v Speaker 1>busy,</v>

279
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.020
<v Speaker 1>but then when I look back over the day I</v>
<v Speaker 1>never took a break necessarily.</v>

280
00:12:14.021 --> 00:12:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Like where I'm like to step separate </v>
<v Speaker 1>from my work,</v>

281
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:21.400
<v Speaker 1>but somehow I was less productive than I</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought I wasn't working the whole day.</v>

282
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know when I took breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

283
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a strategy for that really.</v>

284
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:28.023
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

285
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:28.863
<v Speaker 1>but when the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When things take way too long as it is </v>

286
00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:33.700
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

287
00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:34.990
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no time to lose,</v>

288
00:12:34.991 --> 00:12:35.780
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

289
00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.330
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to make sure.</v>

290
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Do you have hobbies outside of a film </v>
<v Speaker 1>and music?</v>

291
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.190
<v Speaker 1>Luckily I've been able to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporate most of them.</v>

292
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to incorporate all of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>

293
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like anagrams.</v>

294
00:12:49.181 --> 00:12:52.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean I used to just integrate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit is banana.</v>

295
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.600
<v Speaker 1>I have to say I can't believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So bill,</v>

296
00:12:55.601 --> 00:12:58.540
<v Speaker 1>for context on his website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Wirtz.com.</v>

297
00:12:58.541 --> 00:13:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Is that slash anagrams a no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A yes.</v>

298
00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:03.610
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

299
00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:04.850
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

300
00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:07.043
<v Speaker 1>people submit sentences for you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Anagram and you'll unscramble it and </v>

301
00:13:12.491 --> 00:13:15.070
<v Speaker 1>make a new phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that eh?</v>

302
00:13:15.071 --> 00:13:18.160
<v Speaker 1>And some of them are really incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can pull some examples up down</v>

303
00:13:18.161 --> 00:13:19.210
<v Speaker 1>that we can read it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real well.</v>

304
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:20.063
<v Speaker 1>Got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are really inappropriate </v>

305
00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:22.630
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well,</v>

306
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.910
<v Speaker 1>family shout out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw the family watching,</v>

307
00:13:24.911 --> 00:13:27.850
<v Speaker 1>but they'll have to endure for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

308
00:13:27.851 --> 00:13:29.960
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very tempting to make them.</v>

309
00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:31.263
<v Speaker 1>Dan sent me something here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say thank you for your recent </v>

310
00:13:34.361 --> 00:13:35.194
<v Speaker 1>purchase was the submission and bill </v>
<v Speaker 1>turned it into try our corn cake </v>

311
00:13:39.221 --> 00:13:42.700
<v Speaker 1>funhouse therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then another one,</v>

312
00:13:42.701 --> 00:13:45.400
<v Speaker 1>the joy of painting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fight to enjoy pain.</v>

313

<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

314
00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:49.870
<v Speaker 1>That is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That in your mind you can anagram.</v>

315
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.400
<v Speaker 1>No it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not in my mind.</v>

316
00:13:51.401 --> 00:13:52.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can use computers now.</v>

317
00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you use like a website though,</v>

318
00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:55.643
<v Speaker 1>a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know people are going to say I'll use </v>

319
00:13:56.351 --> 00:13:57.850
<v Speaker 1>computers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A computer won't give you that.</v>

320
00:13:57.851 --> 00:13:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Look it along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like go get a really long uh,</v>

321
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.230
<v Speaker 1>help me out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

322
00:14:01.231 --> 00:14:01.671
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

323
00:14:01.671 --> 00:14:03.810
<v Speaker 1>what's your technique then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you go?</v>

324
00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.691
<v Speaker 1>Jeez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I.</v>

325
00:14:04.691 --> 00:14:05.471
<v Speaker 1>can you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

326
00:14:05.471 --> 00:14:07.990
<v Speaker 1>this is the match would never tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

327
00:14:07.991 --> 00:14:09.190
<v Speaker 1>but you just gotta to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

328
00:14:09.191 --> 00:14:10.024
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

329
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:10.973
<v Speaker 1>Well if you have these in their need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find out where the V is going to go </v>

330
00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:16.850
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise it'll turn up leftover</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have,</v>

331
00:14:16.851 --> 00:14:17.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to take care of,</v>

332
00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.200
<v Speaker 1>you got to take care of that and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just try some stuff.</v>

333
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.100
<v Speaker 1>And then also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

334
00:14:21.101 --> 00:14:23.380
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good if it relates to the thing,</v>

335
00:14:23.381 --> 00:14:25.780
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's a longer thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you know,</v>

336
00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:26.793
<v Speaker 1>try to try to think of what words you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna need to relate and just take care </v>

337
00:14:28.541 --> 00:14:29.374
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The long ones are fun because you can </v>

338
00:14:30.821 --> 00:14:31.654
<v Speaker 1>start out saying anything you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the letters are going to be </v>

339
00:14:33.251 --> 00:14:34.600
<v Speaker 1>there and then you get down to the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

340
00:14:34.601 --> 00:14:36.050
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have like a surprise,</v>

341
00:14:36.051 --> 00:14:39.830
<v Speaker 1>huge surplus of ends and start over and </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to work some more ins and outs.</v>

342
00:14:39.831 --> 00:14:40.664
<v Speaker 1>And what is it about anagrams that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinates you that that's a hobby of </v>

343
00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:44.680
<v Speaker 1>yours?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

344
00:14:44.681 --> 00:14:46.810
<v Speaker 1>I started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to my friend's house at one point</v>

345
00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.673
<v Speaker 1>long time ago when he was rearranging </v>
<v Speaker 1>scrabble tiles of just doing people's </v>

346
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.330
<v Speaker 1>names and I was just for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I just went home and started doing it</v>

347
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.340
<v Speaker 1>and I've been doing it ever since.</v>

348
00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tend to do like the things that are in</v>

349
00:14:58.131 --> 00:15:00.560
<v Speaker 1>my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I would get a job I would do the</v>

350
00:15:00.561 --> 00:15:02.880
<v Speaker 1>name of the job or did you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

351
00:15:02.881 --> 00:15:04.250
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just been something I've done for a</v>

352
00:15:04.251 --> 00:15:06.140
<v Speaker 1>long time and finally I was able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrate it into the,</v>

353
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.480
<v Speaker 1>into the science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely noticed in your videos,</v>

354
00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:11.590
<v Speaker 1>in your lyrics are very much kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>script,</v>

355
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:14.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mixing up words and a lot of wordplay.</v>

356
00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

357
00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:20.060
<v Speaker 1>when you plan your videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you plan out like how meticulously do</v>

358
00:15:20.061 --> 00:15:23.780
<v Speaker 1>plan out and how much is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you've like remix jazz and you're</v>

359
00:15:23.781 --> 00:15:28.781
<v Speaker 1>kind of a fan of or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you have where you remixed gas,</v>

360
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh I,</v>

361
00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.940
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of like Coltrane and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

362
00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like jam jam sessions.</v>

363
00:15:34.431 --> 00:15:37.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like when it's like the way,</v>

364
00:15:37.491 --> 00:15:38.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean jazz in that sense.</v>

365
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.433
<v Speaker 1>It's like when a bunch of guys get </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and read standards like out of </v>

366
00:15:43.581 --> 00:15:46.340
<v Speaker 1>the real book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens to be,</v>

367
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:47.203
<v Speaker 1>except it's just me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I mean is how much of it is </v>

368
00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:49.723
<v Speaker 1>improvised because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems somewhat random but very </v>

369
00:15:51.591 --> 00:15:53.870
<v Speaker 1>controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're making a video,</v>

370
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:58.760
<v Speaker 1>do you make up anything as you go or do </v>
<v Speaker 1>mit or is it completely planned out?</v>

371
00:15:58.761 --> 00:16:02.930
<v Speaker 1>And then you execute the visual would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of as I go along,</v>

372
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.190
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the audience,</v>

373
00:16:06.191 --> 00:16:07.024
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the words melodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the exact chords and the timing of all </v>

374
00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:11.843
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that's spoken or sung and the </v>

375
00:16:13.071 --> 00:16:15.440
<v Speaker 1>exact chords in the exact timing is all </v>
<v Speaker 1>written.</v>

376
00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:16.623
<v Speaker 1>If that's written,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else is just usually implied </v>

377
00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.193
<v Speaker 1>from there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I just fill in the space and </v>

378
00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:23.840
<v Speaker 1>the underscoring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

379
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:26.450
<v Speaker 1>sorry to the underscoring music.</v>

380
00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:29.900
<v Speaker 1>So the extra little instrumental stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that goes in between when I'm speaking,</v>

381
00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.860
<v Speaker 1>that's all done after of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes sense to,</v>

382
00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.600
<v Speaker 1>to sort of support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you,</v>

383
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:38.630
<v Speaker 1>you do the music first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like the built around,</v>

384
00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:40.480
<v Speaker 1>not that music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

385
00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.360
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that's sung or spoken?</v>

386
00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:47.150
<v Speaker 1>I do that first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The underscoring music is done after.</v>

387
00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:49.570
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've had a long one here.</v>

388
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.170
<v Speaker 1>Back to the anagrams here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does this start?</v>

389
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super Sonic game.</v>

390
00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Mega percussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does it start?</v>

391
00:16:56.631 --> 00:16:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Cringe Poland's USS as long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not long.</v>

392
00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.910
<v Speaker 1>That's a short one for horizontal value </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

393
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.140
<v Speaker 1>That one I had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

394
00:17:03.141 --> 00:17:03.831
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

395
00:17:03.831 --> 00:17:04.161
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

396
00:17:04.161 --> 00:17:05.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

397
00:17:05.091 --> 00:17:06.200
<v Speaker 1>step it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a law.</v>

398
00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.560
<v Speaker 1>If anyone's wondering if anyone's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>wondering the answer to that point along</v>

399
00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:14.750
<v Speaker 1>his group is gruesome panics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use more spacing.</v>

400
00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.060
<v Speaker 1>It's escapism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gone.</v>

401
00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.040
<v Speaker 1>So you have choices.</v>

402
00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.540
<v Speaker 1>Some of them I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here we go.</v>

403
00:17:20.541 --> 00:17:21.374
<v Speaker 1>Here's a long one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope doing these anagrams provide you </v>

404
00:17:24.891 --> 00:17:25.724
<v Speaker 1>with an intellectual challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the submission and here's bill's </v>

405
00:17:28.641 --> 00:17:31.460
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guide me now as I get lunch,</v>

406
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.510
<v Speaker 1>pray to religions and escape the hot </v>
<v Speaker 1>lava and hell,</v>

407
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:36.603
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible that you untangle </v>

408
00:17:38.931 --> 00:17:39.800
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

409
00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:41.870
<v Speaker 1>I think once you start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you start doing them,</v>

410
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.170
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see a pattern.</v>

411
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no it's not,</v>

412
00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:47.090
<v Speaker 1>it's just you just start to find stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a high standard,</v>

413
00:17:47.091 --> 00:17:48.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have to just look and you know,</v>

414
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.060
<v Speaker 1>once you start to get ones that are like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that good,</v>

415
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.220
<v Speaker 1>then you start to like really get </v>
<v Speaker 1>excited.</v>

416
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.300
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything interesting in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that like this,</v>

417
00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:58.163
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole sentence with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative meaning in that original </v>

418
00:18:01.351 --> 00:18:02.184
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there something that fascinates you </v>

419
00:18:03.001 --> 00:18:03.834
<v Speaker 1>about just which one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're writing a whole new thought </v>

420
00:18:07.051 --> 00:18:08.400
<v Speaker 1>just from the original one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

421
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.540
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's a thread somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout your work.</v>

422
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:13.703
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

423
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Let's Anagram that I can't do it right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

424
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:24.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm so history of Japan when that came </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

425
00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:29.310
<v Speaker 1>That was an incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible explosion.</v>

426
00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so popular.</v>

427
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean right now I think it has 43 </v>

428
00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:34.380
<v Speaker 1>million views,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

429
00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:35.453
<v Speaker 1>But that's now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think it had something like </v>

430
00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:40.260
<v Speaker 1>just in the first week at like over 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million views or something or even more.</v>

431
00:18:40.261 --> 00:18:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

432
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.230
<v Speaker 1>probably about 10 maybe after a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>of weeks.</v>

433
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.720
<v Speaker 1>So surely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were just blown away by it.</v>

434
00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was so tired of being stuck on</v>

435
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.070
<v Speaker 1>a vine stuck under seven seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

436
00:18:53.071 --> 00:18:54.330
<v Speaker 1>I was desperate to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

437
00:18:54.331 --> 00:18:57.840
<v Speaker 1>if only I could do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so in a way was a react because this</v>

438
00:18:57.841 --> 00:19:02.040
<v Speaker 1>was a really epic undertaking and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a reaction to being like,</v>

439
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.020
<v Speaker 1>I hate doing the small stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to do a huge.</v>

440
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.580
<v Speaker 1>I didn't hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved it.</v>

441
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.710
<v Speaker 1>And when I would sit down to write a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of new ones,</v>

442
00:19:07.711 --> 00:19:09.570
<v Speaker 1>I got really excited every time button </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

443
00:19:09.571 --> 00:19:12.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really wanted to do something the same</v>

444
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.143
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tell me how long did it take you to </v>

445
00:19:13.951 --> 00:19:16.650
<v Speaker 1>create that video?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fourteen weeks.</v>

446
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

447
00:19:19.741 --> 00:19:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Because on Youtube people do not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People spend one day,</v>

448
00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:28.200
<v Speaker 1>but it paid off in 14 weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My God.</v>

449
00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:29.173
<v Speaker 1>Tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did you do you don't want to know </v>

450
00:19:30.451 --> 00:19:34.870
<v Speaker 1>how long history of the world took.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do want to um,</v>

451
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:37.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did you decide on Japan?</v>

452
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Are you a fan of Japanese culture in any</v>
<v Speaker 1>way?</v>

453
00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:42.420
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an expert really.</v>

454
00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:47.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was during for temporarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did.</v>

455
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:52.730
<v Speaker 1>I wrote one for the United States much </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier because I wanted to do that.</v>

456
00:19:52.951 --> 00:19:54.200
<v Speaker 1>So you'll have this grip for us.</v>

457
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.590
<v Speaker 1>Never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never got finished.</v>

458
00:19:55.591 --> 00:19:59.160
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was going really well,</v>

459
00:19:59.161 --> 00:20:00.150
<v Speaker 1>but it kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

460
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.030
<v Speaker 1>I'd never done this before so I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really know it was kind of falling apart</v>

461
00:20:03.031 --> 00:20:05.400
<v Speaker 1>because it kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew too much about certain things.</v>

462
00:20:05.401 --> 00:20:07.560
<v Speaker 1>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't happen.</v>

463
00:20:07.561 --> 00:20:10.290
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when I came around to try it again,</v>

464
00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:11.573
<v Speaker 1>I said I got to pick something that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really know about interests so </v>

465
00:20:15.511 --> 00:20:16.344
<v Speaker 1>that I can just learn about it from </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning to end and then just spit it </v>

466
00:20:18.541 --> 00:20:19.800
<v Speaker 1>out so it won't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

467
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.490
<v Speaker 1>just as a challenge because if I can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that then I can do anything.</v>

468
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.370
<v Speaker 1>So that was the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's almost a nice quality too,</v>

469
00:20:26.371 --> 00:20:29.700
<v Speaker 1>I think in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the output when you don't know anything,</v>

470
00:20:29.701 --> 00:20:30.361
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

471
00:20:30.361 --> 00:20:33.200
<v Speaker 1>suit so much about USA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kind of muddles I,</v>

472
00:20:33.201 --> 00:20:34.034
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know too much about some aspects of </v>

473
00:20:34.941 --> 00:20:35.660
<v Speaker 1>not enough.</v>

474
00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

475
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:38.093
<v Speaker 1>what is your research procedure like </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know so much about so many </v>

476
00:20:42.421 --> 00:20:43.950
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all these little details,</v>

477
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:47.220
<v Speaker 1>it seems so well researched and you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got timelines,</v>

478
00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.690
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>

479
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:54.220
<v Speaker 1>how do you lay that out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't entirely remember actually.</v>

480
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:57.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean I did it very fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took a long time to make the video,</v>

481
00:20:57.761 --> 00:21:01.450
<v Speaker 1>but I was scrambling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how much time on research alone,</v>

482
00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:02.523
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that research and writing</v>
<v Speaker 1>was kind of together because I would </v>

483
00:21:05.501 --> 00:21:07.030
<v Speaker 1>just learn a bunch of stuff and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>write just.</v>

484
00:21:07.031 --> 00:21:08.920
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that was about a week.</v>

485
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:12.040
<v Speaker 1>I have the timeline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I posted the timeline somewhere.</v>

486
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.720
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

487
00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Writing and research was about a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And are you re your.</v>

488
00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:19.390
<v Speaker 1>I was always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering,</v>

489
00:21:19.391 --> 00:21:22.150
<v Speaker 1>do you find people like nitpicking your </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts?</v>

490
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that bother you or you're just like</v>

491
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:26.263
<v Speaker 1>and whatever?</v>

492
00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

493
00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:28.900
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes and no.</v>

494
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:29.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

495
00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:30.970
<v Speaker 1>I did the best I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

496
00:21:30.971 --> 00:21:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

497
00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.290
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

498
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:36.400
<v Speaker 1>And it is entertaining actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised at how few people do that.</v>

499
00:21:36.401 --> 00:21:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's your views and so many people.</v>

500
00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:41.374
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was really careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm obsessed with like </v>

501
00:21:43.091 --> 00:21:44.500
<v Speaker 1>geographical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

502
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:45.543
<v Speaker 1>accuracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I saw Japan video that I was </v>

503
00:21:47.111 --> 00:21:51.010
<v Speaker 1>watching like to learn stuff and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>had Kyoto really in the wrong place.</v>

504
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:54.340
<v Speaker 1>It was a cartoon drawing and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm just,</v>

505
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:58.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of obsessed with with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>while it showed,</v>

506
00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:58.953
<v Speaker 1>it's when I watched that you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a guy that knows what he's </v>

507
00:22:01.241 --> 00:22:03.550
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kind of has that vibe.</v>

508
00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:04.533
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you present yourself in that </v>

509
00:22:05.291 --> 00:22:07.660
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always people who are looking to</v>

510
00:22:07.661 --> 00:22:09.490
<v Speaker 1>like find one thing to nitpick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

511
00:22:09.491 --> 00:22:12.610
<v Speaker 1>I probably spend too long on those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things where I put the stars on the,</v>

512
00:22:12.611 --> 00:22:13.960
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the cities,</v>

513
00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>

514
00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:17.440
<v Speaker 1>I remember actually there was an early.</v>

515
00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:18.970
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen that since it came out by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>

516
00:22:18.971 --> 00:22:22.660
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's an early point where</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm showing where all the old,</v>

517
00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:25.810
<v Speaker 1>like clans are or the old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you haven't watched the video?</v>

518
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:30.080
<v Speaker 1>I've not seen it since it came out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why flashbacks?</v>

519
00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Flashbacks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of what?</v>

520
00:22:32.531 --> 00:22:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Just the just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

521
00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:35.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't watch videos after I make.</v>

522
00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.180
<v Speaker 1>I try no exception unless someone like </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces me to,</v>

523
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.090
<v Speaker 1>if I see it by accident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I was going to say is,</v>

524
00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:44.213
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably spend too long on those ones </v>

525
00:22:44.801 --> 00:22:46.810
<v Speaker 1>with the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you say that you're like,</v>

526
00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:50.350
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of like that one was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>millimeter like that one was.</v>

527
00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.513
<v Speaker 1>That one was difficult because it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient clans and stuff like that are </v>

528
00:22:53.621 --> 00:22:57.280
<v Speaker 1>ancient ancient locations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one of them is called Hai Hai.</v>

529
00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:00.180
<v Speaker 1>How do you google that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

530
00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:03.250
<v Speaker 1>took a long time and there was one for </v>
<v Speaker 1>history of the world where I showed like</v>

531
00:23:03.251 --> 00:23:04.084
<v Speaker 1>a million cities and I spent a long time</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting the exact coordinates all for </v>

532
00:23:08.111 --> 00:23:11.350
<v Speaker 1>like half a second on screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know what's wrong with me,</v>

533
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:12.100
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

534
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

535
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.680
<v Speaker 1>And I think something's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

536
00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.730
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got It all backward.</v>

537
00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.140
<v Speaker 1>I find it interesting that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch that video back.</v>

538
00:23:23.141 --> 00:23:24.700
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it so much.</v>

539
00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.920
<v Speaker 1>That video is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

540
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.100
<v Speaker 1>It's got to feel good help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost prolific.</v>

541
00:23:30.101 --> 00:23:33.040
<v Speaker 1>That video was how it kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reverberated through culture.</v>

542
00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.590
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was on reddit.</v>

543
00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.030
<v Speaker 1>It was online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was everywhere.</v>

544
00:23:37.031 --> 00:23:40.110
<v Speaker 1>It was on television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean everybody does.</v>

545
00:23:40.111 --> 00:23:43.120
<v Speaker 1>You see it on regular television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must have.</v>

546
00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.350
<v Speaker 1>I must have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

547
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:47.481
<v Speaker 1>maybe it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

548
00:23:47.481 --> 00:23:48.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people,</v>

549
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:50.780
<v Speaker 1>the way I remember it was people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching it.</v>

550
00:23:50.781 --> 00:23:53.540
<v Speaker 1>I remember Black Joe Rogan was watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and talking about it.</v>

551
00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:57.860
<v Speaker 1>It just was so prolific and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence.</v>

552
00:23:57.861 --> 00:23:58.694
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the mark of this insane quality </v>

553
00:24:01.671 --> 00:24:04.220
<v Speaker 1>that you brought to it that nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

554
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:05.960
<v Speaker 1>None of your contemporaries are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

555
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:08.600
<v Speaker 1>And I see you smiling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was too kind,</v>

556
00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:09.560
<v Speaker 1>too kind.</v>

557
00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's amazing.</v>

558
00:24:11.541 --> 00:24:13.160
<v Speaker 1>I think you're incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're a gift.</v>

559
00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh Geez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

560
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:19.730
<v Speaker 1>I love that part by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

561
00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:20.930
<v Speaker 1>when the nuke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

562
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Dan just founded on CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill,</v>

563
00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:26.480
<v Speaker 1>what's up now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>CNN doesn't count.</v>

564
00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:30.700
<v Speaker 1>Is it on CNN?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a clip on there.</v>

565
00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.630
<v Speaker 1>One of their youtube channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check it out later.</v>

566
00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't want to launch.</v>

567
00:24:34.031 --> 00:24:39.031
<v Speaker 1>CNN must've covered it at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where it's on television,</v>

568
00:24:39.441 --> 00:24:42.860
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love this moment.</v>

569
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:43.723
<v Speaker 1>My favorite moment with the Hiroshima.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does this for those of you who </v>

570
00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:49.843
<v Speaker 1>haven't seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean mostly I'm sure all of you have </v>

571
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:53.023
<v Speaker 1>history of Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the US drops the bomb on Japan and </v>

572
00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:59.750
<v Speaker 1>the video is very manic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super fast paced.</v>

573
00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:05.320
<v Speaker 1>It's very dense and then all the sudden </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom drops and it's just like.</v>

574
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:07.303
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and another one and it just gets quiet </v>

575
00:25:08.721 --> 00:25:12.140
<v Speaker 1>for a long time because of the manic </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of the video.</v>

576
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:12.973
<v Speaker 1>It makes that moment so powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been a long time getting that </v>

577
00:25:16.821 --> 00:25:17.654
<v Speaker 1>sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm layering windy sound and the huge </v>

578
00:25:21.321 --> 00:25:24.530
<v Speaker 1>bass sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just really feel that explosion.</v>

579
00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:25.393
<v Speaker 1>A lot of layers in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a drum and then it's pitch </v>

580
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.610
<v Speaker 1>pitch way down now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was there you.</v>

581
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:35.040
<v Speaker 1>You nailed that so beautifully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you read,</v>

582
00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:36.253
<v Speaker 1>was there something in your research </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that informed that when you were </v>

583
00:25:39.661 --> 00:25:41.390
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you felt the gravity of that?</v>

584
00:25:41.391 --> 00:25:44.000
<v Speaker 1>I know that I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's heavy,</v>

585
00:25:44.001 --> 00:25:48.330
<v Speaker 1>but like I feel like there was a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression there,</v>

586
00:25:48.331 --> 00:25:50.390
<v Speaker 1>a real empathy there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From what I heard,</v>

587
00:25:50.391 --> 00:25:53.390
<v Speaker 1>they dropped a bomb and destroy it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of like entire cities,</v>

588
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:55.760
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big deal.</v>

589
00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:57.350
<v Speaker 1>That's a big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

590
00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a big deal.</v>

591
00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

592
00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:04.243
<v Speaker 1>And then you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You touched on it again in history of </v>

593
00:26:05.211 --> 00:26:07.160
<v Speaker 1>the world in a really beautiful way to.</v>

594
00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.690
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did a game.</v>

595
00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:13.190
<v Speaker 1>The game show thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun because I got to hit the same.</v>

596
00:26:13.191 --> 00:26:15.470
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like back to the future to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit some of the same things,</v>

597
00:26:15.471 --> 00:26:16.730
<v Speaker 1>but do it a little bit differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

598
00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:18.613
<v Speaker 1>Actually the most fun part was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd like the video game soundtrack </v>

599
00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:21.890
<v Speaker 1>music for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that,</v>

600
00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.050
<v Speaker 1>for that section.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You play video games.</v>

601
00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:27.510
<v Speaker 1>There's no time anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No time became a play.</v>

602
00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Now is the one game where I make videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>so I.</v>

603
00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:32.610
<v Speaker 1>that's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

604
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:34.183
<v Speaker 1>I guess if more people thought about </v>
<v Speaker 1>life as a video game that might be more </v>

605
00:26:36.681 --> 00:26:37.514
<v Speaker 1>productive.</v>

606

766
00:34:42.741 --> 00:34:44.600

<v Speaker 1>But for some people,</v>

772

<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>

785
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:42.960
<v Speaker 1>I am captivated by your editing style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

<v Speaker 1>how did you develop that style?</v>

788
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:47.551
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

789
00:35:47.551 --> 00:35:48.930
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

<v Speaker 1>done?</v>

00:36:32.101 --> 00:36:33.120
<v Speaker 1>that's helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too Bad.</v>

809
00:36:33.121 --> 00:36:33.954
<v Speaker 1>I can't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

810
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:35.940
<v Speaker 1>a long way to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

811
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:36.930
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

812
00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:38.070
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's great.</v>

813
00:36:38.071 --> 00:36:40.660
<v Speaker 1>It's very specific style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do what,</v>

814
00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:42.660
<v Speaker 1>what do you edit and can I ask that just</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

815
00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:44.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a curious editor myself.</v>

816
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a hint,</v>

817
00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:53.240
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm screwed and a lot of a lot of people</v>

818
00:36:53.911 --> 00:36:54.744
<v Speaker 1>are in or we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if anyone's stayed screwed </v>

819
00:36:56.761 --> 00:36:58.350
<v Speaker 1>for this long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were to.</v>

820
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:59.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a popular program that was </v>

821
00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:05.180
<v Speaker 1>industry standard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know long time at a certain.</v>

822
00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:08.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a certain point they made another one</v>

823
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.000
<v Speaker 1>with the same name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

824
00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:11.220
<v Speaker 1>oops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different program.</v>

825
00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:12.540
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sure it's fine.</v>

826
00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Most people hated it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>X Ten,</v>

827
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:17.190
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people hated it when it came out.</v>

828
00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:18.243
<v Speaker 1>Then they bad mouth my trusted is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be okay because the other option is </v>

829
00:37:21.241 --> 00:37:23.240
<v Speaker 1>the one that you have to pay every month</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>

830
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:24.990
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do so.</v>

831
00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

832
00:37:26.341 --> 00:37:28.110
<v Speaker 1>I trust that it's gonna be okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to switch,</v>

833
00:37:28.111 --> 00:37:30.960
<v Speaker 1>but there's never a good time to relearn</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

834
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:31.793
<v Speaker 1>I know every week I learned a new thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the thing that I'm using and I've </v>

835
00:37:34.291 --> 00:37:34.921
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

836
00:37:34.921 --> 00:37:37.380
<v Speaker 1>if you want to know what it looked like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back to the first Monday video on the</v>

837
00:37:37.381 --> 00:37:38.214
<v Speaker 1>five day schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was about a Pelican or </v>

838
00:37:39.511 --> 00:37:42.750
<v Speaker 1>something and it's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like text and nothing.</v>

839
00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:44.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth is,</v>

840
00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:47.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean you are using what was considered</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry standard.</v>

841
00:37:47.641 --> 00:37:51.270
<v Speaker 1>It's not even that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the light light version of that.</v>

842
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's missing.</v>

843
00:37:52.711 --> 00:37:53.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've never seen it.</v>

844
00:37:53.971 --> 00:37:56.740
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got eight stuff.</v>

845
00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is,</v>

846
00:38:00.661 --> 00:38:01.494
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking forward to switching but </v>

847
00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:06.800
<v Speaker 1>because like we added put me here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

848
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:10.260
<v Speaker 1>I feel like with every upgrade they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually added some stuff that are.</v>

849
00:38:10.261 --> 00:38:14.920
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes they'll just break the </v>
<v Speaker 1>software and that was a true.</v>

850
00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Are saving so much time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say a new mask.</v>

851
00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:20.790
<v Speaker 1>And do you know anything about final cut</v>
<v Speaker 1>10?</v>

852
00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:24.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I used final cut but not 10.</v>

853
00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.950
<v Speaker 1>So that's the new one you have to pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>for?</v>

854
00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Or is that the one that uses x?</v>
<v Speaker 1>X is the one that x is what replaced.</v>

855
00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:32.483
<v Speaker 1>So which is what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've literally only met one person ever </v>

856
00:38:35.501 --> 00:38:37.090
<v Speaker 1>that liked X.</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else.</v>

857
00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.170
<v Speaker 1>But we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard,</v>

858
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:39.063
<v Speaker 1>I've heard the same rumors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have found at least two or three </v>

859
00:38:41.741 --> 00:38:43.030
<v Speaker 1>people that say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

860
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:44.440
<v Speaker 1>it's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry.</v>

861
00:38:44.441 --> 00:38:46.150
<v Speaker 1>It's getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's getting better.</v>

862
00:38:46.151 --> 00:38:46.984
<v Speaker 1>They say they're adding back all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and it's like the one I have is </v>

863
00:38:49.871 --> 00:38:53.800
<v Speaker 1>not even the one that you think I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worth so you can do.</v>

864
00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.490
<v Speaker 1>You can do it on anything as long as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>spend time with it and that's one of the</v>

865
00:38:57.491 --> 00:38:59.590
<v Speaker 1>reasons I don't like to go around saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>what program it is going to know.</v>

866
00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:00.423
<v Speaker 1>People are just eager to buy a thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think they're going to get a </v>

867
00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:03.650
<v Speaker 1>billboard that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an emulator.</v>

868
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:04.863
<v Speaker 1>They won't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That and that's true of kind of any art </v>

869
00:39:07.001 --> 00:39:07.834
<v Speaker 1>craft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have like a sick guitar or an </v>

870
00:39:09.821 --> 00:39:14.080
<v Speaker 1>amazing computer or whatever is the tool</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you use,</v>

871
00:39:14.081 --> 00:39:17.800
<v Speaker 1>you have to master your craft and here's</v>
<v Speaker 1>another thing that helps.</v>

872
00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:20.800
<v Speaker 1>If you get really crazy software before </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how to use it,</v>

873
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:23.860
<v Speaker 1>will it will ruin you and it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've been,</v>

874
00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:26.140
<v Speaker 1>I've been there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done that and.</v>

875
00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:26.993
<v Speaker 1>And you get frozen for for years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just don't even touch the thing </v>

876
00:39:29.921 --> 00:39:32.470
<v Speaker 1>because you don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So intimidating and not intuitive.</v>

877
00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these programs are not intuitive at all.</v>

878
00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:35.681
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might be,</v>

879
00:39:35.681 --> 00:39:37.390
<v Speaker 1>but it takes time to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a language,</v>

880
00:39:37.391 --> 00:39:37.960
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

881
00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:38.793
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

882
00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:39.873
<v Speaker 1>I think that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good advice for people who are </v>

883
00:39:41.261 --> 00:39:42.094
<v Speaker 1>trying to learn things is just get in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and do that first and then worry </v>

884
00:39:45.431 --> 00:39:47.340
<v Speaker 1>about the tools and just got to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

885
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:50.200
<v Speaker 1>you gotta use simpler tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you got to just use what you have</v>

886
00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:52.300
<v Speaker 1>used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's available and you know,</v>

887
00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:55.570
<v Speaker 1>you'll go really far and then by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time you're ready to,</v>

888
00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:57.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then one by one step by step you can get</v>

889
00:39:58.350 --> 00:39:59.183
<v Speaker 1>an upgrade.</v>

890
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:05.230
<v Speaker 1>But the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So did you develop this visual aesthetic</v>

891
00:40:05.231 --> 00:40:07.510
<v Speaker 1>with the title fonts that you use and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that?</v>

892
00:40:07.511 --> 00:40:11.440
<v Speaker 1>Is that something that you just started </v>
<v Speaker 1>with or is that something you developed?</v>

893
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:12.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to get by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

894
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does develop over time if you want to</v>

895
00:40:14.291 --> 00:40:15.760
<v Speaker 1>see what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

896
00:40:15.761 --> 00:40:17.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back to Monday,</v>

897
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Pelicans or whatever the heck that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

898
00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:22.330
<v Speaker 1>And then gradually just a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

899
00:40:22.331 --> 00:40:25.450
<v Speaker 1>And then when I started doing vines </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday really fast,</v>

900
00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:27.070
<v Speaker 1>it kind of accelerated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

901
00:40:27.071 --> 00:40:28.370
<v Speaker 1>I just started learning all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

902
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:30.340
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

903
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:32.103
<v Speaker 1>so let me ask you still learning stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean now I'm on a really tight </v>

904
00:40:34.511 --> 00:40:36.460
<v Speaker 1>schedule and I'm learning more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more.</v>

905
00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:38.980
<v Speaker 1>All good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm learning so much about editing.</v>

906
00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:42.910
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did what you said not to do and it was</v>

907
00:40:42.911 --> 00:40:46.210
<v Speaker 1>to my detriment because I learned how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>edit on premier,</v>

908
00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.313
<v Speaker 1>which is like the industry standard on </v>
<v Speaker 1>pcs and you when you don't know what </v>

909
00:40:51.641 --> 00:40:53.320
<v Speaker 1>you're doing and you don't know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right tools,</v>

910
00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:54.513
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so freaking slow and it's taken </v>

911
00:40:57.581 --> 00:40:58.510
<v Speaker 1>so long to catch up.</v>

912
00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Like I was working with an editor we had</v>
<v Speaker 1>hired just a couple of months ago.</v>

913
00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweet kid,</v>

914
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:04.343
<v Speaker 1>great kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to call him a kid that's </v>

915
00:41:05.741 --> 00:41:06.970
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a sweetheart.</v>

916
00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.820
<v Speaker 1>He's a great kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

917
00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:16.020
<v Speaker 1>and he taught me like a couple of little</v>
<v Speaker 1>key shortcuts that like changed my life.</v>

918
00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Like it's literally saves me hands up </v>
<v Speaker 1>ours.</v>

919
00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this crazy thing.</v>

920
00:41:24.071 --> 00:41:25.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing I use,</v>

921
00:41:25.631 --> 00:41:26.464
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of things that don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have shortcuts that drives me </v>

922
00:41:27.941 --> 00:41:28.810
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a trick,</v>

923
00:41:28.811 --> 00:41:33.230
<v Speaker 1>I use a on a Mac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could command question mark opens</v>

924
00:41:33.231 --> 00:41:34.064
<v Speaker 1>up the help menu and then you can type </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first two or three letters of what </v>

925
00:41:36.921 --> 00:41:37.754
<v Speaker 1>you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like eight strokes but I do it </v>

926
00:41:39.861 --> 00:41:40.940
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

927
00:41:40.941 --> 00:41:43.220
<v Speaker 1>you got to shortcut the shortcut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

928
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:44.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have all this.</v>

929
00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:45.860
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I'm going to be so screwed if</v>

930
00:41:45.861 --> 00:41:46.694
<v Speaker 1>I have to switch because it's like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep finding new little tricks and </v>

931
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:50.910
<v Speaker 1>inventing new tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or do you,</v>

932
00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:51.803
<v Speaker 1>when you edit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you on the laptop or a computer or </v>

933
00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:59.280
<v Speaker 1>laptop and to use a mouse?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

934
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a feeling,</v>

935
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:06.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had one of those nights,</v>

936
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:08.660
<v Speaker 1>I had one of those nice trackpads on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

937
00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:12.380
<v Speaker 1>but the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the batteries like leaked and it got the</v>

938
00:42:12.381 --> 00:42:15.620
<v Speaker 1>door that the battery door got stuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>that a usual,</v>

939
00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.513
<v Speaker 1>I could not get it open and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like leaking acid and then I </v>

940
00:42:19.311 --> 00:42:23.870
<v Speaker 1>couldn't get the thing I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot edit on a laptop,</v>

941
00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:26.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met a man without a mouse.</v>

942
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.983
<v Speaker 1>I mean the thought of that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable and it's a testament to </v>

943
00:42:28.941 --> 00:42:32.220
<v Speaker 1>your genius and dedication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I will say if I were a genius,</v>

944
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:33.950
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably get something better.</v>

945
00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:38.030
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is we're all screwed because</v>

946
00:42:38.031 --> 00:42:41.960
<v Speaker 1>if you go to system higher than whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one high Sierra was the one where it</v>

947
00:42:41.961 --> 00:42:44.570
<v Speaker 1>officially stopped working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>

948
00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:46.870
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the program doesn't work anymore and the</v>

949
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:49.940
<v Speaker 1>new computers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're limited.</v>

950
00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.520
<v Speaker 1>But I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

951
00:42:52.521 --> 00:42:53.540
<v Speaker 1>I'll say this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you run.</v>

952
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:54.523
<v Speaker 1>I knew a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may not know anything I'm talking </v>

953
00:42:56.391 --> 00:42:58.820
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it reminds me of this for all of you</v>

954
00:42:58.821 --> 00:43:03.050
<v Speaker 1>who have ever played world of warcraft </v>
<v Speaker 1>or serious video game.</v>

955
00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:04.600
<v Speaker 1>Do you play video games?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll work craft.</v>

956
00:43:04.601 --> 00:43:05.434
<v Speaker 1>Do you know about any of this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have time to do anything except </v>

957
00:43:07.731 --> 00:43:08.564
<v Speaker 1>make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately it was a very intense </v>

958
00:43:10.521 --> 00:43:11.354
<v Speaker 1>video game that's played with a mouse </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a keyboard and I have a friend who </v>

959
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:15.343
<v Speaker 1>clocked thousands of hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was in the highest level of rating of </v>

960
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:24.970
<v Speaker 1>collaborating with 40 plus people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high level raids and I played with him a</v>

961
00:43:26.091 --> 00:43:26.450
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

962
00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:27.283
<v Speaker 1>I was good friends with him and one day </v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to his house and I saw this kid </v>

963
00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:31.273
<v Speaker 1>on a laptop without a mouse and I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know it was possible to do that and I </v>

964
00:43:36.381 --> 00:43:37.214
<v Speaker 1>was absolutely blown away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was playing a high level game with a </v>

965
00:43:41.691 --> 00:43:42.524
<v Speaker 1>trackpad on a keyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It blew me away and I thought this man </v>

966
00:43:45.651 --> 00:43:49.400
<v Speaker 1>is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's incredible and I have this.</v>

967
00:43:49.401 --> 00:43:53.690
<v Speaker 1>I have this admiration for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To edit without a mouse is truly a feat.</v>

968
00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.850
<v Speaker 1>It's probably not smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably not smart,</v>

969
00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:57.133
<v Speaker 1>but the desk that anyone who supports me</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Patrion is going to get so mad </v>

970
00:44:00.381 --> 00:44:01.190
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

971
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:02.023
<v Speaker 1>because I'm not spending money on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a desk that is 10 years old and </v>

972
00:44:06.261 --> 00:44:08.960
<v Speaker 1>cost $10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably 10 bucks.</v>

973
00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Where'd you get it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

974
00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Convenience store pharmacies and those </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmacies.</v>

975
00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Now that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you and you bring up an interesting</v>

976
00:44:17.661 --> 00:44:20.210
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are supported primarily through your</v>

977
00:44:20.211 --> 00:44:21.620
<v Speaker 1>Patrion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that correct?</v>

978
00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:22.331
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

979
00:44:22.331 --> 00:44:23.990
<v Speaker 1>it's a combination of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

980
00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:25.830
<v Speaker 1>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

981
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:28.370
<v Speaker 1>But that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big piece of the puzzle.</v>

982
00:44:28.371 --> 00:44:29.360
<v Speaker 1>So patrion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

983
00:44:29.361 --> 00:44:30.194
<v Speaker 1>if you guys want to support bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it in the scripture and </v>

984
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:33.660
<v Speaker 1>Patrion.com/bill</v>
<v Speaker 1>wirtz,</v>

985
00:44:33.661 --> 00:44:34.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

986
00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:36.323
<v Speaker 1>And I have to apologize for my lack of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a social skills in tact and </v>

987
00:44:39.841 --> 00:44:42.690
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but thank you to anyone who has.</v>

988
00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:43.501
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

989
00:44:43.501 --> 00:44:46.620
<v Speaker 1>my patron is blank is blank and I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>never said,</v>

990
00:44:46.621 --> 00:44:48.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like really promoted.</v>

991
00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:49.950
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

992
00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:52.770
<v Speaker 1>but they are helping pay my rent </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>

993
00:44:52.771 --> 00:44:55.950
<v Speaker 1>So thank you for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think that's fair.</v>

994
00:44:55.951 --> 00:44:57.990
<v Speaker 1>When we were starting off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a patron,</v>

995
00:44:58.450 --> 00:44:59.283
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we also had it blank because I </v>

996
00:45:01.591 --> 00:45:03.030
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the point,</v>

997
00:45:03.031 --> 00:45:03.864
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they want you focusing on what </v>

998
00:45:06.241 --> 00:45:09.760
<v Speaker 1>you do and not necessarily trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make gifts and not central for people.</v>

999
00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:12.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure that's how I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

1000
00:45:12.481 --> 00:45:15.000
<v Speaker 1>thank you for supporting me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can continue to do what we do,</v>

1001
00:45:15.001 --> 00:45:16.410
<v Speaker 1>which is apparently what you want more </v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

1002
00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's perfectly fine.</v>

1003
00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:20.260
<v Speaker 1>I hope so and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1004
00:45:20.330 --> 00:45:23.760
<v Speaker 1>and very reasonable because I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have one and everyone said know,</v>

1005
00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:24.653
<v Speaker 1>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just at least make one </v>

1006
00:45:25.351 --> 00:45:26.184
<v Speaker 1>just so you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1007
00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:27.163
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah.</v>

1008
00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:30.720
<v Speaker 1>But is it true that you turn off ads on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your youtube video?</v>

1009
00:45:30.721 --> 00:45:31.554
<v Speaker 1>Not entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had them off for a long time and then </v>

1010
00:45:33.151 --> 00:45:35.220
<v Speaker 1>I realized that if you want to get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>red,</v>

1011
00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:36.773
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>income from that you have to go the way </v>

1012
00:45:39.061 --> 00:45:40.050
<v Speaker 1>they have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1013
00:45:40.051 --> 00:45:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Uncheck every box except for display </v>
<v Speaker 1>ads,</v>

1014
00:45:42.961 --> 00:45:44.490
<v Speaker 1>which is the one that puts a picture on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the side.</v>

1015
00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:47.410
<v Speaker 1>I still didn't want to do that for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time because,</v>

1016
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:49.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when I see ads,</v>

1017
00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:50.133
<v Speaker 1>like really when I see them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really makes me uncomfortable and </v>

1018
00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:53.490
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1019
00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:54.750
<v Speaker 1>So really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1020
00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:56.280
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1021
00:45:56.281 --> 00:45:59.010
<v Speaker 1>but I have that on there and I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1022
00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:00.053
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be mad at me for not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people are mad at me for not </v>

1023
00:46:02.341 --> 00:46:05.230
<v Speaker 1>having the video pre roll video ads on </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the history video,</v>

1024
00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:08.250
<v Speaker 1>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figure so.</v>

1025
00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:12.420
<v Speaker 1>So you never really had a big payoff </v>
<v Speaker 1>from those big,</v>

1026
00:46:12.421 --> 00:46:16.590
<v Speaker 1>big Japan and history of the world did </v>
<v Speaker 1>because through the other things,</v>

1027
00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:18.930
<v Speaker 1>the youtube red stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1028
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:21.720
<v Speaker 1>through patron and there's paypal donate</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You don't promote it as well.</v>

1036
00:46:40.711 --> 00:46:42.900
<v Speaker 1>I figured you were just making money </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the rest of us.</v>

1037
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:48.330
<v Speaker 1>But here you are like working your ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>off and amazing content.</v>

1038
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:51.600
<v Speaker 1>The thing is certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't even mention the name,</v>

1039
00:46:51.601 --> 00:46:52.434
<v Speaker 1>but certain web companies and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm stalking me for the rest of my life </v>

1040
00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:02.650
<v Speaker 1>through through targeted ads like </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests and you know,</v>

1041
00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:03.563
<v Speaker 1>and it's like I can't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't put other peoples through that </v>

1042
00:47:06.481 --> 00:47:09.540
<v Speaker 1>bother you that people follow you on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet trying to sell you shit.</v>

1043
00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:12.660
<v Speaker 1>You have to becoming targeted ads and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just really annoying.</v>

1044
00:47:12.661 --> 00:47:14.100
<v Speaker 1>It's good strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though,</v>

1045
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:18.300
<v Speaker 1>and this might help you be at ease with </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting ads on your videos,</v>

1046
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:23.100
<v Speaker 1>you have an option as a youtube creator </v>
<v Speaker 1>to turn off targeted ad.</v>

1047
00:47:23.101 --> 00:47:24.210
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

1048
00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:25.163
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that helps you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might because I do want you to </v>

1049
00:47:27.631 --> 00:47:30.820
<v Speaker 1>prosper and to make money so I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1050
00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:35.160
<v Speaker 1>but that is that the primary reason you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't run ads on your videos,</v>

1051
00:47:35.161 --> 00:47:39.040
<v Speaker 1>it's just a drag for the pure and plenty</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people always tell me,</v>

1052
00:47:39.041 --> 00:47:39.580
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

1053
00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:40.270
<v Speaker 1>People are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1054
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:40.780
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

1055
00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:42.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say we don't mind,</v>

1056
00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:44.650
<v Speaker 1>but they can't speak for everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people.</v>

1057
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:46.023
<v Speaker 1>But do you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about the fact that </v>

1058
00:47:47.111 --> 00:47:50.620
<v Speaker 1>like everybody on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1059
00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:54.220
<v Speaker 1>how do you say the expected experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there's an ad there,</v>

1060
00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:55.083
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like television or any popular medium </v>

1061
00:47:56.501 --> 00:47:57.334
<v Speaker 1>because how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you expected to provide for </v>

1062
00:47:58.880 --> 00:47:59.713
<v Speaker 1>yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point because maybe the </v>

1063
00:48:00.881 --> 00:48:03.370
<v Speaker 1>reason I haven't done it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to psychoanalyze this because</v>

1064
00:48:03.371 --> 00:48:05.140
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably should,</v>

1065
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:06.770
<v Speaker 1>you should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1066
00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.970
<v Speaker 1>I think you should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I know what it is.</v>

1067
00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:13.090
<v Speaker 1>I remember when there were no ads on </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube.</v>

1068
00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:14.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you remember that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but youtube is like,</v>

1069
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:16.540
<v Speaker 1>there's no way they can't put ads on </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube.</v>

1070
00:48:16.541 --> 00:48:17.374
<v Speaker 1>It's the Internet ads are for the TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I remember the first day I saw </v>

1071
00:48:21.011 --> 00:48:23.470
<v Speaker 1>an ad on youtube and I felt like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outrage,</v>

1072
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:24.623
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I guess it's been a long time since </v>

1073
00:48:26.771 --> 00:48:27.604
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I still,</v>

1074
00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:29.530
<v Speaker 1>I guess youth that outrage lives.</v>

1075
00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:31.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though maybe I shouldn't anymore,</v>

1076
00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:33.070
<v Speaker 1>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look at you,</v>

1077
00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:37.420
<v Speaker 1>you are extremely hardworking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talented,</v>

1078
00:48:37.421 --> 00:48:38.410
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your work.</v>

1079
00:48:38.411 --> 00:48:39.244
<v Speaker 1>As you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have time to do anything else </v>

1080
00:48:40.061 --> 00:48:40.894
<v Speaker 1>because I'm working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is not just some dude posting </v>

1081
00:48:43.661 --> 00:48:46.630
<v Speaker 1>vlogs are fucking around a hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is your life,</v>

1082
00:48:46.631 --> 00:48:47.464
<v Speaker 1>this is your work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're entitled to get paid for </v>

1083
00:48:50.291 --> 00:48:51.124
<v Speaker 1>that work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1084
00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:53.320
<v Speaker 1>and in addition to Patrion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is completely optional,</v>

1085
00:48:53.321 --> 00:48:54.480
<v Speaker 1>if people can support you there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

1086
00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:55.323
<v Speaker 1>So it was an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say like your work is your art and </v>

1087
00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:03.610
<v Speaker 1>you put it up there for free and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1088
00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:07.870
<v Speaker 1>like other artists sell their work so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you put it out for free.</v>

1089
00:49:07.871 --> 00:49:09.940
<v Speaker 1>So at least you could get money that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1090
00:49:11.330 --> 00:49:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1091
00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:12.763
<v Speaker 1>I'll turn it on.</v>

1092
00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:19.310
<v Speaker 1>Not to impress you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say that for most things too,</v>

1093
00:49:19.311 --> 00:49:19.830
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1094
00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:22.580
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work that well nowadays </v>
<v Speaker 1>because with the Internet you still have</v>

1095
00:49:22.581 --> 00:49:24.680
<v Speaker 1>to one person and then they can send it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to everybody else.</v>

1096
00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you smelled like digital media.</v>

1097
00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:27.203
<v Speaker 1>Well it's still music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it's also on the streaming </v>

1098
00:49:28.971 --> 00:49:30.170
<v Speaker 1>sites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's paid for that I guess.</v>

1099
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:31.543
<v Speaker 1>I guess there's ads there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so technically there are ads so you </v>

1100
00:49:33.801 --> 00:49:34.790
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the Internet,</v>

1101
00:49:34.791 --> 00:49:35.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1102
00:49:35.241 --> 00:49:36.560
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1103
00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:41.110
<v Speaker 1>selling stuff on the Internet is kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>not entirely real good.</v>

1104
00:49:41.290 --> 00:49:42.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can sell it to the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1105
00:49:42.681 --> 00:49:44.960
<v Speaker 1>You could charge a billion dollars for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first one,</v>

1106
00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:47.930
<v Speaker 1>but then once one person has it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could,</v>

1107
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:49.960
<v Speaker 1>they could just send it to anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1108
00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:54.830
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about what Wu Tang did</v>
<v Speaker 1>had that album that I was thinking that.</v>

1109
00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:55.873
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

1110
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did it.</v>

1111
00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:58.173
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's heard that album at Martin </v>

1112
00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:00.770
<v Speaker 1>Shkreli.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still.</v>

1113
00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:03.530
<v Speaker 1>That's too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is too bad to prison.</v>

1114
00:50:03.531 --> 00:50:06.470
<v Speaker 1>He can't do anything with it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably an evidence been somewhere</v>

1115
00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:08.780
<v Speaker 1>in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It list for them.</v>

1116
00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:14.510
<v Speaker 1>I had heard that he had played a portion</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it on a stream.</v>

1117
00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:15.200
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1118
00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:18.050
<v Speaker 1>I cannot believe that album was sold for</v>
<v Speaker 1>only a million dollars.</v>

1119
00:50:18.051 --> 00:50:20.990
<v Speaker 1>It's Wu Tang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how did nobody pay more than that?</v>

1120
00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:25.850
<v Speaker 1>Martin Scarelli is the only guy who </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to shell out a milli for that.</v>

1121
00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:27.173
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would think like someone like Jay z </v>

1122
00:50:29.241 --> 00:50:30.074
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's like really Wu Tang </v>

1123
00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:35.743
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still haven't figured out what it </v>

1124
00:50:37.011 --> 00:50:37.844
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it means to sell stuff on the </v>

1125
00:50:38.931 --> 00:50:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Internet and what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1126
00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:42.110
<v Speaker 1>because in the old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1127
00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.033
<v Speaker 1>I just looked it up and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently that album is now in the </v>

1128
00:50:45.111 --> 00:50:45.944
<v Speaker 1>hands of the government and they seized </v>
<v Speaker 1>his uncle because I wonder if they ever </v>

1129
00:50:52.221 --> 00:50:53.054
<v Speaker 1>imagined their million dollar album </v>
<v Speaker 1>would end up in the hands of the </v>

1130
00:50:55.251 --> 00:50:56.480
<v Speaker 1>government of all people.</v>

1131
00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they'll add it to the library of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Congress.</v>

1132
00:50:58.550 --> 00:50:59.383
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

1133
00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:01.490
<v Speaker 1>They should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sonia.</v>

1134
00:51:01.570 --> 00:51:03.470
<v Speaker 1>That's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you,</v>

1135
00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:04.670
<v Speaker 1>what do you consider that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1136
00:51:04.671 --> 00:51:09.470
<v Speaker 1>how do you consider that act by Wu Tang </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have this one CD?</v>

1137
00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Is that cool?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is theoretically what I thought was a</v>

1138
00:51:13.251 --> 00:51:14.084
<v Speaker 1>legit thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I still have not really figured out </v>

1139
00:51:16.221 --> 00:51:19.120
<v Speaker 1>what I think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you want people to hear you.</v>

1140
00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:23.600
<v Speaker 1>Do you want your work to be seen by as </v>
<v Speaker 1>many people as possible?</v>

1141
00:51:23.601 --> 00:51:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why you want to.</v>

1142
00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting and strength.</v>

1143
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

1144
00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:34.250
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to persuade you about the ad thing,</v>

1145
00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:39.550
<v Speaker 1>I only am looking out for your best </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest and I want you to prosper and I</v>

1146
00:51:39.651 --> 00:51:44.090
<v Speaker 1>think you'd be surprised by how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can then add to your,</v>

1147
00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:46.820
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your quality of life for Christ sake.</v>

1148
00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:47.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might.</v>

1149
00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:48.890
<v Speaker 1>I might do it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1193
00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:37.830
<v Speaker 1>You want to make a movie?</v>

00:53:37.831 --> 00:53:40.980

00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:42.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

1196
00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:43.470

<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1197
00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1198
00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:46.073
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would freaking die to have like a </v>

1199
00:53:48.241 --> 00:53:52.680
<v Speaker 1>history of like that as a show would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely captivating.</v>

1200
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:55.680
<v Speaker 1>I want to do that to the problem and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I wanted to do.</v>

1201
00:53:55.681 --> 00:53:57.890
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is it takes so long to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make you will,</v>

1202
00:53:57.980 --> 00:53:59.720
<v Speaker 1>you would work with people.</v>

1203
00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:02.460
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that would be how to do it.</v>

1204
00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:03.383
<v Speaker 1>You could have a team of 20 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make one every month or I know </v>

1205
00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:11.700
<v Speaker 1>you can make a whole 10 marks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're already doing it.</v>

1206
00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:14.550
<v Speaker 1>We already got a show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just slow.</v>

1207
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.280
<v Speaker 1>We don't get an episode every week </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1208
00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Is that okay or would you be happy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see it accelerate?</v>

1209
00:54:20.011 --> 00:54:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Is What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1210
00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh the right now never was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I.</v>

1211
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's been a wrong way.</v>

1212
00:54:26.281 --> 00:54:27.270
<v Speaker 1>Ron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could,</v>

1213
00:54:27.271 --> 00:54:28.104
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's like the perfect rate of </v>

1214
00:54:29.131 --> 00:54:31.710
<v Speaker 1>releasing those in your ideal world </v>
<v Speaker 1>history videos?</v>

1215
00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once a week.</v>

1216
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:38.220
<v Speaker 1>Is that enough time to do all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>research?</v>

1217
00:54:38.221 --> 00:54:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I did the entire world just because</v>

1218
00:54:40.981 --> 00:54:45.420
<v Speaker 1>I figured let's escalate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we see Japan and after doing that</v>

1219
00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:46.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look,</v>

1220
00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:48.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm really interested in history or I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

1221
00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:50.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm really like really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1222
00:54:51.450 --> 00:54:52.283
<v Speaker 1>and after doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't want to say another word </v>

1223
00:54:54.901 --> 00:54:56.800
<v Speaker 1>about history African.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

1224
00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:57.813
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't want to make the history </v>

1225
00:55:00.121 --> 00:55:00.954
<v Speaker 1>series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

1226
00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:03.720
<v Speaker 1>It was the only thing I wanted to do for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long time and then I did.</v>

1227
00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:07.800
<v Speaker 1>I just did the entire world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that I accept everything in that.</v>

1228
00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:11.520
<v Speaker 1>In fact that was the most painful part </v>
<v Speaker 1>was because the more you learn,</v>

1229
00:55:11.521 --> 00:55:13.740
<v Speaker 1>the more you find out how much you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have to leave out.</v>

1230
00:55:13.741 --> 00:55:15.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like 99 percent you have to worry </v>
<v Speaker 1>about and you know.</v>

1231
00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was painful.</v>

1232
00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:20.650
<v Speaker 1>But I assume so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you not working on a,</v>

1233
00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:21.890
<v Speaker 1>another history video right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1234
00:55:21.891 --> 00:55:22.724
<v Speaker 1>not right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1235

<v Speaker 1>I'm doing songs like every.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there some longterm project and the </v>

1236
00:55:27.001 --> 00:55:28.350

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1237
00:55:28.351 --> 00:55:30.180
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's about to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1238
00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:31.490
<v Speaker 1>because I just got to the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1239
00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:32.333
<v Speaker 1>I think there's about to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you found a topic or something that </v>

1240
00:55:34.171 --> 00:55:35.970
<v Speaker 1>fascinates you or you don't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1241
00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:37.051
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

1242

<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>million views and sits on our videos </v>

1279
00:57:16.721 --> 00:57:20.110
<v Speaker 1>number two of all time with 176,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>up votes.</v>

1280
00:57:20.111 --> 00:57:22.150
<v Speaker 1>Do you use reddit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1281
00:57:22.151 --> 00:57:24.280
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you understand?</v>

1282
00:57:24.281 --> 00:57:24.691
<v Speaker 1>Kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1283
00:57:24.691 --> 00:57:26.140
<v Speaker 1>I know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How nuts that is.</v>

1284
00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:27.863
<v Speaker 1>So when you posted that video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was your expectation for the </v>

1285
00:57:30.431 --> 00:57:32.380
<v Speaker 1>reception?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it was,</v>

1286
00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:33.873
<v Speaker 1>I knew Japan did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was number one and read it and all </v>

1287
00:57:36.401 --> 00:57:37.420
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

1288
00:57:37.421 --> 00:57:38.710
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this could end.</v>

1289
00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:41.830
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge escalation from the Japan </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

1290
00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:44.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like the ultimate thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was like,</v>

1291
00:57:44.501 --> 00:57:47.080
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this could really get there,</v>

1292
00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:49.070
<v Speaker 1>but you just can never get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can never.</v>

1293
00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:49.983
<v Speaker 1>Which is scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been working on this for a year </v>

1294
00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:54.880
<v Speaker 1>since I was thinking at the end of it I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

1295
00:57:54.881 --> 00:57:56.830
<v Speaker 1>I never want to spend this long on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing again.</v>

1296
00:57:56.830 --> 00:57:57.663
<v Speaker 1>It's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very thankful that it came through </v>

1297
00:57:59.801 --> 00:58:00.250
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1298
00:58:00.250 --> 00:58:01.270
<v Speaker 1>it did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it did as well.</v>

1299
00:58:01.271 --> 00:58:02.950
<v Speaker 1>So what was that like for you when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally.</v>

1300
00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:05.440
<v Speaker 1>That must have been such a relief or </v>
<v Speaker 1>relief.</v>

1301
00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:06.333
<v Speaker 1>Somebody told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody texted me and they said it's </v>

1302
00:58:07.781 --> 00:58:09.690
<v Speaker 1>number one year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's number one thing.</v>

1303
00:58:09.970 --> 00:58:12.130
<v Speaker 1>I was just really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I spend that long,</v>

1304
00:58:12.131 --> 00:58:12.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want.</v>

1305
00:58:12.830 --> 00:58:14.950
<v Speaker 1>And Are you happy with how it came out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That video?</v>

1306
00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

1307
00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:19.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't watched it since it came out,</v>

1308
00:58:19.751 --> 00:58:20.584
<v Speaker 1>so I think it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of things that are just </v>

1309
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:24.380
<v Speaker 1>way under cooked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean look,</v>

1310
00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:28.330
<v Speaker 1>it went through like within the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>four months and something that I started</v>

1311
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:29.830
<v Speaker 1>working on the graphics and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1312
00:58:30.050 --> 00:58:32.740
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I must have spent all day looking</v>

1313
00:58:32.741 --> 00:58:36.280
<v Speaker 1>for images of different like apes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

1314
00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:39.700
<v Speaker 1>I must have spent all day looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>apes and finding that perfect clip art.</v>

1315
00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I was like,</v>

1316
00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:42.363
<v Speaker 1>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It occurred to me that this is going to </v>

1317
00:58:43.241 --> 00:58:48.241
<v Speaker 1>take multiple years to finish if I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously kick myself faster every day.</v>

1318
00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:52.000
<v Speaker 1>So it really just became again and again</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again.</v>

1319
00:58:52.001 --> 00:58:53.650
<v Speaker 1>I had to just pick myself up and just go</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster.</v>

1320
00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:56.440
<v Speaker 1>That kind of goes back to the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue of deadlines because you're such a</v>

1321
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:57.303
<v Speaker 1>perfectionist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you remove that deadline it can </v>

1322
00:58:58.931 --> 00:59:00.300
<v Speaker 1>probably drive you crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1323
00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:01.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1324
00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:05.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean around October I set a deadline </v>
<v Speaker 1>of December.</v>

1325
00:59:05.681 --> 00:59:07.780
<v Speaker 1>First I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has got to get somebody.</v>

1326
00:59:08.290 --> 00:59:11.470
<v Speaker 1>During October,</v>
<v Speaker 1>November I was kicking ass.</v>

1327
00:59:11.471 --> 00:59:12.380
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1328
00:59:12.590 --> 00:59:13.423
<v Speaker 1>working so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it came around to December and I </v>

1329
00:59:15.281 --> 00:59:17.860
<v Speaker 1>wasn't nearly done and then I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't get out of bed for a few days.</v>

1330
00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:18.850
<v Speaker 1>It was just too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

1331
00:59:18.851 --> 00:59:19.684
<v Speaker 1>It didn't get done to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you said you couldn't get out of </v>

1332
00:59:21.651 --> 00:59:23.440
<v Speaker 1>bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean you were just despair.</v>

1333
00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Just like working so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

1334
00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:27.680
<v Speaker 1>I needed a break because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

1335
00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:32.000
<v Speaker 1>Are you up to the point of like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not even sleeping that much there?</v>

1336
00:59:32.050 --> 00:59:34.270
<v Speaker 1>I do sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sleep good sleep.</v>

1337
00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:37.620
<v Speaker 1>How much sleep you sleep?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sleep 10 hours a,</v>

1338
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:38.720
<v Speaker 1>it'll be like nine or 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1339
00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:39.993
<v Speaker 1>God bless you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless now I'm on a schedule and </v>

1340
00:59:41.421 --> 00:59:42.254
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately toward the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>schedule it gets ridiculous toward the </v>

1341
00:59:44.811 --> 00:59:46.580
<v Speaker 1>deadline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets you set an alarm clock.</v>

1342
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:50.000
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God bless you to do.</v>

1343
00:59:50.001 --> 00:59:50.834
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if for me be the one joy </v>

1344
00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:56.780
<v Speaker 1>being self employed is not setting an </v>
<v Speaker 1>alarm clock.</v>

1345
00:59:56.781 --> 00:59:59.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all that matters for me.</v>

1346
00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:02.540
<v Speaker 1>Problem is I tend to drift telling you </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal things,</v>

1347
01:00:02.541 --> 01:00:05.870
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by sleep schedule drifts forward like an</v>

1348
01:00:06.350 --> 01:00:07.520
<v Speaker 1>average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about an hour a day.</v>

1349
01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:12.290
<v Speaker 1>Like on average you would like rotating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you sometimes wake up at like 3:00</v>

1350
01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:12.801
<v Speaker 1>AM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1351
01:00:12.801 --> 01:00:13.700
<v Speaker 1>anytime it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll,</v>

1352
01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:15.140
<v Speaker 1>it'll keep drifting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I don't have to,</v>

1353
01:00:15.141 --> 01:00:16.820
<v Speaker 1>if I don't have to work for anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

1354
01:00:16.821 --> 01:00:17.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll,</v>

1355
01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:18.673
<v Speaker 1>it'll gradually drift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's your sleep schedule that like </v>

1356
01:00:20.301 --> 01:00:21.134
<v Speaker 1>right now?</v>

1357
01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:25.650
<v Speaker 1>Right now I woke up early.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're on the early one,</v>

1358
01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:28.750
<v Speaker 1>but I mean I just released the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>

1359
01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:30.290
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1360
01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:31.230
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

1361
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:31.770
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

1362
01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:35.850
<v Speaker 1>I got enough sleep though and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find that so interesting.</v>

1363
01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:36.883
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1364
01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:39.433
<v Speaker 1>do you find yourself more productive at </v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain time of day or is it all just </v>

1365
01:00:42.201 --> 01:00:43.550
<v Speaker 1>rotating?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all a blur.</v>

1366
01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:44.413
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What time it is kind of food do you </v>

1367
01:00:45.591 --> 01:00:46.580
<v Speaker 1>like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1368
01:00:46.581 --> 01:00:47.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You order.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Food is weird.</v>

1370
01:00:48.831 --> 01:00:50.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't like to talk about food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't like talking about food.</v>

1371
01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:52.060
<v Speaker 1>Food is weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1372
01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:54.150
<v Speaker 1>Not that interferes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Food is weird.</v>

1373
01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:57.020
<v Speaker 1>It is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing go eating thing.</v>

1374
01:00:57.021 --> 01:00:58.170
<v Speaker 1>It's just a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1375
01:00:58.190 --> 01:00:59.023
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we all,</v>

1376
01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:01.300
<v Speaker 1>I think we all think we all do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1377
01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:03.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean certainly that is a requirement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to.</v>

1378
01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:05.000
<v Speaker 1>I think I read a book that says we all </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1379
01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:07.610
<v Speaker 1>We all do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is pretty weird though.</v>

1380
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:09.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's strange.</v>

1381
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:11.990
<v Speaker 1>I love food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tell by looking at me.</v>

1382
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:15.380
<v Speaker 1>I'll eat all day and he was pregnant and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's.</v>

1383
01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:17.240
<v Speaker 1>We can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can not talk about food.</v>

1384
01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:19.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't have that much to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it unfortunately.</v>

1385
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:23.390
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isla doesn't really love food,</v>

1386
01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:27.330
<v Speaker 1>but she's pregnant now and she's turned </v>
<v Speaker 1>into like a,</v>

1387
01:01:27.570 --> 01:01:29.990
<v Speaker 1>I want to say beast mode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I love.</v>

1388
01:01:29.991 --> 01:01:30.824
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is an absolute compliment </v>

1389
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:36.350
<v Speaker 1>because I'm a monster and she hardly </v>
<v Speaker 1>eats so now for the past three nights in</v>

1390
01:01:36.351 --> 01:01:41.150
<v Speaker 1>a row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had pizza at midnight last night I</v>

1391
01:01:41.151 --> 01:01:42.560
<v Speaker 1>was eating pizza with the and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1392
01:01:42.561 --> 01:01:46.320
<v Speaker 1>this is the happiest I've ever been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really did say that.</v>

1393
01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:49.020
<v Speaker 1>I usually each their own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1394
01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:52.100
<v Speaker 1>I usually don't care about pizza,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have a preference.</v>

1395
01:01:52.101 --> 01:01:55.920
<v Speaker 1>You don't like specific foods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pizza.</v>

1396
01:01:56.970 --> 01:01:59.270
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize how some reason.</v>

1397
01:01:59.271 --> 01:02:03.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't really like to talk about food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why he lists that way.</v>

1398

<v Speaker 1>What about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you a coffee drinker?</v>

<v Speaker 1>ice cold?</v>

1400
01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:14.303
<v Speaker 1>I just really don't like to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't like to talk about </v>

1401
01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:19.820
<v Speaker 1>preferences of like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 1>for me sound like to talk about it.</v>

1403
01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:25.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me.</v>

1404
01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.790
<v Speaker 1>But I will say that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're sensitive to the temperature.</v>

1410
01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1417
01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:53.880
<v Speaker 1>he can't eat like until it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>lukewarm at a hottest.</v>

1418
01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:57.540
<v Speaker 1>Has this explosion in popularity since </v>
<v Speaker 1>these last two videos,</v>

1419
01:02:57.570 --> 01:02:59.040
<v Speaker 1>do you get recognized on the street </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever?</v>

1420
01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:00.021
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1421
01:03:00.021 --> 01:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1422
01:03:00.550 --> 01:03:02.340
<v Speaker 1>sorry of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those big too,</v>

1423
01:03:02.341 --> 01:03:04.480
<v Speaker 1>I feel like really put true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1424
01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Do you get recognized on the street </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever?</v>

1425
01:03:06.991 --> 01:03:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Does that happen to you?</v>

1426
01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:15.210
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it does happen sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you um,</v>

1427
01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:19.620
<v Speaker 1>has this popularity affected your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>in any way or you feel like everything's</v>

1428
01:03:19.621 --> 01:03:21.780
<v Speaker 1>the same?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weirdly the same.</v>

1429
01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because before I had it,</v>

1430
01:03:25.381 --> 01:03:29.600
<v Speaker 1>I was pretending that I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just convenient because now I don't</v>

1431
01:03:29.601 --> 01:03:32.690
<v Speaker 1>have to change a damn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

1432
01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:36.780
<v Speaker 1>When I was posting five times a week on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the website and I had it all like that,</v>

1433
01:03:36.790 --> 01:03:37.623
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even tell anyone that I was </v>

1434
01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:39.114
<v Speaker 1>doing that and I was just carrying on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pretending that it was really </v>

1435
01:03:41.641 --> 01:03:42.474
<v Speaker 1>important and they do have a day job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was life like before you were </v>

1436
01:03:45.001 --> 01:03:46.770
<v Speaker 1>making money from your art?</v>

1437
01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:50.380
<v Speaker 1>Like music stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1438
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:52.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>music stuff like gigs and stuff.</v>

1439
01:03:52.610 --> 01:03:53.630
<v Speaker 1>It's various things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1440
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1441
01:03:55.140 --> 01:04:00.140
<v Speaker 1>God bless 'em.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just wondering,</v>

1442
01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.120
<v Speaker 1>have you gone to you seem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you classically trained with music?</v>

1443
01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.830
<v Speaker 1>I sort of know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1444
01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:10.013
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I figured out sort of through the </v>

1445
01:04:11.011 --> 01:04:12.960
<v Speaker 1>grapevine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the names of stuff,</v>

1446
01:04:14.130 --> 01:04:18.030
<v Speaker 1>like the names of the notes in the chord</v>
<v Speaker 1>self-trained oh yeah.</v>

1447
01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.080
<v Speaker 1>Completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1448
01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>

1449
01:04:20.011 --> 01:04:21.870
<v Speaker 1>what was your first instrument?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The keyboard?</v>

1450
01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:26.640
<v Speaker 1>It was piano and drums and piano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back to drums and piano.</v>

1451
01:04:27.090 --> 01:04:29.510
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are your music inspirations?</v>

1452
01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:31.230
<v Speaker 1>What kind of music do you like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

1453
01:04:31.231 --> 01:04:32.064
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you have a very specific style and </v>

1454
01:04:36.811 --> 01:04:37.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1455
01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:40.260
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's unfortunate because,</v>

1456
01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:41.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1457
01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:45.570
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to do,</v>

1458
01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:46.980
<v Speaker 1>do whatever I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1459
01:04:48.310 --> 01:04:49.143
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you have a green tractor </v>

1460
01:04:52.590 --> 01:04:54.480
<v Speaker 1>and if that's the one you have people </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1461
01:04:54.481 --> 01:04:55.314
<v Speaker 1>why do you like to drive?</v>

1462
01:04:56.530 --> 01:04:57.680
<v Speaker 1>I want to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1463
01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Do you listen to music though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because yeah.</v>

1464
01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Your whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Music Your Music Ira?</v>

1465
01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:04.110
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you listening to these days?</v>

1466
01:05:04.590 --> 01:05:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately there's not that much </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1467
01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:09.450
<v Speaker 1>But you have a favorite artist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1468
01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:11.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't break it down like the Beatles.</v>

1469
01:05:12.090 --> 01:05:12.923
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't even like really break it </v>
<v Speaker 1>down by artists because it's every </v>

1470
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:17.703
<v Speaker 1>single artist is going to have stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I really love and that I don't </v>

1471
01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:22.240
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's that way with everyone.</v>

1472
01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's not even by song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by Song.</v>

1473
01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:28.900
<v Speaker 1>There's parts of the song that I love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of it that I don't even individual</v>

1474
01:05:28.901 --> 01:05:30.250
<v Speaker 1>moments of songs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1475
01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Parts of it that I don't think I can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>and don't it.</v>

1476
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:33.880
<v Speaker 1>So he's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>

1477
01:05:33.881 --> 01:05:36.190
<v Speaker 1>That reminds me of kind of what Jason </v>
<v Speaker 1>Donkey said.</v>

1478
01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:38.920
<v Speaker 1>He does this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this blew me away.</v>

1479
01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:40.083
<v Speaker 1>He says he'll take songs that he loves </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cut out the parts he likes and cut </v>

1480
01:05:45.431 --> 01:05:48.850
<v Speaker 1>out the part that doesn't like and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a cut of his perfect idea.</v>

1481
01:05:48.851 --> 01:05:52.500
<v Speaker 1>In that Song I've done that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed the billing to a.</v>

1482
01:05:52.530 --> 01:05:54.910
<v Speaker 1>I cut up the bridge to pretty woman and </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed it.</v>

1483
01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.520
<v Speaker 1>Pretty Woman Roy orbison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great tune.</v>

1484
01:05:57.521 --> 01:05:58.354
<v Speaker 1>For some reason the bridge just it takes</v>
<v Speaker 1>this detour that really bores the hell </v>

1485
01:06:01.301 --> 01:06:02.134
<v Speaker 1>out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just changed it without adding </v>

1486
01:06:04.571 --> 01:06:05.404
<v Speaker 1>anything new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just took the meat part and I pitched </v>

1487
01:06:07.211 --> 01:06:09.340
<v Speaker 1>it up a whole step and another whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>step and comes back around.</v>

1488
01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Were you always interested in music or </v>
<v Speaker 1>was that kind of,</v>

1489
01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:14.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps coming back.</v>

1490
01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:16.470
<v Speaker 1>I think by the time I was about 10 and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just like,</v>

1491
01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:18.400
<v Speaker 1>it was just one of those things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kept coming back.</v>

1492
01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:19.953
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1493
01:06:20.050 --> 01:06:21.100
<v Speaker 1>I better do this then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1494
01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:22.653
<v Speaker 1>Is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there an artist or band or style </v>

1495
01:06:25.330 --> 01:06:27.610
<v Speaker 1>where you think like that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was it?</v>

1496
01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:28.473
<v Speaker 1>Was there something you ever heard as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>child or whatever where it was kind of </v>

1497
01:06:31.151 --> 01:06:31.984
<v Speaker 1>transformed when you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to make music because this is </v>

1498
01:06:34.931 --> 01:06:36.370
<v Speaker 1>just so brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1499
01:06:36.371 --> 01:06:38.860
<v Speaker 1>it was probably a bunch of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember exactly.</v>

1500
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:41.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you hear those?</v>

1501
01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:45.370
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's sirens outside.</v>

1502
01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:46.713
<v Speaker 1>The soundproofing can only do so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was actually a window behind that </v>

1503
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:52.990
<v Speaker 1>foam Paul Desmond sacks plan on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on take five.</v>

1504
01:06:52.991 --> 01:06:54.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a very famous tune.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1505
01:06:54.461 --> 01:06:57.310
<v Speaker 1>he does a nice job on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's real good.</v>

1506
01:06:57.311 --> 01:06:58.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard that at a young age.</v>

1507
01:06:59.110 --> 01:07:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's jazz.</v>

1508
01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:02.913
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1509
01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:04.210
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave Brubeck.</v>

1510
01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:06.650
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1511
01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:07.863
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1512
01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:09.010
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1513
01:07:09.010 --> 01:07:10.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing to talk about.</v>

1514
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Now people are gonna think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1515
01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all good.</v>

1516
01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:16.140
<v Speaker 1>You don't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

1517
01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.250
<v Speaker 1>No pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I'm so weird.</v>

1518
01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:18.940
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

1519
01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:22.120
<v Speaker 1>I get the sense you don't like talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about your musical inspirations.</v>

1520
01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a little confused about what you</v>

1521
01:07:27.881 --> 01:07:30.340
<v Speaker 1>like or what about what you want to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1522
01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't figured it out yet,</v>

1523
01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:38.590
<v Speaker 1>but one thing that I will always come </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to again and again is popular music</v>

1524
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:41.500
<v Speaker 1>can't get away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really can't ignore it.</v>

1525
01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:45.610
<v Speaker 1>You loved pop music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I refuse to hate it unconditionally,</v>

1526
01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:50.470
<v Speaker 1>which I think it seems like everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>around is always doing it and I can't.</v>

1527
01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.150
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>

1528
01:07:52.151 --> 01:07:52.984
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a wise way because </v>

1529
01:07:54.881 --> 01:07:58.600
<v Speaker 1>clearly there's something there that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people find irresistible.</v>

1530
01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.310
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At pop music,</v>

1531
01:08:00.311 --> 01:08:00.940
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As,</v>

1532
01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:01.773
<v Speaker 1>as always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the times of like what I was a kid </v>

1533
01:08:03.401 --> 01:08:07.180
<v Speaker 1>like backstreet boys and Brittany Spears</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever's popular.</v>

1534
01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:11.740
<v Speaker 1>The reaction of everyone is always to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everyone was cool.</v>

1535
01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:12.593
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you start finding these </v>

1536
01:08:14.291 --> 01:08:15.920
<v Speaker 1>articles and now on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1537
01:08:15.921 --> 01:08:20.220
<v Speaker 1>you can see interviews from 1955 from </v>
<v Speaker 1>1925 from a,</v>

1538
01:08:20.230 --> 01:08:22.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for any given year in the past.</v>

1539
01:08:23.330 --> 01:08:24.163
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's always trying to say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing's good nowadays and that the </v>

1540
01:08:28.101 --> 01:08:29.750
<v Speaker 1>latest technology has ruined everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1541
01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:30.703
<v Speaker 1>Once you see how prevalent that </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint is at every single moment in </v>

1542
01:08:34.731 --> 01:08:35.564
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly you just can't take it </v>

1543
01:08:36.231 --> 01:08:37.720
<v Speaker 1>seriously anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1544
01:08:38.270 --> 01:08:40.520
<v Speaker 1>Why would it be true now if it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>true then that's really,</v>

1545
01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:42.500
<v Speaker 1>that's a really great option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just I have,</v>

1546
01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.060
<v Speaker 1>I have no patience anymore for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

1547
01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:46.930
<v Speaker 1>for the pop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unconditional pop hate.</v>

1548
01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:48.650
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great great.</v>

1549
01:08:48.710 --> 01:08:52.280
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying I like every tune </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's ever on the radio,</v>

1550
01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:53.233
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every given your and everyone has </v>

1551
01:08:54.651 --> 01:08:57.530
<v Speaker 1>different tastes but any given year if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just check out the charts,</v>

1552
01:08:57.531 --> 01:09:02.531
<v Speaker 1>there's at least a handful of tunes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just like here,</v>

1553
01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:04.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1554
01:09:04.611 --> 01:09:05.444
<v Speaker 1>I know and it'll be different ones for </v>
<v Speaker 1>different people and maybe some people </v>

1555
01:09:07.341 --> 01:09:08.300
<v Speaker 1>like none of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

1556
01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's true,</v>

1557
01:09:09.681 --> 01:09:10.970
<v Speaker 1>but I just think it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just never.</v>

1558
01:09:10.971 --> 01:09:11.840
<v Speaker 1>It never stops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1559
01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:13.900
<v Speaker 1>2014,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2000,</v>

1560
01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:14.810
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

1561
01:09:14.811 --> 01:09:16.580
<v Speaker 1>52.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean sometimes I go to,</v>

1562
01:09:16.581 --> 01:09:19.850
<v Speaker 1>there's a charts website where you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>just listen to stuff and you'll hear,</v>

1563
01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:24.020
<v Speaker 1>you'll hear good stuff and you'll hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are copying their neighbors,</v>

1564
01:09:24.021 --> 01:09:26.450
<v Speaker 1>just trying to sneak in there and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>always there too.</v>

1565
01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:28.220
<v Speaker 1>And that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1566
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:31.220
<v Speaker 1>I think that's really wise and reminds </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

1567
01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:35.240
<v Speaker 1>the best example of that that I always </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear is like Bob Dylan,</v>

1568
01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:38.060
<v Speaker 1>when he switched to electric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was like,</v>

1569
01:09:38.061 --> 01:09:40.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so poppy and it's not authentic,</v>

1570
01:09:40.671 --> 01:09:44.600
<v Speaker 1>and everyone was saying that he was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hack and it was making pop music because</v>

1571
01:09:44.601 --> 01:09:46.010
<v Speaker 1>he switched the electric guitar.</v>

1572
01:09:46.310 --> 01:09:47.870
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could say that about Bob </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dylan.</v>

1573
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:50.263
<v Speaker 1>You can't say that about anyone is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do have a artist today that you like a </v>

1574
01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:57.350
<v Speaker 1>pop artist that you're a fan of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't really.</v>

1575
01:09:57.380 --> 01:09:59.630
<v Speaker 1>I can't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't like naming.</v>

1576
01:09:59.631 --> 01:10:00.740
<v Speaker 1>I can't really say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1577
01:10:00.741 --> 01:10:03.790
<v Speaker 1>there's so many things were and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even pay attention anymore.</v>

1578
01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:04.633
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's,</v>

1579
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:06.620
<v Speaker 1>there's certain songs where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1580
01:10:06.621 --> 01:10:07.590
<v Speaker 1>I love that song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was.</v>

1581
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.823
<v Speaker 1>But I don't even think about whether or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not it happens to be by the same person </v>

1582
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:14.030
<v Speaker 1>of another song that I can't stand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't even notice anymore.</v>

1583
01:10:14.031 --> 01:10:15.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

1584
01:10:16.330 --> 01:10:17.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1585
01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:20.203
<v Speaker 1>I would say when I look at your style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will consider to be almost </v>

1586
01:10:22.461 --> 01:10:25.250
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do A.</v>

1587
01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:28.400
<v Speaker 1>is that an influence on you at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1588
01:10:28.450 --> 01:10:30.380
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not physically,</v>

1589
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:32.090
<v Speaker 1>not physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1590
01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:34.053
<v Speaker 1>But you know what it was.</v>

1591
01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.620
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you take academic?</v>

1592
01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:38.361
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never.</v>

1593
01:10:38.361 --> 01:10:39.194
<v Speaker 1>I've never done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1594
01:10:39.330 --> 01:10:40.163
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1595
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:42.040
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about this backstage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kind of are,</v>

1596
01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:46.100
<v Speaker 1>you have this frank Zappa kind of vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about you with this,</v>

1597
01:10:46.101 --> 01:10:49.280
<v Speaker 1>like really excentric brilliant music </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

1598
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:50.203
<v Speaker 1>you may know about for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that he was very much not a drug </v>

1599
01:10:53.961 --> 01:10:55.520
<v Speaker 1>user.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was very sober,</v>

1600
01:10:55.521 --> 01:10:56.354
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the point of even expelling people </v>

1601
01:10:58.191 --> 01:10:59.024
<v Speaker 1>from his band for using drugs and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was during the sixties and seventies </v>

1602
01:11:02.471 --> 01:11:04.690
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when everybody was on drugs and I,</v>

1603
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:05.743
<v Speaker 1>he was one of the most eccentric and </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative musicians from that time </v>

1604
01:11:09.171 --> 01:11:10.400
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

1605
01:11:10.401 --> 01:11:11.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relate to that?</v>

1606
01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:13.530
<v Speaker 1>But I wouldn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1607
01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:14.383
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't kick people off the bat </v>

1608
01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.010
<v Speaker 1>unless it was like messing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1609
01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:20.551
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1610
01:11:20.551 --> 01:11:23.370
<v Speaker 1>you're not good at or not shown up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Gig.</v>

1611
01:11:23.370 --> 01:11:24.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you play in bands?</v>

1612
01:11:25.050 --> 01:11:26.970

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1615
01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:31.553
<v Speaker 1>Because you're very much a one man band,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I understand from watching your </v>

1616
01:11:33.781 --> 01:11:35.150
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1617
01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:36.510
<v Speaker 1>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the live,</v>

1618
01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:38.250
<v Speaker 1>the live show is going to be a band for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1620
01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:41.251
<v Speaker 1>but the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1621
01:11:41.251 --> 01:11:43.070
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is it's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a.</v>

1622
01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:45.960
<v Speaker 1>It was just going to be a band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me about this live show.</v>

1623
01:11:45.970 --> 01:11:46.890
<v Speaker 1>What's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

1624
01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:48.930
<v Speaker 1>It's not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not happening yet.</v>

1625
01:11:48.931 --> 01:11:49.764
<v Speaker 1>But you're planning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1626
01:11:50.130 --> 01:11:51.120
<v Speaker 1>Well No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not for it yet,</v>

1627
01:11:51.121 --> 01:11:52.950
<v Speaker 1>but I'm planning to plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're planning the planet.</v>

1628
01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:53.793
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in the word.</v>

1629
01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:58.650
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm very curious about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people are.</v>

1630
01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:00.900
<v Speaker 1>This is a tour that you want to do.</v>

1631
01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

1632
01:12:03.061 --> 01:12:04.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm not planning it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm planning to planet.</v>

1633
01:12:04.710 --> 01:12:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you haven't got that far.</v>

1634
01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:07.440
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is,</v>

1635
01:12:07.441 --> 01:12:08.274
<v Speaker 1>but while I'm doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't make a new any new songs or </v>

1636
01:12:11.331 --> 01:12:13.560
<v Speaker 1>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can be a lucrative.</v>

1637
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Does that to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does money.</v>

1638
01:12:16.190 --> 01:12:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Does money motivate you at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1639
01:12:19.410 --> 01:12:20.243
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope it doesn't change what I do or </v>

1640
01:12:24.211 --> 01:12:25.230
<v Speaker 1>like how I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1641
01:12:25.231 --> 01:12:26.041
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1642
01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:26.910
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I need it.</v>

1643
01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:28.410
<v Speaker 1>You need it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need some of it.</v>

1644
01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:29.333
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1645
01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:30.173
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1646
01:12:30.370 --> 01:12:31.203
<v Speaker 1>Are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't care about being a </v>

1647
01:12:31.771 --> 01:12:33.930
<v Speaker 1>millionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you just want to keep doing what</v>

1648
01:12:33.931 --> 01:12:34.670
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1649
01:12:34.670 --> 01:12:35.940
<v Speaker 1>that'd be convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be nice.</v>

1650
01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>touring will be very lucrative.</v>

1651
01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:40.703
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you want to do it like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and putting ads on would also be </v>

1652
01:12:43.021 --> 01:12:45.800
<v Speaker 1>very liquid dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would be making it.</v>

1653
01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

1654
01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:51.060
<v Speaker 1>you're going to text me and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you dude.</v>

1655
01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:54.520
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to text the million people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

1656
01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:57.130
<v Speaker 1>other people who told you to get started</v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

1657
01:12:57.180 --> 01:12:58.013
<v Speaker 1>I think the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But can I take credit for having </v>

1658
01:13:00.001 --> 01:13:01.380
<v Speaker 1>convinced you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because this I feel like.</v>

1659
01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:03.510
<v Speaker 1>No because you didn't convince me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do it.</v>

1660
01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:07.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that could get you off </v>
<v Speaker 1>my back basically.</v>

1661
01:13:07.771 --> 01:13:08.604
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

1662
01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

1663
01:13:12.150 --> 01:13:13.560
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good.</v>

1664
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:14.700
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a smart idea.</v>

1665
01:13:14.701 --> 01:13:17.340
<v Speaker 1>I probably should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

1666
01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me see here.</v>

1667
01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:22.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won that.</v>

1668
01:13:22.530 --> 01:13:24.110
<v Speaker 1>You won the shorty award?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1669
01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:27.900
<v Speaker 1>How was that experience for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you went up there and just drive</v>

1670
01:13:27.930 --> 01:13:30.540
<v Speaker 1>her to thank you and you bounced out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was too weird.</v>

1671
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:33.050
<v Speaker 1>What was weird about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1672
01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:36.360
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of alarming how bad my social </v>
<v Speaker 1>skills are.</v>

1673
01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Like when I go to a place like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it knocked me out.</v>

1674
01:13:39.991 --> 01:13:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't even expect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1675
01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:42.473
<v Speaker 1>I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got invited this vip find party thing </v>

1676
01:13:45.031 --> 01:13:47.130
<v Speaker 1>and it was like I walked in and I walked</v>
<v Speaker 1>right out.</v>

1677
01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:49.710
<v Speaker 1>You just walked in and did a one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

1678
01:13:49.711 --> 01:13:50.544
<v Speaker 1>It was like at a bar with ping pong and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and it was like a kindergarten </v>

1679
01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:53.803
<v Speaker 1>flashback because it felt like the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>room was already talking and already </v>

1680
01:13:57.241 --> 01:13:59.600
<v Speaker 1>knew each other and I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1681
01:13:59.850 --> 01:14:04.520
<v Speaker 1>there's never a good time to interrupt </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone and awkward for everyone.</v>

1682
01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:06.373
<v Speaker 1>I think socializing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we all need to acknowledge how </v>

1683
01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:12.310
<v Speaker 1>weird socializing is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard.</v>

1684
01:14:12.670 --> 01:14:13.810
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>

1685
01:14:13.811 --> 01:14:15.910
<v Speaker 1>playing ping pong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I get next game?</v>

1686
01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:23.080
<v Speaker 1>We've never gone to one of those events </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the same reasons I avoid.</v>

1687
01:14:23.650 --> 01:14:24.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1688
01:14:24.641 --> 01:14:25.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

1689
01:14:25.781 --> 01:14:26.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1690
01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:28.990
<v Speaker 1>you're alarmed by how bad your social </v>
<v Speaker 1>skills are.</v>

1691
01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:31.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm just surprised because you have like</v>
<v Speaker 1>social anxiety.</v>

1692
01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:33.940
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1693
01:14:33.941 --> 01:14:36.670
<v Speaker 1>it's just I have no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nowhere to anything.</v>

1694
01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Once I'm in a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cool.</v>

1695
01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.020
<v Speaker 1>As long as there's something to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1696
01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.000
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1697
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:41.800
<v Speaker 1>it's starting to get that foot in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>door.</v>

1698
01:14:42.190 --> 01:14:43.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I pretty much had those things.</v>

1699
01:14:43.811 --> 01:14:47.260
<v Speaker 1>I just literally get a beer and stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in the corner,</v>

1700
01:14:47.261 --> 01:14:48.094
<v Speaker 1>just really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people approach me because they </v>

1701
01:14:49.271 --> 01:14:51.280
<v Speaker 1>recognize me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was convenient.</v>

1702
01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:54.070
<v Speaker 1>That's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very nice.</v>

1703
01:14:54.850 --> 01:14:57.940
<v Speaker 1>And tell me about the award ceremony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever play ping pong,</v>

1704
01:14:57.941 --> 01:14:59.000
<v Speaker 1>by the way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you get a game?</v>

1705
01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Do you play Ping Pong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1706
01:15:03.670 --> 01:15:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1707
01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:05.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1708
01:15:05.090 --> 01:15:05.923
<v Speaker 1>let them go.</v>

1709
01:15:06.010 --> 01:15:07.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not that big of a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1710
01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:08.710
<v Speaker 1>it's not that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really that big.</v>

1711
01:15:08.711 --> 01:15:10.210
<v Speaker 1>We could actually is probably pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>

1712
01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:11.950
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to be good at like forrest </v>
<v Speaker 1>gump.</v>

1713
01:15:11.951 --> 01:15:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hard.</v>

1714
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1715
01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:16.900
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pink box really not that serious.</v>

1716
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:19.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how was it accepting the award?</v>

1717
01:15:19.151 --> 01:15:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Because I was watching you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had you,</v>

1718
01:15:22.930 --> 01:15:25.960
<v Speaker 1>you had this great little video you put </v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess on your website,</v>

1719
01:15:25.961 --> 01:15:28.990
<v Speaker 1>but you never posted on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Youtube.</v>

1720
01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was on vine about you being </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1721
01:15:31.391 --> 01:15:34.720
<v Speaker 1>I went up and I told her keep the door </v>
<v Speaker 1>open because I'm going to be fast.</v>

1722
01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:38.560
<v Speaker 1>That was when I explained pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>half of what I just explained actually.</v>

1723
01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:39.653
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1724
01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:43.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me about that acceptance.</v>

1725
01:15:43.151 --> 01:15:46.270
<v Speaker 1>What will you had a strategy where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>planning on that quick thank you.</v>

1726
01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1727
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:48.760
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an option.</v>

1728
01:15:48.970 --> 01:15:50.440
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't authentic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1729
01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:51.400
<v Speaker 1>because I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

1730
01:15:51.401 --> 01:15:53.570
<v Speaker 1>I saw Andre 3000 doing it at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grammy's.</v>

1731
01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:57.010
<v Speaker 1>He had a very strong effect on me for </v>
<v Speaker 1>some reason,</v>

1732
01:15:57.011 --> 01:15:59.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not rocket science and he's not the</v>

1733
01:15:59.531 --> 01:16:00.364
<v Speaker 1>first person who's done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised more people haven't done </v>

1734
01:16:02.411 --> 01:16:04.390
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well what more needs to be said.</v>

1735
01:16:04.930 --> 01:16:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Probably some more things could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been said,</v>

1736
01:16:06.521 --> 01:16:09.460
<v Speaker 1>but I just didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't have it and it was just,</v>

1737
01:16:09.461 --> 01:16:10.294
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the ceremony was going on and on </v>

1738
01:16:11.741 --> 01:16:12.574
<v Speaker 1>and everyone's like thanking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanking their manager's manager and </v>

1739
01:16:15.521 --> 01:16:18.370
<v Speaker 1>their social media manager and all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1740
01:16:18.371 --> 01:16:19.820
<v Speaker 1>I'd never heard of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1741
01:16:20.290 --> 01:16:21.123
<v Speaker 1>But the detail of that story that I love</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that you're walking up to the stage </v>

1742
01:16:24.221 --> 01:16:25.054
<v Speaker 1>to accept the award and you and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a girl who's got her arm on the door </v>

1743
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:30.390
<v Speaker 1>that you are planning in your head </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead.</v>

1744
01:16:30.450 --> 01:16:32.930
<v Speaker 1>You says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be awkwardly waiting for</v>

1745
01:16:32.931 --> 01:16:36.800
<v Speaker 1>her to open the door for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he says to her as he's going to his,</v>

1746
01:16:36.890 --> 01:16:38.530
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be quick.</v>

1747
01:16:38.531 --> 01:16:40.270
<v Speaker 1>So keep the door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted her to be,</v>

1748
01:16:40.271 --> 01:16:42.370
<v Speaker 1>to have the door right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was pretty slick.</v>

1749
01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:45.940
<v Speaker 1>I love the that we can see your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1750
01:16:45.941 --> 01:16:50.941
<v Speaker 1>And the footage that was you show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like that door now.</v>

1751
01:16:51.090 --> 01:16:51.923
<v Speaker 1>Where was that something you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>planning while you were in the audience </v>

1752
01:16:54.161 --> 01:16:55.240
<v Speaker 1>being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I win,</v>

1753
01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:56.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be standing there </v>
<v Speaker 1>awkwardly.</v>

1754
01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:58.960
<v Speaker 1>A brooding over this I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1755
01:16:58.961 --> 01:16:59.410
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1756
01:16:59.410 --> 01:17:00.243
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1757
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:02.170
<v Speaker 1>I know I was going to do as soon as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>walked into the theater,</v>

1758
01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:07.260
<v Speaker 1>I knew I was going to just because I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way in the back to this is we're</v>

1759
01:17:09.561 --> 01:17:10.970
<v Speaker 1>just talking about how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1760
01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.000
<v Speaker 1>antisocial and basically that's okay.</v>

1761
01:17:14.730 --> 01:17:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1762
01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:16.680
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find it charming.</v>

1763
01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

1764
01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:19.350
<v Speaker 1>it's genuine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1765
01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:20.370
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am very,</v>

1766
01:17:21.170 --> 01:17:23.860
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like I have social anxiety.</v>

1767
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:27.220
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I need to draw stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw Al Williams interview where he was</v>

1768
01:17:27.221 --> 01:17:28.054
<v Speaker 1>just like doodling stuff while he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviewing because I just couldn't </v>

1769
01:17:29.741 --> 01:17:30.600
<v Speaker 1>deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1770
01:17:30.601 --> 01:17:32.380
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you for interviewing me.</v>

1771
01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:34.600
<v Speaker 1>I know I need to do interviews and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally cool,</v>

1772
01:17:34.601 --> 01:17:37.070
<v Speaker 1>but just forgive me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just have to just A.</v>

1773
01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:38.540
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel that way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

1774
01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.860
<v Speaker 1>do you want something to draw?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1775
01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:42.153
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel that way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's like you don't want to do </v>

1776
01:17:44.111 --> 01:17:46.120
<v Speaker 1>interviews but you feel like at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>point you have to.</v>

1777
01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>

1778
01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:50.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this confronting and kind of like a,</v>

1779
01:17:50.740 --> 01:17:53.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's a fear but like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity of you being here?</v>

1780
01:17:54.370 --> 01:17:55.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's fun to,</v>

1781
01:17:55.511 --> 01:17:58.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so cool.</v>

1782
01:17:58.090 --> 01:17:58.923
<v Speaker 1>I mean I love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love having the opportunity to speak </v>

1783
01:18:00.701 --> 01:18:05.701
<v Speaker 1>to your logo is the umbrella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the significance of that?</v>

1784
01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Well this is what happened really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing,</v>

1785
01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:11.560
<v Speaker 1>I didn't on my website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no logo,</v>

1786
01:18:11.710 --> 01:18:14.130
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really want one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1787
01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:14.973
<v Speaker 1>but then I was setting up the youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel and so was setting up the </v>

1788
01:18:16.361 --> 01:18:17.194
<v Speaker 1>banner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so had the black background and it says </v>

1789
01:18:19.721 --> 01:18:20.554
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it still says to this day said </v>

1790
01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:24.310
<v Speaker 1>hi or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was cool.</v>

1791
01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:26.200
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the,</v>

1792
01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:29.720
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a thing in the corner where the,</v>

1793
01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:31.240
<v Speaker 1>there's a thing you have to put in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corner.</v>

1794
01:18:31.490 --> 01:18:33.040
<v Speaker 1>So I was like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you got to put something there.</v>

1795
01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:34.000
<v Speaker 1>So I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just put,</v>

1796
01:18:34.001 --> 01:18:35.260
<v Speaker 1>I did it based on what was already </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1797
01:18:35.261 --> 01:18:36.510
<v Speaker 1>So the high thing there.</v>

1798
01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:37.713
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just picked what would look good and </v>

1799
01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:40.413
<v Speaker 1>then I realized that that's actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna be the thing that shows up as my </v>

1800
01:18:42.431 --> 01:18:43.660
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a surprise to me.</v>

1801
01:18:43.661 --> 01:18:44.494
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just thought it was something was </v>

1802
01:18:45.090 --> 01:18:47.920
<v Speaker 1>going to go in the corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're happy with the umbrella?</v>

1803
01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1804
01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:52.450
<v Speaker 1>And I try to use a different color when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to each different platform.</v>

<v Speaker 1>world?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I have a list.</v>

1818
01:19:25.410 --> 01:19:26.243
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was doing the history of the </v>

1819
01:19:27.941 --> 01:19:30.100
<v Speaker 1>world research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sort of,</v>

1820
01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:33.970
<v Speaker 1>I already knew this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I sort sort of solidified in my mind</v>

1821
01:19:33.971 --> 01:19:34.804
<v Speaker 1>even more was like the way progress and </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovery and things getting crazier </v>

1822
01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:42.310
<v Speaker 1>happens all the time.</v>

1823
01:19:42.430 --> 01:19:45.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was just rocks for like billions</v>

1824
01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:46.233
<v Speaker 1>of years and then something more </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting and that it was for a long </v>

1825
01:19:48.221 --> 01:19:51.250
<v Speaker 1>time and then then something gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered and then like,</v>

1826
01:19:51.370 --> 01:19:56.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and that's been happening forever and</v>

1827
01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:57.653
<v Speaker 1>faster and faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you think about the future in </v>

1828
01:20:00.181 --> 01:20:01.014
<v Speaker 1>regards to that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you interested in like robotics and </v>

<v Speaker 1>stuff?</v>

1830
01:20:05.970 --> 01:20:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably going to get really crazy,</v>

1831
01:20:07.681 --> 01:20:09.630
<v Speaker 1>really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you a fan of Elon Musk?</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I understand there's some,</v>

1834
01:20:15.850 --> 01:20:16.900
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:23.790
<v Speaker 1>I love Elon Musk because I feel like </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a.</v>

1838
01:20:23.850 --> 01:20:24.683
<v Speaker 1>here's a guy who is fabulously rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is one of the richest people in the </v>

1839
01:20:30.631 --> 01:20:34.680
<v Speaker 1>world and he uses his wealth and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence and his intellect,</v>

1840
01:20:35.490 --> 01:20:38.160
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the betterment of mankind,</v>

1841
01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:41.010
<v Speaker 1>and he and he has to do in a way that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>profitable obviously,</v>

1842
01:20:41.011 --> 01:20:43.260
<v Speaker 1>because how can you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but space x,</v>

1843
01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:48.960
<v Speaker 1>which is basically just fueling his </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasy of starting a colony on Mars,</v>

1844
01:20:49.230 --> 01:20:52.140
<v Speaker 1>nearly bankrupted him as did Tesla.</v>

1845
01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:55.020
<v Speaker 1>The guy's been on the verge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bankruptcy from gambling.</v>

1846
01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:55.883
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got his billions is vast wealth on </v>

1847
01:20:58.411 --> 01:21:01.170
<v Speaker 1>these insane ideas that everybody said </v>
<v Speaker 1>was impossible.</v>

1848
01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Having a private company that sends a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rockets and outer space,</v>

1849
01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:06.480
<v Speaker 1>who would ever do that except the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

1850
01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:09.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making electric cars,</v>

1851
01:21:09.930 --> 01:21:13.310
<v Speaker 1>zero gas with batteries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient enough to take you through.</v>

1852
01:21:13.311 --> 01:21:14.940
<v Speaker 1>And German people said that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible.</v>

1853
01:21:15.150 --> 01:21:16.680
<v Speaker 1>I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's incredible.</v>

1854
01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Love Him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's pretty cool.</v>

1855
01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:21.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough to really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's amazing.</v>

1856
01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:23.303
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by the rapid increase in </v>

1857
01:21:25.981 --> 01:21:26.860
<v Speaker 1>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know.</v>

1858
01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:29.130
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I didn't really explain what</v>

1859
01:21:29.131 --> 01:21:30.090
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said what?</v>

1860
01:21:30.091 --> 01:21:33.180
<v Speaker 1>What am I hope that gives you hope?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1861
01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:34.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have it,</v>

1862
01:21:34.801 --> 01:21:36.450
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know where it comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1863
01:21:36.490 --> 01:21:37.323
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel like you're a naturally </v>

1864
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:39.090
<v Speaker 1>optimistic?</v>

1865
01:21:39.090 --> 01:21:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1866
01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:41.180
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1867
01:21:41.250 --> 01:21:42.270
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I had that.</v>

1868
01:21:43.670 --> 01:21:46.610
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm painfully centered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cynical.</v>

1869
01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Do you think I'm painfully cynical?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1870
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:52.980
<v Speaker 1>not all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank God.</v>

1871
01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:57.390
<v Speaker 1>But you feel like you wake up generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a sunny disposition.</v>

1872
01:21:57.391 --> 01:21:58.560
<v Speaker 1>You're happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1873
01:21:58.830 --> 01:22:00.290
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been worse morning.</v>

1874
01:22:00.291 --> 01:22:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Anyone does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have morning anxiety I think.</v>

1875
01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1876
01:22:03.290 --> 01:22:05.430
<v Speaker 1>I have crazy morning anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>

1877
01:22:05.431 --> 01:22:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Morning anxiety when you wake up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have crazy anxiety just because of</v>

1878
01:22:09.091 --> 01:22:09.870
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1879
01:22:09.870 --> 01:22:12.000
<v Speaker 1>of what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you anxious about or is it just</v>

1880
01:22:12.001 --> 01:22:13.950
<v Speaker 1>a general feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this show this morning.</v>

1881
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't blame you for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a new experience for you,</v>

1882
01:22:17.410 --> 01:22:19.850
<v Speaker 1>like what you have to do that day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

1883
01:22:19.851 --> 01:22:21.000
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1884
01:22:21.001 --> 01:22:23.750
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you have that eye opener,</v>

1885
01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:25.250
<v Speaker 1>you know [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1886
01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:25.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1887
01:22:25.770 --> 01:22:28.110
<v Speaker 1>I want you to get into your work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel more comfortable?</v>

1888
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:29.833
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once I figured out what I'm doing and </v>

1889
01:22:30.691 --> 01:22:33.060
<v Speaker 1>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's most people.</v>

1890
01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.073
<v Speaker 1>It might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost wouldn't trust someone who </v>

1891
01:22:36.031 --> 01:22:40.410
<v Speaker 1>would tell me they just wake up happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so pink.</v>

1892
01:22:40.490 --> 01:22:41.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1893
01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:44.850
<v Speaker 1>thank God I'm alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of how you should be.</v>

1894
01:22:44.851 --> 01:22:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That somehow we're not maybe think,</v>

1895
01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:50.640
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a day of wonder.</v>

1896
01:22:50.850 --> 01:22:51.683
<v Speaker 1>That's like all those self help gurus </v>
<v Speaker 1>are like every morning I'm blessed that </v>

1897
01:22:55.021 --> 01:22:55.854
<v Speaker 1>I'm away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you really care about doing </v>

1898
01:22:58.891 --> 01:23:03.891
<v Speaker 1>really good stuff and good work and </v>
<v Speaker 1>really care about making stuff good,</v>

1899
01:23:04.690 --> 01:23:05.523
<v Speaker 1>there's to be a flip side of the coin </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to get really </v>

1900
01:23:07.031 --> 01:23:07.864
<v Speaker 1>paranoid that it's not going to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to a little bit and hopefully it </v>

1901
01:23:11.891 --> 01:23:13.180
<v Speaker 1>doesn't kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1902
01:23:13.181 --> 01:23:14.014
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe in Ufos or ghosts or do </v>

1903
01:23:18.581 --> 01:23:19.414
<v Speaker 1>you subscribe to any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would be considered as conspiracy </v>

1904
01:23:21.761 --> 01:23:22.594
<v Speaker 1>theories?</v>

1905
01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Ghosts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1906
01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:29.440
<v Speaker 1>I thought ghosts were pretty cool and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked into some things.</v>

1907
01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:33.100
<v Speaker 1>I found like some lists of all the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous ghost sightings and stuff.</v>

1908
01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:36.370
<v Speaker 1>I was kinda disappointed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of them were not very believable.</v>

1909
01:23:36.371 --> 01:23:39.850
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was going to find some </v>
<v Speaker 1>really believable stuff.</v>

1910
01:23:39.851 --> 01:23:43.120
<v Speaker 1>I've heard some stories from people I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that are very believable,</v>

1911
01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:44.413
<v Speaker 1>so I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I look into the ghost stuff </v>

1912
01:23:46.391 --> 01:23:47.224
<v Speaker 1>because I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to accept a naturally </v>

1913
01:23:50.321 --> 01:23:52.610
<v Speaker 1>skeptical person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I agree with the.</v>

1914
01:23:52.650 --> 01:23:57.010
<v Speaker 1>The evidence is not compelling yet as of</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

1915
01:23:57.610 --> 01:23:59.410
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was expecting to find it,</v>

1916
01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:02.980
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't use it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about Ufos and aliens?</v>

1917
01:24:02.981 --> 01:24:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Do you think aliens are out there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1918
01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:08.650
<v Speaker 1>I think alien just means someone from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different planet than yours.</v>

1919
01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:11.680
<v Speaker 1>So I think depending on which planet </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on,</v>

1920
01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:13.690
<v Speaker 1>the other person would be.</v>

1921
01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there's interplanetary </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings that.</v>

1922
01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there's things on other </v>
<v Speaker 1>planets?</v>

1923
01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you think they visited the earth?</v>

1924
01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:22.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they have,</v>

1925
01:24:23.170 --> 01:24:25.530
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1926
01:24:26.110 --> 01:24:28.960
<v Speaker 1>You think there's intelligent cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings out in the universe?</v>

1927
01:24:29.610 --> 01:24:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there would have to be,</v>

1928
01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:32.710
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing though,</v>

1929
01:24:33.930 --> 01:24:36.160
<v Speaker 1>where we're going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long have we been?</v>

1930
01:24:36.190 --> 01:24:40.900
<v Speaker 1>How long have we been here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really like zero time.</v>

1931
01:24:40.901 --> 01:24:41.890
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the things I was talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1932
01:24:41.891 --> 01:24:44.440
<v Speaker 1>things that are like going super fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we're here and we're,</v>

1933
01:24:44.441 --> 01:24:45.274
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know what the future is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll either maybe be extinct or maybe </v>

1934
01:24:47.171 --> 01:24:51.710
<v Speaker 1>we'll invent an entire way out of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire paradigm somehow or,</v>

1935
01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:54.010
<v Speaker 1>or invent our way off of this planet or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1936
01:24:54.011 --> 01:24:54.844
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the chances that I don't know what </v>

1937
01:24:58.631 --> 01:24:59.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to say.</v>

1938
01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:02.930
<v Speaker 1>The chances that there's another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that word,</v>

1939
01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:04.280
<v Speaker 1>the only one what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1940
01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:06.940
<v Speaker 1>what you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or what I think is that the chances that</v>

1941
01:25:06.941 --> 01:25:09.700
<v Speaker 1>we're the only ones here cooking on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

1942
01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:10.593
<v Speaker 1>It's like lower than the chances that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's other intelligent cultural </v>

1943
01:25:14.531 --> 01:25:18.400
<v Speaker 1>beings on other planets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think they would have to be,</v>

1944
01:25:18.401 --> 01:25:20.860
<v Speaker 1>but there might to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be pretty quick.</v>

1945
01:25:20.861 --> 01:25:24.070
<v Speaker 1>It might be pretty temporary and pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>quick before they like,</v>

1946
01:25:24.590 --> 01:25:25.423
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what fascinates me about our time on </v>

1947
01:25:27.130 --> 01:25:32.130
<v Speaker 1>earth is that it took a while to cook us</v>
<v Speaker 1>up like and on earth has been around for</v>

1948
01:25:32.861 --> 01:25:33.694
<v Speaker 1>a long time and the dinosaurs were cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were dealt but they weren't really </v>

1949
01:25:36.730 --> 01:25:39.160
<v Speaker 1>going anywhere with science and shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1950
01:25:39.370 --> 01:25:40.570
<v Speaker 1>So the media was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

1951
01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:41.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard,</v>

1952
01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:44.170
<v Speaker 1>hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reset that let's throw out the leftovers</v>

1953
01:25:44.171 --> 01:25:45.004
<v Speaker 1>and start over and so I wonder how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard resets before you get someone that </v>

1954
01:25:49.151 --> 01:25:51.850
<v Speaker 1>can build a spaceship or build a </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer or something,</v>

1955
01:25:51.851 --> 01:25:52.684
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1956
01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Didn't take that many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only like to,</v>

1957
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:55.863
<v Speaker 1>for us to come pop out of there too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was like a several mass </v>

1958
01:25:58.991 --> 01:25:59.824
<v Speaker 1>extinctions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1959
01:25:59.830 --> 01:26:00.910
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were like five.</v>

1960
01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:03.440
<v Speaker 1>So five resets it took.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1961
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:05.303
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>

1962
01:26:06.690 --> 01:26:09.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry I'm not more of an expert so I</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like I'm letting you down.</v>

1963
01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:12.930
<v Speaker 1>You're not letting me down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1964
01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:15.900
<v Speaker 1>I think I was an expert while I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>making the history of the worldview.</v>

1965
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:18.440
<v Speaker 1>There's new stuff in your head now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1966
01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:19.393
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Elan Musk believes were living </v>

1967
01:26:24.271 --> 01:26:25.940
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an,</v>

1968
01:26:25.970 --> 01:26:26.803
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a simulation of what he thinks that we </v>

1969
01:26:31.461 --> 01:26:36.170
<v Speaker 1>are living in a computer simulation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else entirely.</v>

1970
01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:39.290
<v Speaker 1>That reality is just a computer </v>
<v Speaker 1>simulation</v>

1971
01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:41.013
<v Speaker 2>of</v>

1972
01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:43.353
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that would mean that someone </v>

1973
01:26:44.651 --> 01:26:45.484
<v Speaker 1>else's control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else is controlling it for some </v>

1974
01:26:47.081 --> 01:26:49.350
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you think of like,</v>
