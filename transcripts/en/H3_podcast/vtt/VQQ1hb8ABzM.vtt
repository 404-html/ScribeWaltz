<v Speaker 3>Real tennis or you know,</v>

54
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:17.653
<v Speaker 3>usually when we don't keep score.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just more about getting out there </v>

55
00:03:23.671 --> 00:03:27.210
<v Speaker 3>and exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How frequently do you guys play tennis?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Stopping and starting</v>

68
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.993
<v Speaker 2>Wisconsin.</v>

<v Speaker 2>road.</v>

<v Speaker 3>La driving nuts though,</v>

75
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.493
<v Speaker 2>the cycle between the car has always </v>
<v Speaker 2>struck me as very oddly reckless </v>

76
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.160
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

77
00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:39.070
<v Speaker 2>but I think when you're on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>motorcycle you feel like you know better</v>

78
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:41.090

<v Speaker 3>going the wrong way.</v>

81
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.540

<v Speaker 2>recklessness becomes my problem because </v>

84
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.123
<v Speaker 2>I'm in traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not paying that close attention to </v>

85
00:04:58.511 --> 00:05:00.670
<v Speaker 2>like what's in between me and the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

86
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.280
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden I'm switching lanes.</v>

239
00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:05.750
<v Speaker 2>so like there's like 10 people actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>waving their arms and their exit.</v>

240
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:07.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the room,</v>

241
00:14:07.201 --> 00:14:10.850
<v Speaker 2>it's just like not interested at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>

242
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.110
<v Speaker 2>Just a strange event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bam.</v>

243
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like Justin Bieber's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're singing that DJ count,</v>

244
00:14:17.881 --> 00:14:19.410
<v Speaker 2>which is the worst part of every music </v>
<v Speaker 2>video.</v>

245
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:28.880
<v Speaker 5>Oh No.</v>

246
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:35.580
<v Speaker 2>Or five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

247
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:40.590
<v Speaker 2>are you serious right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

248
00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:44.900
<v Speaker 5>And one more thing.</v>

249
00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:50.720
<v Speaker 2>What it makes it look like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

250
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:52.490
<v Speaker 2>The phone light.</v>

251
00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:53.423
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you people are holding their phones </v>

252
00:14:54.481 --> 00:14:55.950
<v Speaker 6>up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They are.</v>

253
00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:58.170
<v Speaker 6>They're making it look like they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>holding their phones up.</v>

254
00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.870
<v Speaker 6>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People have their phones out.</v>

255
00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:03.970
<v Speaker 2>Wristbands probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

256
00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.960
<v Speaker 2>maybe like an event wristband.</v>

257
00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:16.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Looks confused.</v>

258
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:28.530
<v Speaker 5>You can't do without the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>bank.</v>

259
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:34.710
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you take out another one is another</v>

260
00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:39.770
<v Speaker 5>word you said plants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

261
00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:05.363
<v Speaker 5>these guys were paid to dance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you not even see happening at this </v>

262
00:16:14.101 --> 00:16:17.450
<v Speaker 5>point?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gala?</v>

263
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.960
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get your own concert.</v>

264
00:16:21.961 --> 00:16:22.794
<v Speaker 2>But like at a concert you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think that this could go on for two </v>

265
00:16:26.101 --> 00:16:30.810
<v Speaker 2>hours straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't want to appreciate him for</v>

266
00:16:30.811 --> 00:16:35.811
<v Speaker 2>even having the courage to do in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like,</v>

267
00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:41.140
<v Speaker 2>it really doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like a blizzard hired him.</v>

268
00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:43.283
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

269
00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.690
<v Speaker 6>It probably paid him like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

270
00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:50.710
<v Speaker 6>I don't think he would go out there for </v>
<v Speaker 6>less than $200,000.</v>

271
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:52.203
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

272
00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.380
<v Speaker 2>We paid them pretty good</v>

273
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.900
<v Speaker 5>black.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alright.</v>

00:24:42.281 --> 00:24:43.114
<v Speaker 6>couldn't decide between Dj Khaled and </v>
<v Speaker 6>all of the Mexican workers going on </v>

<v Speaker 7>They sit on a come together yet.</v>

405
00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:10.570

<v Speaker 7>don't know anything about who filmed</v>

406
00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:14.820
<v Speaker 6>the story is that they're on some kind </v>
<v Speaker 6>of smelting plant.</v>

407
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:16.723
<v Speaker 6>Two of the dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess their boss supervises our </v>

408
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:20.893
<v Speaker 6>comrades,</v>
<v Speaker 6>was all of a sudden rush of Soviet </v>

409
00:25:23.761 --> 00:25:24.594
<v Speaker 6>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Their colleagues got fired or sent home </v>

410
00:25:28.201 --> 00:25:30.360
<v Speaker 6>for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so they all packed up and said,</v>

411
00:25:30.361 --> 00:25:31.650
<v Speaker 6>fuck this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

412
00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.120
<v Speaker 6>salt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>solidarity.</v>

413
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.433
<v Speaker 6>So this guy who was working with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess there's a bunch of Mexicans and </v>

414
00:25:36.951 --> 00:25:37.784
<v Speaker 6>a couple of black dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So this is one of the black dudes who's </v>

415
00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:44.160
<v Speaker 6>an og of the Mexican camaraderie and </v>
<v Speaker 6>spirit.</v>

416
00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:53.120
<v Speaker 7>They up this book.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fucking black people need to be your own</v>

<v Speaker 7>Isn't this motherfucking on my momma?</v>

419
00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:13.040
<v Speaker 7>They are not bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They don't stop up in depth.</v>

420
00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:19.990
<v Speaker 7>They thought they was going to play with</v>
<v Speaker 7>these amigos.</v>

421
00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:22.320
<v Speaker 7>We rise together,</v>
<v Speaker 7>homey.</v>

422
00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:28.490

<v Speaker 7>We all went home,</v>

424
00:26:33.051 --> 00:26:35.500
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The Way God bless him.</v>

425
00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:39.310
<v Speaker 7>I mean jokes aside for documenting that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm with him,</v>

426
00:26:39.311 --> 00:26:40.121
<v Speaker 7>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's cool.</v>

427
00:26:40.121 --> 00:26:41.890
<v Speaker 7>It's probably going to get in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah,</v>

428
00:26:41.891 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 7>he's fired.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll never work again.</v>

429
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:49.920
<v Speaker 2>I love it that I'm with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in solidarity,</v>

430
00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:53.670
<v Speaker 2>but we need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why the hell do you think apple is worth</v>

431
00:26:53.671 --> 00:26:58.671
<v Speaker 2>a trillion dollars?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No unions.</v>

432
00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:02.940
<v Speaker 2>They don't have unions in China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

433
00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:08.280
<v Speaker 2>What do you guys think about apple being</v>
<v Speaker 2>worth a trillion fucking dollars?</v>

434
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:13.130
<v Speaker 2>Why are you an apple man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

435
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:14.820
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found though.</v>

436
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.780
<v Speaker 2>I guess so you're sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in your foot,</v>

437
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.660
<v Speaker 2>your foot's in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You like apple?</v>

438
00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:26.060
<v Speaker 2>We don't really have an opinion on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's very.</v>

439
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.940
<v Speaker 2>And we would have to look more into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to take any,</v>

440
00:27:28.941 --> 00:27:33.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>radical fucking hate bad.</v>

441
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:38.263
<v Speaker 2>I'm using it very sparingly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Waiting for the right you can use that </v>

442
00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.553
<v Speaker 2>sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't understand like have all </v>

443
00:27:51.591 --> 00:27:52.424
<v Speaker 2>come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can keep it of all companies in the </v>

444
00:27:53.611 --> 00:27:54.444
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is it that apple was the one that </v>

445
00:27:55.981 --> 00:27:57.570
<v Speaker 2>got a trillion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

446
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.970
<v Speaker 2>what are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they just.</v>

447
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.033
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the most valued company of all </v>

448
00:28:04.471 --> 00:28:05.304
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first company ever to be worth a </v>

449
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:07.463
<v Speaker 2>trillion dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they sell shit so they aren't </v>

450
00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:14.070
<v Speaker 2>getting or many fucking phones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they selling?</v>

451
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.233
<v Speaker 2>I get it though because everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with that iphone all over the </v>

452
00:28:18.151 --> 00:28:21.890
<v Speaker 2>word and there were computers too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's like,</v>

453
00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.420
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

454
00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.270
<v Speaker 2>It's expensive to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the hell do people afford that shit?</v>

455
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:31.830
<v Speaker 2>But that means to me that like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>margins are insane,</v>

456
00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:33.893
<v Speaker 2>that they probably are exploiting hell </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people for those margins to be so </v>

457
00:28:39.241 --> 00:28:41.970
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

458
00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:46.830
<v Speaker 2>Like for someone to make a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars is hard enough,</v>

459
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:48.263
<v Speaker 2>you have to like step on a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>throats along the way to make forget </v>

460
00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:52.820
<v Speaker 2>about a billion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a billion.</v>

461
00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.860
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple of hookers in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your pool,</v>

462
00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:56.300
<v Speaker 2>under your pool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

463
00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:04.340
<v Speaker 2>At least several hundred immoral things </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

464
00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is Not being followed.</v>

465
00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:10.510
<v Speaker 2>Apple is notorious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not just them inside in big,</v>

466
00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.050
<v Speaker 2>big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was watching CNN,</v>

467
00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:14.610
<v Speaker 2>they're doing this whole clip about </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

468
00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.820
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just outed myself for watching CNN.</v>

469
00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:23.683
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

470
00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:24.683
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing this whole thing about </v>

471
00:29:25.621 --> 00:29:26.454
<v Speaker 2>like celebrating that apple made a </v>
<v Speaker 2>trillion dollars and it's like </v>

472
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:31.530
<v Speaker 2>celebrating.</v>

00:36:19.461 --> 00:36:22.400
<v Speaker 6>You don't like to learn from somebody </v>
<v Speaker 6>that doesn't want to teach.</v>

591
00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:25.190
<v Speaker 6>You do it at your own time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at your own pace,</v>

592
00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:26.203
<v Speaker 6>the same level of learning even better </v>
<v Speaker 6>because you can pause it and continue </v>

593
00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:32.030
<v Speaker 6>another time when you actually want to </v>
<v Speaker 6>learn.</v>

594
00:36:32.031 --> 00:36:33.920
<v Speaker 6>You don't have to sit in a class for </v>
<v Speaker 6>three hours.</v>

595
00:36:33.921 --> 00:36:35.330

<v Speaker 6>I'd go back in time and do you to me </v>

597
00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:39.253
<v Speaker 6>cost me a heck of a lot less than I </v>
<v Speaker 6>probably would be a lot smarter to you </v>

598
00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:46.160
<v Speaker 6>about over 65,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>courses match that.</v>

599
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:47.263
<v Speaker 6>I went.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wanted to learn a little bit about </v>

<v Speaker 6>you can drop a line to the professor.</v>

635
00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:23.913
<v Speaker 6>a couple of clicks and it automatically </v>
<v Speaker 6>searches the entire web for coupons as </v>

636

<v Speaker 6>you shop.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's saved me hundreds of dollars and </v>

637
00:38:32.271 --> 00:38:34.420
<v Speaker 6>youtube we'll.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

638
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:36.280
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just going and buying shoes.</v>

639
00:38:36.281 --> 00:38:38.620
<v Speaker 6>I was ready to drop $300.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was the price.</v>

640
00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:43.770
<v Speaker 6>All of a sudden honey pops in like </v>
<v Speaker 6>Batman and hand and they're like,</v>

641
00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:45.430
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 6>we found a coupon code.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just saved 50 bucks that you didn't </v>

643
00:38:48.641 --> 00:38:50.680
<v Speaker 6>think you were going to save until right</v>
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>

644
00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.620
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're probably wondering how much money</v>

645
00:38:53.621 --> 00:38:54.850
<v Speaker 6>can hunt?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He really saved me.</v>

646
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:55.833
<v Speaker 6>They actually crunched the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It turns out those of you who have </v>

647
00:38:57.611 --> 00:38:58.444
<v Speaker 6>already downloaded honey for my link </v>
<v Speaker 6>have already collectively saved over </v>

648
00:39:01.781 --> 00:39:02.614

649
00:39:05.411 --> 00:39:08.140
<v Speaker 6>$25 per person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>

650
00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:11.170
<v Speaker 6>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is insane.</v>

651
00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:14.260
<v Speaker 6>You may also be thinking of honey </v>
<v Speaker 6>doesn't work on sites that I shop at.</v>

652
00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.510
<v Speaker 6>The truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>honey works on over 30,000</v>

653
00:39:16.511 --> 00:39:18.130
<v Speaker 6>sites including Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ebay,</v>

654
00:39:18.131 --> 00:39:19.060

<v Speaker 6>razor,</v>

655
00:39:19.061 --> 00:39:20.170
<v Speaker 6>Walmart,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and more.</v>

656

<v Speaker 6>more Isla and one more today.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 6>how is money?</v>

659
00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:32.070
<v Speaker 6>How was honey free?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

660
00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:35.200
<v Speaker 6>there's no catchall.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Honey gets a small commission from sites</v>

661
00:39:35.201 --> 00:39:36.034
<v Speaker 6>where honey saves you money so it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>always free and that's really all there </v>

<v Speaker 6>It's changed everything you know about </v>

686
00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:07.953
<v Speaker 6>oral hygiene and trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know very little and you don't need </v>

687
00:41:10.811 --> 00:41:11.644
<v Speaker 6>to know much because this is all unique.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This incredible vibrating toothbrush </v>

688
00:41:16.211 --> 00:41:19.000
<v Speaker 6>starts at just $25.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

689
00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:19.953
<v Speaker 6>Compared to other electric toothbrushes </v>
<v Speaker 6>or the size of a car battery that </v>

690
00:41:21.941 --> 00:41:24.970
<v Speaker 6>started probably like at least 10,000,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe not that much,</v>

691
00:41:24.971 --> 00:41:25.804
<v Speaker 6>but like a couple of hundred bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't need all that because in this </v>

692
00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:29.493
<v Speaker 6>little cylinder is a vibrating little </v>
<v Speaker 6>motor that's going to keep your teeth </v>

693
00:41:32.801 --> 00:41:35.870
<v Speaker 6>clean and your breath smelling fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here's what it does.</v>

694
00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:38.390
<v Speaker 6>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's not get ahead of ourselves because</v>

695
00:41:38.391 --> 00:41:40.460
<v Speaker 6>it's got these soft,</v>
<v Speaker 6>incredible bristles.</v>

696
00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:41.653
<v Speaker 6>I hate when the bristle is too hard or </v>
<v Speaker 6>too long and they irritate your gums </v>

697
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:49.040
<v Speaker 6>because guess what guys?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can get your teeth worked on,</v>

698
00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.230
<v Speaker 6>but gums don't grow back</v>

699
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:54.740
<v Speaker 6>and that should horrify you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Gums,</v>

700
00:41:54.741 --> 00:41:55.574
<v Speaker 6>don't grow back true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You need a good toothbrush or you have </v>

701
00:41:58.731 --> 00:42:01.760
<v Speaker 6>so much problems ahead for you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So much,</v>

702
00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.640
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this toothbrush,</v>

703
00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:06.980
<v Speaker 6>this quip is everything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Soft bristles.</v>

00:57:22.541 --> 00:57:23.374
<v Speaker 2>from making those kinds of videos for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>long time or was it just like they were </v>

00:57:27.101 --> 00:57:29.950
<v Speaker 2>dicks and you fucked off kind of like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rash decision,</v>

944
00:57:29.951 --> 00:57:34.280
<v Speaker 2>but it was first basket area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just like,</v>

945
00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:36.550
<v Speaker 2>I was really scared that he was going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

946
00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:40.010
<v Speaker 2>regret drastic change right away,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

1043
01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:36.480
<v Speaker 2>but the new thing I'm working on is </v>
<v Speaker 2>baking.</v>

1044
01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:40.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm working on learning how to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>sourdough bread.</v>

1045
01:03:41.810 --> 01:03:46.170
<v Speaker 2>Tell me about that and it's like it's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>intense and it's so time consuming,</v>

1046
01:03:46.171 --> 01:03:51.120
<v Speaker 2>but it's a good starter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made my own starter from scratch.</v>

1047
01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:56.910
<v Speaker 2>I think it's in a good shape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good bread and last Friday it was</v>

1048
01:03:56.911 --> 01:03:59.520
<v Speaker 2>like professional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While I had made two breads.</v>

1049
01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:01.740
<v Speaker 2>One was great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one was like perfect.</v>

1050
01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:05.460
<v Speaker 2>The first one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second one was a literal brick,</v>

1051
01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:11.550
<v Speaker 2>but still it was like you could break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The flavor was good.</v>

1052
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.940
<v Speaker 2>As far as breaks go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty important.</v>

1053
01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:18.300
<v Speaker 2>Structure was off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can't wait.</v>

1054
01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:22.470
<v Speaker 2>I started getting that starter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's my favorite food.</v>

1055
01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:24.960
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>

1056
01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.390
<v Speaker 2>I rolled the dough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I proved it,</v>

1057
01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:30.300
<v Speaker 2>proved it some more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in the proven basket now.</v>

1058
01:04:30.301 --> 01:04:31.134
<v Speaker 2>It's in the fridge.</v>

1059
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:39.223
<v Speaker 2>I've got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually this one I'm super proud of </v>

1060
01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:48.500
<v Speaker 2>because the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the starter was bubbly and ice crash.</v>

1061
01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:49.603
<v Speaker 2>It was like really good smell and </v>
<v Speaker 2>texture and this morning I was kneading </v>

1062
01:04:53.971 --> 01:04:55.980
<v Speaker 2>the dough and it was just looking really</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

1063
01:04:56.910 --> 01:05:01.170
<v Speaker 2>And so I did a little twist because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to over prove it by the way.</v>

1064
01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.033
<v Speaker 2>Proving people don't know is when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave the dough out for several hours </v>

1065
01:05:06.421 --> 01:05:07.254
<v Speaker 2>and the yeast eats the flower so it </v>
<v Speaker 2>starts to rise and make it fluffy and </v>

1066
01:05:10.851 --> 01:05:12.630
<v Speaker 2>turn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's our team does all the magic.</v>

1067
01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:16.170
<v Speaker 2>So you prove it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't want to over prove it.</v>

1068
01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:18.760
<v Speaker 2>So I popped it in the fridge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the twist.</v>

1069
01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:22.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's going to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it should.</v>

1070
01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:26.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to work if I buy into that</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's terrible.</v>

1071
01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:27.793
<v Speaker 3>I'm to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to feel horrible knowing the </v>

1072
01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:35.023
<v Speaker 3>slider.</v>

1073
01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:38.373
<v Speaker 2>I really liked those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So wholesome because Isla is the </v>

1074
01:05:40.931 --> 01:05:41.764
<v Speaker 2>pickiest eater ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She loves bread and the bread here in </v>

1075
01:05:43.301 --> 01:05:46.570
<v Speaker 2>America is so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no problem with them.</v>

1076
01:05:46.571 --> 01:05:47.860
<v Speaker 2>Bread here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1077
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.810
<v Speaker 2>Noticed</v>

1078
01:05:48.810 --> 01:05:52.760
<v Speaker 3>and define Brenda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She'll just eat a role,</v>

1079
01:05:52.761 --> 01:05:53.680
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1080
01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:58.580
<v Speaker 3>I will just eat plain know the baker I </v>
<v Speaker 3>worked out was also a sourdough bakery.</v>

1081
01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:00.210
<v Speaker 3>Specifically salary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1082
01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:01.220
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1083
01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:02.570
<v Speaker 3>so I got a lot of free bread there.</v>

1084
01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.980
<v Speaker 2>Thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we particularly hate.</v>

1085
01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:10.780
<v Speaker 2>Isla is that there's so much sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you go to the store,</v>

1086
01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.990
<v Speaker 2>bakeries have got it going on generally </v>
<v Speaker 2>like in a good way,</v>

1087
01:06:14.290 --> 01:06:15.123
<v Speaker 2>but at the store it's like I've noticed </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll get a hot dog bun and it's got </v>

1088
01:06:18.401 --> 01:06:22.230
<v Speaker 2>six grams of sugar in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1089
01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:23.640
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1090
01:06:23.650 --> 01:06:26.950
<v Speaker 2>We try to buy like local bakeries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

1091
01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:29.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't really have a baker in Paris.</v>

1092
01:06:29.890 --> 01:06:32.330
<v Speaker 2>So you guys are on the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys are killing it on breads.</v>

1093
01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:38.640
<v Speaker 2>We try to go to the grocery store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't even have like local bake,</v>

1094
01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:43.540
<v Speaker 2>like bakery stuff at your grocery store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they always.</v>

1095
01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:45.880
<v Speaker 2>They're always dry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1096
01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:48.700
<v Speaker 2>Browse like Ralph's make their own bread</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>

1097
01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:50.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rouse lady,</v>

1098
01:06:50.531 --> 01:06:53.030
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't really care what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>at that level.</v>

1099
01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:55.540
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1100
01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:58.610
<v Speaker 2>Like the bakery fresh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not like artisan.</v>

1101
01:06:58.650 --> 01:07:00.790
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking around back there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't take.</v>

1102
01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:03.820
<v Speaker 2>They don't take it on the ceiling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't take it.</v>

1103
01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:06.253
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got oil on my hands so it doesn't </v>

1104
01:07:08.201 --> 01:07:09.550
<v Speaker 2>stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm neat.</v>

1105
01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:12.400
<v Speaker 2>I've needed this dough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're doing that.</v>

1106
01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:16.270
<v Speaker 3>Definitely not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's so much.</v>

1107
01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:20.000
<v Speaker 3>Sun is coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the kitchen on wedding oil,</v>

1108
01:07:20.001 --> 01:07:23.360
<v Speaker 3>on my hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need sleeping.</v>

1109
01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:29.180
<v Speaker 3>I'll wake up upstairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm downstairs sweating.</v>

1110
01:07:29.590 --> 01:07:32.960
<v Speaker 3>Needed oil on my hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1111
01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:34.503
<v Speaker 3>How come this is a very unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It unusual because I knew you guys were </v>

1112
01:07:40.281 --> 01:07:43.370
<v Speaker 3>coming and I want it to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm wanting to do the right thing,</v>

1113
01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:45.500
<v Speaker 3>but the question is now</v>

1114
01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:48.500
<v Speaker 2>and I've learned that you were such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexican food fanatic,</v>

1115
01:07:48.501 --> 01:07:49.334
<v Speaker 2>which I appreciate so much is because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was originally planning to cook some </v>

1116
01:07:52.971 --> 01:07:55.910
<v Speaker 2>filet minions and all my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give you the option.</v>

1117
01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:57.240
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

1118
01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:02.240
<v Speaker 3>probably just follow up with my follow </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

1119
01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:13.610
<v Speaker 3>You got a couple of Chubby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is good edge.</v>

1120
01:08:13.630 --> 01:08:15.890
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys can have a side conversation.</v>

1121
01:08:15.930 --> 01:08:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Me and Jason could talk all day about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of Hokey.</v>

1122
01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:24.600
<v Speaker 2>Like my bread,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you see,</v>

1123
01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:26.270
<v Speaker 2>it seems like you're in deep in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bread world,</v>

1124
01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:27.800
<v Speaker 2>so this is going to be a real test for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1125
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:31.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to eat it plain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to eat it with butter.</v>

1126
01:08:32.170 --> 01:08:35.930
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nutella we're prepared.</v>

1127
01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:37.070
<v Speaker 2>You're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We bought,</v>

1128
01:08:37.670 --> 01:08:41.330
<v Speaker 2>we bought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we bought butter.</v>

1129
01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:42.350
<v Speaker 2>Salted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

1130
01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:44.420
<v Speaker 2>French.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very nice.</v>

1131
01:08:45.190 --> 01:08:49.840
<v Speaker 2>And Jelly cream cheese obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1132
01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:54.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't usually have cream cheese on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's a killer one?</v>

1133
01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:59.500
<v Speaker 2>Cream cheese and jelly sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1134
01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:02.313
<v Speaker 2>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So back to the meats because the bread </v>

1135
01:09:06.650 --> 01:09:11.650
<v Speaker 2>was Scott sorta started dinner and no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're one course down.</v>

1136
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:15.770
<v Speaker 2>Don't jump the gun.</v>

1137
01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:19.813
<v Speaker 2>So I think that my specialty is </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely cooking steaks so I can do </v>

1138
01:09:25.311 --> 01:09:26.900
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also,</v>

1139
01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:30.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean Mexican food teco wrongs steak </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tacos.</v>

1140
01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:32.860
<v Speaker 2>You can vary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1141
01:09:32.861 --> 01:09:33.800
<v Speaker 2>you can vary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go wrong.</v>

1142
01:09:33.830 --> 01:09:34.663
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of bad places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if we order there's a chance it's </v>

1143
01:09:37.701 --> 01:09:38.534
<v Speaker 2>going to be bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably going to be good to ask </v>

1144
01:09:39.770 --> 01:09:44.770
<v Speaker 2>because I'm Mexican food in Wisconsin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't be that.</v>

1145
01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:50.560
<v Speaker 2>Is there a good Mexican food and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>some good people out there.</v>

1146
01:09:50.690 --> 01:09:53.650
<v Speaker 2>Are they Mexican cooking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1147
01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:57.290
<v Speaker 2>They produce is not as good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That said,</v>

1148
01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:58.940
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>

1149
01:09:58.941 --> 01:10:03.941
<v Speaker 2>are you speaking from Mexican food and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Wisconsin and I might be speaking out of</v>

1150
01:10:04.251 --> 01:10:06.290
<v Speaker 2>turn because I've never been to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Wisconsin,</v>

1151
01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:11.460
<v Speaker 2>but probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

1152
01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:15.560
<v Speaker 2>I like the urgency of you to send me a </v>
<v Speaker 2>DM.</v>

1153
01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:21.160
<v Speaker 2>No private life about Mexican food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why don't we do both?</v>

1154
01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:30.460
<v Speaker 2>Sometime we should do both.</v>

1155
01:10:35.210 --> 01:10:38.260
<v Speaker 2>That'd be a fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting video almost.</v>

1156
01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.030
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1157
01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:44.760
<v Speaker 2>If people are listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anybody's left lists,</v>

1158
01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.033
<v Speaker 2>they're going to love that one on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best videos was made a really great </v>

1159
01:10:51.381 --> 01:10:53.900
<v Speaker 2>video about like Burrito density.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see?</v>

1160
01:10:53.901 --> 01:10:58.580
<v Speaker 2>That was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He made a video analyzing the content of</v>

1161
01:10:58.581 --> 01:11:02.980
<v Speaker 2>Burritos in San Diego and it was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking great.</v>

1162
01:11:04.730 --> 01:11:07.670
<v Speaker 2>Opens up the brooders and analyzes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So good.</v>

1163
01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:10.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dedication,</v>

1164
01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:11.183
<v Speaker 2>the conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he was analyzing like three </v>

1165
01:11:13.201 --> 01:11:14.034
<v Speaker 2>different major chains and like if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're making them right because </v>

1166
01:11:17.161 --> 01:11:18.540
<v Speaker 2>sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not,</v>

1167
01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:19.900
<v Speaker 2>they put French fries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>embryos,</v>

1168
01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:24.880
<v Speaker 2>and just kind of a weird twist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

1169
01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:26.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1170
01:11:26.071 --> 01:11:31.071
<v Speaker 2>you get your burger reader in Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We Got Burger Rico.</v>

1171
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:32.183
<v Speaker 2>What it sounds like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sounds like some Wisconsin and </v>

1172
01:11:39.850 --> 01:11:42.600
<v Speaker 2>that's so tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do they put ketchup in it?</v>

1173
01:11:42.601 --> 01:11:43.434
<v Speaker 2>Like my nightmare details.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's really dedicated to being a </v>

1174
01:11:49.111 --> 01:11:49.944
<v Speaker 2>hamburger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a problem in a Burrito with some </v>

1175
01:11:53.701 --> 01:11:58.230
<v Speaker 2>French fries in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably that's not okay.</v>

1176
01:12:00.130 --> 01:12:04.890
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of them know it's a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a wrap.</v>

1177
01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:06.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just her wrap.</v>

1178
01:12:07.230 --> 01:12:09.540
<v Speaker 2>If you call it a wrap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's much easier for me to handle.</v>

1179
01:12:10.930 --> 01:12:13.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I liked it that much.</v>

1180
01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:18.150
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will not eat that.</v>

1181
01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:25.550
<v Speaker 2>You can do it to the mistake and I hated</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1182
01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:30.060
<v Speaker 2>I hated it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think I'm the same way.</v>

1183
01:12:30.450 --> 01:12:33.250
<v Speaker 2>I hate it and I'll eat it either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>

1184
01:12:33.251 --> 01:12:34.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even touch it.</v>

1185
01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:37.710
<v Speaker 2>I'll start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1186
01:12:37.711 --> 01:12:42.711
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why we look like I'm actually,</v>

1187
01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:47.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat two portions of every meal or like</v>

1188
01:12:47.150 --> 01:12:49.620
<v Speaker 2>one and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty bad.</v>

1189
01:12:49.621 --> 01:12:51.750
<v Speaker 2>I ended up starving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I.</v>

1190
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:56.750
<v Speaker 2>If it doesn't look perfect to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that it's not that I want to do it,</v>

1191
01:12:57.811 --> 01:12:59.790
<v Speaker 2>I just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't eat it.</v>

1192
01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:01.830
<v Speaker 2>I hear you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you're built from a different cloth.</v>

01:13:05.550 --> 01:13:08.880
<v Speaker 2>I have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've my food falling apart and then it's</v>

1195
01:13:08.881 --> 01:13:09.714
<v Speaker 2>too messy for me to eat on time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're at the restaurant and the waiter </v>

1196
01:13:16.961 --> 01:13:19.350
<v Speaker 2>is going by and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here give me that.</v>

1197
01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:20.213
<v Speaker 2>Like she was all done with their burger </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was like the whole burger was </v>

1198
01:13:22.171 --> 01:13:25.340
<v Speaker 2>still there with all this stuff and I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>had my whole plate is clear.</v>

<v Speaker 2>give me that.</v>

1200
01:13:26.370 --> 01:13:27.203
<v Speaker 2>And right when the waiters going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just taking her whole plate and </v>

1201
01:13:30.001 --> 01:13:30.834

<v Speaker 2>You just walked by and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going?</v>

<v Speaker 2>do you guys hear about.</v>

1234
01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:51.450
<v Speaker 6>There was this megabucks jackpot was </v>
<v Speaker 6>$543,</v>

1235
01:15:51.451 --> 01:15:54.470
<v Speaker 6>million bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No Damn.</v>

1236
01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:56.233
<v Speaker 6>So this was like a huge Jackpot in </v>
<v Speaker 6>California and I'm 11 employees at one </v>

1237
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:06.530
<v Speaker 6>store all went in together on tickets </v>
<v Speaker 6>and they won.</v>

1238
01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:08.203
<v Speaker 6>So basically all of the employees at </v>
<v Speaker 6>this one place are now overnight worth </v>

1239
01:16:13.281 --> 01:16:15.620
<v Speaker 6>like 60 million apiece.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm not ashamed to admit it.</v>

1285
01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:13.040
<v Speaker 2>I bought four tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dropped $10 on that.</v>

1286
01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:14.663
<v Speaker 2>Why did they tons of tickets probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They probably pulled in and bought a </v>

1287
01:19:18.481 --> 01:19:22.650
<v Speaker 2>bunch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but think just like for they bought,</v>

1288
01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:24.950
<v Speaker 2>they only like a handful of doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>achieve bucks.</v>

1289
01:19:25.330 --> 01:19:30.330
<v Speaker 2>Spent $10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bucks a piece.</v>

1290
01:19:33.650 --> 01:19:35.490
<v Speaker 2>So 11 people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so 22 bucks.</v>

1291
01:19:35.550 --> 01:19:37.170
<v Speaker 2>They probably had 11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a decent amount.</v>

1292
01:19:37.171 --> 01:19:39.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

1293
01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:43.770
<v Speaker 2>Have you guys ever played the lottery?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever buy ticket and just fantasize?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1296
01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:52.260
<v Speaker 2>My mom used to always do the same where </v>
<v Speaker 2>she buy,</v>

1297
01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.153
<v Speaker 2>when the lottery get big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'd buy ticket and then for like the </v>

1298
01:19:55.471 --> 01:20:00.471
<v Speaker 2>whole week she would just talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>fantasizing about the ball for the whole</v>

1299
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:13.010
<v Speaker 7>week.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like I would move to Florida and I would</v>

1300
01:20:14.581 --> 01:20:19.581
<v Speaker 7>do with the kitchen this way and like </v>
<v Speaker 7>really extended fantasy,</v>

1301
01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:24.420
<v Speaker 2>started getting you excited and file </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we are going to win.</v>

1302
01:20:24.710 --> 01:20:29.440
<v Speaker 9>My Dad used to own and kiosk and really </v>
<v Speaker 9>I didn't know your dad was a key ops man</v>

1303
01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:32.000
<v Speaker 9>and I don't know if you know and that is</v>
<v Speaker 9>here,</v>

1304
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:37.470
<v Speaker 9>like if I got a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So they,</v>

1305
01:20:37.870 --> 01:20:38.703
<v Speaker 9>they did a lottery there and I just </v>
<v Speaker 9>remember all the old people going in </v>

1306
01:20:42.821 --> 01:20:46.790
<v Speaker 9>there and like placing their bats and </v>
<v Speaker 9>they're so serious about it.</v>

1307
01:20:46.791 --> 01:20:51.791
<v Speaker 9>There's like combos and like I'll do the</v>
<v Speaker 9>acs and the ACS Combo and I dunno,</v>

1308
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:55.730
<v Speaker 9>I ain't gonna even know what it means </v>
<v Speaker 9>even though it's completely random.</v>

1309
01:20:56.460 --> 01:21:00.560
<v Speaker 9>I know the people that when like they're</v>
<v Speaker 9>doing their exam,</v>

1310
01:21:00.561 --> 01:21:02.000
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>like they're all,</v>

1311
01:21:05.770 --> 01:21:07.590
<v Speaker 2>it's been three days since the seven </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks.</v>

1312
01:21:07.690 --> 01:21:08.523
<v Speaker 2>First number on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine though that amount of </v>

1313
01:21:12.501 --> 01:21:14.060
<v Speaker 2>money to win?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so obscene.</v>

1314
01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:18.290
<v Speaker 2>Half a billion dollars for literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing nothing.</v>

1315
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:20.263
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to say no to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where the Jackpot is so high </v>

1316
01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:27.640
<v Speaker 2>because so many people in bond </v>
<v Speaker 2>overnight,</v>

1317
01:21:27.951 --> 01:21:28.784
<v Speaker 2>one of the richest people in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does that differ from what are </v>

1318
01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.570
<v Speaker 2>weird?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it works.</v>

1319
01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:35.960
<v Speaker 2>They're just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make money by people buying tickets</v>

1320
01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:39.920
<v Speaker 2>makes the jackpot larger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually the lawyer always one.</v>

1321
01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:44.020
<v Speaker 2>Obviously the lottery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lottery every night.</v>

1322
01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:48.290
<v Speaker 2>Actually the lotteries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the interesting thing it was,</v>

1323
01:21:48.650 --> 01:21:49.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember where I learned about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1324
01:21:49.851 --> 01:21:54.851
<v Speaker 2>but it was made to be a public service,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like it's like a voluntary tax.</v>

1325
01:21:55.490 --> 01:21:56.323
<v Speaker 2>Literally that's how they thought about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and it originated in like Japan and </v>

1326
01:21:59.091 --> 01:22:01.040
<v Speaker 2>so you will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give us a book,</v>

1327
01:22:02.210 --> 01:22:05.690
<v Speaker 2>have a chance to win a prize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the money goes to civic services,</v>

1328
01:22:06.210 --> 01:22:07.043
<v Speaker 2>so like they use the lottery money to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fund schools and local shit and that's </v>

1329
01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:13.330
<v Speaker 2>still what they do today if you'd like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The California lottery is a.</v>

1330
01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:17.160
<v Speaker 2>is a public fund used for the benefit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The welfare of the gut?</v>

1331
01:22:17.250 --> 01:22:19.570
<v Speaker 7>I don't know why I always thought it </v>
<v Speaker 7>interesting.</v>

1332
01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:22.733
<v Speaker 7>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's so like it's a California state </v>

1333
01:22:29.331 --> 01:22:31.390
<v Speaker 7>lottery,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so it's run by the APP.</v>

1334
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:32.910
<v Speaker 9>It.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think it's the same.</v>

1335
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:37.380
<v Speaker 9>Well because I've seen like you'll see </v>
<v Speaker 9>like an auditorium and it says the.</v>

1336
01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:42.350
<v Speaker 2>It's a voluntary tax is literally a </v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntary tax.</v>

1337
01:22:43.370 --> 01:22:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Growing up,</v>

1338
01:22:44.961 --> 01:22:47.810
<v Speaker 2>my dad always would tell me it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idiot tax.</v>

1339
01:22:47.850 --> 01:22:52.850
<v Speaker 2>That was another word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then whenever the Jackpot was huge,</v>

1340
01:22:52.911 --> 01:22:53.744
<v Speaker 2>like it was on this one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would still go buy a ticket like </v>

1341
01:22:55.230 --> 01:22:57.030
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1342
01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:58.730
<v Speaker 2>my brother explained it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>

1343
01:22:58.820 --> 01:22:59.690
<v Speaker 2>Science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1344
01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:05.380
<v Speaker 2>at a certain point when it gets so big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're actually statistically</v>

1345
01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:09.220
<v Speaker 6>a favorable bet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

1346
01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:14.940
<v Speaker 6>Let's say you have like a one in 10 </v>
<v Speaker 6>million chance of winning and so usually</v>

1347
01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:19.180
<v Speaker 6>let's say the price is 5 million bucks </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you buy ticket,</v>

1348
01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:20.133
<v Speaker 6>so that's not a statistically good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Say if you put a dollar and you stand </v>

1349
01:23:23.921 --> 01:23:27.020
<v Speaker 6>the win half a billion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then all the sudden,</v>

1350
01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:30.040
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1351
01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:34.530
<v Speaker 6>maybe there's logic there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't win if you don't play Nice.</v>

1352
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:35.980
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She didn't want one.</v>

1353
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:41.050
<v Speaker 6>Not No one wins.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nobody went,</v>

1354
01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:43.750
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have a great video about the lottery.</v>

1355
01:23:43.751 --> 01:23:44.790
<v Speaker 6>I want to watch with you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1356
01:23:44.810 --> 01:23:45.970
<v Speaker 6>there's another story I want to talk </v>
<v Speaker 6>about.</v>

1357
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:47.890
<v Speaker 6>Just cracked me up.</v>

1358
01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:50.730
<v Speaker 2>Nela,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almond breeze,</v>

1359
01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:52.410
<v Speaker 2>almond breeze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys drink almond milk?</v>

1360
01:23:52.690 --> 01:23:53.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you'll be.</v>

1361
01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:54.713
<v Speaker 2>You'll be horrified to know that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>being recalled because there's actually </v>

1362
01:23:59.131 --> 01:24:01.530
<v Speaker 2>a trace amount of real book in it.</v>

1363
01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:12.350
<v Speaker 7>Even like some other day I was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I had a big old bowl of honey smacks,</v>

1364
01:24:14.091 --> 01:24:16.820
<v Speaker 7>like the cereal that I never eat.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just picked it for some reason.</v>

1365
01:24:16.821 --> 01:24:17.241
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

1366
01:24:17.241 --> 01:24:18.074
<v Speaker 7>I'll have honey smacks.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then like we're driving home from </v>

1367
01:24:19.551 --> 01:24:20.384
<v Speaker 7>Milwaukee.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm like this fucking crazy radio </v>

1368
01:24:22.221 --> 01:24:25.100
<v Speaker 7>stations.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like on this goofy hip hop station,</v>

1369
01:24:25.410 --> 01:24:26.740
<v Speaker 7>Dj fresh,</v>

<v Speaker 7>Has Salmonella and it like what the </v>

1371
01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:37.800
<v Speaker 7>fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like a sub plot from Salmonella funds to</v>

1372
01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:48.830
<v Speaker 7>throw and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

1373
01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:53.300
<v Speaker 7>you thought I was going to Salmonella.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1374
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:54.663
<v Speaker 7>but isn't that fucking hilarious?</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're making all men milk a milk </v>

1375
01:24:59.211 --> 01:25:00.044
<v Speaker 7>alternative and somehow real milk is </v>
<v Speaker 7>slipping into how the hell does that </v>

1376
01:25:05.331 --> 01:25:10.331
<v Speaker 7>happen?</v>
<v Speaker 7>One mission to not have milk,</v>

1377
01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:18.870
<v Speaker 2>they're recalling 145,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>half gallons of almond milk because they</v>

1378
01:25:18.871 --> 01:25:21.700
<v Speaker 2>could contain actual milk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoops.</v>

1379
01:25:22.590 --> 01:25:23.423
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no information about why actual </v>

1380
01:25:26.850 --> 01:25:30.540
<v Speaker 2>milk got into the almond milk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to dig into it and just nobody.</v>

1381
01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:34.020
<v Speaker 2>Nobody has any excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a great mystery.</v>

1382
01:25:35.190 --> 01:25:36.023
<v Speaker 2>I just loved the idea of somebody going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to buy almond milk because they're like </v>

1383
01:25:38.251 --> 01:25:41.370
<v Speaker 2>a Vegan or something and there's just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>trace amount of real milk.</v>

1384
01:25:41.371 --> 01:25:46.200
<v Speaker 2>It just like a little prankster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like disgruntled worker.</v>

1385
01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:49.900
<v Speaker 2>Just a little milk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1386
01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:50.753
<v Speaker 2>that's not like a little mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like a fucking like a month of </v>

1387
01:25:53.950 --> 01:25:57.270
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long does that go on?</v>

1388
01:25:58.770 --> 01:26:00.720
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno know the recalling a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>milk.</v>

1389
01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:03.120
<v Speaker 2>And why does the almonds have to pay for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1390
01:26:03.710 --> 01:26:04.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many,</v>

1391
01:26:05.690 --> 01:26:08.360
<v Speaker 2>how many defenses almonds are going </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

1392
01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:11.293
<v Speaker 3>Jason was freaking out about the cereal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thought they were like rubbing raw </v>

1393
01:26:14.361 --> 01:26:15.600
<v Speaker 3>chicken on the serialized</v>

1394
01:26:18.170 --> 01:26:21.340
<v Speaker 2>cereal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cereal wasn't a cook,</v>

1395
01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:24.720
<v Speaker 2>but what touch like every piece of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cereal or like what?</v>

<v Speaker 7>let's,</v>

1440
01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:09.580
<v Speaker 7>let's squash this.</v>

1441
01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:12.290
<v Speaker 2>Beef menial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Always fight about food.</v>

1442
01:29:12.291 --> 01:29:13.580
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Anymore.</v>

1443
01:29:14.570 --> 01:29:15.403
<v Speaker 2>It used to be all we fought about like </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're telling her to eat or like </v>

1444
01:29:18.771 --> 01:29:19.740
<v Speaker 2>where do you eat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because Ila,</v>

1445
01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:21.930
<v Speaker 9>I don't know why we argue so much about </v>
<v Speaker 9>it</v>

1446
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:25.830
<v Speaker 2>because like it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to tell.</v>

1447
01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:30.300
<v Speaker 9>I come from like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>my mom usually cooks all the time,</v>

1448
01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:33.300
<v Speaker 9>so growing up I only ate at home so I </v>
<v Speaker 9>ate.</v>

1449
01:29:33.390 --> 01:29:35.640
<v Speaker 9>I hate eating outside and</v>

1450
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:36.863
<v Speaker 7>I up the opposite.</v>

1451
01:29:38.710 --> 01:29:40.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all right.</v>

1452
01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:46.950
<v Speaker 9>Ethan ate out like every time all day.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>

1453
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:52.000
<v Speaker 9>That's as I understand it the same.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So that is why we would have a lot of</v>

1454
01:29:53.570 --> 01:29:56.450
<v Speaker 2>like I wanted to eat out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1455
01:29:56.451 --> 01:29:58.150
<v Speaker 2>You don't like eating out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have anything else,</v>

1456
01:29:59.330 --> 01:30:02.030
<v Speaker 9>but we don't really argue about it and </v>
<v Speaker 9>as much anymore</v>

1457
01:30:04.390 --> 01:30:06.720
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've learned to do at home.</v>

1458
01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:09.450

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1496
01:32:05.921 --> 01:32:09.010

01:32:09.011 --> 01:32:13.850
<v Speaker 2>Just like a couple bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a quick turnaround here.</v>

1498
01:32:15.070 --> 01:32:17.710
<v Speaker 2>Why did you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he's like a son to me.</v>

1499
01:32:18.190 --> 01:32:22.030
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's almost like she wishes she didn't </v>

1501
01:32:27.911 --> 01:32:28.744
<v Speaker 2>win because then she'd almost rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they didn't win and then that they </v>

1502
01:32:33.521 --> 01:32:35.650
<v Speaker 2>were still like friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:38.170
<v Speaker 2>Like it's ruined her life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are they going to do?</v>

1504
01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:40.250
<v Speaker 2>It's like you just won $600,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Going in and out spend half of it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>attorneys.</v>

1506
01:32:46.150 --> 01:32:50.530
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll get over it on the winning ticket.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've got some other stuff here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we really blessed.</v>

1512
01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:10.600
<v Speaker 2>We really spent a lot of time on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>

1513
01:33:12.270 --> 01:33:14.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't have regrets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me if you want to watch any of this</v>

1514
01:33:14.801 --> 01:33:16.600
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can wrap it up.</v>

1515

<v Speaker 2>Squash some stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I've got Christian mom upset by </v>

<v Speaker 2>Have you seen that by one,</v>

1517
01:33:23.290 --> 01:33:26.590
<v Speaker 2>by one with 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an investment.</v>

1518
01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:28.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1519
01:33:28.630 --> 01:33:29.463
<v Speaker 2>It's an audit because I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was kind of related to you writing </v>

1520
01:33:31.331 --> 01:33:35.140
<v Speaker 2>your own hip hop song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't do it.</v>

1521
01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:37.770
<v Speaker 2>I kind of want to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1522
01:33:38.290 --> 01:33:40.270
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

1523
01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:45.420
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to put on the person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1524
01:33:45.930 --> 01:33:46.763
<v Speaker 2>Oh the.</v>

1525
01:33:48.090 --> 01:33:49.610
<v Speaker 13>It's a little long.</v>
<v Speaker 13>So bear with me.</v>

1526
01:33:50.250 --> 01:33:53.760
<v Speaker 2>The song by Vince staples called North </v>
<v Speaker 2>North on the radio.</v>

1527
01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:55.120
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a great song,</v>

1528
01:33:55.130 --> 01:33:59.490
<v Speaker 2>but as far as hip hop songs go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really not the worst one.</v>

1529
01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:01.560
<v Speaker 2>Not even close,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1530
01:34:01.650 --> 01:34:02.630
<v Speaker 2>He's got a message,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1531
01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:03.473
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's having like a mental breakdown </v>

1532
01:34:06.091 --> 01:34:06.924
<v Speaker 2>that it was playing on the radio and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best she reads the whole lyrics to the </v>

1533
01:34:11.521 --> 01:34:16.350
<v Speaker 2>song with the best part is that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>she literally reads every single lyric,</v>

1534
01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:17.333
<v Speaker 2>they were able to mix it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she's singing the song like he sat </v>

1535
01:34:20.941 --> 01:34:24.300
<v Speaker 2>there for like 12 minutes reading and </v>
<v Speaker 2>crying and having,</v>

1536
01:34:25.630 --> 01:34:27.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great</v>

1537
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:33.650
<v Speaker 13>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 13>You don't die.</v>

1538
01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:38.370
<v Speaker 13>I just want to dance with you baby.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Just don't move too fast,</v>

1539
01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:41.390
<v Speaker 13>man.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Down shaded.</v>

1540
01:34:42.170 --> 01:34:47.170
<v Speaker 13>Take a Nigga mind on that and we </v>
<v Speaker 13>function on my Yankee hat.</v>

1541
01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:55.980
<v Speaker 13>Gangster gangster rap shit is </v>
<v Speaker 13>everywhere.</v>

1542
01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:58.820

<v Speaker 13>kitchen,</v>

<v Speaker 13>That was the first verse.</v>

1547
01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:18.110

<v Speaker 13>The main chorus says,</v>

<v Speaker 13>police.</v>

1549
01:35:22.130 --> 01:35:22.963
<v Speaker 13>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 13>I ain't never ran from nothing but the </v>

<v Speaker 13>It's a good day.</v>
