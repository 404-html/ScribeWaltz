<v Speaker 2>for anything anytime soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just hang out here and do cool stuff.</v>

120
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.753
<v Speaker 2>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you've been talking a lot about </v>

121
00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:34.360
<v Speaker 2>being burned out and taking a break from</v>
<v Speaker 2>your panel.</v>

122
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 2>Is that kind of is coming out to la </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like therapeutic kind of get away</v>

123
00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:40.750
<v Speaker 2>from the life back there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

124
00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:41.584
<v Speaker 2>Which is weird cause I said that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>needed a break and I was getting burned </v>

125
00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:46.030
<v Speaker 2>out and I just needed to figure out what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to do and everyone's was like,</v>

126
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.640
<v Speaker 2>La is not the place to go find yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

127
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Disagree by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really I feel like La gets a bad rep.</v>

128
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that La is,</v>

129
00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.100
<v Speaker 2>this is a huge metropolis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the biggest,</v>

130
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean per square miles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's enormous.</v>

131
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.730
<v Speaker 2>There's so many different communities </v>
<v Speaker 2>and different you can be and do whatever</v>

132
00:05:03.731 --> 00:05:05.710
<v Speaker 2>you want here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why everyone has such a bad</v>

133
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.530
<v Speaker 2>perception of La la.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

134
00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:11.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I agree with doing well</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

135
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.350
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean you are in a sense kind of,</v>

136
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean you out here kind of just trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to figure things out or is it more just,</v>

137
00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:18.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coincidental.</v>

138
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what bit of both.</v>

139
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

140
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.903
<v Speaker 2>I was just got really miserable doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the types of videos I was doing after </v>

141
00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:25.714
<v Speaker 2>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a whole month where I was </v>

142
00:05:26.741 --> 00:05:28.030
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is crap.</v>

143
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.670
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm uploading Shit just for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sake of uploading.</v>

144
00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:34.350
<v Speaker 2>And I was so stringent on my schedule </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was so proud of that schedule.</v>

145
00:05:34.351 --> 00:05:35.560
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to break that.</v>

146
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.690
<v Speaker 2>But your fans could they tell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

147
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.850
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was what made me do it cause they,</v>

148
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:41.470
<v Speaker 2>they started being able to see it and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

149
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:43.390
<v Speaker 2>well if I'm not enjoying it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not enjoying it.</v>

150
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.340
<v Speaker 2>What kind of comments would they say </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you were like,</v>

151
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.990
<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe just like a,</v>

152
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.380
<v Speaker 2>I didn't seem happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the energy I normally had.</v>

153
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:52.420
<v Speaker 2>I looked sad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked tired,</v>

154
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:53.800
<v Speaker 2>which I fully agreed with.</v>

155
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.633
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it just came to a point where </v>

156
00:05:55.871 --> 00:05:56.261
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

157
00:05:56.261 --> 00:05:57.260
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to,</v>

158
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 2>and I was coming here anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was like,</v>

159
00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:00.530
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll on the way to la,</v>

160
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:01.364
<v Speaker 2>I'll just take a week off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never ever taken any time off of </v>

161
00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:05.270
<v Speaker 2>youtube and the five years I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it,</v>

162
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:05.991
<v Speaker 2>so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

163
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 2>full break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Youtube,</v>

164
00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:09.260
<v Speaker 2>no twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no tumbler,</v>

165
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:10.520
<v Speaker 2>no instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no none of that.</v>

166
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.510
<v Speaker 2>And I decided would just spend a week of</v>
<v Speaker 2>my own and it was great.</v>

167
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.260
<v Speaker 2>I got here and hung out with friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Completely changed my mind again.</v>

168
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.180
<v Speaker 2>You feeling better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

169
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:23.660
<v Speaker 2>100% I'm completely one 80 done where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

170
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.240
<v Speaker 2>You feeling like motivated to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but are you,</v>

171
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 2>are you afraid?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you get back into it,</v>

172
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:28.904
<v Speaker 2>you almost fall back into it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that was my problem was like </v>

173
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Speaker 2>I've been through that same exact thing.</v>

174
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't have a crazy upload </v>
<v Speaker 2>schedule like you were,</v>

175
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.600
<v Speaker 2>you were doing two videos the day for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>

176
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.220
<v Speaker 2>Five years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you went,</v>

177
00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:43.430
<v Speaker 2>you started doing one a day recently or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

178
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.110
<v Speaker 2>whenever I'd have to go out and tour or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

179
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:47.330
<v Speaker 2>I kind of bump it down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was still like,</v>

180
00:06:47.331 --> 00:06:48.590
<v Speaker 2>can you still wore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still working.</v>

181
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.260
<v Speaker 2>I remember seeing you in New York a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple,</v>

182
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.930
<v Speaker 2>couple of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 16 yeah,</v>

183
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.250
<v Speaker 2>it was a long ass time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

184
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.450
<v Speaker 2>and you and Felix and mark were there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

185
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.161
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

186
00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:05.820
<v Speaker 2>we all made videos ahead of time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all scheduled the upload.</v>

187
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:06.683
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

188
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's just fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just twisted.</v>

189
00:07:12.201 --> 00:07:16.200
<v Speaker 2>Like there's something fucked up about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this job in particular.</v>

190
00:07:16.201 --> 00:07:17.034
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

191
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.253
<v Speaker 2>I mean to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my stuff is a lot easier to do than the </v>

192
00:07:20.301 --> 00:07:21.440
<v Speaker 2>ones you did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

193
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:22.274
<v Speaker 2>But still let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're still making two videos a </v>

194
00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:24.710
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

195
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Speaker 2>And you still under the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>expectation,</v>

196
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.810
<v Speaker 2>your fans have expectations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have expectations of yourself.</v>

197
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our approach is different,</v>

198
00:07:32.751 --> 00:07:35.210
<v Speaker 2>but the consumption of time and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>expectation is the same.</v>

199
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's fair.</v>

200
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.050
<v Speaker 2>But like this job seems particularly </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up,</v>

201
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is it about,</v>

202
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 2>because everyone was talking about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing of like burnout,</v>

203
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:44.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Youtube or burnout.</v>

204
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.610
<v Speaker 2>That's really big right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's so aware.</v>

205
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:51.700
<v Speaker 2>We haven't posted a video where we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of burnout.</v>

206
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.950
<v Speaker 2>I would say for all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fully burnt out.</v>

207
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.790
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no wax left in the camp.</v>

208
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm new canvas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking out a new candle.</v>

209
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.930
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like handle smell like lavender jasmine.</v>

210
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:10.720
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not those are the lavender is flowing in</v>

211
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:13.040
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

212
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.460
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need a new essence.</v>

213
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.780
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

214
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:23.590
<v Speaker 2>Why is being a Youtuber so fucked up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's rolled psychopaths.</v>

215
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.213
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's because you started it </v>

216
00:08:26.841 --> 00:08:27.674
<v Speaker 2>cause you love it and then it becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>your job and then you have an audience </v>

217
00:08:29.991 --> 00:08:30.824
<v Speaker 2>and people to take care of and you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do the best you can and it's just a </v>

218
00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:34.094
<v Speaker 2>platform and a job that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not really allowed take time </v>

219
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.910
<v Speaker 2>allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do whatever the fuck you want.</v>

220
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:38.773
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's just not in your best interest </v>

221
00:08:40.461 --> 00:08:41.540
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And no one's,</v>

222
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:42.830
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're your own boss.</v>

223
00:08:42.831 --> 00:08:43.664
<v Speaker 2>You make your own hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make your own schedules and then </v>

224
00:08:45.421 --> 00:08:47.000
<v Speaker 2>it's the curse I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

225
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.863
<v Speaker 2>And now it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube is just in such a weird place </v>

226
00:08:49.221 --> 00:08:50.054
<v Speaker 2>anyway with all the shit that's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening over the last year or two </v>

227
00:08:52.491 --> 00:08:56.280
<v Speaker 2>years and now they're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>diversify their streams and everything.</v>

228
00:08:56.281 --> 00:08:59.070
<v Speaker 2>So everyone just feels like on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>treadmill more than ever.</v>

229
00:08:59.071 --> 00:08:59.904
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right and then it's just coming to a </v>

230
00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:01.644
<v Speaker 2>head and then one person talks about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would sperms another person to talk </v>

231
00:09:03.841 --> 00:09:06.480
<v Speaker 2>about it and then 10 other people start </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about it on our,</v>

232
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.670
<v Speaker 2>everyone's able to talk about that.</v>

233
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.573
<v Speaker 3>I think part of the problem too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think everything you said is exactly </v>

234
00:09:10.141 --> 00:09:10.974
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you're your own boss and </v>

235
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.450
<v Speaker 3>when you're involved in something as,</v>

236
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:16.890
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

237
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean I want to say toxic but that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not specific.</v>

238
00:09:19.831 --> 00:09:22.560
<v Speaker 3>It's just so like you're on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>treadmill,</v>

239
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:23.394
<v Speaker 3>you're on the hamster wheel and it just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like you got to keep the machine </v>

240
00:09:25.801 --> 00:09:26.634
<v Speaker 3>rolling.</v>

241
00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.041
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

242
00:09:27.041 --> 00:09:29.210
<v Speaker 2>the mentalities on youtube have changed </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot over the years.</v>

243
00:09:29.211 --> 00:09:33.110
<v Speaker 2>Like three years ago at the gaming scene</v>
<v Speaker 2>was all collaborative all the time.</v>

244
00:09:33.111 --> 00:09:33.944
<v Speaker 2>It was in your best interest to collab </v>
<v Speaker 2>with people in like beauty gurus and </v>

245
00:09:36.771 --> 00:09:40.070
<v Speaker 2>everybody would be doing it to now no </v>
<v Speaker 2>one doesn't because everyone's afraid of</v>

246
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.233
<v Speaker 2>stepping on each other's toes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone wants to insulate their own </v>

247
00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:46.160
<v Speaker 2>brand and build it as far as they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything gets very,</v>

248
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:47.840
<v Speaker 2>I was self involved</v>

249
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:48.923
<v Speaker 3>I think I was going to say is that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think now it's more competitive because </v>

250
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:56.220
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you ask an average 10 year old</v>

251
00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:58.590
<v Speaker 3>what their dream job is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone wants to be a utuber.</v>

252
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like so competitive and it's so</v>

253
00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:03.570
<v Speaker 3>hard to become to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

254
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.273
<v Speaker 3>earn a living on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big youtuber that I think that's </v>

255
00:10:07.591 --> 00:10:09.460
<v Speaker 3>part of what's so toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

256
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.610
<v Speaker 3>About what it's become.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're definitely right.</v>

257
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:12.444
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just not,</v>

258
00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.700
<v Speaker 2>and we can all see each others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't see what each other makes.</v>

259
00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:18.040
<v Speaker 2>But if you make a certain amount of view</v>
<v Speaker 2>is like somebody else,</v>

260
00:10:18.041 --> 00:10:18.874
<v Speaker 2>you kind of know what everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>makings or every youtuber kind of knows </v>

261
00:10:21.041 --> 00:10:23.140
<v Speaker 2>what if your subs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see your views,</v>

262
00:10:23.141 --> 00:10:25.940
<v Speaker 2>you can see your like how interested </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are the comments.</v>

263
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:28.030
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well mine's better than yours.</v>

264
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.160
<v Speaker 2>And then if your yours isn't better than</v>
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>

265
00:10:30.161 --> 00:10:32.980
<v Speaker 2>than you do some weird shit to try and </v>
<v Speaker 2>get it to be better than somebody else.</v>

266
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:34.750
<v Speaker 2>And it's a lot of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

267
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:37.840
<v Speaker 2>it's not friendly rivalry anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's,</v>

268
00:10:37.841 --> 00:10:39.100
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if somebody uploads something,</v>

269
00:10:39.101 --> 00:10:42.160
<v Speaker 2>you think it's cool so you like want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do better.</v>

270
00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:43.053
<v Speaker 2>Now it's a case of like I can fucking do</v>
<v Speaker 2>better than that and you try and shit </v>

271
00:10:46.061 --> 00:10:47.310
<v Speaker 2>all over somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's that.</v>

272
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:48.283
<v Speaker 2>That's what I feel like youtube at large</v>
<v Speaker 2>is now everyone's trying to be better </v>

273
00:10:50.831 --> 00:10:52.060
<v Speaker 2>than each other in that way.</v>

274
00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:54.190
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

275
00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:56.160
<v Speaker 3>I guess whatever came became popular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

276
00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.740
<v Speaker 3>I swear I feel like I in some way has </v>
<v Speaker 3>played a role in that.</v>

277
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:01.143
<v Speaker 3>I do so because like I feel like when we</v>
<v Speaker 3>first started coming up popular on </v>

278
00:11:06.461 --> 00:11:07.294
<v Speaker 3>Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was from reaction videos and like </v>

279
00:11:09.611 --> 00:11:11.770
<v Speaker 3>shitting on people and just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

280
00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:13.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>choose your target wisely,</v>

281
00:11:13.571 --> 00:11:15.490
<v Speaker 3>but like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you bay,</v>

282
00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean our early videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just really shitting on people.</v>

283
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that we did collaborate with</v>

284
00:11:22.121 --> 00:11:23.410
<v Speaker 3>people to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

285
00:11:23.411 --> 00:11:24.580
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

286
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:26.943
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to say that I'm like </v>

287
00:11:27.701 --> 00:11:31.360
<v Speaker 3>wholly responsible for like this trend </v>
<v Speaker 3>of like cometary channels,</v>

288
00:11:31.361 --> 00:11:35.530
<v Speaker 3>which are basically just solely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost talking shit on other creators.</v>

289
00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:37.083
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely a fad that came up </v>

290
00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:42.730
<v Speaker 3>around the time we started doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We helped popularize it.</v>

291
00:11:42.731 --> 00:11:43.290
<v Speaker 3>I can say it.</v>

292
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:44.041
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying.</v>

293
00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:46.950
<v Speaker 2>Like you guys started off and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever way you perceive it,</v>

294
00:11:46.951 --> 00:11:47.784
<v Speaker 2>but you picked your targets property,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pick people that you felt like were </v>

295
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.260
<v Speaker 2>valid in criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not shitting on someone.</v>

296
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.480
<v Speaker 2>That's just the entertainment factor of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

297
00:11:55.481 --> 00:11:55.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

298
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.670
<v Speaker 2>it's a bit more embellished than it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be,</v>

299
00:11:57.671 --> 00:12:00.880
<v Speaker 2>but then like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody else sees that and they want to</v>

300
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:01.714
<v Speaker 2>do something better and they want to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something crazier and get more views </v>

301
00:12:04.061 --> 00:12:04.894
<v Speaker 2>than you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then they end up just shitting on </v>

302
00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:06.700
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

303
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.200
<v Speaker 2>And then it becomes a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

304
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.550
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's like,</v>

305
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.033
<v Speaker 2>I see this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see this a lot where it's just really </v>

306
00:12:12.581 --> 00:12:15.040
<v Speaker 2>popular content on youtube right now is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

307
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:17.890
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to shit on someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>

308
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being creative.</v>

309
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.810
<v Speaker 2>And maybe it's not your style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's not a video like,</v>

310
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.063
<v Speaker 2>and so it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so easy and people do this and </v>

311
00:12:26.051 --> 00:12:28.960
<v Speaker 2>people love watching it being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this person's not funny.</v>

312
00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

313
00:12:30.071 --> 00:12:30.904
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're making something original and </v>

314
00:12:32.321 --> 00:12:34.180
<v Speaker 2>you're just fucking shitting on them for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

315
00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

316
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mentality is changing,</v>

317
00:12:37.901 --> 00:12:38.734
<v Speaker 2>but I see that a lot on youtube and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the people who are trying to be </v>

318
00:12:41.351 --> 00:12:43.270
<v Speaker 2>creative and actually put themselves out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

319
00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.223
<v Speaker 2>it's so scary to put yourself out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>on Youtube these days and be authentic </v>

320
00:12:47.231 --> 00:12:50.830
<v Speaker 2>and try to be creative and original </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's so many fucking,</v>

321
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:52.083
<v Speaker 2>there's so many people waiting to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>eat you alive for as like you're not </v>

322
00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:58.060
<v Speaker 2>doing anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might be unfunny and my opinion,</v>

323
00:12:58.061 --> 00:13:00.490
<v Speaker 2>but like what do I have to flush her </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying,</v>

324
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.353
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to shit on you for being an </v>

325
00:13:01.741 --> 00:13:02.574
<v Speaker 2>unfunny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus the youtube audiences have just </v>

326
00:13:04.601 --> 00:13:07.150
<v Speaker 2>changed now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they all do that now.</v>

327
00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very rare to have a community where</v>

328
00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:12.640
<v Speaker 2>everyone is actually positive all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time because you're not,</v>

329
00:13:12.641 --> 00:13:13.900
<v Speaker 2>you're not an up and comer anymore.</v>

330
00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.200
<v Speaker 2>It's not a new job to do anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not the underdog anymore.</v>

331
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.093
<v Speaker 2>Everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's more money involved in youtube </v>

332
00:13:19.781 --> 00:13:22.390
<v Speaker 2>now within the river husband,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think the audience are very keenly</v>

333
00:13:22.391 --> 00:13:23.224
<v Speaker 2>aware of that and that they want to poke</v>
<v Speaker 2>at people because they feel like it's </v>

334
00:13:26.021 --> 00:13:27.280
<v Speaker 2>easier to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

335
00:13:27.281 --> 00:13:28.150
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have money.</v>

336
00:13:28.151 --> 00:13:29.710
<v Speaker 2>It's just a matter of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I say shit to them,</v>

337
00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:30.401
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

338
00:13:30.401 --> 00:13:31.234
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're still people at the end of the </v>

339
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:32.590
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

340
00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:33.390
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

341
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:35.100
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely a big part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything,</v>

342
00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:35.983
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's just a whole bunch of building </v>

343
00:13:37.541 --> 00:13:38.374
<v Speaker 2>blocks to where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes a difference too on the </v>

344
00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:43.990
<v Speaker 2>burnout because like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody,</v>

345
00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:45.490
<v Speaker 2>even the people who talk shit on say </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

346
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.630
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one's not funny.</v>

347
00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:47.973
<v Speaker 2>That's all their videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be more stressed out </v>

348
00:13:51.101 --> 00:13:53.410
<v Speaker 2>because they're afraid that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking coat.</v>

349
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:54.890
<v Speaker 2>They're know colleagues.</v>

350
00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:55.723
<v Speaker 2>They're going to call them out for </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking up and everybody's walking on </v>

351
00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:02.530
<v Speaker 2>eggshells because it's just like a giant</v>
<v Speaker 2>mud slinging contest these days on,</v>

352
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:03.963
<v Speaker 2>I mean we went through a huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>spreadsheet of like drama and community </v>

353
00:14:06.821 --> 00:14:07.654
<v Speaker 2>and reactions and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that circle just went around and </v>

354
00:14:10.481 --> 00:14:11.314
<v Speaker 2>around for like a whole year and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that just fundamentally changed </v>

355
00:14:14.471 --> 00:14:15.304
<v Speaker 2>everything after that Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like communist Russia so that </v>

356
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:22.030
<v Speaker 2>chopping block good and get dragged out </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of the night.</v>

357
00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:22.893
<v Speaker 2>It's human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone wants to take down somebody </v>

358
00:14:24.731 --> 00:14:26.260
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone wants to find the thing.</v>

359
00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.720
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm positive and energetic all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>

360
00:14:28.721 --> 00:14:31.480
<v Speaker 2>but some people think I have like some </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird seedy underbelly,</v>

361
00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:32.643
<v Speaker 2>like I have like a weird peto ring or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that I'm keeping secret that </v>

362
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.450
<v Speaker 2>they're like somebody waiting to find it</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

363
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.790
<v Speaker 2>Well that would explain why you're so </v>
<v Speaker 2>energetic and happy.</v>

364
00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:42.850
<v Speaker 2>That's why I played happy wheels all </v>
<v Speaker 2>those years.</v>

365
00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:44.213
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's just fucking waiting to find </v>

366
00:14:44.981 --> 00:14:46.030
<v Speaker 2>that thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

367
00:14:46.031 --> 00:14:47.140
<v Speaker 2>you get shit on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

368
00:14:47.141 --> 00:14:49.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people love or hate you.</v>

369
00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:50.530
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you agree with that?</v>

370
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do people like,</v>

371
00:14:52.131 --> 00:14:54.410
<v Speaker 2>what is it do you think that people hate</v>
<v Speaker 2>about you?</v>

372
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cause it's,</v>

373
00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:57.854
<v Speaker 2>whenever you watch my content,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm obviously very boisterous and very </v>

374
00:14:59.991 --> 00:15:00.824
<v Speaker 2>loud and very energetic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some people either see that as </v>

375
00:15:02.631 --> 00:15:06.200
<v Speaker 2>genuine interests in energy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>enthusiasm,</v>

376
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.650
<v Speaker 2>but to another person it's completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>obnoxious and that's like,</v>

377
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:11.960
<v Speaker 2>I completely understand that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I watched it,</v>

378
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.170
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably have some sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought process going on.</v>

379
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.090
<v Speaker 2>It is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

380
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:17.931
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

381
00:15:17.931 --> 00:15:20.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't hate anybody who doesn't like </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I do.</v>

382
00:15:20.591 --> 00:15:22.460
<v Speaker 2>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does the hate bother you?</v>

383
00:15:22.461 --> 00:15:24.890
<v Speaker 2>Does it ever get too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it used to,</v>

384
00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I,</v>

385
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:28.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm a person who wants to like make sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's okay.</v>

386
00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:29.690
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's having a good time.</v>

387
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:32.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just wanted everybody to like,</v>

388
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:34.220
<v Speaker 2>have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when somebody doesn't have fun,</v>

389
00:15:34.221 --> 00:15:36.620
<v Speaker 2>you feel like it's your responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make them have fun button.</v>

390
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:38.090
<v Speaker 2>At this point I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

391
00:15:38.091 --> 00:15:39.490
<v Speaker 2>you can't win everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

392
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.850
<v Speaker 2>I'll just be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

393
00:15:40.851 --> 00:15:42.350
<v Speaker 2>there's still 20 million people on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>channel.</v>

394
00:15:42.351 --> 00:15:44.540
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very happy with that.</v>

395
00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.013
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't really say shit at certain </v>

396
00:15:47.091 --> 00:15:48.710
<v Speaker 2>point when you have 20 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>subscribers.</v>

397
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:49.573
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in any sort of like egotistical </v>

398
00:15:50.421 --> 00:15:51.254
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like clearly I've done </v>

399
00:15:51.741 --> 00:15:55.130
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well people have some an understatement.</v>

400
00:15:55.131 --> 00:15:55.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

401
00:15:55.851 --> 00:15:56.391
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

402
00:15:56.391 --> 00:16:00.470
<v Speaker 2>I'll feed into that positive aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the community rather than worrying about</v>

403
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.333
<v Speaker 2>what everybody else is going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever feel like you don't get </v>

404
00:16:05.151 --> 00:16:06.810
<v Speaker 2>enough credit in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and let me,</v>

405
00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:07.713
<v Speaker 2>let me explain because a lot of times </v>
<v Speaker 2>like people like you and mark computed </v>

406
00:16:11.121 --> 00:16:13.430
<v Speaker 2>by who play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people always say,</v>

407
00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:15.920
<v Speaker 2>oh you just play video games and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

408
00:16:15.921 --> 00:16:17.240
<v Speaker 2>and you have so many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much,</v>

409
00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.000
<v Speaker 2>you make so much money and you have so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many people who love you and watch you.</v>

410
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:20.833
<v Speaker 2>All you do is play video games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But clearly there's more going on that </v>

411
00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.780
<v Speaker 2>you feel like you don't get enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>credit when people say that too.</v>

412
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:29.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say so.</v>

413
00:16:29.241 --> 00:16:31.280
<v Speaker 2>I'd say that's fair cause it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are they missing?</v>

414
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:32.183
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the whole aspect outside of what </v>

415
00:16:33.801 --> 00:16:35.780
<v Speaker 2>you record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like recording it.</v>

416
00:16:35.781 --> 00:16:38.660
<v Speaker 2>Game shore day after day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an easy kind of thing to do.</v>

417
00:16:38.661 --> 00:16:40.760
<v Speaker 2>You sit down and turn on the camera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you record,</v>

418
00:16:40.761 --> 00:16:41.594
<v Speaker 2>but you have to find the games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to find stuff that people want </v>

419
00:16:43.371 --> 00:16:44.204
<v Speaker 2>to see when it's daily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything like fluctuates so much and </v>

420
00:16:46.791 --> 00:16:49.640
<v Speaker 2>you have to like be always kind of there</v>
<v Speaker 2>for your audience.</v>

421
00:16:49.641 --> 00:16:52.970
<v Speaker 2>And I'm very heavily involved in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience and interacting with them.</v>

422
00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:55.520
<v Speaker 2>So it's like after the video goes up </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

423
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:56.383
<v Speaker 2>well now I'm on social media and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>interacting with people that I'm making </v>

424
00:16:59.511 --> 00:17:02.090
<v Speaker 2>sure everyone's okay and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>re-blogging fine art.</v>

425
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:04.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm like tweeting out at people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

426
00:17:04.221 --> 00:17:05.054
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a whole lot more than just sitting </v>

427
00:17:06.741 --> 00:17:08.990
<v Speaker 2>down and recording the video and you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 20 minute video.</v>

428
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:11.240
<v Speaker 2>Like when I was recording what was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sub Nautica,</v>

429
00:17:11.241 --> 00:17:12.074
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sometimes it was an hour long </v>

430
00:17:13.461 --> 00:17:14.294
<v Speaker 2>video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was like a two and a half hour </v>

431
00:17:14.811 --> 00:17:17.900
<v Speaker 2>session that's chopped down and that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>going out every single day.</v>

432
00:17:17.901 --> 00:17:19.910
<v Speaker 2>So I was like sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

433
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.580
<v Speaker 2>and it's isolated bubble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an easy thing to do to play a game.</v>

434
00:17:22.581 --> 00:17:23.414
<v Speaker 2>And react to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to do it that consistently for that </v>

435
00:17:25.401 --> 00:17:26.810
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they never take a break.</v>

436
00:17:26.811 --> 00:17:29.600
<v Speaker 2>I feel like just insane man hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

437
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.820
<v Speaker 2>So it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not hard to do.</v>

438
00:17:31.821 --> 00:17:34.190
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to keep it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

439
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:38.150
<v Speaker 2>And I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find your rhythm,</v>

440
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.460
<v Speaker 2>you get into your schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the thing is like,</v>

441
00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:41.593
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you start seeing your channel </v>

442
00:17:43.431 --> 00:17:46.370
<v Speaker 2>growing and you start making money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like really motivating.</v>

443
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:48.200
<v Speaker 2>But you get used to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

444
00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.380
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it's like it's,</v>

445
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.450
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>

446
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.160
<v Speaker 2>It's like you lose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a thing,</v>

447
00:17:53.161 --> 00:17:55.020
<v Speaker 2>especially with my channel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it rose so quickly,</v>

448
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.510
<v Speaker 2>obviously plateaus out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every channel does.</v>

449
00:17:57.511 --> 00:17:58.470
<v Speaker 2>It's healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fine.</v>

450
00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:59.343
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But some people went their channels </v>

451
00:18:00.481 --> 00:18:03.240
<v Speaker 2>plateau with a freak out and they feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>like they have to do something else.</v>

452
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.700
<v Speaker 2>Cause no insane growth is no growth at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all to them.</v>

453
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.590
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you're used to like,</v>

454
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.270
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this steroid injection.</v>

455
00:18:10.271 --> 00:18:12.210
<v Speaker 2>So it's like you started off in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's like,</v>

456
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.740
<v Speaker 2>oh this is fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is cool.</v>

457
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.960
<v Speaker 2>And then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well now I kind of get your gimmick.</v>

458
00:18:15.961 --> 00:18:17.910
<v Speaker 2>I know what you are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what else can you do?</v>

459
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.470
<v Speaker 2>And that's the trap people can fall </v>
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>

460
00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:20.304
<v Speaker 2>Cause then that's how you ended up </v>
<v Speaker 2>recording a dead body in a forest </v>

461
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.160
<v Speaker 2>somewhere because you feel like you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to keep pushing this thing.</v>

462
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:26.993
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying that you were basically </v>

463
00:18:30.511 --> 00:18:34.350
<v Speaker 2>just maintaining what made people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you to begin with what's the right,</v>

464
00:18:34.351 --> 00:18:35.880
<v Speaker 2>but your channel hasn't really slowed </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

465
00:18:35.881 --> 00:18:37.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

466
00:18:37.801 --> 00:18:40.650
<v Speaker 2>it's not the center yourself and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

467
00:18:40.651 --> 00:18:44.940
<v Speaker 2>what I'm doing is good enough and keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it and just be stable.</v>

468
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.590
<v Speaker 2>Well that was always my mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

469
00:18:46.591 --> 00:18:48.300
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to be like,</v>

470
00:18:48.301 --> 00:18:49.170
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this keeps going,</v>

471
00:18:49.171 --> 00:18:51.870
<v Speaker 2>I'll be a 10 million at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

472
00:18:51.871 --> 00:18:53.970
<v Speaker 2>no one knows what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was always a case of like,</v>

473
00:18:53.971 --> 00:18:55.230
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people are here now,</v>

474
00:18:55.231 --> 00:18:56.940
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So entertain them,</v>

475
00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.000
<v Speaker 2>keep them happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be happy with them and do what you want.</v>

476
00:19:00.001 --> 00:19:01.380
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you keep doing it,</v>

477
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.620
<v Speaker 2>obviously you're doing something right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more people are going to come in.</v>

478
00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.840
<v Speaker 2>I think that mentality of always like </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking ahead of like,</v>

479
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.100
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could get this amount.</v>

480
00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:10.830
<v Speaker 2>That's a very slippery slope to go down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most definitely.</v>

481
00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

482
00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:15.443
<v Speaker 2>we didn't fucking real and we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>covering so much ground everybody and </v>

483
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.610
<v Speaker 2>let me hit them with one of these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember we'll still here.</v>

484
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.750
<v Speaker 2>You followed the Roseanne thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that we need to get into it.</v>

485
00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:28.584
<v Speaker 2>I just thought it just through twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard this was and I love that </v>

486
00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.580
<v Speaker 2>she actually say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

487
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:43.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean we thought a lot about it so I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to get repetitive,</v>

488
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.890
<v Speaker 2>unheard channel that happened when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>on tour.</v>

489
00:19:46.891 --> 00:19:49.770
<v Speaker 2>They recommend and we all woke up in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tour bus and looked at our twitter feeds</v>

490
00:19:49.771 --> 00:19:51.450
<v Speaker 2>and going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>

491
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.000
<v Speaker 2>Well this was from her apology video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

492
00:19:54.001 --> 00:19:55.460
<v Speaker 2>good apology Rosa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

493
00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:00.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean Christ listen clearly a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>stable human being.</v>

494
00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.910
<v Speaker 2>That was my first thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you like a touring you,</v>

495
00:20:07.911 --> 00:20:09.180
<v Speaker 2>you do a lot of touring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

496
00:20:09.181 --> 00:20:11.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean you didn't seem to be on this on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the road somewhat frequently.</v>

497
00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:13.243
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got like two legs of the tour so </v>

498
00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:16.290
<v Speaker 2>far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same show every time.</v>

499
00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:19.140
<v Speaker 2>But we can segment it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

500
00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.480
<v Speaker 2>I love live shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

501
00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:25.110
<v Speaker 2>like create her an audience in the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>room together,</v>

502
00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.950
<v Speaker 2>being able to do whatever the hell you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want and then entertaining.</v>

503
00:20:27.951 --> 00:20:30.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean having that direct live feedback </v>
<v Speaker 2>is so much fun.</v>

504
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:32.310
<v Speaker 2>I think that was part of the burnout </v>
<v Speaker 2>setting.</v>

505
00:20:32.311 --> 00:20:35.880
<v Speaker 2>Cause I did that and then I came back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>my video is alone in my bedroom.</v>

506
00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

507
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.153
<v Speaker 2>no one's here to listen right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it kind of gets in your head is </v>

508
00:20:40.581 --> 00:20:42.960
<v Speaker 2>small bits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had to reconfigure my,</v>

509
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:44.160
<v Speaker 2>my brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

510
00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.640
<v Speaker 2>I never said that word before in my life</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm fully on board with that.</v>

511
00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.900
<v Speaker 2>What do you do in your show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>

512
00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:56.440
<v Speaker 2>it's like a 90 minute standup show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a comedy show.</v>

513
00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.593
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of about my life and then talks </v>

514
00:21:00.461 --> 00:21:01.720
<v Speaker 2>about my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my childhood,</v>

515
00:21:01.721 --> 00:21:03.370
<v Speaker 2>my teenage hood and my adulthood.</v>

516
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.980
<v Speaker 2>And so it's in three acts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you talked about your childhood</v>

517
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.890
<v Speaker 2>and there's like good gaming memories </v>
<v Speaker 2>from my childhood.</v>

518
00:21:08.891 --> 00:21:12.790
<v Speaker 2>So you get people up to play a game from</v>
<v Speaker 2>your childhood and then that's insane.</v>

519
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.320
<v Speaker 2>90 minutes single man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

520
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:16.350
<v Speaker 2>Shell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

521
00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.910
<v Speaker 2>And Games are all about experience and </v>
<v Speaker 2>overcoming your obstacles,</v>

522
00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:19.744
<v Speaker 2>which life is about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you move onto your next stage </v>

523
00:21:20.921 --> 00:21:21.754
<v Speaker 2>of life and you just keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she told some funny stories from my </v>

524
00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:26.050
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess work.</v>

<v Speaker 2>we've done one live show and it was like</v>

534
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.570
<v Speaker 2>an amazing experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so,</v>

535
00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:54.220
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was magical.</v>

536
00:21:54.221 --> 00:21:55.120
<v Speaker 2>Honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a way.</v>

537
00:21:55.121 --> 00:21:57.700
<v Speaker 2>It was so intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people were there?</v>

538
00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:00.430
<v Speaker 2>It was like 200.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a small,</v>

539
00:22:00.431 --> 00:22:02.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean it wasn't a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you probably,</v>

540
00:22:02.211 --> 00:22:04.180
<v Speaker 2>what size,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what size you do.</v>

541
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:05.853
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

542
00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:06.723
<v Speaker 2>it's between like 1500 to 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is where we have to invent new </v>

543
00:22:10.341 --> 00:22:11.171
<v Speaker 2>sports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 600,</v>

544
00:22:11.171 --> 00:22:13.230
<v Speaker 2>800 depending on where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

545
00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.410
<v Speaker 2>so we just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we played a,</v>

546
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.380
<v Speaker 2>a comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a store here in la.</v>

547
00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just to kind of test it out.</v>

548
00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:22.000
<v Speaker 2>And I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really amazing,</v>

549
00:22:22.001 --> 00:22:22.834
<v Speaker 2>but it was just so much work and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like so stressful putting it together </v>

550
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:27.463
<v Speaker 2>because it was also live streamed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We livestream is fit to go and set up </v>

551
00:22:30.401 --> 00:22:31.810
<v Speaker 2>all the cameras and do all this shit.</v>

552
00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:32.950
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

553
00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.400
<v Speaker 2>but you guys did all that comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

554
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.353
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

555
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:37.263
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I work with the game grumps they have a </v>

556
00:22:38.951 --> 00:22:40.480
<v Speaker 2>20 kilo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they produced it for you.</v>

557
00:22:40.481 --> 00:22:41.314
<v Speaker 2>So you very much just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're able to show up and just do your </v>

558
00:22:45.071 --> 00:22:45.904
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just wrote the material and </v>

559
00:22:47.171 --> 00:22:48.004
<v Speaker 2>practice it and ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long it take you to rehearse it and </v>

560
00:22:49.091 --> 00:22:51.940
<v Speaker 2>prep for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for these weak,</v>

561
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.540
<v Speaker 2>you prepared it in a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

562
00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:58.000
<v Speaker 2>But like how long to like memorize it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and rehearse it and shit.</v>

563
00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never really like fully wrote it down.</v>

564
00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.370
<v Speaker 2>It is scripted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's kind of just in my head as I go</v>

565
00:23:03.371 --> 00:23:04.204
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long and then how long before you </v>

566
00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:09.340
<v Speaker 2>did performed it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A month I think.</v>

567
00:23:09.341 --> 00:23:12.140
<v Speaker 2>And how was the first show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great Fun.</v>

568
00:23:12.141 --> 00:23:14.110
<v Speaker 2>Touch the land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you didn't,</v>

569
00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.093
<v Speaker 2>you didn't really rehearse it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I did in my head over and over </v>

570
00:23:17.681 --> 00:23:19.600
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not like properly out loud,</v>

571
00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:20.650
<v Speaker 2>like start to finish it.</v>

572
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:25.440
<v Speaker 2>How's the snow?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't do that shit.</v>

573
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:31.640
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking balloon animals.</v>

574
00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.830
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No stop.</v>

575
00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.760
<v Speaker 2>How was your show evolve?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's,</v>

576
00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:40.630
<v Speaker 2>if it seems like if you'd just have it </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your head,</v>

577
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:42.520
<v Speaker 2>it seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is every show very different?</v>

578
00:23:42.521 --> 00:23:44.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does that Pan out?</v>

579
00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:45.283
<v Speaker 2>The life stories are all the same and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the punchlines and everything are all </v>

580
00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.193
<v Speaker 2>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's enough like Improv Room in </v>

581
00:23:50.751 --> 00:23:52.580
<v Speaker 2>between depending on the audience </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the audience don't,</v>

582
00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:53.533
<v Speaker 2>don't know what it is and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what to expect or anything like </v>

583
00:23:55.491 --> 00:23:56.870
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you start telling the stories,</v>

584
00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:58.610
<v Speaker 2>different jokes land with different </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

585
00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:03.500
<v Speaker 2>So it's my farm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're your fans.</v>

586
00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:04.370
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're good.</v>

587
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:06.740
<v Speaker 2>They're good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very good crowd.</v>

588
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:08.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is what I'm saying,</v>

589
00:24:08.151 --> 00:24:10.730
<v Speaker 2>like you guys did a live show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clearly your fans showed up to it.</v>

590
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:14.630
<v Speaker 2>Forgiving the barrier for entry is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much easier.</v>

591
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:17.900
<v Speaker 2>You're not going into a cold room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to prove yourself to,</v>

592
00:24:17.901 --> 00:24:20.810
<v Speaker 2>I know they're very easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should want to put it on a good show</v>

593
00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:21.653
<v Speaker 2>when something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to just get up and shit </v>

594
00:24:22.191 --> 00:24:25.610
<v Speaker 2>on stage and have people cheer for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's my next door.</v>

595
00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:26.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

596
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:29.070
<v Speaker 2>The shitting on stage just jerk off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a cop on,</v>

597
00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:33.230
<v Speaker 2>I call it circle jerking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like get me a one vip.</v>

598
00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:36.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like when we do it,</v>

599
00:24:36.321 --> 00:24:37.460
<v Speaker 2>it's the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

600
00:24:37.461 --> 00:24:42.280
<v Speaker 2>So it's different every time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the threat of bombing is,</v>

601
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:46.870
<v Speaker 2>is very much right there for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm bawling.</v>

602
00:24:46.871 --> 00:24:47.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm bombing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>

603
00:24:47.891 --> 00:24:48.724
<v Speaker 2>do you think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think it comes out of a fear of </v>

604
00:24:51.141 --> 00:24:53.390
<v Speaker 2>your audience?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

605
00:24:53.391 --> 00:24:54.800
<v Speaker 2>I just think I'm an anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

606
00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm just an anxious person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but part of why I'm,</v>

607
00:24:58.351 --> 00:25:00.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get fucking therapy on your</v>
<v Speaker 2>ass right now.</v>

608
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:02.263
<v Speaker 2>Like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where does your anxiety start and what </v>

609
00:25:03.861 --> 00:25:04.820
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what,</v>

610
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.930
<v Speaker 2>what triggers it to like kicking bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Waking Up.</v>

611
00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:10.873
<v Speaker 2>But the opening my eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there must be some like trigger factor </v>

612
00:25:12.831 --> 00:25:13.664
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're afraid of not performing </v>

613
00:25:14.961 --> 00:25:18.290
<v Speaker 2>well or letting someone down or well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not being funny.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

618
00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.280
<v Speaker 2>I need to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think your audience are here just</v>

619
00:25:28.281 --> 00:25:31.880
<v Speaker 2>to watch you be funny?</v>

<v Speaker 3>About a week ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

659
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's a lot about,</v>

660
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.290
<v Speaker 3>well I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe just the job we do,</v>

661
00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.473
<v Speaker 3>they're this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like talking a lot about balance </v>

662
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:02.183
<v Speaker 3>and that was kind of a lot of stuff I </v>
<v Speaker 3>came to terms with when I took a week </v>

663
00:27:03.601 --> 00:27:04.081
<v Speaker 3>off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

664
00:27:04.081 --> 00:27:05.820
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes a mess.</v>

665
00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:06.923
<v Speaker 3>And I was doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had never been anxious before in my </v>

666
00:27:08.221 --> 00:27:10.260
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then in the last couple of months it</v>

667
00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:11.610
<v Speaker 3>was like sitting down and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden like,</v>

668
00:27:11.611 --> 00:27:13.130
<v Speaker 3>this swell and your chest happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

669
00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:14.940
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what the,</v>

670
00:27:14.941 --> 00:27:16.530
<v Speaker 3>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

671
00:27:16.531 --> 00:27:17.364
<v Speaker 3>I don't like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The best line ever heard an eighth and </v>

672
00:27:20.251 --> 00:27:21.300
<v Speaker 3>eighth grade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this great line.</v>

673
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:23.190
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

674
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before you get on the roller coaster and</v>

675
00:27:25.621 --> 00:27:27.870
<v Speaker 3>then when you're done and you get off </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it goes away.</v>

676
00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.630
<v Speaker 3>But it's like you never get the relief </v>
<v Speaker 3>of getting,</v>

677
00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:31.710
<v Speaker 3>being dumped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The roller coaster.</v>

678
00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.320
<v Speaker 3>That's how I feel all the time right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

<v Speaker 3>soft bristles and it's got rubber on the</v>

743
00:31:04.091 --> 00:31:07.930
<v Speaker 3>outside and sometimes they'll go in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there with the toothbrush and it will be</v>

744
00:31:07.931 --> 00:31:09.220

<v Speaker 3>little bit long.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Clothes?</v>

815
00:34:32.910 --> 00:34:34.970
<v Speaker 3>Not as far as like the Internet thinks </v>
<v Speaker 3>we are.</v>

816
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:35.833
<v Speaker 3>I was just going to say how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like do you guys say you guys </v>

818
00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.330
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think we talk every single day?</v>

819
00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.680
<v Speaker 3>Because what I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

820
00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:46.653
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the Internet is quite to the </v>

821
00:34:47.991 --> 00:34:50.030
<v Speaker 3>contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm out,</v>

822
00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:50.883
<v Speaker 3>I'm gone.</v>

823
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:53.833
<v Speaker 3>There's this phenomenon on the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is completely baffled me is that </v>

824
00:34:57.561 --> 00:34:58.394
<v Speaker 3>there's fan fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you and mark having like explicit </v>

825
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Growth task.</v>

826
00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:09.290
<v Speaker 3>Sexual encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pure sodomy.</v>

827
00:35:09.291 --> 00:35:10.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

828
00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:12.260
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pure sodomy and worse.</v>

829
00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:13.513
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not there's anything wrong necessarily </v>

830
00:35:14.631 --> 00:35:16.820
<v Speaker 3>with sodomy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although thought of me.</v>

831
00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:20.340
<v Speaker 3>So I mean when you say it's sodomy mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a violent act.</v>

832
00:35:20.341 --> 00:35:21.174
<v Speaker 3>So it almost sounds like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there anything like rapey about </v>

833
00:35:23.511 --> 00:35:25.160
<v Speaker 3>threatening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just put it that way.</v>

834
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:26.023
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because you can make love to </v>

835
00:35:26.871 --> 00:35:31.871
<v Speaker 3>somebody asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like saw but sodomy.</v>

836
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:34.520
<v Speaker 3>But sodomy implies something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>nefarious.</v>

837
00:35:34.521 --> 00:35:35.990
<v Speaker 3>Am I right or am I wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan,</v>

838
00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:36.943
<v Speaker 3>can you fact check the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the definition of sodomy is sexual </v>

839
00:35:39.631 --> 00:35:42.300
<v Speaker 3>intercourse involving anal or oral </v>
<v Speaker 3>copulation.</v>

840
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:43.283
<v Speaker 3>So you'd have a romantic sodomy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went from like anxiety and youtube </v>

841
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:51.420
<v Speaker 3>and depression to fucking sodomy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically what we've just established is</v>

842
00:35:51.421 --> 00:35:54.780
<v Speaker 3>that I could sodomized you romantically.</v>

843
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't sound good though.</v>

844
00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:59.520
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't sodomy totally sodomized this </v>
<v Speaker 3>girl.</v>

845
00:35:59.521 --> 00:36:01.360
<v Speaker 3>I saw them as though that over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

846
00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:02.161
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

847
00:36:02.161 --> 00:36:03.990
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't sound,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a style,</v>

848
00:36:03.991 --> 00:36:06.810
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lifestyle.</v>

<v Speaker 2>every now and then somebody will say </v>

995
00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:42.980
<v Speaker 2>something about it and it's still a </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing on the Internet and everything and</v>

996
00:42:42.981 --> 00:42:43.814
<v Speaker 2>people would still do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't want to take away from </v>

997
00:42:44.931 --> 00:42:47.840
<v Speaker 2>people's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's their outlet to create art and</v>

998
00:42:47.841 --> 00:42:50.660
<v Speaker 2>that's how they really want to express </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

999
00:42:50.661 --> 00:42:51.494
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate being the person to take that </v>

1000
00:42:52.281 --> 00:42:56.120
<v Speaker 2>away from somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you personally via violated it seems</v>

1001
00:42:56.121 --> 00:42:58.490
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not violated.</v>

1002
00:42:58.491 --> 00:42:59.324
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something that I don't think needs </v>

1003
00:43:00.351 --> 00:43:02.120
<v Speaker 2>to exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1004
00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:05.930
<v Speaker 2>I think it went too far and like jumped </v>
<v Speaker 2>the shark too much and now it's like,</v>

1005
00:43:05.931 --> 00:43:08.840
<v Speaker 2>well you can't see it without seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that side of it anyway,</v>

1006
00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:09.580
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1007
00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:11.570
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's why I'm Kinda like,</v>

1009
00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:16.010

<v Speaker 2>even if it's not explicit anymore,</v>

<v Speaker 3>His name is Jack Septic Eye.</v>

1243
00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:22.460
<v Speaker 3>what was that like for you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well here's the thing cause there's huge</v>

1244
00:53:22.461 --> 00:53:25.070
<v Speaker 3>misconceptions about that because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>easy.</v>

1245
00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 3>Look back at me and Felix</v>

1246
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.510
<v Speaker 2>are friends and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look back and say like,</v>

1247
00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:30.570
<v Speaker 2>oh that's how he became popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the secret.</v>

1248
00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:35.190
<v Speaker 2>You just get a shadow competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at that time I was at 2.2</v>

1249
00:53:35.191 --> 00:53:40.191
<v Speaker 2>k subs there and then after that I came </v>
<v Speaker 2>home from college and it was at 15,000</v>

1250
00:53:40.771 --> 00:53:43.170
<v Speaker 2>subscribers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is fucking bananas at that moment.</v>

1251
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:48.750
<v Speaker 2>And then after like three days and went </v>
<v Speaker 2>up to 20 k and then completely stopped,</v>

1252
00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:50.213
<v Speaker 2>nothing happened after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Christine and I had been doing like </v>

1253
00:53:52.321 --> 00:53:53.154
<v Speaker 2>grand theft auto five videos twice a day</v>
<v Speaker 2>for like a week and no one was watching </v>

1254
00:53:55.861 --> 00:53:56.694
<v Speaker 2>those either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the people who came from the shout </v>

1255
00:53:57.961 --> 00:54:02.790
<v Speaker 2>out and kind of watch one video and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>got like 15 k views and then just didn't</v>

1256
00:54:02.791 --> 00:54:03.730
<v Speaker 2>watch anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone.</v>

1257
00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:04.633
<v Speaker 2>And then people just stop subscribing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It went from like getting 3000 subs a </v>

1258
00:54:07.651 --> 00:54:09.890
<v Speaker 2>day to a hundred right.</v>

1259
00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:12.600
<v Speaker 2>And then it's like no one really watched</v>
<v Speaker 2>any more.</v>

1260
00:54:12.601 --> 00:54:14.670
<v Speaker 2>So that that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the moment where I changed like</v>

1261
00:54:14.671 --> 00:54:15.504
<v Speaker 2>everything I was doing and Tristan and </v>
<v Speaker 2>became more of myself and just like </v>

1262
00:54:18.151 --> 00:54:22.650
<v Speaker 2>settled into the content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how long after the shadow was it,</v>

1263
00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:25.380
<v Speaker 2>like what's the timeline of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the growth of your channel?</v>

1264
00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:30.030
<v Speaker 2>Like in comparison is how long did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much time passed from that shadow to</v>

1265
00:54:30.031 --> 00:54:32.880
<v Speaker 2>the point where your channel started?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like picking up traction?</v>

1266
00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:36.270
<v Speaker 2>About six months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say.</v>

1267
00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:37.493
<v Speaker 2>So it was after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was September of 2013 and then </v>

1268
00:54:40.261 --> 00:54:41.094
<v Speaker 2>after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the rest of the year passed and </v>

1269
00:54:42.511 --> 00:54:43.344
<v Speaker 2>nothing was really happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some stuff was still like residual and </v>

1270
00:54:45.121 --> 00:54:47.670
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just like put my foot down.</v>

1271
00:54:47.671 --> 00:54:50.610
<v Speaker 2>I started doing videos like much harder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much better,</v>

1272
00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:51.623
<v Speaker 2>a lot more variety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't just doing the same game </v>

1273
00:54:52.951 --> 00:54:53.784
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1274
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.760
<v Speaker 2>The whole top of the morning thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>became like a huge thing at that point.</v>

1275
00:54:56.761 --> 00:54:57.594
<v Speaker 2>And then it was August,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2014 that the channel hit a million </v>

1276
00:55:00.841 --> 00:55:03.120
<v Speaker 2>soaps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was like right after that,</v>

1277
00:55:03.121 --> 00:55:07.500
<v Speaker 2>nothing really happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was the thing that instigated the</v>

1278
00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:09.240
<v Speaker 2>passion in me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was like,</v>

1279
00:55:09.241 --> 00:55:10.530
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's this opportunity.</v>

1280
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:14.760
<v Speaker 2>I thought it would make the channel huge</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it kind of died out real quick.</v>

1281
00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:15.511
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1282
00:55:15.511 --> 00:55:17.520
<v Speaker 2>well I need to do something I need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's,</v>

1283
00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:19.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is what,</v>

1284
00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:22.710
<v Speaker 2>that's the beautiful thing is anyone can</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a shadow.</v>

1285
00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:27.390
<v Speaker 2>Like it happens all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not everybody takes that.</v>

1286
00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:28.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And shout to,</v>

1287
00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:31.690
<v Speaker 2>into an opportunity to shout out alone </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't get you to no.</v>

1288
00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:32.543
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Felix at 26 million subscribers at </v>

1289
00:55:34.081 --> 00:55:38.310
<v Speaker 2>that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking just dental is even back then.</v>

1290
00:55:38.311 --> 00:55:39.960
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1291
00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:43.360
<v Speaker 2>so like five years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like six behind that.</v>

1292
00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:46.470
<v Speaker 2>And it's like if you told that kid that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was going to happen,</v>

1293
00:55:46.471 --> 00:55:49.500
<v Speaker 2>he would've lost his fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1294
00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:51.390
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that that's the testimony.</v>

1295
00:55:51.391 --> 00:55:52.171
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1296
00:55:52.171 --> 00:55:53.610
<v Speaker 2>he got a shell from Pupae,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1297
00:55:53.611 --> 00:55:56.730
<v Speaker 2>Of course he's got 20 million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like the shadow is literally,</v>

1298
00:55:57.390 --> 00:55:59.130
<v Speaker 2>it's just like a little like it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1299
00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:00.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the little,</v>

1300
00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:04.170
<v Speaker 2>it's important but like you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take,</v>

1301
00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:06.540
<v Speaker 2>and the analogy I always use is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>your channels,</v>

1302
00:56:06.541 --> 00:56:08.340
<v Speaker 2>your care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Felix is the key.</v>

1303
00:56:08.341 --> 00:56:10.050
<v Speaker 2>Turning it on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get you going,</v>

1304
00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:12.390
<v Speaker 2>teaches you how to like drive it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1305
00:56:12.391 --> 00:56:13.224
<v Speaker 2>but you're the one who has to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>change gears and stay in lane and drive </v>

1306
00:56:15.541 --> 00:56:16.374
<v Speaker 2>down to the fly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way that shadow wasn't that ethic </v>

1307
00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:19.350
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1308
00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:22.260
<v Speaker 2>it was like very lightweight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go through,</v>

1309
00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:23.113
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple of other channels who </v>

1310
00:56:23.831 --> 00:56:26.590
<v Speaker 2>he shouted out in that and there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>another channel called illmatic.</v>

1311
00:56:27.070 --> 00:56:27.903
<v Speaker 2>I remember who I thought was phenomenal </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of his editing at the time was </v>

1312
00:56:30.611 --> 00:56:33.310
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's Australian and he got up to</v>

1313
00:56:33.311 --> 00:56:37.000
<v Speaker 2>like 11 key subs and then never went any</v>
<v Speaker 2>further.</v>

1314
00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:39.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what his channel was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>now I hope he's doing well.</v>

1315
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:42.430
<v Speaker 2>He'll manic shut up but are getting a </v>
<v Speaker 2>shout out bro.</v>

1316
00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:44.340
<v Speaker 2>Shout out from shouting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting a fucking,</v>

1317
00:56:44.341 --> 00:56:46.210
<v Speaker 2>it's shout out all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what it was.</v>

1318
00:56:46.211 --> 00:56:47.044
<v Speaker 2>That kind of thing where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I want this to work so I want to </v>

1319
00:56:49.090 --> 00:56:53.290
<v Speaker 2>like put the effort in and get it going </v>
<v Speaker 2>and see how far I can push it.</v>

1320
00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:54.893
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to get a shout out you kind of have </v>

1321
00:56:55.901 --> 00:56:56.734
<v Speaker 2>to be putting the work in already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he wouldn't have shouted me out if </v>

1322
00:56:58.211 --> 00:57:01.090
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't doing two videos a day at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>point anyway.</v>

1323
00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:04.930
<v Speaker 2>Was there a point where you're getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>feedback and you're like,</v>

1324
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:05.823
<v Speaker 2>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like what I'm doing cause I </v>

1325
00:57:07.031 --> 00:57:08.530
<v Speaker 2>remember I had a moment like that where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1326
00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:09.730
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck something.</v>

1327
00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:12.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing something right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember a specific moment?</v>

1328
00:57:13.570 --> 00:57:15.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was fairly early on.</v>

1329
00:57:15.761 --> 00:57:16.594
<v Speaker 2>People obviously like the accent a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they like the energy and the </v>

1330
00:57:19.091 --> 00:57:21.900
<v Speaker 2>enthusiasm because you kick it up at one</v>
<v Speaker 2>point were,</v>

1331
00:57:22.210 --> 00:57:23.043
<v Speaker 2>I mean cause like you said that you took</v>
<v Speaker 2>the six months and you really focus on </v>

1332
00:57:25.421 --> 00:57:26.254
<v Speaker 2>your content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just something you changed where </v>

1333
00:57:27.431 --> 00:57:28.510
<v Speaker 2>people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh that,</v>

1334
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:29.710
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do more of that.</v>

1335
00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:31.383
<v Speaker 2>It was just a case of being more of </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself because at that point I was </v>

1336
00:57:33.611 --> 00:57:37.120
<v Speaker 2>trying to imitate like the metrics and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Felix to everybody else who was kind</v>

1337
00:57:37.121 --> 00:57:40.030
<v Speaker 2>of doing let's plays at that point and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then after that was like,</v>

1338
00:57:40.031 --> 00:57:40.864
<v Speaker 2>well I'm not going to get anywhere from </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody else that already has a </v>

1339
00:57:43.631 --> 00:57:46.270
<v Speaker 2>channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just started being more of who I am</v>

1340
00:57:46.271 --> 00:57:48.570
<v Speaker 2>and talking honestly and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1341
00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:49.930
<v Speaker 2>that sounds really healthy dude.</v>

1342
00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:51.413
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess being yourself not to take away </v>

1343
00:57:55.571 --> 00:57:56.404
<v Speaker 2>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hugely grateful for the shoutout </v>

1344
00:57:57.610 --> 00:57:58.443
<v Speaker 2>Felix stage and I'm really glad that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened and I would never take that </v>

1345
00:58:02.171 --> 00:58:03.004
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think that there's some </v>

1346
00:58:03.911 --> 00:58:07.210
<v Speaker 2>misconceptions on the line of what that </v>
<v Speaker 2>did and that's why everyone's like,</v>

1347
00:58:07.211 --> 00:58:09.250
<v Speaker 2>you need to do a shout out competition </v>
<v Speaker 2>now because Felix did one,</v>

1348
00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:14.260
<v Speaker 2>I can see it being a little frustrating </v>
<v Speaker 2>of being like you owe everything to this</v>

1349
00:58:14.261 --> 00:58:15.130
<v Speaker 2>one shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1350
00:58:15.131 --> 00:58:17.060
<v Speaker 2>well that's really not what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1351
00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:19.100
<v Speaker 2>And even Felix for like recently came to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

1352
00:58:19.101 --> 00:58:19.934
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to like delete those videos </v>

1353
00:58:20.861 --> 00:58:25.861
<v Speaker 2>off our channels anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause like it's like still a whole thing</v>

1354
00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:27.083
<v Speaker 2>cause he knew that people were like </v>
<v Speaker 2>shitting on me for that and say like </v>

1355
00:58:30.071 --> 00:58:31.180
<v Speaker 2>you're only popular because of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1356
00:58:31.181 --> 00:58:32.650
<v Speaker 2>So that's so insane.</v>

1357
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:34.840
<v Speaker 2>That's so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep it there.</v>

1358
00:58:34.841 --> 00:58:36.280
<v Speaker 2>It's a piece of history that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

1359
00:58:36.281 --> 00:58:37.810
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1360
00:58:38.130 --> 00:58:39.250
<v Speaker 2>Live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd go and watch it.</v>

1361
00:58:39.251 --> 00:58:44.110
<v Speaker 2>You can see it's like he's not like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to go subscribe right now.</v>

1362
00:58:44.610 --> 00:58:47.640
<v Speaker 2>Play your video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like check the guy out and he,</v>

1363
00:58:47.641 --> 00:58:50.000
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was supposed to do the shadow</v>

1364
00:58:50.001 --> 00:58:50.834
<v Speaker 2>of competition and then he kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>forgot about it and then he did it </v>

1365
00:58:52.991 --> 00:58:56.600
<v Speaker 2>really quick cause he came back from </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere and then that's why he's face,</v>

1366
00:58:56.601 --> 00:58:58.990
<v Speaker 2>this isn't even on it cause he just </v>
<v Speaker 2>recorded the thing with his microphone.</v>

1367
00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.630
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievable man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cutie Pie.</v>

1368
00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:05.830
<v Speaker 2>You want a guy has on another level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1369
00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:07.053
<v Speaker 2>And he's still five now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way we talk about like burnout and </v>

1370
00:59:09.281 --> 00:59:12.050
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he still posting every fucking okay.</v>

1371
00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:15.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how he does it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He must be deeply,</v>

1372
00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:17.800
<v Speaker 2>deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply damaged and miserable,</v>

1373
00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:20.960
<v Speaker 2>but he seems really well adjusted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what is the optimum?</v>

1374
00:59:21.450 --> 00:59:22.283
<v Speaker 2>We're all damaged man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he changes up as content enough </v>

1375
00:59:24.711 --> 00:59:26.750
<v Speaker 2>to keep it fresh for himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Where'd that come from?</v>

1382
00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:46.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if you go back and watch an earlier</v>

1383
00:59:46.161 --> 00:59:46.994
<v Speaker 2>video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my intro used to be hello all you </v>

1384
00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:52.250
<v Speaker 2>beautiful people out there helping them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1385
00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:53.273
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1386
00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:54.890
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to have like somebody else's </v>
<v Speaker 2>voice.</v>

1387
00:59:55.410 --> 00:59:56.990
<v Speaker 2>Mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hated my accident.</v>

1388
00:59:56.991 --> 00:59:59.300
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sell for anything.</v>

1389
00:59:59.590 --> 01:00:01.070
<v Speaker 2>So my earlier videos have a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>intro,</v>

1390
01:00:01.071 --> 01:00:02.630
<v Speaker 2>different voice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no face cam.</v>

1391
01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.350
<v Speaker 2>And then later on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like during that time I was like,</v>

1392
01:00:06.351 --> 01:00:07.184
<v Speaker 2>well I don't really like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they started showing my face and </v>

1393
01:00:09.561 --> 01:00:10.394
<v Speaker 2>then everyone thought I was American </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretending to be Irish because me doing </v>

1394
01:00:14.031 --> 01:00:16.160
<v Speaker 2>that for probably sounded kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americanized.</v>

1395
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:19.850
<v Speaker 2>And then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I want to show people I'm Irish.</v>

1396
01:00:19.851 --> 01:00:21.110
<v Speaker 2>What's the most Irish thing you can say?</v>

1397
01:00:21.110 --> 01:00:21.943
<v Speaker 2>And then an episode of friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Monica Says Tapa Dot Martin and tea </v>

1398
01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:29.150
<v Speaker 2>that's very Irish that it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1399
01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.850
<v Speaker 2>I'll be as Irish as I can be in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first five seconds of my video,</v>

1400
01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:34.460
<v Speaker 2>just as a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking,</v>

1401
01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.130
<v Speaker 2>and then people resonated with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1402
01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:37.790
<v Speaker 2>if you don't make the first five seconds</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the video,</v>

1403
01:00:37.791 --> 01:00:39.140
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to like the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck off.</v>

1404
01:00:39.141 --> 01:00:42.710
<v Speaker 2>So the great firewall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

1405
01:00:42.711 --> 01:00:43.544
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I can't really take credit for </v>

1406
01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:48.080
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots of generations of Irish people came</v>

1407
01:00:48.081 --> 01:00:51.530
<v Speaker 2>up with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do are you famous in Ireland?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Why do you say it like that?</v>

1412
01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:02.923
<v Speaker 2>Cause when I was living in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was living in a small town that had </v>

1413
01:01:04.851 --> 01:01:06.110
<v Speaker 2>like 15,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in it.</v>

1414
01:01:06.210 --> 01:01:07.043
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like every time I went outside it was </v>

1415

<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1417
01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.153

<v Speaker 2>people know what you live there and </v>

1418
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:17.570
<v Speaker 2>people are just out and about anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on at the time of day,</v>

1419
01:01:17.571 --> 01:01:18.404
<v Speaker 2>obviously I want to have green hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just a lot more you bond over </v>

1420

1423
01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.273
<v Speaker 2>it's funny cause a thing that happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>awhile ago was they did a list of the </v>

<v Speaker 2>like a tabloid paper.</v>

1425
01:01:41.061 --> 01:01:41.894
<v Speaker 2>It meant nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at number 10 was the president and </v>

1426

1438
01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:11.150
<v Speaker 2>Religious people can be the most passive</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressive people you'll ever meet.</v>

1439
01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:12.530
<v Speaker 2>They're super friendly and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>

1440
01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:13.933
<v Speaker 2>but they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anytime somebody would see like the </v>

1441
01:02:17.211 --> 01:02:19.860

<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm going to work towards.</v>

1444
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:25.740
<v Speaker 2>We're an Irish person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be like,</v>

1450
01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:40.470
<v Speaker 2>I hate that he represents our country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So I left that and then it became very </v>

1489
01:04:36.811 --> 01:04:37.644
<v Speaker 2>depressed and miserable at home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when I started youtube and then </v>

1490
01:04:40.650 --> 01:04:41.483
<v Speaker 2>went back to college for Hotel </v>
<v Speaker 2>Management and graduated from Hotel </v>

1491
01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:46.410
<v Speaker 2>College.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You did?</v>

1492
01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:49.320
<v Speaker 2>How many years is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who it tell the call it three years.</v>

1493
01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:50.880
<v Speaker 2>You're a fucking hotel manager,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

1494
01:04:51.070 --> 01:04:53.760
<v Speaker 2>Tray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you learn that in?</v>

1495
01:04:53.770 --> 01:04:55.950
<v Speaker 2>Hotel management?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck all.</v>

1496
01:04:56.970 --> 01:04:57.803
<v Speaker 2>You learn how horrible hotels are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole time we were there they were </v>

1497
01:05:00.241 --> 01:05:01.590
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hotels are overworked,</v>

1498
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:03.630
<v Speaker 2>underpaid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>understaffed,</v>

1499
01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:05.700
<v Speaker 2>and they're all losing money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we were like,</v>

1500
01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:06.780
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get my gym.</v>

1501
01:05:06.781 --> 01:05:11.781
<v Speaker 2>Good effect that so weirdly specific and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then now you can learn that.</v>

1502
01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:15.540
<v Speaker 2>So in in college when I was doing like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the final semester,</v>

1503
01:05:15.541 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 2>that's when that moment happened and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

1504
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:19.263
<v Speaker 3>I left college wants before I should </v>
<v Speaker 3>finish this one out and get a degree of </v>

1505
01:05:22.181 --> 01:05:23.014
<v Speaker 3>some sort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if youtube is going and </v>

1506
01:05:24.761 --> 01:05:27.100
<v Speaker 3>that thankfully it took off cause I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't to work in a book in a hotel.</v>

1507
01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:29.730
<v Speaker 3>And you were living with your parents?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>youtube pursue?</v>

1509
01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:36.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean my parents have always kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>been supportive almost to a fault.</v>

1510
01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:37.710
<v Speaker 3>They're one of the good ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1512
01:05:40.391 --> 01:05:41.224
<v Speaker 3>much credit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was just the case of like </v>

1513
01:05:42.671 --> 01:05:43.504
<v Speaker 3>whatever I was into they would just let </v>
<v Speaker 3>me do and if I was passionate about it </v>

1514
01:05:46.091 --> 01:05:46.924

<v Speaker 3>though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause I think you only tried like to </v>

1689
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:09.143

01:14:25.411 --> 01:14:26.720
<v Speaker 3>that's what's ridiculous about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1717
01:14:26.721 --> 01:14:28.780
<v Speaker 3>It's because we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't really get much.</v>

1718
01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:30.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1719
01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:34.210
<v Speaker 3>No college and health care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a whole rabbit hole.</v>

1720
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:35.223
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because my editor is from Sweden and </v>

1721
01:14:36.341 --> 01:14:38.340
<v Speaker 3>everything over there is free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like free healthcare,</v>

1722
01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:40.720
<v Speaker 3>free education,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get paid to go to college.</v>

1723
01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:42.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't get all these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other than that,</v>

1724
01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:44.110
<v Speaker 3>it's like a conservative talking point </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

1725
01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:47.740
<v Speaker 3>Is there like a socialism never works </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>

1726
01:14:47.741 --> 01:14:51.700
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scandinavia is like a utopia.</v>

1727
01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:55.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean it works out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The social,</v>

1728
01:14:55.630 --> 01:14:58.510
<v Speaker 3>the social programs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a shit hole country.</v>

1729
01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:01.110
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently no far.</v>

1730
01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:02.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1731
01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:05.170
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1732
01:15:05.630 --> 01:15:10.630
<v Speaker 3>rmn well you probably don't want to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>into politics political they made,</v>

1733
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.823
<v Speaker 3>cause I'm not thinking about politics </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm just a person experiencing like </v>

1734
01:15:20.410 --> 01:15:22.690
<v Speaker 3>paying so much taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't get anything.</v>

1735
01:15:22.691 --> 01:15:25.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't know even why it's gotta be so </v>
<v Speaker 3>political.</v>

1736
01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:26.021
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1737
01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:26.854
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's something that I've been </v>

1738
01:15:27.611 --> 01:15:28.444
<v Speaker 3>thinking like trump wanted to have $100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>million military parade in DC and </v>

1739
01:15:34.001 --> 01:15:38.110
<v Speaker 3>meanwhile actual veterans aren't getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthcare.</v>

1740
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:39.783
<v Speaker 3>It's like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile it's like you always get this </v>

1741
01:15:41.711 --> 01:15:44.980
<v Speaker 3>talking point of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are you going to pay for it?</v>

1742
01:15:45.010 --> 01:15:45.843
<v Speaker 3>You say you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very liberal talking point that </v>

1743
01:15:47.861 --> 01:15:48.830
<v Speaker 3>you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1744
01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:52.510
<v Speaker 3>healthcare and college tuition free to </v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever wants it.</v>

1745
01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:54.610
<v Speaker 3>And they always say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are you going to pay for it?</v>

1746
01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:55.841
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro,</v>

1747
01:15:55.841 --> 01:15:56.674
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are you going to pay for your $100 </v>

1748
01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:02.800
<v Speaker 3>million military prey space force?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

1749
01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:03.783
<v Speaker 3>Let it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>speak your truth.</v>

1751
01:16:05.890 --> 01:16:07.600
<v Speaker 3>How are you going to pay for anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>spilled?</v>

1752
01:16:07.601 --> 01:16:09.040
<v Speaker 3>I political worry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're in debt.</v>

1753
01:16:09.041 --> 01:16:10.320
<v Speaker 3>Trillions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you what?</v>

1754
01:16:10.330 --> 01:16:11.163
<v Speaker 3>Who's paying for that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how I could figure it out </v>

1755
01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:16.530
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They figured.</v>

1756
01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:18.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the truth of the matter is that when you</v>

1757
01:16:18.371 --> 01:16:21.310
<v Speaker 3>have social healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually cheaper than what the fuck</v>

01:16:21.311 --> 01:16:22.630
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where have we have now?</v>

1759
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:24.610
<v Speaker 3>Because like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well anyway,</v>

1760
01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:27.550
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna have to drop a soundboard </v>
<v Speaker 3>on now to break that 10.</v>

1761

<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

1762

<v Speaker 2>are so enthused about this game that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

1794
01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:54.590
<v Speaker 2>you wanted to tattoo it?</v>

<v Speaker 2>What is it again to people like me with </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know bloodborne.</v>

1796
01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:00.300
<v Speaker 2>Dan's a big fan of it apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1797
01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:01.433
<v Speaker 2>so what I've always kind of been from </v>
<v Speaker 2>software and the people who make it and </v>

1798
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:05.690
<v Speaker 2>I love dark souls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love dark souls.</v>

1799
01:18:05.691 --> 01:18:07.580
<v Speaker 2>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three demon's souls and this,</v>

1800
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:11.660
<v Speaker 2>and then I always wanted to get a tattoo</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway and it was in my head was like,</v>

1801
01:18:11.661 --> 01:18:13.130
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck am I going to get?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

1802
01:18:13.131 --> 01:18:16.100

<v Speaker 2>And then this,</v>

1803
01:18:16.101 --> 01:18:16.934
<v Speaker 2>this I decided to get because you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need to know a bloodborne is </v>

1804
01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:22.850
<v Speaker 2>to know what this is and I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just a cool design anyway.</v>

1805
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:24.103
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I want to make the leap and get </v>

1806
01:18:25.011 --> 01:18:25.844
<v Speaker 2>something and then it's like my second </v>
<v Speaker 2>favorite game of all time and then it's </v>

<v Speaker 3>It's healthy or unhealthy.</v>

1945
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:43.810
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>woefully unhealthy.</v>

1946
01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:47.740
<v Speaker 3>I'd say full of salt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's so good that it's worth it.</v>

1947
01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:49.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put It on a,</v>

1948
01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:50.880
<v Speaker 3>it's like a four Irish and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think of a better,</v>

1949
01:24:50.910 --> 01:24:53.770
<v Speaker 3>like more enticing name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was called black pudding.</v>

1950
01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:55.090
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not blood pudding.</v>

1951
01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:56.360
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1952
01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:58.990
<v Speaker 3>that is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we don't call it though cause no one</v>

1953
01:24:58.991 --> 01:24:59.710
<v Speaker 3>would eat that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1954
01:24:59.710 --> 01:25:01.240
<v Speaker 3>that sounds so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1955
01:25:01.241 --> 01:25:03.640
<v Speaker 3>you eat sausages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is lined with like,</v>

1956
01:25:04.810 --> 01:25:05.643
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm done.</v>

1957
01:25:06.030 --> 01:25:07.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked it.</v>

1958
01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:10.210
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you have?</v>

1959
01:25:10.211 --> 01:25:12.220
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got pretty much everything sorted.</v>

1960
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:13.430
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got through the,</v>

1961
01:25:13.431 --> 01:25:15.430
<v Speaker 3>the sodomy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the firies,</v>

1962
01:25:15.431 --> 01:25:18.490
<v Speaker 3>the politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He dropped a fortnight in there,</v>

1963
01:25:18.890 --> 01:25:19.451
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1964
01:25:19.451 --> 01:25:20.170
<v Speaker 3>I'll put four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine.</v>

1965
01:25:20.170 --> 01:25:23.980
<v Speaker 3>The thumbnail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We talked about Logan,</v>

1966
01:25:23.981 --> 01:25:26.290
<v Speaker 3>Paul and therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Logan.</v>

1967
01:25:26.291 --> 01:25:28.540
<v Speaker 3>Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We talked about the suicide forest.</v>

1968
01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:31.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's going to win that fight?</v>

1969
01:25:32.170 --> 01:25:33.003
<v Speaker 3>Drop that in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>August 25th we didn't talk about that </v>

1970
01:25:35.261 --> 01:25:37.360
<v Speaker 3>now and then I'll click bait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have talked about,</v>

1971
01:25:37.390 --> 01:25:40.270
<v Speaker 3>oh we did this podcast today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Today.</v>

1972
01:25:41.530 --> 01:25:44.290
<v Speaker 3>Who Do you think's going to win?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Logan's going.</v>

1973
01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:47.950
<v Speaker 3>When is he taller?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does they have a longer reach?</v>

1974
01:25:47.951 --> 01:25:48.840
<v Speaker 3>What makes you think that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1975
01:25:48.890 --> 01:25:49.661
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's taller.</v>

1976
01:25:49.661 --> 01:25:51.850
<v Speaker 3>He just seems like he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's bigger.</v>

1977
01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:56.010
<v Speaker 3>He's probably way more ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more like no case.</v>

1978
01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:58.480
<v Speaker 3>He's like stacked and everything and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd got into great shape.</v>

1979
01:25:58.481 --> 01:26:00.190
<v Speaker 3>But watching him fight Joe Waller who </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

1980
01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:03.160
<v Speaker 3>well you only one cause joe didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>really fight.</v>

1981
01:26:03.610 --> 01:26:04.190
<v Speaker 3>I haven't,</v>

1982
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:05.023
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen that actual flight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that would be good to inform my </v>

1983
01:26:07.341 --> 01:26:08.174
<v Speaker 2>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of times in boxing and </v>

1984
01:26:09.561 --> 01:26:13.970
<v Speaker 2>fighting in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bigger guy generally wins.</v>

1985
01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:15.133
<v Speaker 2>That's why you have weight classes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these guys are probably not in the </v>

1986
01:26:16.641 --> 01:26:19.550
<v Speaker 2>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to Tyson Tyson,</v>

1987
01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:21.440
<v Speaker 2>but they were in the same way class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was heavy.</v>

1988
01:26:21.441 --> 01:26:22.460
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1989
01:26:22.461 --> 01:26:23.390
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1990
01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:24.353
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Tyson was also like a fucking </v>

1991
01:26:25.281 --> 01:26:26.114
<v Speaker 2>monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think just physicality will win </v>

1992
01:26:28.101 --> 01:26:28.934
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Logan used to do like wrestling in </v>

1993
01:26:30.621 --> 01:26:31.454
<v Speaker 2>college and high school and stuff and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always leaning towards case I </v>

1994
01:26:34.651 --> 01:26:35.484
<v Speaker 2>simply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he had already had a fight </v>

1995
01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:38.593
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But from what it sounds like not that </v>

1996
01:26:41.511 --> 01:26:42.344
<v Speaker 2>valuable of experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I do think is that it's going </v>

1997
01:26:44.741 --> 01:26:48.140
<v Speaker 2>to be fairly boring cause they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional fighters is going to go the</v>

1998
01:26:48.141 --> 01:26:48.974
<v Speaker 2>whole length.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's going to get knocked out and </v>

1999
01:26:50.061 --> 01:26:52.010
<v Speaker 2>somebody's going to win on on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>technical one.</v>

2000
01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be,</v>

2001
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:56.600
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh we were wrong.</v>

2002
01:26:56.630 --> 01:26:59.210
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully someone gets like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mommy and I'll wash the,</v>

2003
01:26:59.211 --> 01:27:00.044
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna Watch the highlights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm washed the fuck out of the </v>

2004
01:27:01.221 --> 01:27:02.054
<v Speaker 2>highlight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you're not going to get to $10 pay </v>

2005
01:27:02.661 --> 01:27:04.370
<v Speaker 2>per view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it only 10 bucks?</v>

2006
01:27:04.490 --> 01:27:07.120
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was like 11 days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$10 paper.</v>

2007
01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:09.800
<v Speaker 2>Paper view doesn't pay the bills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

2008
01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:11.900
<v Speaker 2>Why is that so a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>100,000</v>

2009
01:27:11.901 --> 01:27:13.080
<v Speaker 2>people watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2010
01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:17.990
<v Speaker 2>They're going to charge more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I honestly have no idea.</v>

2011
01:27:18.050 --> 01:27:19.680
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what's going on with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2012
01:27:19.850 --> 01:27:21.200
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well fuck that.</v>

2013
01:27:21.250 --> 01:27:22.083
<v Speaker 2>We should just put money into a pot and </v>
<v Speaker 2>see who wins that pays the bills if </v>

2014
01:27:25.851 --> 01:27:27.000
<v Speaker 2>you're good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

01:27:28.821 --> 01:27:31.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've really covered every single thing.</v>

2017
01:27:31.230 --> 01:27:33.710
<v Speaker 2>I was wondering that people are very </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious in Ireland,</v>

2018
01:27:33.711 --> 01:27:34.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2020
01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:37.453
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been religious since I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like 12 I used to be an altar boy </v>

2021
01:27:40.281 --> 01:27:41.300
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Did you just like,</v>

2023
01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:45.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was there something or you're just like,</v>

2024

2025
01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:48.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God got,</v>

2026
01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:51.050
<v Speaker 2>it was so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was such a fucking woke 12 year old.</v>

2027
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:52.970
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like running down the field,</v>

2028
01:27:52.971 --> 01:27:54.760
<v Speaker 2>playing around and then I just thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>to myself,</v>

2029
01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:58.130
<v Speaker 2>I cut very existential was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if it's not real?</v>

2030
01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:01.460
<v Speaker 2>What if God is not up there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if God is not one of us.</v>

2031
01:28:01.790 --> 01:28:04.370
<v Speaker 2>And then I like went down this rabbit </v>
<v Speaker 2>hole and I was like,</v>

2032
01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:08.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I believe in God anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On by on your own,</v>

2033
01:28:08.331 --> 01:28:10.420
<v Speaker 2>kind of do your own thing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>is your family religious?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2035
01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:14.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I gonna do they think about your,</v>

2036
01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:15.013
<v Speaker 2>are you an atheist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you consider yourself an atheist </v>

2037
01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:20.470
<v Speaker 2>or an agnostic or you just not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2038
01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:23.240
<v Speaker 2>What would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say more agnostic.</v>

2039
01:28:23.241 --> 01:28:25.070
<v Speaker 2>More for the optimism of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2040
01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:26.090
<v Speaker 2>We're atheism is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2041
01:28:26.091 --> 01:28:27.240
<v Speaker 2>nothing exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2042
01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:29.930
<v Speaker 2>Like gnostic is like something might </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist.</v>

2043
01:28:29.931 --> 01:28:31.460
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Opened up my eyes to it.</v>

2044
01:28:31.570 --> 01:28:33.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God isn't real.</v>

2045
01:28:33.741 --> 01:28:34.730
<v Speaker 2>Changed my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2046
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:36.450
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2047
01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:41.500
<v Speaker 2>how does your family feel about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your godlessness put my hedonism.</v>

2048
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:45.560
<v Speaker 2>My parents never really cared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't mind.</v>

2049
01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:49.400
<v Speaker 2>They went to church and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I never told my grandmother that.</v>

2050
01:28:49.401 --> 01:28:51.320
<v Speaker 2>I didn't believe in God because she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

2051
01:28:51.321 --> 01:28:52.154
<v Speaker 2>very religious and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'd never knock on anybody who is </v>

2052
01:28:54.381 --> 01:28:55.610
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to do many of their,</v>

2053
01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:56.473
<v Speaker 2>it gave her like great peace of mind and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she felt a lot closer to things in her </v>

2054
01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:02.220
<v Speaker 2>later years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything so fantastic.</v>

2055
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:04.910
<v Speaker 3>But for me it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't really make sense in my head.</v>

2056
01:29:04.911 --> 01:29:05.744
<v Speaker 3>Just say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

2057
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.610
<v Speaker 3>Is there a growing like a among younger </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

2058
01:29:08.611 --> 01:29:10.700
<v Speaker 3>that's probably a growing attitude </v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

2059
01:29:10.701 --> 01:29:11.640
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>100%.</v>

2060
01:29:11.641 --> 01:29:12.474
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're just legalized abortion </v>

2061
01:29:13.351 --> 01:29:14.750
<v Speaker 3>there at a couple of months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2062
01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:17.160
<v Speaker 3>And that's cracked just a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>months ago.</v>

2063
01:29:17.970 --> 01:29:19.140
<v Speaker 3>Ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>America is going to,</v>

2064
01:29:19.170 --> 01:29:20.003
<v Speaker 3>going back to making it illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's huge for Ireland and like </v>

2065
01:29:23.941 --> 01:29:27.150
<v Speaker 3>same sex marriage is allowed there now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was a recent development too,</v>

2066
01:29:27.151 --> 01:29:28.140
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

2067
01:29:28.141 --> 01:29:28.974
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was what that was within the time </v>

2068
01:29:30.451 --> 01:29:31.600
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember that.</v>

2069
01:29:32.170 --> 01:29:33.600
<v Speaker 3>Maybe like two years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2071
01:29:35.011 --> 01:29:38.910
<v Speaker 3>The moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole world is so weird thing that,</v>

2072
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:40.101

2073
01:29:40.101 --> 01:29:41.760
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just interesting.</v>

2074
01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:43.360
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe fanfic.</v>

2107
01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:26.220
<v Speaker 3>It's an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I write one for you.</v>

2108
01:31:26.970 --> 01:31:28.140
<v Speaker 3>That'd be sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about me?</v>

2109
01:31:28.141 --> 01:31:30.510
<v Speaker 3>But I'll just in general I'd write one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually I did it.</v>

2110
01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:31.373
<v Speaker 3>I forgot I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I noticed you sit in a video that 2017 </v>

2111
01:31:35.521 --> 01:31:38.360
<v Speaker 3>was the worst of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That really stuck out to me.</v>

2112
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:39.223
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

2113
01:31:40.110 --> 01:31:41.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you want to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2114
01:31:41.401 --> 01:31:46.350
<v Speaker 3>but I was really curious like what was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on in 2017 there's a lot of stuff,</v>

2115
01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:49.710
<v Speaker 3>a lot of like youtube stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything and trying to figure out what</v>

2116
01:31:49.711 --> 01:31:50.544
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that thing of like climbing the </v>

2117
01:31:52.081 --> 01:31:54.990
<v Speaker 3>hail and then getting there and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what else can I do it now?</v>

2118
01:31:55.230 --> 01:31:56.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm feeling very aimless.</v>

2119
01:31:56.521 --> 01:32:00.090
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like stuff with in my life that had</v>

2120
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:03.010
<v Speaker 2>changed very drastically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of friendships,</v>

2121
01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:06.760
<v Speaker 2>a lot of stuff like that that had just </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten very weird.</v>

2122
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.850
<v Speaker 2>And then by the end of the year I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just felt so drained and exhausted and</v>

2123
01:32:09.851 --> 01:32:10.684
<v Speaker 2>miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really know what was going on </v>

2124
01:32:11.861 --> 01:32:14.050
<v Speaker 2>and that's why the whole like pma things</v>
<v Speaker 2>started cause I,</v>

2125
01:32:14.590 --> 01:32:15.423
<v Speaker 2>I was going into this year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like I'm going to make it </v>

2126
01:32:16.391 --> 01:32:17.224
<v Speaker 2>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to change my mentality and </v>

2127
01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:22.300
<v Speaker 2>just work towards a better me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what does PNA mean?</v>

2128
01:32:22.630 --> 01:32:25.180
<v Speaker 2>Positive mental attitude and what does </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2129
01:32:25.930 --> 01:32:26.763
<v Speaker 2>it's just something that kind of gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>thrown around to be like keep it </v>

2130
01:32:29.261 --> 01:32:30.094
<v Speaker 2>positive mental attitude and to me it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was something that I could just keep </v>

2131
01:32:32.051 --> 01:32:34.330
<v Speaker 2>saying to like remind myself to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>happier.</v>

2132
01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:36.240
<v Speaker 2>Like a mantra of something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not to,</v>

2133
01:32:36.290 --> 01:32:37.123
<v Speaker 2>not to dwell on the bullshit that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening that really meant nothing in </v>

2134
01:32:39.221 --> 01:32:40.180
<v Speaker 2>the grand scheme of things.</v>

2135
01:32:40.450 --> 01:32:42.500
<v Speaker 2>And then because I kept saying a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch,</v>

2136
01:32:42.850 --> 01:32:43.683
<v Speaker 2>my audience obviously picked up on it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it's become like a whole like </v>

2137
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:48.850
<v Speaker 2>movement on my channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2138
01:32:48.851 --> 01:32:49.750
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can not,</v>

2139
01:32:49.751 --> 01:32:51.260
<v Speaker 2>we can wear it around with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

2140
01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:52.870
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel that you were,</v>

2141
01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:54.033
<v Speaker 2>you were able to willfully change your </v>
<v Speaker 2>attitude by just consciously forcing </v>

2142
01:33:01.121 --> 01:33:04.870
<v Speaker 2>herself to be more positive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not exactly cause I don't,</v>

2143
01:33:04.871 --> 01:33:07.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's healthy to just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was the whole point of it.</v>

2144
01:33:07.361 --> 01:33:08.530
<v Speaker 2>I was worried that people would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2145
01:33:08.531 --> 01:33:09.364
<v Speaker 2>just go out there and be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're happy then nothing gets you </v>

2146
01:33:11.291 --> 01:33:12.700
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what bullshit.</v>

2147
01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:14.433
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that it's more complex than</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about like it's going to sound so </v>

2148
01:33:18.071 --> 01:33:18.904
<v Speaker 2>hokey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about like trying your best to get </v>

2149
01:33:20.651 --> 01:33:23.980
<v Speaker 2>to a positive mudding in the work to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the hole.</v>

2150
01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:26.890
<v Speaker 2>So for me it was a lot of like starting </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go to therapy,</v>

2151
01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:27.813
<v Speaker 2>like reflecting on things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easing up on my work life and just </v>

2152
01:33:30.971 --> 01:33:31.804
<v Speaker 2>having a better balance with my mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>health and coming to terms because for </v>

2153
01:33:35.621 --> 01:33:38.470
<v Speaker 2>the longest time I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone sees me as the positive person,</v>

2154
01:33:38.471 --> 01:33:39.304
<v Speaker 2>but if I show any sign of like I'm sad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I was worried I was letting people </v>

2155
01:33:42.401 --> 01:33:45.130
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that creates anxiety and things</v>

2156
01:33:45.131 --> 01:33:45.881
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

2157
01:33:45.881 --> 01:33:46.960
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to be open,</v>

2158
01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:48.093
<v Speaker 2>honest cause I'm going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta be a burden to be like that </v>

2159
01:33:51.791 --> 01:33:53.050
<v Speaker 2>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy,</v>

2160
01:33:53.051 --> 01:33:54.760
<v Speaker 2>energetic guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2161
01:33:55.090 --> 01:33:56.770
<v Speaker 2>And then especially when you have people</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming to you and be like,</v>

2162
01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:57.873
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like no drama on you and you're </v>

2163
01:33:58.721 --> 01:33:59.554
<v Speaker 2>so happy all the time and people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>nice things to say about you all the </v>

2164
01:34:01.391 --> 01:34:01.840
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2165
01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:03.880
<v Speaker 2>And that's just way too much pressure </v>
<v Speaker 2>for any person.</v>

2166
01:34:04.630 --> 01:34:07.690
<v Speaker 2>And it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm don't feel like I'm not that all the</v>

2167
01:34:07.691 --> 01:34:09.310
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's perfect.</v>

2168
01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:10.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2169
01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:11.673
<v Speaker 2>so then just don't try to re reconfigure</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brain again as you get to a better </v>

2170
01:34:17.021 --> 01:34:17.854
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because it was a lot of stuff that </v>

2171
01:34:19.091 --> 01:34:20.410
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that meant nothing.</v>

2172
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:23.470
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot of very tiny things to kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of build up that mean nothing.</v>

2173
01:34:23.471 --> 01:34:25.480
<v Speaker 2>And then you get miserable about them </v>
<v Speaker 2>for no reason.</v>

2174
01:34:26.230 --> 01:34:27.063
<v Speaker 2>And then because I have so many people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that come to me talking about their </v>

2175
01:34:28.691 --> 01:34:31.750
<v Speaker 2>mental health all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I figured that let's do something better</v>

2176
01:34:31.751 --> 01:34:32.740
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we start doing,</v>

2177
01:34:32.741 --> 01:34:33.574
<v Speaker 2>the monthly charity streams and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like the Hashtag for it every </v>

2178
01:34:36.131 --> 01:34:40.270
<v Speaker 2>time and try and turn it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn some turn things into a positive.</v>

2179
01:34:40.271 --> 01:34:42.640
<v Speaker 2>I think trying to work to a better life.</v>

2180
01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:45.010
<v Speaker 2>God bless you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I not,</v>

2181
01:34:45.090 --> 01:34:49.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm an energy to be miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sadly.</v>

2182
01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:51.160
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the same head space.</v>

2183
01:34:51.161 --> 01:34:52.480
<v Speaker 2>You are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really liked what you said.</v>

2184
01:34:52.481 --> 01:34:54.250
<v Speaker 2>It's not about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2185
01:34:54.910 --> 01:34:56.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2186
01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:57.313
<v Speaker 2>it's about you have to make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to like make the changes that </v>

2187
01:35:01.431 --> 01:35:02.264
<v Speaker 2>you know you need to make to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of youtubers suffer with </v>

2188
01:35:05.721 --> 01:35:06.554
<v Speaker 2>that because they have everything they </v>
<v Speaker 2>need technically or everything they've </v>

2189
01:35:09.831 --> 01:35:10.611
<v Speaker 2>always wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They haven't,</v>

2190
01:35:10.611 --> 01:35:11.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like why?</v>

2191
01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:14.570
<v Speaker 2>It's like I have no reason and worst of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

2192
01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:19.920
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the fans are people watch or </v>
<v Speaker 2>like very judgmental about like what the</v>

2193
01:35:21.201 --> 01:35:24.770
<v Speaker 2>fuck that you have to complain about and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing when your,</v>

2194
01:35:24.771 --> 01:35:25.604
<v Speaker 2>when your finances are taken care of and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're your own boss and you're doing a </v>

2195
01:35:28.041 --> 01:35:31.340
<v Speaker 2>job you love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that's left is emotional issues.</v>

2196
01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:32.653
<v Speaker 2>All the things that you have left to </v>
<v Speaker 2>worry about or stuff that's all in here </v>

2197
01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:38.210
<v Speaker 2>and your brain has a lot of shit to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is not useful at all.</v>

2198
01:35:38.650 --> 01:35:41.570
<v Speaker 2>And on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of people have an opinion about</v>

2199
01:35:41.571 --> 01:35:42.404
<v Speaker 2>you that you've never met and you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be their advocate for their mental </v>

2200
01:35:45.201 --> 01:35:47.100
<v Speaker 2>health a lot of the time as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And keeping,</v>

2201
01:35:47.110 --> 01:35:47.943
<v Speaker 2>making sure they are entertained and </v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping a check on them and making sure </v>

2202
01:35:50.511 --> 01:35:54.050
<v Speaker 2>people are okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why like after awhile it gets</v>

2203
01:35:54.051 --> 01:35:55.010
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

2204
01:35:55.011 --> 01:35:56.720
<v Speaker 2>it's nobody can go out there and just be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2205
01:35:56.780 --> 01:35:57.613
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be happy today because </v>

2206
01:35:59.180 --> 01:36:01.070
<v Speaker 2>you're a fucking psychopath if you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2207
01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:02.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2208
01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:04.430
<v Speaker 2>but as long as you're trying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you have a shit day,</v>

2209
01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:06.110
<v Speaker 2>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sit in Shit Day,</v>

2210
01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:06.953
<v Speaker 2>allow yourself to feel shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get it out of your system and move onto </v>

2211
01:36:09.170 --> 01:36:10.003
<v Speaker 2>the next day.</v>

2212
01:36:10.130 --> 01:36:13.860
<v Speaker 2>If that shit keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a shit month,</v>

2213
01:36:13.861 --> 01:36:15.140
<v Speaker 2>a shit year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep going.</v>

2214
01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:19.820
<v Speaker 2>Eventually that day will arrive where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're happier and it all like,</v>

2215
01:36:19.850 --> 01:36:20.683
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone always says that people get </v>

2216
01:36:21.231 --> 01:36:23.660
<v Speaker 2>bullied in high school and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>grow up and it's like,</v>

2217
01:36:23.661 --> 01:36:24.860
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that really meant nothing.</v>

2218
01:36:24.861 --> 01:36:25.694
<v Speaker 2>Did it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2219
01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:26.823
<v Speaker 2>It leave some scars if it's bad enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then at the end of the day it's </v>

2220
01:36:28.611 --> 01:36:28.881
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2221
01:36:28.881 --> 01:36:31.550
<v Speaker 2>you kept going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kept fighting and you're at a better</v>

2222
01:36:31.551 --> 01:36:33.830
<v Speaker 2>place in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God bless.</v>

2223
01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:36.710
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2224
01:36:36.711 --> 01:36:38.000
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been seriously,</v>

2225
01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:38.953
<v Speaker 2>I've been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been legitimately depressed for </v>

2226
01:36:41.151 --> 01:36:44.720
<v Speaker 2>like probably two years and that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>just now I'm starting to like address it</v>

2227
01:36:45.110 --> 01:36:45.943
<v Speaker 2>and that's part of why we're not posting</v>
<v Speaker 2>videos on each three because we were </v>

2228
01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:49.453
<v Speaker 2>just doing too much shit and I was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>working every day and like it was </v>

2229
01:36:53.810 --> 01:36:57.080
<v Speaker 2>getting between me and Isla and you work</v>
<v Speaker 2>from home and hobbies.</v>

2230
01:36:57.080 --> 01:36:57.681
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2231
01:36:57.681 --> 01:36:58.514
<v Speaker 2>Your free time and you're leisurely time</v>
<v Speaker 2>are mixed up cause you were from home </v>

2232
01:37:01.761 --> 01:37:03.140
<v Speaker 2>and it's just so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2233
01:37:03.690 --> 01:37:05.960
<v Speaker 2>You know you can only take it for so </v>
<v Speaker 2>long before you're like,</v>

2234
01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:07.333
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to disappear forever or </v>

2235
01:37:12.201 --> 01:37:14.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to address this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the,</v>

2236
01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:14.893
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtubers is that when you're on that </v>

2237
01:37:16.491 --> 01:37:19.250
<v Speaker 2>treadmill and you're constantly working </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards it,</v>

2238
01:37:19.251 --> 01:37:20.084
<v Speaker 2>you feel like if you fall off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're never gonna be able to get back </v>

2239
01:37:21.261 --> 01:37:22.790
<v Speaker 2>on again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really not true.</v>

2240
01:37:22.850 --> 01:37:23.511
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

2241
01:37:23.511 --> 01:37:25.610
<v Speaker 2>And you can see channels like Shane </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dawson who was,</v>

2242
01:37:25.611 --> 01:37:27.770
<v Speaker 2>had like huge popularity a few years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

2243
01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:30.110
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't disappear or anything,</v>

2244
01:37:30.111 --> 01:37:31.740
<v Speaker 2>but it's definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2245
01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:32.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2246
01:37:32.490 --> 01:37:33.680
<v Speaker 2>It's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

2247
01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:37.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean the biggest he's ever been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same with Philly d he was big,</v>

2248
01:37:37.610 --> 01:37:39.020
<v Speaker 2>went down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was huge again.</v>

2249
01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:42.140
<v Speaker 2>And the one that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well those guys stayed active.</v>

2250
01:37:42.141 --> 01:37:43.640
<v Speaker 2>The one that always blows my mind is </v>
<v Speaker 2>John Tron.</v>

2251
01:37:43.641 --> 01:37:46.430
<v Speaker 2>Like he doesn't even fucking post a </v>
<v Speaker 2>video for a year.</v>

2252
01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:47.893
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he comes back and everybody's still </v>

2253
01:37:49.371 --> 01:37:51.170
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll excited for content.</v>

2254
01:37:51.710 --> 01:37:55.650
<v Speaker 2>So it's very much that that myth has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been busted.</v>

2255
01:37:55.710 --> 01:37:56.543
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why a lot of more youtubers </v>

2256
01:37:57.931 --> 01:38:00.330
<v Speaker 2>are talking about it now cause they feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they can take a break,</v>

2257
01:38:00.350 --> 01:38:04.110
<v Speaker 2>but I also take a break and it is really</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard to get back to it.</v>

2258
01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:05.213
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one thing that like when you're </v>

2259
01:38:06.901 --> 01:38:08.940
<v Speaker 2>in that treadmill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2260
01:38:09.110 --> 01:38:11.580
<v Speaker 2>not to chase when you post a video of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>

2261
01:38:11.581 --> 01:38:14.880
<v Speaker 2>or at least we used to do once a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Kinda like,</v>

2262
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.340
<v Speaker 2>it's just the routine and then once you </v>
<v Speaker 2>break it,</v>

2263
01:38:17.850 --> 01:38:20.990
<v Speaker 2>it's like even harder to get back to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel part,</v>

2264
01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:26.020
<v Speaker 2>the problem for us is that you're always</v>
<v Speaker 2>chasing like a feeling or a time of like</v>

2265
01:38:27.751 --> 01:38:28.620
<v Speaker 2>how it used to be.</v>

2266
01:38:28.650 --> 01:38:32.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of just embracing like,</v>

2267
01:38:32.170 --> 01:38:33.720
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit's different now.</v>

2268
01:38:34.130 --> 01:38:34.963
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't mean that's the same for the </v>

2269
01:38:36.721 --> 01:38:37.554
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The audience are still chasing the old </v>

2270
01:38:38.881 --> 01:38:39.570
<v Speaker 2>use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2271
01:38:39.570 --> 01:38:43.560
<v Speaker 2>And I think they either mature with you </v>
<v Speaker 2>or they leave and shit all over you.</v>

2272
01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:45.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you gotta just,</v>

2273
01:38:46.290 --> 01:38:47.123
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been doing it for how long at </v>

2274
01:38:47.821 --> 01:38:52.821
<v Speaker 2>this point you're not even the salons </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were five years.</v>

2275
01:38:54.450 --> 01:38:55.283
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every person changes like every three </v>

2276
01:38:56.701 --> 01:38:57.600
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

2277
01:38:58.510 --> 01:39:03.060
<v Speaker 2>So I think part of what's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>important for us is just to be like,</v>

2278
01:39:03.090 --> 01:39:06.360
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that air has done like as a new,</v>

2279
01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:08.730
<v Speaker 2>it's a whole new era now because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep,</v>

2280
01:39:08.731 --> 01:39:10.200
<v Speaker 2>we've always been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh man,</v>

2281
01:39:10.201 --> 01:39:13.350
<v Speaker 2>I can't do this anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but okay now I really needed to get back</v>

2282
01:39:13.351 --> 01:39:17.040
<v Speaker 2>into doing that again and then it's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this never ending cycle.</v>

2283
01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:18.413
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about finding balance and </v>

2284
01:39:19.890 --> 01:39:21.930
<v Speaker 2>stuff that makes you happy outside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your channel as well.</v>

2285
01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:23.393
<v Speaker 2>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was like the thing talking to in </v>

2286
01:39:24.691 --> 01:39:27.060
<v Speaker 2>therapy I realized that I don't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything outside of my channel.</v>

2287
01:39:27.570 --> 01:39:29.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't do anything like physical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's,</v>

2288
01:39:29.670 --> 01:39:31.710
<v Speaker 2>everything I do is mental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if I play video games,</v>

2289
01:39:31.711 --> 01:39:32.544
<v Speaker 2>it's still keeping your brain on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need something to let your brain </v>

2290
01:39:34.801 --> 01:39:35.634
<v Speaker 2>shut the fuck up every now and then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something I've been thinking a </v>

2291
01:39:37.021 --> 01:39:38.700
<v Speaker 2>lot to something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a whole,</v>

2292
01:39:38.710 --> 01:39:39.543
<v Speaker 2>you need a wholesome activity to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just distract your sending the fucking </v>

2293
01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:47.370
<v Speaker 2>real world like what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have any hobbies outside of work?</v>

2294
01:39:47.371 --> 01:39:48.870
<v Speaker 2>In Games?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that I've come here,</v>

2295
01:39:48.871 --> 01:39:51.660
<v Speaker 2>I've just been hanging out with people a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot more like living in Brighton.</v>

2296
01:39:51.661 --> 01:39:54.790
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't left my house and like two </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks cause I don't need to write,</v>

2297
01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:55.633
<v Speaker 2>I have to keep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my video is going and then when I came </v>

2298
01:39:57.181 --> 01:39:59.160
<v Speaker 2>here I finally had people to hang out </v>
<v Speaker 2>with day to day.</v>

2299
01:39:59.470 --> 01:40:00.810
<v Speaker 2>They've just been hanging out with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people all the time,</v>

2300
01:40:00.811 --> 01:40:02.430
<v Speaker 2>but it's just cleared my head </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely.</v>

2301
01:40:02.610 --> 01:40:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well not completely,</v>

2302
01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:05.490
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no ever fully clear.</v>

2303
01:40:05.491 --> 01:40:07.290
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compared to what it was,</v>

2304
01:40:07.291 --> 01:40:08.124
<v Speaker 2>I'm so much happier and then it makes it</v>
<v Speaker 2>easier to get back into your videos and </v>

2305
01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:14.040
<v Speaker 2>if you hate doing it the way you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

2306
01:40:14.041 --> 01:40:15.990
<v Speaker 2>then that's a sign that something has to</v>
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>

2307
01:40:16.140 --> 01:40:16.973
<v Speaker 2>Your schedule changes or your </v>
<v Speaker 2>methodology changes or what you're </v>

2308
01:40:19.861 --> 01:40:20.694
<v Speaker 2>actually doing changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the bottom line is if you're not </v>

2309
01:40:24.421 --> 01:40:27.390
<v Speaker 2>happy doing the old version of you that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the audience wants,</v>

2310
01:40:27.690 --> 01:40:30.270
<v Speaker 2>then it's not worth doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you might as well do it.</v>

2311
01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:32.160
<v Speaker 2>You might as well just do what makes you</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>

2312
01:40:32.161 --> 01:40:33.510
<v Speaker 2>And if the audience leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they leave.</v>

2313
01:40:33.511 --> 01:40:34.500
<v Speaker 2>If they stay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they stay.</v>

2314
01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:39.330
<v Speaker 2>You got to make yourself happy first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a tough pill to swallow,</v>

2315
01:40:39.331 --> 01:40:40.430
<v Speaker 2>but it's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

2316
01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:43.800
<v Speaker 2>And something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people don't want to swallow.</v>

2317
01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:51.420
<v Speaker 2>Cut the tension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we've really talked about everything</v>

2318
01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:53.010
<v Speaker 2>we really have except one</v>

2319
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.130
<v Speaker 3>ghost stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah.</v>

2320
01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:00.850
<v Speaker 3>Do you believe in ghosts or Ufos or </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything paranormal like that?</v>

2321
01:41:00.910 --> 01:41:02.950
<v Speaker 3>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm too rational.</v>

2322
01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fine.</v>

2323
01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:07.180
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we,</v>

2324
01:41:07.870 --> 01:41:08.703
<v Speaker 3>we have a habit of asking all of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>guests if you have any ghost or Ufo </v>

2325
01:41:11.891 --> 01:41:14.320
<v Speaker 3>stories that sometimes the answers are </v>
<v Speaker 3>quite surprising,</v>

2326
01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:16.870
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of times they say no and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the end of it.</v>

2327
01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:19.690
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you were full story.</v>

2328
01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:24.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean not really a alien Ufo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one time I was out when I was like,</v>

2329
01:41:25.010 --> 01:41:27.310
<v Speaker 3>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like eight to 10 years old.</v>

2330
01:41:27.311 --> 01:41:28.144
<v Speaker 3>I was out in my backyard in Ireland and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we were all outside very late at night </v>

2331
01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:32.583
<v Speaker 3>in Ireland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see all the stars because </v>

2332
01:41:33.201 --> 01:41:34.600
<v Speaker 3>there's not much light pollution going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

2333
01:41:35.050 --> 01:41:35.883
<v Speaker 3>And then all of a sudden my friends were</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking and I could hear this like </v>

2334
01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:42.760
<v Speaker 3>almost like a jet engine sound and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>kept getting louder and I like looked up</v>

2335
01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:43.653
<v Speaker 3>and there was a star in the sky that </v>
<v Speaker 3>just got like whiter and brighter and </v>

2336
01:41:46.961 --> 01:41:50.470
<v Speaker 3>then vanished and all of a sudden the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sound was gone.</v>

2337
01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:51.690
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

2338
01:41:51.970 --> 01:41:54.310
<v Speaker 3>I was an alien dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just saw an alien.</v>

2339
01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:55.330
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How old?</v>

2340
01:41:55.331 --> 01:41:57.130
<v Speaker 3>Real eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nine.</v>

2341
01:41:57.131 --> 01:41:58.210
<v Speaker 3>Did they see it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2342
01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:02.320
<v Speaker 3>and I feel like a lunatic thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to do that.</v>

2343
01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:05.080
<v Speaker 3>That's been a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's cool.</v>

2344
01:42:05.110 --> 01:42:05.943
<v Speaker 3>Were you guys here like the missile went</v>
<v Speaker 3>off that day and the gentle marbles and </v>

2345
01:42:09.141 --> 01:42:12.370
<v Speaker 3>I can fill in where the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow like capture that moment.</v>

2346
01:42:13.090 --> 01:42:15.070
<v Speaker 3>Did you see it in the air?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>

2347
01:42:15.071 --> 01:42:16.660
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just saw it all over the news.</v>

2348
01:42:16.930 --> 01:42:18.490
<v Speaker 3>I think we may have been in New York at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time,</v>

2349
01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:20.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh right.</v>

2350
01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:21.813
<v Speaker 3>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just turned out with some missile </v>

2351
01:42:23.321 --> 01:42:24.154
<v Speaker 3>tests,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some shit they didn't tell him that you </v>

2352
01:42:24.791 --> 01:42:28.960
<v Speaker 3>want to see when you go outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you believe in ghosts and aliens?</v>

2353
01:42:30.850 --> 01:42:32.650
<v Speaker 3>Don't believe there's aliens visiting </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2354
01:42:32.850 --> 01:42:34.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in ghosts.</v>

2355
01:42:34.630 --> 01:42:35.620
<v Speaker 3>I believe there's aliens.</v>

2356
01:42:36.220 --> 01:42:38.500
<v Speaker 3>They're out there fucking slamming away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2357
01:42:38.690 --> 01:42:41.700
<v Speaker 3>Fucking microbes going at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2358
01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:43.960
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think they're visiting the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>

2359
01:42:44.530 --> 01:42:45.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would they want to?</v>

2360
01:42:46.540 --> 01:42:48.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

2361
01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:50.490
<v Speaker 3>I might just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they visited the earth were,</v>

2362
01:42:50.830 --> 01:42:52.960
<v Speaker 3>where do you think is like the worst </v>
<v Speaker 3>place they could land to be like,</v>

2363
01:42:52.961 --> 01:42:55.780
<v Speaker 3>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never coming here again.</v>

2364
01:42:57.530 --> 01:42:59.110
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>

2365
01:42:59.850 --> 01:43:00.790
<v Speaker 3>Because like everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2366
01:43:00.791 --> 01:43:03.670
<v Speaker 3>they'll come and they'll go to like dc </v>

2368
01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:06.570

<v Speaker 3>I mean to an alien.</v>

2385
01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:46.300

<v Speaker 3>Kidding.</v>
