37
00:02:12.941 --> 00:02:16.840
<v Speaker 1>but first let's start with our goof of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the day.</v>

38
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.030
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to think of a name of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>last week,</v>

39
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.253
<v Speaker 1>goof of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the idea when we do these top of </v>

40
00:02:22.751 --> 00:02:25.660
<v Speaker 1>the weeks to start it every time with a </v>

42
00:02:31.361 --> 00:02:35.740
<v Speaker 1>got laughter yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this video.</v>

43
00:02:35.741 --> 00:02:38.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm very conflicted about this video </v>
<v Speaker 1>laughter yoga because,</v>

44
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.260
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just show you.</v>

45
00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:44.094
<v Speaker 1>It's like these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all have these awful diseases and </v>

46
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:52.941
<v Speaker 1>their method of coping with it is by </v>
<v Speaker 1>manic laughing.</v>

47
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.390
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think it's a cool thing,</v>

48
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 1>but it's like it's so eerie and strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

49
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

50
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 1>let's just start it off right here guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

51
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 2>God bless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

52
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.550
<v Speaker 3>diagnosis and we're going to laugh </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

53
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you go around the room,</v>

54
00:03:19.341 --> 00:03:21.680
<v Speaker 3>it's very powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now if you don't,</v>

55
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.700
<v Speaker 3>and we'll do it just with a few people </v>
<v Speaker 3>here just to get a flavor.</v>

56
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.930
<v Speaker 3>If anybody has a diagnosis they want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>share and laugh about that,</v>

57
00:03:27.931 --> 00:03:30.170
<v Speaker 3>that'd be great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't,</v>

58
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.950
<v Speaker 3>then what I've done is combine it with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ha ha mantra,</v>

59
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.143
<v Speaker 3>which is you'll say your name and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened recently to you that normally </v>

60
00:03:39.471 --> 00:03:43.310
<v Speaker 3>would really bum you out and share it </v>
<v Speaker 3>with us and we'll laugh at it.</v>

61
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.320
<v Speaker 3>So it's that whole psychology of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

62
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:47.773
<v Speaker 3>turning lemons.</v>

63
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.700
<v Speaker 2>Oops.</v>

64
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.530
<v Speaker 3>Was it into lemonade?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

65
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.720
<v Speaker 1>so you guys get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This lady,</v>

66
00:03:52.721 --> 00:03:54.430
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do you get that Eric?</v>

67
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.023
<v Speaker 1>I think on face value it sounds nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you watch it it's like I just </v>

68
00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:02.524
<v Speaker 1>don't buy the laughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the saddest shit I've ever </v>

69
00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:05.464
<v Speaker 1>seen.</v>

70
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.780

71
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.890

<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

72
00:04:07.891 --> 00:04:09.780
<v Speaker 3>and I always start and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's how it looks.</v>

73
00:04:09.781 --> 00:04:12.150
<v Speaker 3>So my name is Geeta.</v>

74
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.833
<v Speaker 1>The one thing that throws me off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes me feel strange about this is </v>

75
00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:19.564
<v Speaker 1>like why laughing after the name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes it seem like they're just </v>

76
00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:24.041
<v Speaker 1>clowning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

77
00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:26.620

<v Speaker 1>Like they laugh,</v>

78
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.940
<v Speaker 1>they laugh after they say the trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then like they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it feels like you're getting clowned on,</v>

81
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.630
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see what I mean.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's strange to see these things side by</v>
<v Speaker 1>side and I'm dying of breast cancer.</v>

238
00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:26.790

290
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:10.870
<v Speaker 9>Something subtle like asking them,</v>
<v Speaker 9>oh no,</v>

<v Speaker 9>I've got some bumpy.</v>

294
00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.070
<v Speaker 1>Why the fuck did they sound like Chris </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rock?</v>

295
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's like citizen justice.</v>

297
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:28.663
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they're advocating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this guy hasn't raped any kids and </v>

298
00:15:31.551 --> 00:15:33.290
<v Speaker 1>you're loving you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're strong.</v>

299
00:15:33.291 --> 00:15:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Arming him against a wall man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

300
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.650
<v Speaker 1>it's like such a Chris rock </v>
<v Speaker 1>impersonation.</v>

301
00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:40.573
<v Speaker 1>It's tripping me out as a great shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine being in middle school and </v>

302
00:15:43.281 --> 00:15:48.281
<v Speaker 1>trying to extrapolate meaning from this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just so insane.</v>

303
00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Is he explicitly a dinosaur?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what else he could be.</v>

304
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking weird.</v>

305
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see sin city where they chop off</v>

306
00:15:57.951 --> 00:16:00.470
<v Speaker 1>the pedals balls and he turns yellow?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's what this is.</v>

307
00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:01.573
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like the devolution and he's a </v>

308
00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.780
<v Speaker 1>yellow man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

309
00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:08.750
<v Speaker 1>he's a castrated pedophile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

310
00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:13.980
<v Speaker 9>I'm an upstanding citizen</v>

311
00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:20.440
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This shit so fucked up.</v>

312
00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.013
<v Speaker 1>He tricks all these little girls and </v>
<v Speaker 1>into doing a photo shoot for him and </v>

313
00:16:25.811 --> 00:16:27.580
<v Speaker 1>he's in there taking photos and look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>it as creepy.</v>

314
00:16:27.581 --> 00:16:30.820
<v Speaker 1>A little friend like cheering them on </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then at the end,</v>

315
00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:34.330
<v Speaker 1>which I'll show you the dinosaur breaks </v>
<v Speaker 1>into his office to get the photos.</v>

316
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:37.593
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all a sting operation and the </v>

317
00:16:38.801 --> 00:16:42.940
<v Speaker 1>rest of the dinosaur you'll see there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a twist in between the lines,</v>

318
00:16:42.941 --> 00:16:44.320
<v Speaker 1>which I'd like you guys to watch your </v>
<v Speaker 1>budget.</v>

319
00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.110
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot to unpack here and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>really not sure.</v>

320
00:16:47.111 --> 00:16:49.590
<v Speaker 1>What's the meaning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the meaning is the lizards,</v>

321
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.090
<v Speaker 1>the Pedo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every once the pedo trust.</v>

322
00:16:52.091 --> 00:16:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Nobody at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

323
00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.160
<v Speaker 1>This whole pedo hysteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so strange.</v>

324
00:16:57.161 --> 00:17:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know that there was this </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy pedo hysteria when I was this age.</v>

325
00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.840
<v Speaker 1>But these days it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

326
00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:05.793
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

327
00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:07.143
<v Speaker 1>don't play outside by yourself or </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a hundred percent chance that </v>

328
00:17:09.851 --> 00:17:10.684
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to rape you immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like how many immediately you're </v>

329
00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:15.460
<v Speaker 1>innovating a rapist pedals are out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>lurking.</v>

330
00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:16.323
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's never got show one of these when </v>

331
00:17:17.891 --> 00:17:19.360
<v Speaker 1>you were growing up though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

332
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:20.650
<v Speaker 1>cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not this one,</v>

333
00:17:20.651 --> 00:17:25.360
<v Speaker 1>but I explicitly remember the pedo video</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was like in elementary school,</v>

334
00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:25.840
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

335
00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.790
<v Speaker 1>We have the Dan Cam up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do.</v>

339
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.050

<v Speaker 1>It's hit the Dan Cam.</v>

340
00:17:35.051 --> 00:17:36.560
<v Speaker 1>You're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

341
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:37.843
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to explain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I'm just sitting here like an </v>

342
00:17:39.311 --> 00:17:41.790
<v Speaker 1>idiot like this and you're talking hit </v>

354
00:18:00.481 --> 00:18:01.314
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

355
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.290

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what more do you need to know?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Definitely not for like a little to </v>

360
00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.880
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not worth the finger in the ass.</v>

<v Speaker 10>than like you.</v>

396
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.240

<v Speaker 10>Maybe there's something to that.</v>

397
00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:11.350
<v Speaker 10>You hear me right?</v>

398
00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.740

401
00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:23.853

<v Speaker 1>going with those photos?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

403

<v Speaker 1>You can't use those in court.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just barged in and stolen out of his</v>

404
00:20:36.391 --> 00:20:37.224
<v Speaker 1>safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what exactly is he doing with those </v>

405
00:20:39.251 --> 00:20:41.340
<v Speaker 1>photos?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

406
00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean he didn't show up at the cops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just kind of this vigilante.</v>

407
00:20:44.201 --> 00:20:45.034
<v Speaker 1>You kicked in the doors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stole the child porn and he's going </v>

408
00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:49.030
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going straight home with that.</v>

409
00:20:49.031 --> 00:20:49.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like Take Kiki and get outta here.</v>

414
00:21:07.691 --> 00:21:09.790
<v Speaker 1>photos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been sure of anything more in</v>

415
00:21:09.791 --> 00:21:10.624
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>

426
00:21:37.381 --> 00:21:39.640
<v Speaker 1>approach because I'm not sure I could </v>
<v Speaker 1>extrapolate any means.</v>

<v Speaker 1>attendant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Albert Einstein.</v>

467
00:23:38.471 --> 00:23:41.260
<v Speaker 1>fantasizes about.</v>

477
00:24:05.331 --> 00:24:06.164
<v Speaker 1>because I look like a fuck boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do like there's something in </v>

482
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

483
00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:32.600
<v Speaker 1>you're first class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just imagine this person.</v>

484
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

485
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:41.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am so sorry I judged you.</v>

486
00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:45.220
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

487
00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:50.220
<v Speaker 1>And then of course the subtle bragging </v>
<v Speaker 1>about being rich and flying first class.</v>

488
00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.130
<v Speaker 1>But what exactly are you asking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to judge.</v>

489
00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:58.390
<v Speaker 1>There's no nothing about your character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's saying don't,</v>

490
00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.150
<v Speaker 1>don't make a judgment if someone's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rich or poor.</v>

491
00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:03.600
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

492
00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Be careful who you're rude too because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they might be rich.</v>

493
00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:12.530
<v Speaker 1>The fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the moral of the story,</v>

494
00:25:12.531 --> 00:25:13.364
<v Speaker 1>Logan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to bring awareness to the </v>

495
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:16.543
<v Speaker 1>rampant persecution of fuck boys in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country that honestly is probably the </v>

496
00:25:20.031 --> 00:25:21.960
<v Speaker 1>biggest social issue that we have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with it.</v>

497
00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:24.320
<v Speaker 1>And not denying that he's a fuck boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

498
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:27.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm a rich fuckboy and therefore you </v>
<v Speaker 1>judged a book by its cover.</v>

499
00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:30.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

500
00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:34.430
<v Speaker 1>basically he's saying because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthy,</v>

501
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:37.070
<v Speaker 1>he's superior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

502
00:25:37.071 --> 00:25:38.420
<v Speaker 1>that's really what's sewn in here.</v>

503
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:40.350
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

504
00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:43.320
<v Speaker 1>And to that I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you are fucking,</v>

505
00:25:43.321 --> 00:25:43.871
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

506
00:25:43.871 --> 00:25:44.704
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really one of the worst tweets </v>

507
00:25:46.561 --> 00:25:48.390
<v Speaker 1>I've ever read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he always says,</v>

508
00:25:48.391 --> 00:25:51.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm a kid and he always has a 30 year </v>
<v Speaker 1>old man and all that shit.</v>

509
00:25:51.391 --> 00:25:53.130
<v Speaker 1>He would call me at 33 year old man.</v>

510
00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.510
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that excuse is not,</v>

511
00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:57.403
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really probably the dumbest </v>

512
00:25:58.491 --> 00:26:03.491
<v Speaker 1>thing I've ever read by a public </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

513
00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:07.460
<v Speaker 1>How long did he keep this up before he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was 30,000</v>

514
00:26:07.461 --> 00:26:08.450
<v Speaker 1>likes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

515
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:13.510
<v Speaker 1>probably half a day or more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was he getting a bunch of shit for it?</v>

516
00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:15.321
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

517
00:26:15.321 --> 00:26:16.154
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did he become self aware suddenly </v>

518
00:26:17.631 --> 00:26:19.860
<v Speaker 1>that that is fucking awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

519
00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.980
<v Speaker 1>He was probably getting shit for it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

520
00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:24.530
<v Speaker 1>he's probably trying to play it like </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to the hip these days,</v>

521
00:26:24.531 --> 00:26:25.364
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

522
00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:26.323
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

523
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.750
<v Speaker 1>I guess he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why people don't like</v>

524
00:26:29.751 --> 00:26:30.584
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to remove it because </v>

525
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:35.240
<v Speaker 1>trying to keep it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

526
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:39.350
<v Speaker 1>coach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I have to say I,</v>

527
00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.330
<v Speaker 1>when I read this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said stunned.</v>

528
00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.100
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh wow.</v>

529
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.780
<v Speaker 1>And then you stood up and started </v>
<v Speaker 1>applauding.</v>

530
00:26:45.781 --> 00:26:46.614
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I did judge this book by its </v>

531
00:26:48.301 --> 00:26:48.720
<v Speaker 1>cover.</v>

532
00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.351
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

533
00:26:49.351 --> 00:26:50.490
<v Speaker 1>they were right about you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

534
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:54.030
<v Speaker 1>They weren't talking about the price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you are first class,</v>

535
00:26:54.031 --> 00:26:55.710
<v Speaker 1>they were talking about that you're such</v>
<v Speaker 1>a douchebag.</v>

536
00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.900
<v Speaker 1>They saw this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they saw him,</v>

537
00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.910
<v Speaker 1>they knew it was Logan Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

538
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's a fucking idiot.</v>

539
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:04.260
<v Speaker 1>And then Logan's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

540
00:27:04.261 --> 00:27:06.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm first class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

541
00:27:06.931 --> 00:27:08.100
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still,</v>

542
00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:09.660

<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what I expected.</v>

543
00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:12.720
<v Speaker 1>You're a fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a Marv.</v>

544
00:27:12.721 --> 00:27:15.570
<v Speaker 1>I must want to frame this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

545
00:27:15.571 --> 00:27:17.670
<v Speaker 1>We should wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is a picture?</v>

547
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:19.770

<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

548
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:22.260
<v Speaker 1>when you had done that self image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't make someone aware,</v>

549
00:27:22.261 --> 00:27:24.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's only got a negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>connotation.</v>

550
00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.160
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.300
<v Speaker 1>CSI.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

731
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Ksi sound like an old man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

732
00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:50.160
<v Speaker 1>who's this CSI guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

733
00:36:50.161 --> 00:36:53.250
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Ksi Logan.</v>

734
00:36:53.251 --> 00:36:54.084
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys all know about this boxing </v>

735
00:36:54.721 --> 00:36:55.670
<v Speaker 1>match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to lie.</v>

736
00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to watch the highlights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to sit here in front.</v>

737
00:36:58.351 --> 00:37:01.890
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not even interested on aunt.</v>

738
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:04.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to watch the highlights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching it.</v>

739
00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:06.210
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this side is going to,</v>

740
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:07.703
<v Speaker 1>I think Ksi will win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I am standing by that I think is </v>

741
00:37:10.171 --> 00:37:14.010
<v Speaker 1>going to be a shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boring match ever since I heard.</v>

742
00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:14.963
<v Speaker 1>So they're doing two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one in the UK and one back here in La </v>

743
00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.210
<v Speaker 1>and they always arrange for it to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

744
00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:22.980
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all bogus.</v>

745
00:37:22.981 --> 00:37:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Like one is going to win one and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other is going to win the other.</v>

746
00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:26.910
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

747
00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:27.773
<v Speaker 1>I don't what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying that someone's going to </v>

748
00:37:28.771 --> 00:37:29.670
<v Speaker 1>throw it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

749
00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going full conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

750
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:32.513
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think either of them have </v>

751
00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:38.010
<v Speaker 1>neither have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they both have such huge egos.</v>

752
00:37:38.011 --> 00:37:42.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't think either of them have it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to get their ass beat and throw.</v>

753
00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:46.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

754
00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.920
<v Speaker 1>But if there's like a slaughter and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first one,</v>

755
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:50.083
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no reason to believe it's weird </v>

756
00:37:51.381 --> 00:37:52.131
<v Speaker 1>to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well anyway,</v>

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:09.410
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching this video,</v>

764
00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:13.460

<v Speaker 1>Paul in a way.</v>

765
00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:15.890
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets,</v>

766
00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:19.580
<v Speaker 13>he's the heel.</v>
<v Speaker 13>He just can't go wrestling hill.</v>

767
00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:21.520
<v Speaker 13>So embarrassing.</v>

768
00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Like he just gets creamed by case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I then Logan's Logan's dad of all people</v>

769
00:38:26.681 --> 00:38:28.960
<v Speaker 1>come out and try to defend him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his dad is crunchy as fuck and it's just</v>

771
00:38:34.661 --> 00:38:37.420
<v Speaker 1>like a shit show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so embarrassing.</v>

772
00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.150
<v Speaker 1>You know what Logan's thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

774
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:43.570
<v Speaker 1>this may well be my last chance to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

775
00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:45.400
<v Speaker 9>Okay,</v>

776

00:38:47.621 --> 00:38:49.600
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to crunch some numbers right now.</v>

778
00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Let's crunch numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's 20,000</v>

779
00:38:53.891 --> 00:38:55.150
<v Speaker 1>seats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're going to sell it.</v>

780
00:38:55.151 --> 00:38:55.984
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe they'll sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's be generous and say they sell </v>

781
00:38:58.241 --> 00:38:59.380
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000.</v>

783
00:39:02.021 --> 00:39:05.410

00:39:08.551 --> 00:39:09.384
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't charging a hundred fucking </v>

786
00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:12.003
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do this thing.</v>

00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:14.523

<v Speaker 1>But then they're doing paper view and </v>

789
00:39:16.301 --> 00:39:18.610
<v Speaker 1>all this bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll have a lot of live streamers.</v>

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.260
<v Speaker 1>10,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

794
00:39:26.261 --> 00:39:27.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right</v>

<v Speaker 1>isn't it online thing?</v>

796
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:33.383
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they'll still more than 10,000,</v>

799
00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:40.530
<v Speaker 1>let's say it's 25 for the stream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think they sell?</v>

800
00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:41.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

801
00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:44.550
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

802
00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:46.740
<v Speaker 1>but maybe I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a hundred I don't know.</v>

803
00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:49.140
<v Speaker 1>50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another,</v>

804
00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.950

806
00:39:59.851 --> 00:40:00.684
<v Speaker 1>the two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like this calculation can't be </v>

807
00:40:02.311 --> 00:40:03.144
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like they got to be making more </v>

808
00:40:03.571 --> 00:40:05.970
<v Speaker 1>money from this.</v>

810
00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.300
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking not making that much </v>
<v Speaker 1>money from this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>hundred I mean,</v>

812
00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.820
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm out of touch a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people are like,</v>

992
00:49:17.411 --> 00:49:18.880
<v Speaker 1>he's not in a good place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Logan.</v>

993
00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:20.620
<v Speaker 1>I think he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

994
00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talking about it.</v>

995
00:49:23.261 --> 00:49:24.670
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's gotta be so happy.</v>

996
00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:26.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his dad's got his fucking back.</v>

997
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His Dad's got his back through thick and</v>

998
00:49:30.461 --> 00:49:32.350
<v Speaker 1>thin for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of it,</v>

999
00:49:32.351 --> 00:49:33.184
<v Speaker 1>BBC was at an interview with Logan to </v>
<v Speaker 1>promote the fight and they tweeted this </v>

1000
00:49:37.211 --> 00:49:39.310
<v Speaker 1>out today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were going to hear from Logan,</v>

1001
00:49:39.311 --> 00:49:40.144
<v Speaker 1>Paul and Ksi on their boxing match </v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight after listening back to the </v>

1002
00:49:42.701 --> 00:49:44.170
<v Speaker 1>interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we don't feel it's right.</v>

1003
00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:46.150
<v Speaker 1>We understand some of your strong views </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Logan,</v>

1004
00:49:46.151 --> 00:49:46.984
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we don't think the interview is good </v>

1005
00:49:49.661 --> 00:49:50.740
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't air it.</v>

1006
00:49:51.730 --> 00:49:53.590
<v Speaker 1>They thought the interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1007
00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:56.380
<v Speaker 1>it's not about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys don't like Logan.</v>

1008
00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:57.243
<v Speaker 1>It's about that the interview sucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this guy at nothing interesting to </v>

1009
00:50:01.541 --> 00:50:05.170
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we didn't air it like this is the</v>

1010
00:50:05.171 --> 00:50:06.004
<v Speaker 1>best burn ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That like we acknowledge that we all </v>

1011
00:50:07.511 --> 00:50:12.511
<v Speaker 1>hate him and that's not why we aired it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We aired it because it sucked.</v>

<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't for this a little warming </v>

1184
00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:29.740
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would just be fucking like crazy.</v>

1185
00:58:29.741 --> 00:58:32.030
<v Speaker 1>He's crushing it honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1186
00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:36.550
<v Speaker 1>I love the image of him being stopped </v>
<v Speaker 1>between bases.</v>

1187
00:58:36.551 --> 00:58:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Like he got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got tagged out.</v>

1188
00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:39.033
<v Speaker 1>He was in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's having a pickle and probably came </v>

1189
00:58:40.541 --> 00:58:42.040
<v Speaker 1>downstairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1190
00:58:42.041 --> 00:58:44.020
<v Speaker 1>that might be actually accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

1191
00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:48.120
<v Speaker 12>Your left.</v>
<v Speaker 12>All right.</v>

1192
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:54.360
<v Speaker 12>Just once for all the tamales.</v>

1193
00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:56.543
<v Speaker 11>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 11>What's the most trouble skips trouble </v>

1194
00:59:00.690 --> 00:59:04.770
<v Speaker 11>skippy has ever gotten with his bishop?</v>
<v Speaker 11>We've taught,</v>

1195
00:59:04.771 --> 00:59:09.771
<v Speaker 11>heard him talk about his bishop.</v>
<v Speaker 11>This is the man at his church who passes</v>

1196
00:59:09.781 --> 00:59:10.614
<v Speaker 11>judgment on him.</v>
<v Speaker 11>He's basically the gatekeeper to the </v>

1197
00:59:13.201 --> 00:59:15.440
<v Speaker 11>afterlife.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Right,</v>

1198
00:59:15.450 --> 00:59:16.380
<v Speaker 11>right.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So a,</v>

1199
00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:18.893
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got in trouble for all the handies </v>

1200
00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:21.793
<v Speaker 1>he's been getting</v>

1201
00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:22.430
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1202
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:23.660
<v Speaker 11>as we,</v>
<v Speaker 11>as we've called it,</v>

1203
00:59:23.661 --> 00:59:24.494
<v Speaker 11>rounding the third base,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but being struck out for masturbating </v>

1204
00:59:28.581 --> 00:59:29.414
<v Speaker 11>too much or see getting drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 11>which is strictly against the Mormon </v>

1205
00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:37.070
<v Speaker 11>faith.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Sarah,</v>

1206
00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:39.973
<v Speaker 15>what is your oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 15>I think deeply and the mind of the </v>

1207
00:59:45.441 --> 00:59:50.441
<v Speaker 15>Mormon enter the mind of the virgin.</v>
<v Speaker 15>I would say it's probably masturbating,</v>

1208
00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:57.290
<v Speaker 15>masturbating too much.</v>

1209
00:59:58.250 --> 01:00:02.300
<v Speaker 16>Very nice and very,</v>
<v Speaker 16>very good gas.</v>

1210
01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:08.260
<v Speaker 16>I would guess that he masturbates at </v>
<v Speaker 16>least seven times a day at least.</v>

1211
01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:11.573
<v Speaker 5>Dan,</v>

1212
01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.320
<v Speaker 16>is it masturbating too much,</v>
<v Speaker 16>John</v>

1213
01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:15.263
<v Speaker 14>to second base with multiple girls?</v>
<v Speaker 14>I got if we're using the baseball </v>

1214
01:00:21.001 --> 01:00:22.470
<v Speaker 14>analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I uh,</v>

1215
01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:27.500
<v Speaker 14>got sidelined by my bishop and was told </v>
<v Speaker 14>not to take the communion for awhile.</v>

1216
01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:32.900
<v Speaker 14>So in the Mormon church they call it </v>
<v Speaker 14>being disfellowshipped.</v>

1217
01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:34.190
<v Speaker 1>This fella</v>

1218
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:35.870
<v Speaker 15>shipped.</v>
<v Speaker 15>It is sadly,</v>

1219
01:00:35.950 --> 01:00:37.240
<v Speaker 15>he had a great,</v>
<v Speaker 15>great guess.</v>

1220
01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:38.083
<v Speaker 15>You had a great guess.</v>
<v Speaker 15>He probably does masturbate a lot to </v>

1221
01:00:42.591 --> 01:00:44.000
<v Speaker 15>that.</v>
<v Speaker 15>I would give you all the credit,</v>

1222
01:00:45.210 --> 01:00:46.043
<v Speaker 1>but it was actually from all the handies</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was getting and he got </v>

1223
01:00:47.881 --> 01:00:51.450
<v Speaker 1>disfellowshipped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a word that makes me giggle.</v>

1224
01:00:51.970 --> 01:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

1225
01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:56.730
<v Speaker 1>But this is okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This last question.</v>

1226
01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.280
<v Speaker 1>Everything rides on this question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's two to two.</v>

1227
01:00:59.281 --> 01:01:01.620
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are on the board to,</v>

1229
01:01:02.730 --> 01:01:04.680

<v Speaker 1>I love this segment.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Who should we do next?</v>

1303
01:04:29.541 --> 01:04:32.900
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we actually,</v>

1304
01:04:32.901 --> 01:04:34.090
<v Speaker 1>this show is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1305
01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:35.773
<v Speaker 1>let's just do the Roseanne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've got a lot of great stuff </v>

1306
01:04:37.491 --> 01:04:40.250
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I kind of want to go over it with,</v>

1307
01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:43.540
<v Speaker 1>with Ila.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1308
01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:44.593
<v Speaker 1>one thing in particular I really want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about is that we talked previously </v>

1309
01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:48.613
<v Speaker 1>that mean either trying to have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to do a semen analysis and I </v>

1310
01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.000
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1311
01:04:53.001 --> 01:04:56.330
<v Speaker 1>the room was unbelievable where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>going there and squirting a cup.</v>

1312
01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:01.070
<v Speaker 1>I was taking pictures and videos of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>room because it's like you can't imagine</v>

1313
01:05:01.071 --> 01:05:01.904
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to wait until Ila sitting </v>

1314
01:05:03.891 --> 01:05:07.310
<v Speaker 1>across from me so she can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to see her reaction to this.</v>

1315
01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:10.670
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of stuff I want to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1316
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.010
<v Speaker 1>but I want to close up the show with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Roseanne.</v>

1317
01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:16.880
<v Speaker 1>You guys have heard about Roseanne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the situation of her calling.</v>

1318
01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:20.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember if this lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said she looked like a monkey.</v>

1319
01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Shar show got canceled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she's finally issued an explanation.</v>

1320
01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:29.103
<v Speaker 1>She's finally issued a statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an apology of sorts that I think clears </v>

1321
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:36.160
<v Speaker 1>everything up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think you guys will all agree.</v>

1322
01:05:36.790 --> 01:05:40.450
<v Speaker 1>So in her own words.</v>

1323
01:05:42.130 --> 01:05:42.970
<v Speaker 3>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hello?</v>

1324
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:45.490
<v Speaker 3>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hello?</v>

1325
01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:46.323
<v Speaker 3>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hello.</v>

1326
01:05:46.590 --> 01:05:47.970
<v Speaker 1>Is it loud enough out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan?</v>

1327
01:05:49.590 --> 01:05:51.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1328
01:05:51.151 --> 01:05:52.500
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fine.</v>

1329
01:05:53.010 --> 01:05:55.800
<v Speaker 1>Cause it only she's Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else is just getting ambient.</v>

1330
01:05:55.801 --> 01:05:57.090
<v Speaker 1>So once she starts talking and listen.</v>

1331
01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:00.740
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1332
01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I get frustrated with Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have sound issues and I yell at Dan,</v>

1333
01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:08.990
<v Speaker 1>you guys have any sound issues with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbalanced or itchy weird shit?</v>

1334
01:06:09.170 --> 01:06:11.090
<v Speaker 1>Emailed Dan and give him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give him hell.</v>

1335
01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:14.453
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1336
01:06:15.130 --> 01:06:17.350
<v Speaker 1>Sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have chat anymore,</v>

1337
01:06:17.351 --> 01:06:19.720
<v Speaker 1>so we don't even know for fucking up </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1338
01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:24.190
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this figurine and another video,</v>

1339
01:06:24.191 --> 01:06:26.380
<v Speaker 1>she explains that this is a statue of </v>
<v Speaker 1>her body.</v>

1340
01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:31.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe skippy's into that.</v>

1341
01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe d Roseanne would be,</v>

1342
01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:37.940
<v Speaker 1>that kind of surprises me that skippy </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to fuck oprah does.</v>

1343
01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:41.020
<v Speaker 1>I know the figurine with your mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just took it full screen right here.</v>

1344
01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there she is.</v>

1345
01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Does it surprise you that skippy wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fuck oprah?</v>

1346
01:06:45.101 --> 01:06:46.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1347
01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1348
01:06:47.330 --> 01:06:50.110
<v Speaker 1>I want to fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know who I want around third base on</v>

1349
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:51.063
<v Speaker 1>Oprah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what's very surprised when he </v>

1350
01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:55.540
<v Speaker 1>said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What base is ass play?</v>

1351
01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:58.633
<v Speaker 1>Cause that then that's the dugout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The metaphor kind of breaks down cause </v>

1352
01:07:02.951 --> 01:07:07.930
<v Speaker 1>it's like ask plays almost more advanced</v>
<v Speaker 1>than a home run in a way.</v>

1353
01:07:09.730 --> 01:07:10.810
<v Speaker 1>In most circles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

1354
01:07:11.830 --> 01:07:13.810
<v Speaker 1>So I wonder if skippy's ever fingered an</v>
<v Speaker 1>asshole.</v>

1355
01:07:16.570 --> 01:07:17.403
<v Speaker 1>I don't wonder that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do I hear him talking in the </v>

1356
01:07:18.941 --> 01:07:21.340
<v Speaker 1>background?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was that Ian,</v>

1357
01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:24.370

1361
01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.410

1362
01:07:36.530 --> 01:07:37.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hello.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1369
01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:52.853
<v Speaker 3>Imagine a presidential address.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're busted with a killing a </v>

01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:59.543

<v Speaker 3>going to give his address and then the </v>

1372
01:08:01.891 --> 01:08:02.724
<v Speaker 3>camera fades out and it's fucking the </v>
<v Speaker 3>president on his desk in the Oval </v>

1373
01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:07.110
<v Speaker 3>Office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

1374
01:08:07.170 --> 01:08:09.270
<v Speaker 3>I do not have sex with that hooker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1375
01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:10.333
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine in his statement the keep and </v>

1376
01:08:12.121 --> 01:08:14.580
<v Speaker 3>save his job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were jump cuts,</v>

1377
01:08:14.810 --> 01:08:15.920
<v Speaker 3>multiple outfits,</v>

1378
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:20.390
<v Speaker 5>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to talk about,</v>

1379
01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.640
<v Speaker 5>you've told me this $300.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know that?</v>

1380
01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:26.803
<v Speaker 5>That's what my tweet was about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know you've explained this literally </v>

1381
01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:36.520
<v Speaker 5>was why I thought the bridge was why.</v>

1382
01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:39.730
<v Speaker 1>So that clears it up.</v>

1383
01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:42.353
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1384

<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of interesting things here</v>

1385
01:08:46.111 --> 01:08:47.220
<v Speaker 1>about this field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1389
01:08:59.670 --> 01:09:00.503
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is probably my favorite clip to </v>

1390
01:09:02.941 --> 01:09:07.620
<v Speaker 1>come out of this whole possibly year </v>
<v Speaker 1>2018 this might be the strongest clip of</v>

1391
01:09:07.621 --> 01:09:10.720
<v Speaker 1>the whole year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roseanne,</v>

1392
01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:13.300
<v Speaker 1>what do you have to say in your defense</v>

1393
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:15.880
<v Speaker 5>job?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There were jump cuts.</v>

1394
01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:20.890
<v Speaker 5>You've told me this 300 times.</v>

1395
01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:23.080
<v Speaker 1>What is wrong with her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

1396
01:09:23.350 --> 01:09:25.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she's on drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like my God,</v>

1397
01:09:25.541 --> 01:09:30.541
<v Speaker 1>she's like breaking down just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>

1398
01:09:31.690 --> 01:09:35.170
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't look good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was posted this this previous week,</v>

1399
01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:36.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is very recent.</v>

1400
01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:40.150
<v Speaker 1>You think it was recorded recently or </v>
<v Speaker 1>was this right after the incident?</v>

1401
01:09:40.151 --> 01:09:40.360
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1402
01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:41.170
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

1403
01:09:41.170 --> 01:09:44.910
<v Speaker 1>maybe this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is after some thoughtful after some</v>

1404
01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:47.110
<v Speaker 1>reflection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like the question is,</v>

1405
01:09:47.111 --> 01:09:50.170
<v Speaker 1>well here after some after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love this.</v>

1406
01:09:50.171 --> 01:09:51.004
<v Speaker 1>This is so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After some careful consideration and </v>

1407
01:09:53.381 --> 01:09:57.730
<v Speaker 1>some thoughtful reflection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rosanne has decided to issue a statement</v>

1408
01:09:58.420 --> 01:09:59.890
<v Speaker 1>on her controversial tweets.</v>

1409
01:10:01.690 --> 01:10:04.720
<v Speaker 5>That's what my point was about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know you've explained this.</v>

1410
01:10:04.721 --> 01:10:05.554
<v Speaker 5>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was why I thought the bridge was </v>

1411
01:10:12.330 --> 01:10:13.163
<v Speaker 5>why.</v>

1412
01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:17.590
<v Speaker 1>Now I've got an interesting question for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1413
01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Do you think this in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does this help her?</v>

1414
01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:23.350
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1415
01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:24.911
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost?</v>

1416
01:10:24.911 --> 01:10:27.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm more inclined to believe her because</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

1417
01:10:27.550 --> 01:10:30.200
<v Speaker 1>she's very passionate about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's very passionate about it or I'm,</v>

1418
01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:33.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm somewhat inclined to believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1419
01:10:33.610 --> 01:10:34.443
<v Speaker 1>that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't necessarily coming from a </v>

1420
01:10:35.591 --> 01:10:36.424
<v Speaker 1>place of,</v>

1421
01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:38.950
<v Speaker 5>he's done</v>

1422
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:40.750
<v Speaker 1>prove that statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a strong statement.</v>

1423
01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:41.613
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm also inclined to believe that she's </v>

1424
01:10:43.091 --> 01:10:44.020
<v Speaker 1>a fucking psycho.</v>

1425
01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:50.870
<v Speaker 5>What makes you think that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What makes you say at all,</v>

1426
01:10:53.311 --> 01:10:54.144
<v Speaker 5>Dan?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dan,</v>

1427
01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:56.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just something,</v>

1428
01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:57.380
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something about,</v>

1429
01:10:57.410 --> 01:10:58.490
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she goes about it.</v>

1430
01:10:58.491 --> 01:10:59.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

1431
01:10:59.571 --> 01:11:00.710
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1432
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:04.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just thought that there's really a lot</v>

1433
01:11:04.251 --> 01:11:05.084
<v Speaker 1>of value here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought this was a great clip and I </v>

1434
01:11:08.811 --> 01:11:10.190
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1435
01:11:10.530 --> 01:11:11.300
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

1436
01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:13.110
<v Speaker 1>let me draft this in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in another way.</v>

1437
01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:32.693
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

1438
01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:38.110
<v Speaker 1>And for those reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount.</v>

1439
01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:40.930
<v Speaker 1>I've been waiting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do that for a long time.</v>

1440
01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:43.030
<v Speaker 1>I got this soundbite here is I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>another one.</v>

1441
01:11:43.031 --> 01:11:43.960
<v Speaker 1>The angels in heaven.</v>

1442
01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:45.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1443
01:11:57.330 --> 01:11:58.350
<v Speaker 1>I think the curb ones better.</v>

1444
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:06.743
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

1445
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:15.190
<v Speaker 1>I love that soundboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1446
01:12:16.190 --> 01:12:17.190
<v Speaker 1>you're a conductor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1447
01:12:17.970 --> 01:12:20.080
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a Dj for the first time.</v>

1448
01:12:20.410 --> 01:12:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here actually,</v>

1449
01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:25.463
<v Speaker 1>this is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like right when they start </v>

1450
01:12:26.731 --> 01:12:28.680
<v Speaker 1>rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was like her off the cuff thing.</v>

1451
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen someone famous so </v>
<v Speaker 1>unhinged in your life?</v>

1452
01:12:31.861 --> 01:12:33.420
<v Speaker 1>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's so fascinating about it?</v>

1453
01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:36.860
<v Speaker 17>I thought that bitch was,</v>
<v Speaker 17>why</v>

1454
01:12:38.190 --> 01:12:39.250
<v Speaker 1>does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

1455
01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:42.460
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy to see anybody that unhinged,</v>

1456
01:12:43.090 --> 01:12:45.340
<v Speaker 1>but it does kind of give you an insight </v>
<v Speaker 1>to how,</v>

1457
01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:50.140
<v Speaker 1>how fucked up he is kind of in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Whoa,</v>

1458
01:12:51.010 --> 01:12:53.230
<v Speaker 1>probably shouldn't have been working on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that show to begin with,</v>

1459
01:12:53.690 --> 01:12:54.110
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1460
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.943
<v Speaker 17>Yeah.</v>

1461
01:12:55.710 --> 01:12:58.980
<v Speaker 1>That's where you're at mentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1462
01:12:59.110 --> 01:13:04.110
<v Speaker 17>I thought that was wow.</v>
<v Speaker 17>It was why</v>

1463
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:09.820
<v Speaker 1>God damn fucking open a portal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit.</v>

1464
01:13:09.970 --> 01:13:11.290
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1465
01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so then take too,</v>

1466
01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:15.933
<v Speaker 1>she gets her shit together by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck are they put that on our </v>

1467
01:13:18.371 --> 01:13:19.300
<v Speaker 1>official channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1468
01:13:19.301 --> 01:13:22.150
<v Speaker 1>I just loved that so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is her actual,</v>

1469
01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:24.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real statement on it</v>

1470
01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:25.693
<v Speaker 17>bar.</v>
<v Speaker 17>And I'd like to welcome you to my own </v>

1471
01:13:28.081 --> 01:13:28.914
<v Speaker 17>studio,</v>
<v Speaker 17>to my fellow and sister Americans </v>

1472
01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:35.393
<v Speaker 17>without the filter of the biased media.</v>
<v Speaker 17>That's my statement from the very </v>

1473
01:13:40.441 --> 01:13:41.274
<v Speaker 17>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 17>And it will continue to be one abc </v>

1474
01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:51.740
<v Speaker 17>called and asked me to explain my gray,</v>
<v Speaker 17>just an unforgettable tweet.</v>

1475
01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:53.873
<v Speaker 17>I told them I thought Valerie Jarrett </v>
<v Speaker 17>was white and I'm willing to go on the </v>

1476
01:14:01.021 --> 01:14:01.854
<v Speaker 17>BW,</v>
<v Speaker 17>Jimmy Kimmel or whatever other show you </v>

1477
01:14:03.901 --> 01:14:04.734
<v Speaker 17>want me to go on to my audience.</v>
<v Speaker 17>Now what happened with about 40 minutes </v>

1478
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:12.423
<v Speaker 17>after that,</v>
<v Speaker 17>my show was canceled before even one </v>

1479
01:14:14.831 --> 01:14:18.190
<v Speaker 17>advertiser pulled out and I was labeled </v>
<v Speaker 17>a racist.</v>

1480
01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:21.340
<v Speaker 17>Why you ask?</v>
<v Speaker 17>Well,</v>

1481
01:14:21.341 --> 01:14:22.174
<v Speaker 17>the answer is simple.</v>
<v Speaker 17>It's because I voted for Donald Trump </v>

1482
01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.500
<v Speaker 17>and that is not allowed in Hollywood.</v>

1483
01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Pretty Shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1484
01:14:28.530 --> 01:14:29.550
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so ma'am,</v>

1485
01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:31.013
<v Speaker 1>well first of all wasn't the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>premise of the show that she was like a </v>

1486
01:14:33.901 --> 01:14:38.450
<v Speaker 1>trump voter and like so clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously not that they get away,</v>

1487
01:14:38.451 --> 01:14:39.284
<v Speaker 1>they gave you the show because you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>a trump supporter because they thought </v>

1488
01:14:41.161 --> 01:14:44.190
<v Speaker 1>it was an interesting dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1489
01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:47.280
<v Speaker 1>So that doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I do,</v>

1490
01:14:47.281 --> 01:14:48.114
<v Speaker 1>I actually do believe that she thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>she was white because I've seen a </v>

1491
01:14:50.131 --> 01:14:53.490
<v Speaker 1>picture and the lady doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she my first guest wouldn't be black.</v>

1492
01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:55.680
<v Speaker 1>And I mean if you can elicit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1493
01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:58.820
<v Speaker 17>this response was,</v>
<v Speaker 17>why?</v>

1494
01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:01.480
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at any rate,</v>

1495
01:15:01.481 --> 01:15:06.481
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if let's say,</v>

1496
01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:09.790
<v Speaker 1>let's say if she did think she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>white,</v>

1497
01:15:09.910 --> 01:15:12.760
<v Speaker 1>then is the tweet and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how bad is the tweet still?</v>

1498
01:15:13.090 --> 01:15:15.580
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1499
01:15:15.581 --> 01:15:16.414
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously it doesn't have the whole </v>

1500
01:15:17.831 --> 01:15:21.760
<v Speaker 1>connotation of calling a black person a </v>
<v Speaker 1>monkey that everyone thought it did.</v>

1501
01:15:21.790 --> 01:15:24.460
<v Speaker 1>So it's not as bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the context does help,</v>

1502
01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:27.870
<v Speaker 1>but it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's unhinged it,</v>

1503
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:29.440
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

1504
01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:34.120
<v Speaker 1>she was probably on thin ice already at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the executives at ABC because</v>

1505
01:15:34.121 --> 01:15:36.670
<v Speaker 1>she'd just nonstop was ranting on </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter about it.</v>

1506
01:15:36.671 --> 01:15:36.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1507
01:15:36.810 --> 01:15:37.643
<v Speaker 17>Nine Times.</v>

1508
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And can you imagine working with that?</v>

1509
01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:41.933
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that's not an isolated </v>

1510
01:15:44.641 --> 01:15:45.210
<v Speaker 1>incident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1511
01:15:45.210 --> 01:15:47.460
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what happened,</v>

1512
01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:50.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably that they were like,</v>

1513
01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.000
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1514
01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:53.260
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is Nikki.</v>

1515
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

1516
01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:56.040
<v Speaker 1>this is not going to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But see,</v>

1517
01:15:56.041 --> 01:15:58.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to kind of line that up in a way,</v>

1518
01:15:58.360 --> 01:15:59.193
<v Speaker 3>how did you,</v>

1585
01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:13.293
<v Speaker 18>um,</v>
<v Speaker 18>which it was in response to them </v>

1586
01:19:15.370 --> 01:19:16.203
<v Speaker 18>announcing that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 18>they're going to up their spending on </v>

1587
01:19:18.551 --> 01:19:21.520

<v Speaker 18>on the platform.</v>

1588
01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:23.170

1591
01:19:27.511 --> 01:19:28.344

1593
01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:33.093
<v Speaker 18>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 18>and that kind of coupled with the fact </v>

1594
01:19:34.901 --> 01:19:37.240
<v Speaker 18>that I guess their user growth has </v>
<v Speaker 18>really slowed down.</v>

1595
01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:38.200
<v Speaker 18>Surprise,</v>

1597
01:19:41.411 --> 01:19:43.960

<v Speaker 18>perfect storm where,</v>

1598
01:19:43.961 --> 01:19:45.880
<v Speaker 18>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 18>in a single night,</v>

01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:49.990
<v Speaker 18>$100 billion disappeared off the market.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Single biggest loss for a company.</v>

1600
01:19:49.991 --> 01:19:51.240
<v Speaker 18>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 18>The single biggest loss.</v>

1601
01:19:51.250 --> 01:19:52.130
<v Speaker 18>However,</v>
<v Speaker 18>um,</v>

1602
01:19:52.630 --> 01:19:54.790
<v Speaker 18>and just to give some perspective number</v>
<v Speaker 18>two,</v>

1603
01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:55.713
<v Speaker 18>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 18>I looked this up on September 22nd the </v>

1604
01:19:58.931 --> 01:20:03.750
<v Speaker 18>year 2000 Intel lost 90 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 18>so about 18 years ago.</v>

<v Speaker 18>you know,</v>

1606
01:20:05.010 --> 01:20:06.550
<v Speaker 18>the.com</v>
<v Speaker 18>crash.</v>

1607
01:20:06.551 --> 01:20:08.550
<v Speaker 18>That happened at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 18>nineties.</v>

1608
01:20:08.650 --> 01:20:09.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of results.</v>

1609
01:20:09.790 --> 01:20:13.620
<v Speaker 1>What I'd like to say is suck my Dick </v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook.</v>

1610
01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mark Zuckerberg.</v>

1611
01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Facebook.</v>

1612
01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:20.610
<v Speaker 1>I cannot wait for facebook to become the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next my space.</v>

1613
01:20:20.910 --> 01:20:22.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've said this all the time,</v>

1614
01:20:22.111 --> 01:20:25.560
<v Speaker 1>but I hate everything about facebook and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so fucking glad.</v>

1615
01:20:25.561 --> 01:20:26.394
<v Speaker 1>By the way I read a report,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like their earnings from them </v>

1616
01:20:28.681 --> 01:20:30.900
<v Speaker 1>stealing content from where everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>else on the internet,</v>

1617
01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:33.510
<v Speaker 1>like the earnings aren't good and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>engagement isn't good.</v>

1618
01:20:33.690 --> 01:20:37.350
<v Speaker 1>And all I have to say is for those </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons I'm out.</v>

1619
01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1621
01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:49.430

1622
01:20:54.210 --> 01:20:57.370
<v Speaker 1>so they're basically just back to where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were a few months ago.</v>

1623
01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:58.021

<v Speaker 1>himself wouldn't ever use that word </v>
<v Speaker 1>after having used the word right.</v>

1650
01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:00.713
<v Speaker 1>Which is kind of the confusing part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole thing is he's like </v>

1651
01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:05.213
<v Speaker 1>acknowledging that he said it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also denying that he said it in the </v>

1652
01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always,</v>

1653
01:22:08.941 --> 01:22:11.400
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I saw that headline and then I read</v>

1654
01:22:11.401 --> 01:22:12.570
<v Speaker 1>the article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1655
01:22:12.810 --> 01:22:15.120
<v Speaker 1>well again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think there needs to be a disc.</v>

1656
01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:16.493
<v Speaker 1>Like I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all fucking kind of lost our minds a </v>

1657
01:22:18.961 --> 01:22:20.280
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1658
01:22:20.281 --> 01:22:23.100
<v Speaker 1>he shouldn't have said it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>

1659
01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:25.410
<v Speaker 1>If a marketing company asks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you racist?</v>

1660
01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:28.890
<v Speaker 1>Don't drop the n bomb this show how not </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist you are.</v>

1661
01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Which is basically what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like he didn't like use the,</v>

1662
01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:34.853
<v Speaker 1>he didn't weaponize the word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't use the word he was talking </v>

1663
01:22:36.631 --> 01:22:37.740
<v Speaker 1>about the word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1664
01:22:37.770 --> 01:22:39.650
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the headlines Bra,</v>

1665
01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:44.010
<v Speaker 1>the drug drops to Ed on the conference </v>
<v Speaker 1>call and you're like,</v>

1666
01:22:44.011 --> 01:22:44.844
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he just like called someone the n </v>

1667
01:22:46.291 --> 01:22:49.650
<v Speaker 1>word or somewhat not exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>

1668
01:22:49.651 --> 01:22:50.580
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1669
01:22:50.610 --> 01:22:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Papa John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's sliding that guy spent,</v>

1670
01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:55.620
<v Speaker 1>he spent way too much time close to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pizza oven.</v>

1671
01:22:56.410 --> 01:23:00.060
<v Speaker 1>His face is like melting off like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mozzarella cheese is like,</v>

1672
01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:03.500
<v Speaker 1>it's in the pores and men that pizza is </v>
<v Speaker 1>ready to,</v>

1673
01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:05.890
<v Speaker 1>you can't that pizza</v>

1674
01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:09.760
<v Speaker 18>that peet's has been baked too may time.</v>
<v Speaker 18>So,</v>

1675
01:23:09.761 --> 01:23:11.260
<v Speaker 18>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 18>so he's going after them,</v>

1676
01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:11.951
<v Speaker 18>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 18>saying that,</v>

1677
01:23:11.951 --> 01:23:14.800
<v Speaker 18>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 18>he was unfairly forced out as the,</v>

1678
01:23:14.801 --> 01:23:16.930
<v Speaker 18>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 18>head and I guess he's,</v>

1679
01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:18.093
<v Speaker 18>I thought he was out completely.</v>
<v Speaker 18>I guess it was just that he was forced </v>

1680
01:23:20.381 --> 01:23:21.214
<v Speaker 18>out as the chairman.</v>
<v Speaker 18>He still owns 29% of the company while </v>

1681
01:23:24.701 --> 01:23:27.180
<v Speaker 18>he was on the board of directors and </v>
<v Speaker 18>then they booted him.</v>

1682
01:23:27.181 --> 01:23:28.300
<v Speaker 18>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 18>And so he,</v>

1683
01:23:28.301 --> 01:23:32.110
<v Speaker 18>he's still got his,</v>
<v Speaker 18>his claws in it a little bit.</v>

1684
01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:33.010
<v Speaker 18>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 18>but they're,</v>

1685
01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:34.520
<v Speaker 18>they're trying real hard to get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 18>him.</v>

1686
01:23:34.521 --> 01:23:38.980
<v Speaker 18>I love his papa John who is the man.</v>
<v Speaker 18>You mean pop a boner</v>

1687
01:23:39.670 --> 01:23:42.990
<v Speaker 1>and usurp power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got that meme.</v>

1688
01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:44.110
<v Speaker 1>I saw this man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1689
01:23:44.130 --> 01:23:45.720
<v Speaker 1>I really think the y'all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1690
01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:49.680
<v Speaker 1>this kind of says it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't trust anybody.</v>

1691
01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:50.993
<v Speaker 1>Even yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens when Papa John Tries to </v>

1692
01:23:54.961 --> 01:23:59.520
<v Speaker 1>execute?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Papa John's thought provoking.</v>

1693
01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:01.843
<v Speaker 18>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 18>It Dan,</v>

1694
01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:03.390
<v Speaker 18>what's next?</v>
<v Speaker 18>Some deep stuff.</v>

1695
01:24:03.410 --> 01:24:03.990
<v Speaker 18>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Uh,</v>

1696
01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:04.940
<v Speaker 18>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 18>What is next.</v>

1697
01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:06.450
<v Speaker 18>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 18>this is really cool.</v>

1698
01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:09.670
<v Speaker 18>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 18>so this week a,</v>

1699
01:24:09.671 --> 01:24:10.504
<v Speaker 18>a team of Italian researchers announced </v>
<v Speaker 18>that after analyzing some data for the </v>

1700
01:24:14.521 --> 01:24:15.354
<v Speaker 18>last two years,</v>
<v Speaker 18>they are saying with a high degree of </v>

1701
01:24:18.031 --> 01:24:23.031
<v Speaker 18>confidence that they have discovered a </v>
<v Speaker 18>lake of water on Mars.</v>

1702
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:27.420
<v Speaker 18>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 18>it is under the southern polar cap.</v>

1703
01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:29.900
<v Speaker 18>And I guess this is very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Um,</v>

1704
01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:32.790
<v Speaker 18>the reason they knew to look for this </v>
<v Speaker 18>specific thing is,</v>

1705
01:24:32.791 --> 01:24:36.220
<v Speaker 18>um,</v>
<v Speaker 18>there's these kinds of lakes in an class</v>

1706
01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:40.050
<v Speaker 18>here on earth in a very similar fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 18>And so they were using,</v>

1707
01:24:40.051 --> 01:24:40.884
<v Speaker 18>there's this European,</v>
<v Speaker 18>a space mission called the Mars Express </v>

1708
01:24:43.321 --> 01:24:44.154
<v Speaker 18>orbiter that was able to use ground </v>
<v Speaker 18>penetrating radar and they detected a </v>

1709
01:24:48.210 --> 01:24:50.370
<v Speaker 18>what looked like a lake,</v>
<v Speaker 18>but they weren't sure.</v>

1710
01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:52.410
<v Speaker 18>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 18>but again,</v>

1711
01:24:52.411 --> 01:24:54.450
<v Speaker 18>after a analyzing this for the last two </v>
<v Speaker 18>years,</v>

1712
01:24:54.510 --> 01:24:55.343
<v Speaker 18>they with a high degree of confidence </v>
<v Speaker 18>are able to say this is a wow 20 </v>

1713
01:24:59.281 --> 01:25:02.130
<v Speaker 18>kilometer wide lake sitting,</v>
<v Speaker 18>uh,</v>

1714
01:25:02.131 --> 01:25:06.120
<v Speaker 18>an amateur and a half under the ice cap.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Any estimate when we can get anything up</v>

1715
01:25:06.121 --> 01:25:07.640
<v Speaker 18>there to do some digging?</v>
<v Speaker 18>Yeah.</v>

1716
01:25:07.641 --> 01:25:09.090
<v Speaker 18>So I mean that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 18>It's,</v>

1717
01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:10.740
<v Speaker 18>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 18>that's still a ways off,</v>

1718
01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:11.613
<v Speaker 18>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 18>just because of the weight of all the </v>

1719
01:25:12.691 --> 01:25:13.800
<v Speaker 18>equipment you would need.</v>
<v Speaker 18>I mean,</v>

1720
01:25:13.801 --> 01:25:16.560
<v Speaker 18>you need a drill that can go almost a </v>
<v Speaker 18>mile straight,</v>

1721
01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:18.753
<v Speaker 1>thrilling when we can cut into that ice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if they find like there's two </v>

1722
01:25:24.271 --> 01:25:26.100
<v Speaker 1>options or there's three options,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

1723
01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:31.140
<v Speaker 1>One option is that they find life that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is identical and DNA to ours,</v>

1724
01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:34.020
<v Speaker 1>which could mean that life originated on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mars.</v>

1725
01:25:34.050 --> 01:25:34.883
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like a meteor impact or </v>

1726
01:25:36.961 --> 01:25:37.794
<v Speaker 1>something she sperm did onto earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the second option is that it's </v>

1727
01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:44.700
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Completely different.</v>

1728
01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:47.160
<v Speaker 1>The third options,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing there.</v>

1729
01:25:47.161 --> 01:25:49.980
<v Speaker 1>They're all fascinating and their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1730
01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:55.280
<v Speaker 1>The craziest one for me would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's completely a different origin of</v>

1731
01:25:55.681 --> 01:25:57.000
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1732
01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:57.953
<v Speaker 1>But if you do find life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the most likely would be </v>

1733
01:25:59.461 --> 01:26:01.620
<v Speaker 1>that it's the same Dna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like.</v>

1734
01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:02.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1735
01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:03.373
<v Speaker 18>And I think you're though that if it </v>
<v Speaker 18>were completely different from life on </v>

1736
01:26:05.961 --> 01:26:06.794
<v Speaker 18>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 18>that that won't be the coolest thing </v>

1737
01:26:07.731 --> 01:26:09.260
<v Speaker 18>because that just shows.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Okay.</v>

1738
01:26:09.261 --> 01:26:13.040
<v Speaker 18>So it developed completely independently</v>
<v Speaker 18>on two planets in the solar system.</v>

1739
01:26:13.041 --> 01:26:17.270
<v Speaker 18>That means it's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 18>How much you'd like to see.</v>

1740
01:26:17.271 --> 01:26:18.104
<v Speaker 18>Another alien life form that has a </v>
<v Speaker 18>completely different building blocks </v>

1741
01:26:21.291 --> 01:26:24.440
<v Speaker 18>would be late discovery of,</v>
<v Speaker 18>of the life.</v>

1742
01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:26.060
<v Speaker 18>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 18>I cannot wait for that.</v>

1743
01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:29.120
<v Speaker 18>That's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 18>God bless.</v>

1744
01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:31.340
<v Speaker 18>Really awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Really awesome stuff.</v>

1745
01:26:31.341 --> 01:26:32.600
<v Speaker 18>So good job.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Good job.</v>

1746
01:26:32.601 --> 01:26:35.330
<v Speaker 18>Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 18>[inaudible] killing it over there.</v>

1747
01:26:36.150 --> 01:26:37.670
<v Speaker 18>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 18>next up.</v>

1748
01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:40.460
<v Speaker 18>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 18>so I don't know if everybody,</v>

1749
01:26:40.461 --> 01:26:44.510
<v Speaker 18>I'm sure everybody's heard about this.</v>
<v Speaker 18>So James Gunn got fired from,</v>

1750
01:26:44.511 --> 01:26:46.820
<v Speaker 18>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 18>the guardians of the galaxy three.</v>

1751
01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:48.200
<v Speaker 18>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 18>because,</v>

1752
01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:51.200
<v Speaker 18>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 18>some old tweets got dug up from about 10</v>

1753
01:26:51.201 --> 01:26:55.850
<v Speaker 18>years ago of him making some pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 18>pretty distasteful.</v>

1754
01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:57.193
<v Speaker 18>What was,</v>
<v Speaker 18>what was the joke you have if you have </v>

1755
01:26:59.361 --> 01:26:59.870
<v Speaker 18>an example?</v>

1756
01:26:59.870 --> 01:27:01.800
<v Speaker 18>So I have one example.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Uh,</v>

1757
01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:05.480
<v Speaker 18>and in the words of the article,</v>
<v Speaker 18>this is from entertainment weekly.</v>

1758
01:27:05.530 --> 01:27:06.980
<v Speaker 18>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 18>this was one of the only ones that could</v>

1759
01:27:06.981 --> 01:27:07.814
<v Speaker 18>reprint.</v>
<v Speaker 18>So I can only imagine the rest were </v>

1760
01:27:09.051 --> 01:27:10.160
<v Speaker 18>pretty bad too.</v>
<v Speaker 18>This one,</v>

1761
01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:12.260
<v Speaker 18>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 18>was laughter is the best medicine.</v>

1762
01:27:12.261 --> 01:27:14.930
<v Speaker 18>That's why I laugh at people with AIDS.</v>

<v Speaker 18>find,</v>
<v Speaker 18>find the worst one.</v>

<v Speaker 18>They're out there.</v>

1776

<v Speaker 18>that's not the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 18>but here's the whole,</v>

<v Speaker 18>Um,</v>

1782
01:27:50.690 --> 01:27:54.470
<v Speaker 18>so basically what this all is,</v>
<v Speaker 18>is,</v>

1783
01:27:54.471 --> 01:27:55.100
<v Speaker 18>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 18>you know,</v>

1784
01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:55.933
<v Speaker 18>James Gunn,</v>
<v Speaker 18>he's pretty outspoken critic of trump </v>

1785
01:27:58.610 --> 01:27:59.560
<v Speaker 18>and,</v>
<v Speaker 18>um,</v>

1786
01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:04.280
<v Speaker 18>some this right wing group that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 18>like that he was talking all this shit,</v>

1787
01:28:04.370 --> 01:28:05.203
<v Speaker 18>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 18>decided to kind of troll through all of </v>

1788
01:28:06.891 --> 01:28:08.690
<v Speaker 18>his old tweets and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 18>And yeah,</v>

1789
01:28:08.691 --> 01:28:09.524
<v Speaker 18>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 18>I guess James Gunn has been on twitter </v>

1790
01:28:10.011 --> 01:28:12.560
<v Speaker 18>forever,</v>
<v Speaker 18>and so there was thousands and thousands</v>

1791
01:28:12.561 --> 01:28:13.394
<v Speaker 18>of these things and James Gunn,</v>
<v Speaker 18>if anybody knows anything about James </v>

1792
01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:17.240
<v Speaker 18>Gunn,</v>
<v Speaker 18>he,</v>

1793
01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:19.940
<v Speaker 18>he,</v>
<v Speaker 18>he's an edgy dude like that.</v>

1794
01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:21.073
<v Speaker 18>Everything before doing the guardians of</v>
<v Speaker 18>the galaxy movies that he's ever done </v>

1795
01:28:24.230 --> 01:28:27.590
<v Speaker 18>was pretty Raunchy.</v>
<v Speaker 18>What's the,</v>

1796
01:28:27.591 --> 01:28:30.170
<v Speaker 18>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 18>what's the headline?</v>

1797
01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:32.870
<v Speaker 18>So the headline is there's a campaign to</v>
<v Speaker 18>get him,</v>

1798
01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:33.753
<v Speaker 18>um,</v>
<v Speaker 18>to get him rehired that it was bullshit </v>

1799
01:28:35.871 --> 01:28:36.940
<v Speaker 18>that they fired him.</v>
<v Speaker 18>And,</v>

1800
01:28:36.941 --> 01:28:39.060
<v Speaker 18>and you know the fans,</v>
<v Speaker 18>they,</v>

1801
01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:40.580

1802
01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:41.443
<v Speaker 18>They think he's done a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 18>They don't care and they want them back </v>

1803
01:28:43.611 --> 01:28:44.300
<v Speaker 18>end.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Um,</v>

1804
01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:46.520
<v Speaker 18>as of yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 18>300,000</v>

1805
01:28:46.521 --> 01:28:49.010
<v Speaker 18>signatures in a matter of,</v>
<v Speaker 18>I think two or three days.</v>

1806
01:28:49.370 --> 01:28:50.910
<v Speaker 18>So Disney's,</v>
<v Speaker 18>that's like,</v>

1807
01:28:50.930 --> 01:28:52.370
<v Speaker 18>you have found a,</v>
<v Speaker 18>Oh yeah,</v>

1808
01:28:52.371 --> 01:28:53.270
<v Speaker 18>let's hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Give me more.</v>

1809
01:28:53.300 --> 01:28:56.450
<v Speaker 18>Give me the most cause that,</v>
<v Speaker 18>that wouldn't have got him fired.</v>

1810
01:28:56.510 --> 01:28:57.343
<v Speaker 18>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 18>so here's an I like when little boys </v>

1811
01:28:58.391 --> 01:29:02.910
<v Speaker 18>touch me in my silly place.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Another thing that's pretty cringy.</v>

1812
01:29:03.390 --> 01:29:04.230
<v Speaker 18>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 18>that's the thing.</v>

1813
01:29:04.231 --> 01:29:08.010
<v Speaker 18>None of these are even really that sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 18>It's really not funny at all.</v>

1814
01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:11.700
<v Speaker 18>The best thing about being raped is when</v>
<v Speaker 18>you're done being raped and it's like,</v>

1815
01:29:11.701 --> 01:29:13.410
<v Speaker 18>whew,</v>
<v Speaker 18>this feels great not being raped.</v>

1816
01:29:13.770 --> 01:29:15.300
<v Speaker 18>God,</v>
<v Speaker 18>can you imagine tweeting that?</v>

1817
01:29:15.940 --> 01:29:17.880
<v Speaker 18>It's like so embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Well,</v>

1818
01:29:17.881 --> 01:29:18.920
<v Speaker 18>and he's embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 18>I mean,</v>

1819
01:29:18.930 --> 01:29:20.790
<v Speaker 18>he said like,</v>
<v Speaker 18>I was an idiot.</v>

1820
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:22.230
<v Speaker 18>I was just trying to be edgy.</v>

1821
01:29:22.530 --> 01:29:24.810
<v Speaker 18>I'm not this person anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 18>10 years.</v>

1822
01:29:24.811 --> 01:29:25.644
<v Speaker 18>Think back 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 18>how much like of a person you can </v>

1823
01:29:27.211 --> 01:29:28.200
<v Speaker 18>change.</v>
<v Speaker 18>I mean,</v>

1824
01:29:28.201 --> 01:29:29.034
<v Speaker 18>the weird thing is like Disney hired </v>
<v Speaker 18>this guy who has a reputation and now </v>

1825
01:29:34.861 --> 01:29:37.530
<v Speaker 18>all the sudden they're shocked what </v>
<v Speaker 18>James Gunn,</v>

1826
01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:40.620
<v Speaker 18>this whole thing of firing someone for a</v>
<v Speaker 18>tweet they may 10 years ago.</v>

1827
01:29:40.630 --> 01:29:42.130
<v Speaker 18>So obscene.</v>
<v Speaker 18>And I,</v>

1828
01:29:42.150 --> 01:29:44.160
<v Speaker 18>and I think Disney now,</v>
<v Speaker 18>it's probably like,</v>

1829
01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:47.310
<v Speaker 18>maybe we were,</v>
<v Speaker 18>I don't know if they're regretting it,</v>

1830
01:29:47.311 --> 01:29:51.960
<v Speaker 18>but I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 18>I don't think a trillion signatures will</v>

1831
01:29:51.961 --> 01:29:55.860
<v Speaker 18>ever make Disney eat attack.</v>
<v Speaker 18>They'll never change their mind.</v>

1832
01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:57.360
<v Speaker 18>No.</v>
<v Speaker 18>And that's,</v>

1833
01:29:57.870 --> 01:29:59.390
<v Speaker 18>I doubt it too.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Um,</v>

1834
01:29:59.850 --> 01:30:02.250
<v Speaker 18>even if they got triple those,</v>
<v Speaker 18>what else?</v>

1835
01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:04.370
<v Speaker 18>Do you have any other tweets?</v>
<v Speaker 18>I actually enjoy,</v>

1836
01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:06.510
<v Speaker 18>there's a bunch of your,</v>
<v Speaker 18>what he says.</v>

1837
01:30:06.511 --> 01:30:07.480
<v Speaker 18>So,</v>
<v Speaker 18>um,</v>

1838
01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:08.633
<v Speaker 18>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 18>there's a maid's typical comments about </v>

1839
01:30:09.841 --> 01:30:12.270
<v Speaker 18>nine 11.</v>
<v Speaker 18>It's a holocaust.</v>

1840
01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:13.183
<v Speaker 18>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 18>just grabbed a monkey masturbating on a </v>

1841
01:30:14.671 --> 01:30:19.020
<v Speaker 18>young child and it was called Terry that</v>
<v Speaker 18>made him extremely happy.</v>

1842
01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:20.393
<v Speaker 18>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 18>it looks like those were the only ones </v>

1843
01:30:23.671 --> 01:30:24.504
<v Speaker 18>that they tweeted.</v>
<v Speaker 18>And then we'll just given kind of some </v>

1844
01:30:25.441 --> 01:30:27.630
<v Speaker 18>more examples of the type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 18>But again,</v>

1845
01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:28.653
<v Speaker 18>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 18>that's what's great.</v>

1846
01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:31.710
<v Speaker 18>Disney will not rehire him because you </v>
<v Speaker 18>know,</v>

1847
01:30:31.711 --> 01:30:33.490
<v Speaker 18>this is Disney and they haven't been </v>
<v Speaker 18>clean,</v>

1848
01:30:34.470 --> 01:30:37.860
<v Speaker 18>but why did they hire him in the first </v>
<v Speaker 18>place then everybody like,</v>

1849
01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:39.233
<v Speaker 18>did they not know who he was?</v>
<v Speaker 18>Companies are such fucking policies </v>

1850
01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:43.260
<v Speaker 18>these days.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Like,</v>

1851
01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:46.890
<v Speaker 18>like the minute they sniff controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Yeah.</v>

1852
01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:49.470
<v Speaker 18>It's like everybody shut the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 18>door.</v>

1853
01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:50.333
<v Speaker 18>You know what I mean?</v>

1854
01:30:51.100 --> 01:30:54.100
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

1855
01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:59.880
<v Speaker 1>this goes out to every company out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stick it about firing someone because</v>

1856
01:30:59.881 --> 01:31:04.881
<v Speaker 1>they did something offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1857
01:31:05.881 --> 01:31:06.714
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

1858
01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:12.020
<v Speaker 18>Technically the same company,</v>
<v Speaker 18>she got fired by ABC,</v>

1859
01:31:12.021 --> 01:31:14.260
<v Speaker 18>which is Disney.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Disney owns everything.</v>

1860
01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:15.343
<v Speaker 18>Disney.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Disney owns like the butt plug that you </v>

1861
01:31:18.111 --> 01:31:21.470
<v Speaker 18>see and they have a butt plug brand.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Do they?</v>

1862
01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:22.700
<v Speaker 18>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 18>They own everything.</v>

1863
01:31:22.701 --> 01:31:23.534
<v Speaker 18>I don't know why you said Bob Plug,</v>
<v Speaker 18>but like they own Disney owns </v>

1864
01:31:26.211 --> 01:31:27.980

<v Speaker 18>Didn't they just buy out a huge company?</v>

1865
01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:29.990
<v Speaker 18>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 18>they're buying Fox.</v>

1866
01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:32.960
<v Speaker 18>They're trying to and it looks like it's</v>
<v Speaker 18>happening.</v>

1867
01:31:33.050 --> 01:31:34.760
<v Speaker 18>There was a little bit of a back and </v>
<v Speaker 18>forth.</v>

1868
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:37.040
<v Speaker 18>They were in a bidding war,</v>
<v Speaker 18>but there they're going to win his,</v>

1869
01:31:37.041 --> 01:31:38.800
<v Speaker 18>they're plucking Disney.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Disney.</v>

1870
01:31:38.830 --> 01:31:42.830
<v Speaker 18>When they own every company in America,</v>
<v Speaker 18>that's when,</v>

1871
01:31:43.190 --> 01:31:44.023
<v Speaker 18>that's when fascism will be here.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Cause you're not gonna be able to make </v>

1872
01:31:45.921 --> 01:31:47.160
<v Speaker 18>any jokes at all.</v>
<v Speaker 18>And then you,</v>

1873
01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:49.640
<v Speaker 18>you,</v>
<v Speaker 18>you work in a factory.</v>

1874

<v Speaker 18>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 18>it.</v>

1901
01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:55.000
<v Speaker 18>It's not good at all.</v>
<v Speaker 18>That's a shame.</v>

1902
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.490
<v Speaker 18>So that's an older one.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Um,</v>

01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:10.750
<v Speaker 18>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 18>that's a good question.</v>

1908
01:33:10.751 --> 01:33:13.420
<v Speaker 18>I mean they all have kind of their own </v>
<v Speaker 18>take on it to be fair.</v>

1909
01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:14.593
<v Speaker 18>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 18>but does anybody even give a shit about </v>

<v Speaker 18>Okay.</v>

1921
01:33:39.390 --> 01:33:40.223
<v Speaker 18>All right.</v>

<v Speaker 18>Look them up yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 18>everybody,</v>

<v Speaker 18>if you're curious.</v>

1924
01:33:43.330 --> 01:33:46.480
<v Speaker 18>I sense I sense this.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Yeah,</v>

1925
01:33:46.690 --> 01:33:48.280
<v Speaker 18>that's a lot of Robin Hood.</v>
<v Speaker 18>It's a lot of Robin Hood.</v>

1926
01:33:48.850 --> 01:33:49.920
<v Speaker 18>To be fair.</v>
<v Speaker 18>There's a lot of rabbinic.</v>

1927
01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:51.760
<v Speaker 18>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 18>next story.</v>

1928
01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:54.130
<v Speaker 18>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 18>this is actually like two weeks ago.</v>

1929
01:33:54.131 --> 01:33:55.160
<v Speaker 18>This is too good.</v>
<v Speaker 18>I mean,</v>

1930
01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:56.200
<v Speaker 18>we had to,</v>
<v Speaker 18>uh,</v>

1931
01:33:56.710 --> 01:33:58.440
<v Speaker 18>had to do it to them,</v>
<v Speaker 18>had to do it to him.</v>

1932
01:33:59.390 --> 01:34:04.030
<v Speaker 18>There was a flight in China that loss </v>
<v Speaker 18>pressure and dropped 20,000</v>

1933
01:34:04.031 --> 01:34:05.540
<v Speaker 18>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Um,</v>

1934
01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:08.740
<v Speaker 18>because the pilots were vaping in the </v>
<v Speaker 18>cockpit.</v>

1935
01:34:08.770 --> 01:34:10.680
<v Speaker 18>How does that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 18>What's the correlation?</v>

1936
01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:15.820
<v Speaker 18>So they were vaping and it got so full </v>
<v Speaker 18>or hotboxing the,</v>

1937
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:17.800
<v Speaker 18>they were hot boxing the cockpit.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Wow.</v>

1938
01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:18.693
<v Speaker 18>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 18>And,</v>

1939
01:34:19.330 --> 01:34:22.390
<v Speaker 18>and it got,</v>
<v Speaker 18>and basically they didn't want the vapor</v>

1940
01:34:22.391 --> 01:34:23.224
<v Speaker 18>to escape into the passenger cabin,</v>
<v Speaker 18>give away the fact that they were doing </v>

1941
01:34:26.441 --> 01:34:27.210
<v Speaker 18>this.</v>
<v Speaker 18>So,</v>

1942
01:34:27.210 --> 01:34:28.043
<v Speaker 18>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 18>the copilot tried to flip a switch that </v>

1943
01:34:30.071 --> 01:34:33.430
<v Speaker 18>would keep the air from cycling into the</v>
<v Speaker 18>rest of the cabin,</v>

1944
01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:35.200
<v Speaker 18>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 18>and hit the wrong button,</v>

1945
01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:37.160
<v Speaker 18>which depressurized the cabinet.</v>

1946
01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:40.330
<v Speaker 18>Why is there a button to depressurize </v>
<v Speaker 18>the cabin?</v>

1947
01:34:40.331 --> 01:34:43.300
<v Speaker 18>Midflight anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 18>that seems like a little danger.</v>

1948
01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:44.143
<v Speaker 18>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 18>I mean maybe there's some preventative </v>

1949
01:34:46.001 --> 01:34:47.950
<v Speaker 18>thing that they need to do that </v>
<v Speaker 18>occasionally for,</v>

1950
01:34:47.951 --> 01:34:49.210
<v Speaker 18>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 18>but yeah,</v>

1951
01:34:49.211 --> 01:34:51.640
<v Speaker 18>I guess it was right next to the other </v>
<v Speaker 18>switch and it was so,</v>

1952
01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:55.540
<v Speaker 18>so much fucking Dank vape smoke in there</v>
<v Speaker 18>that they,</v>

1953
01:34:55.541 --> 01:34:56.374
<v Speaker 18>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 18>hit the wrong button and just had to </v>

1954
01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:02.240
<v Speaker 18>kind of barrel down all the oxygen mask </v>
<v Speaker 18>drops and uh,</v>

1955
01:35:02.241 --> 01:35:05.030
<v Speaker 18>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 18>so maybe nation,</v>

1956
01:35:05.031 --> 01:35:05.864
<v Speaker 18>the air over in China,</v>
<v Speaker 18>are they executed when they land in </v>

1957
01:35:08.181 --> 01:35:09.530
<v Speaker 18>China?</v>
<v Speaker 18>I mean,</v>

1958
01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:11.690
<v Speaker 18>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 18>it is China.</v>

1959
01:35:11.691 --> 01:35:13.130
<v Speaker 18>So let's just say that.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Um,</v>

1960
01:35:13.190 --> 01:35:17.780
<v Speaker 18>nobody's heard from these vape natures.</v>
<v Speaker 18>I hope wherever you are,</v>

1961
01:35:17.781 --> 01:35:20.300
<v Speaker 18>you're vaping in heaven now,</v>
<v Speaker 18>but everyone's okay.</v>
