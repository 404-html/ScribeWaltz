54
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.513
<v Speaker 3>people who won donated large amounts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there was one person that won a big </v>

<v Speaker 3>not to be outdone.</v>

68
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.083

<v Speaker 3>powerful moments I think in live </v>

69
00:03:17.661 --> 00:03:22.190
<v Speaker 3>broadcasting history when Justin pepper </v>
<v Speaker 3>sprayed joey salads and the face.</v>

79
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:47.740
<v Speaker 4>continue to do this and hopefully the </v>
<v Speaker 4>numbers that we raised grow,</v>

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.560
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>like one wheel.</v>

86
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.390
<v Speaker 4>Well I guess it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those things are dangerous but some sort</v>

<v Speaker 3>if he dies this year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are we going to do next year?</v>

93

<v Speaker 3>sort of DNA that we can clone him </v>

99
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.450
<v Speaker 3>because that technology is probably not </v>
<v Speaker 3>too far down the line.</v>

199
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.410
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so post Malone,</v>

200
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.950
<v Speaker 3>this was smashed just last weekend</v>

201
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.570
<v Speaker 2>during his show at rolling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loud,</v>

202
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.780
<v Speaker 2>signed and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and dedicated.</v>

203
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.080
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I truly believe a valuable part of music</v>

204
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:07.980
<v Speaker 2>history that we will frame </v>
<v Speaker 2>professionally and sent to the winter.</v>

205
00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:09.540
<v Speaker 2>So this is really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

206
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:13.260
<v Speaker 2>an amazing donation by post malone who </v>
<v Speaker 2>we think very much next up.</v>

207
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.200
<v Speaker 2>This is something amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Justin,</v>

208
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.073
<v Speaker 2>why don't you go ahead and explain?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a rick and morty episode number </v>

209
00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:21.480
<v Speaker 2>one side by just rolling.</v>

210
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:22.541
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a comma.</v>

211
00:09:22.541 --> 00:09:24.600
<v Speaker 6>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's the first issue comic,</v>

212
00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.860
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the cover I did and then I had seen,</v>

213
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.210
<v Speaker 6>I grabbed harmon to sign it and I signed</v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

214
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.370
<v Speaker 6>So you valued this at,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

215
00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:33.204
<v Speaker 6>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like on Ebay they go for all </v>

216
00:09:34.621 --> 00:09:37.740
<v Speaker 6>different ranges of amounts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've,</v>

217
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:41.310
<v Speaker 6>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've seen themselves for like $5,000</v>

218
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:42.173
<v Speaker 6>and that's what that might be the most </v>
<v Speaker 6>I've seen itself without the signature </v>

219
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:47.490
<v Speaker 6>of the creators,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like 2000 1500.</v>

220
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:48.031
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

221
00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:50.460
<v Speaker 6>but honestly I think that's the low,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's weird.</v>

222
00:09:50.461 --> 00:09:52.380
<v Speaker 6>I haven't looked in a while so I don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>know valuable.</v>

223
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.200
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty valuable on the Ada.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But with the two sick,</v>

224
00:09:55.201 --> 00:09:58.470
<v Speaker 6>with both of both of our signatures,</v>
<v Speaker 6>definitely pretty rare.</v>

225
00:09:58.471 --> 00:09:59.640
<v Speaker 6>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel like that should,</v>

226
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.690
<v Speaker 6>that should be,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a good one to two to raffle.</v>

227
00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:04.620
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's there.</v>

228
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:06.160
<v Speaker 6>That isn't a premium premium price.</v>

229
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.160
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead and tell us about this because </v>
<v Speaker 2>this also your fans have been going,</v>

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.960
<v Speaker 6>And there was so difficult to make it so</v>
<v Speaker 6>expensive that Disney was just like,</v>

239
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.943
<v Speaker 6>we're making 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>of these and we are never going to do </v>

240
00:10:37.151 --> 00:10:37.984
<v Speaker 6>this nonsense again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like we can't even believe that anybody </v>

241
00:10:40.871 --> 00:10:41.704
<v Speaker 6>would buy these because they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>expensive and rare and hard to get </v>

242
00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:44.680
<v Speaker 6>ahold.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they only made a few.</v>

243
00:10:44.681 --> 00:10:47.680
<v Speaker 6>And then once they were done,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like for the past year and a half,</v>

244
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:48.543
<v Speaker 6>my entire twitter feed every day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just people like where can I get </v>

245
00:10:50.111 --> 00:10:50.944
<v Speaker 6>another gravity falls during number </v>
<v Speaker 6>three special edition cause there and I </v>

246
00:10:52.931 --> 00:10:54.130
<v Speaker 6>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're gone.</v>

247
00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.710
<v Speaker 6>There's not another single one left on </v>
<v Speaker 6>the planet earth.</v>

248
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:59.560
<v Speaker 6>There's only one left that I have and </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's mine and I'm not selling it.</v>

249
00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:00.663
<v Speaker 6>And then I was going through my stuff </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I found one final journal number </v>

250
00:11:04.721 --> 00:11:07.030
<v Speaker 6>three special edition.</v>
<v Speaker 6>These have gone on Ebay.</v>

251
00:11:07.031 --> 00:11:09.520
<v Speaker 6>I've seen them go for 4,005</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jesus Christ.</v>

252
00:11:09.521 --> 00:11:10.354
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

253
00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:14.170
<v Speaker 6>And this one is rarer than those because</v>
<v Speaker 6>May,</v>

254
00:11:14.171 --> 00:11:16.600
<v Speaker 6>the reason this exists is because this </v>
<v Speaker 6>was a test.</v>

255
00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.970
<v Speaker 6>This was the very first test printing of</v>
<v Speaker 6>this book,</v>

256
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.073
<v Speaker 6>just to see if it would all work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I think there might be like a few </v>

257
00:11:21.791 --> 00:11:24.700
<v Speaker 6>like typos in there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it's like it's a first,</v>

258
00:11:24.701 --> 00:11:25.930
<v Speaker 6>first edition.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

259
00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.000
<v Speaker 6>It's unlabeled.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's like when you get a normal one,</v>

260
00:11:28.001 --> 00:11:30.280
<v Speaker 6>it's like one out of 10,008</v>
<v Speaker 6>out of 10,000.</v>

261
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.680
<v Speaker 6>This isn't even labeled.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's off the grid.</v>

262
00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.620
<v Speaker 6>It's the rarest journal number that is a</v>
<v Speaker 6>real collectible.</v>

263
00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:39.700
<v Speaker 6>That is a real heroes right here folks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

264
00:11:39.701 --> 00:11:40.870
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so yeah,</v>

265
00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.250
<v Speaker 6>just like everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

266
00:11:42.251 --> 00:11:43.150
<v Speaker 6>one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>$1,</v>

267
00:11:43.151 --> 00:11:45.880
<v Speaker 6>one raffle ticket for $1,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could win this.</v>

268
00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:47.720
<v Speaker 6>It's totally possible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

269
00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.150
<v Speaker 6>but I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd hedge my bets,</v>

270
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 6>maybe throw some more data.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The throw in like</v>

271
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.110
<v Speaker 7>half the value of what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what it would sell on Ebay for.</v>

272
00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.930
<v Speaker 7>What do you think that would sell on </v>
<v Speaker 7>Ebay for considering it's one of a kind.</v>

273
00:11:59.931 --> 00:12:00.764
<v Speaker 7>I couldn't say.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's been like a year since any </v>

274
00:12:02.381 --> 00:12:04.030
<v Speaker 7>of these were available.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

275
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.810
<v Speaker 7>but not to mention that's literally a </v>
<v Speaker 7>production that's like the first one off</v>

276
00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:08.490
<v Speaker 7>the presses.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

277
00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:09.323
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like when they make a stamp and </v>

278
00:12:09.851 --> 00:12:12.850
<v Speaker 7>there's like a misprint,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe only one of those.</v>

279
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.390
<v Speaker 7>Those are incredibly collectable,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like the,</v>

280
00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.040
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that stuff is accurate and I value it at</v>

281
00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:18.874
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's like a prototype toy or </v>

282
00:12:19.541 --> 00:12:20.710
<v Speaker 7>something.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I won't lie.</v>

283
00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:21.813
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if like signing it would </v>

284
00:12:22.781 --> 00:12:23.614
<v Speaker 7>make it less valuable if I should just </v>
<v Speaker 7>include a signature with it or </v>

285
00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:27.010
<v Speaker 7>something.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Cause I don't want to mess.</v>

286
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:29.050
<v Speaker 7>Why don't we,</v>
<v Speaker 7>why don't we ask the winter?</v>

287
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:30.620
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We know what to choose.</v>

288
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:35.170
<v Speaker 7>Signed or not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>[inaudible] is not a bad thing.</v>

289
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.030
<v Speaker 7>I can't imagine the winter being like </v>
<v Speaker 7>don't,</v>

290
00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:42.410

<v Speaker 3>So these are the last ones.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And then we have some,</v>

378
00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:26.023
<v Speaker 3>I know teddy fresh one off samples of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things we've tried and then decided not </v>

379
00:16:29.871 --> 00:16:30.704
<v Speaker 3>to go out.</v>

380
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.560
<v Speaker 3>Like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me show something like,</v>

381
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:37.030
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have the sweater.</v>

382
00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.890
<v Speaker 3>We made these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this happy like that sweater.</v>

383
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.590
<v Speaker 3>And so we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we tested one an orange.</v>

384
00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.630
<v Speaker 3>That's one of a kind that only exists </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

385
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.600
<v Speaker 3>We have one in blue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are ones that we sampled but never</v>

386
00:16:47.601 --> 00:16:48.980
<v Speaker 3>went ahead with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This one's in blue.</v>

387
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.120
<v Speaker 3>That one actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty good.</v>

388
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.691
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really,</v>

389
00:16:50.691 --> 00:16:52.160
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why he didn't go.</v>

390
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.030
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe you might want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>reconsider them.</v>

391
00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.040
<v Speaker 3>Reconsider.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it won't be that rare breed.</v>

392
00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.500
<v Speaker 3>There's like this was another sample.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is one of a kind.</v>

393
00:17:00.501 --> 00:17:03.080
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't exist anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's official teddy fresh.</v>

394
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:07.400
<v Speaker 3>This one was a really interesting story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got this sample and then when I,</v>

395
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:11.060
<v Speaker 3>when we tried it on and took it off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we really liked how the inside looked.</v>

396
00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:15.530
<v Speaker 3>You can kind of see that's how we ended </v>
<v Speaker 3>up making the rainbow one,</v>

397
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:19.250
<v Speaker 3>the new one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is basically,</v>

398
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:21.920
<v Speaker 3>it was based on the inside of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>sweater.</v>

399
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:22.970
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>

400
00:17:22.971 --> 00:17:25.310
<v Speaker 3>We liked it better inside out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well let's just do that.</v>

401
00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:26.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>what happened here in California as just</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of rich people lost their </v>

<v Speaker 7>don't care about like you can carry </v>
<v Speaker 7>around everything you've ever touched in</v>

555
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.260
<v Speaker 8>you're never going to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Even if you bring it,</v>

556
00:23:48.261 --> 00:23:49.094
<v Speaker 8>like how much shit is in your house </v>
<v Speaker 8>there that you will never even think </v>

557
00:23:51.951 --> 00:23:52.910
<v Speaker 8>about.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If it was gone,</v>

558
00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.620
<v Speaker 8>you wouldn't even notice.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

559
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:56.540
<v Speaker 8>I liked who were arguing for like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

560
00:23:56.541 --> 00:23:58.750
<v Speaker 8>it doesn't matter if you lose all your </v>
<v Speaker 8>stuff in front of this mountaintop.</v>

561
00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:01.400
<v Speaker 8>People losing their entire house.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 8>if you had a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

564
00:24:03.411 --> 00:24:07.400
<v Speaker 8>The difference between having everything</v>
<v Speaker 8>just blinked out is horrific.</v>

565
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:09.920
<v Speaker 8>Got a lot of media.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Does anyone know how these started?</v>

566
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:13.020
<v Speaker 8>These fires?</v>
<v Speaker 8>How did the campfire start?</v>

567
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.410
<v Speaker 8>Dan Fires,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

568
00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.453
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the problem is that it's just so windy </v>

569
00:24:18.051 --> 00:24:19.100
<v Speaker 8>and dry.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

570
00:24:19.101 --> 00:24:20.880
<v Speaker 8>It's the combination.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like you,</v>

571
00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:23.270
<v Speaker 8>if you breathe wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 8>some brush,</v>

572
00:24:23.271 --> 00:24:24.104
<v Speaker 8>you start a wildfire or it's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's a thing that's happening every </v>

573
00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:31.640
<v Speaker 8>single year now getting worse and worse.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The campfire specifically we believe was</v>

574
00:24:31.641 --> 00:24:35.500
<v Speaker 8>started by our friends at PG and e </v>
<v Speaker 8>company,</v>

575
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:38.570
<v Speaker 8>mother fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But like I said,</v>

576
00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.810
<v Speaker 8>you could almost just like take a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a spicy shit and start a fire.</v>

577
00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.131
<v Speaker 8>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But yeah,</v>

578
00:24:43.131 --> 00:24:44.230
<v Speaker 8>some of their equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

579
00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:47.240
<v Speaker 8>overloaded and caused the spark and </v>
<v Speaker 8>that's what started it.</v>

580
00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.890
<v Speaker 8>I shouldn't eat.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Why chewing into the mix.</v>

581
00:24:51.891 --> 00:24:55.190
<v Speaker 8>People talk shit about it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We'll talk good about me.</v>

582
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:58.870
<v Speaker 8>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The problem is that he was,</v>

583
00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.370
<v Speaker 8>a lack of rain was,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they're amazing.</v>

584
00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:05.000
<v Speaker 8>There's no rain.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The Santa Ana's,</v>

585
00:25:05.001 --> 00:25:08.210

<v Speaker 3>That is one of the greatest things I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever seen.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You guys know this thing's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely viral.</v>

866
00:38:26.581 --> 00:38:29.550
<v Speaker 3>Five 15 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was supposed to only a couple of days</v>

867
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:31.530
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is mark rope rubber.</v>

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:32.940
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to love this.</v>

869
00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.530
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] can tell them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've seen this,</v>

870
00:38:35.531 --> 00:38:36.430
<v Speaker 3>Alex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it.</v>

871
00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:38.800
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as you guys know,</v>

872
00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:39.693
<v Speaker 3>box theft is a huge problem today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People going up to your head and </v>

873
00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:44.663
<v Speaker 3>especially around the holiday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go up to your door and they steal </v>

874
00:38:46.661 --> 00:38:47.494
<v Speaker 3>your package.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this guy was tired of this happening </v>

875
00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.273
<v Speaker 3>and what he devised was a bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a glitter bomb to go off with a camera </v>

876
00:38:57.130 --> 00:39:00.670
<v Speaker 3>in the box so he could record there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had the wrong people get called.</v>

877
00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:02.530
<v Speaker 3>Now this is going to cut it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now this guy,</v>

878
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:06.730
<v Speaker 3>this guy is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was as a former NASA engineer.</v>

879
00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.600
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like being sent to Mars.</v>

880
00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.760
<v Speaker 7>It's half with the wrong guy.</v>

881
00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:12.541
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

882
00:39:12.541 --> 00:39:13.520
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly right.</v>

883
00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:17.890
<v Speaker 3>Having fun making glitter bomb packages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So great.</v>

884
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:22.760
<v Speaker 3>He does this a bunch of times and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>captures just unbelievable footage.</v>

885
00:39:22.761 --> 00:39:23.594
<v Speaker 3>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

886
00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:27.210
<v Speaker 10>I may be biased,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but sometimes in your design,</v>

887
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:28.103
<v Speaker 7>and it doesn't just throw it up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>literally four cameras capturing live </v>

888
00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:33.060
<v Speaker 7>and it also has,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

889
00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.790
<v Speaker 7>barb on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but as a fart bomb also the fart bomb is</v>

890
00:39:35.791 --> 00:39:36.960
<v Speaker 7>just incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 7>First,</v>

891
00:39:36.961 --> 00:39:39.300
<v Speaker 7>the glitter shoots out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This has been really hard bump shoots at</v>

892
00:39:39.301 --> 00:39:40.134
<v Speaker 7>like every 30 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So they have to get rid of it when they </v>

893
00:39:42.331 --> 00:39:43.164
<v Speaker 7>realized,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because at first they're going to be </v>

894
00:39:44.011 --> 00:39:44.311
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Hey,</v>

895
00:39:44.311 --> 00:39:45.870
<v Speaker 7>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then it keeps going.</v>

896
00:39:45.871 --> 00:39:48.090
<v Speaker 7>So amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the,</v>

897
00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:50.600
<v Speaker 7>and then the best thing about this is </v>
<v Speaker 7>that I expose,</v>

898
00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:53.220
<v Speaker 7>this guy's got to mass produce these and</v>
<v Speaker 7>sell them.</v>

899
00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:54.093
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was about to say I would buy it the </v>

900
00:39:55.561 --> 00:40:00.090
<v Speaker 7>most fine grained glitter in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Impossible to get out of carpet.</v>

901
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:02.150
<v Speaker 10>[inaudible] package has been moved off </v>
<v Speaker 10>the property.</v>

902
00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.850
<v Speaker 10>So I put it out on the porch and now all</v>
<v Speaker 10>that was left to do</v>

903
00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:07.440
<v Speaker 3>what's his weight and he could have done</v>
<v Speaker 3>a better wrapping job.</v>

904
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.983
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So I was at work and I got a </v>

905
00:40:09.861 --> 00:40:12.770
<v Speaker 10>notification that the geo fence we set </v>
<v Speaker 10>up had been tripped.</v>

906
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:15.710
<v Speaker 10>So then I checked the cameras and sure </v>
<v Speaker 10>enough the package has gone.</v>

907
00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:16.573
<v Speaker 10>So I checked the GPS and sort of tracked</v>
<v Speaker 10>it and it appears they're in a car </v>

908
00:40:19.971 --> 00:40:22.880
<v Speaker 10>because they seem to leave my house </v>
<v Speaker 10>pretty quickly off.</v>

909
00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:27.020
<v Speaker 10>It seems to stop in a parking garage,</v>
<v Speaker 10>which is where I'm headed to now.</v>

910
00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:29.300
<v Speaker 10>And if you're new here,</v>
<v Speaker 10>this isn't a prank channels.</v>

911
00:40:29.301 --> 00:40:31.580
<v Speaker 10>So I am completely out of my comfort </v>
<v Speaker 10>zone.</v>

912
00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:36.200
<v Speaker 10>Rubber by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 10>this legend and there she is.</v>

913
00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.590
<v Speaker 11>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>oh,</v>

914
00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:43.331
<v Speaker 10>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So,</v>

915
00:40:43.331 --> 00:40:46.560
<v Speaker 10>so,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so we're covering,</v>

916
00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:51.380
<v Speaker 10>it would still work even if I didn't get</v>
<v Speaker 10>the box back,</v>

917
00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:54.290
<v Speaker 10>the footage would upload to the cloud,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but it's just faster to plug the phones.</v>

918
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:57.440
<v Speaker 10>I'm gonna go home and find out what he </v>
<v Speaker 10>thought of everything,</v>

919
00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:58.633
<v Speaker 10>how I ended up here.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So it appears he was walking down the </v>

920
00:41:01.161 --> 00:41:03.380
<v Speaker 10>sidewalk and then suddenly makes a hard </v>
<v Speaker 10>left.</v>

921
00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:08.850
<v Speaker 10>They take these clothing,</v>
<v Speaker 10>actually makes it to this parking garage</v>

922
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.400
<v Speaker 10>where this glorious sequence unfold.</v>

923
00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.460
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 11>like four cameras.</v>

924
00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:16.663

<v Speaker 5>Literally like everywhere.</v>

931
00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.590
<v Speaker 5>My friend CC is also had some packages </v>

<v Speaker 6>me now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They did essentially.</v>

1067
00:48:57.550 --> 00:48:58.210

<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1069
00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:02.740
<v Speaker 6>I was working on the secret movie that I</v>
<v Speaker 6>guess I'm not allowed to talk about,</v>

1070
00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:03.593
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't even say,</v>

1071
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:06.340
<v Speaker 6>I can't even say what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

1072
00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:07.270
<v Speaker 6>it was big.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1074
00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:12.070

<v Speaker 6>it wasn't creatively.</v>

1075
00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:12.963
<v Speaker 6>And a Netflix made me a really amazing </v>
<v Speaker 6>offer to basically make anything in the </v>

<v Speaker 6>world I want,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is kind of an intimidating thing </v>

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1078

1164
00:52:23.491 --> 00:52:24.324
<v Speaker 6>I mean I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

1165
00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:26.120
<v Speaker 6>I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1166
00:52:26.121 --> 00:52:27.740
<v Speaker 6>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get that you are,</v>

1167
00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:29.090
<v Speaker 6>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm fat.</v>

1168
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:29.990
<v Speaker 6>I'm fat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1169
00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:32.080
<v Speaker 6>let's go over to judge.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean like keep,</v>

1170
00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:36.400
<v Speaker 6>keep like I can't talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why I was just ignored it.</v>

1171
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:38.660
<v Speaker 6>I just wanted to hear more about how do </v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

1172
00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:40.580
<v Speaker 6>cause you said you haven't like no </v>
<v Speaker 6>rules,</v>

1173
00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:43.190
<v Speaker 6>you can do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was still hard to you.</v>

1174
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:45.450
<v Speaker 6>You have to come up with something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1175
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:46.303
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1176
00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:47.091
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like my,</v>

1177
00:52:47.091 --> 00:52:47.924
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everyone has like a different creative </v>

1178
00:52:48.501 --> 00:52:49.310
<v Speaker 6>process I guess.</v>

1179
00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:50.143
<v Speaker 6>Like for me I kind of do like my own </v>
<v Speaker 6>like mental hunger games where like I'm </v>

1180
00:52:53.121 --> 00:52:55.310
<v Speaker 6>constantly coming up with like different</v>
<v Speaker 6>variations.</v>

1181
00:52:55.311 --> 00:52:58.190
<v Speaker 6>Like when I came up with gravity falls,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I actually came up with three TV shows.</v>

1182
00:52:58.460 --> 00:52:59.293
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I pitched like three shows to </v>

1183
00:52:59.991 --> 00:53:01.520
<v Speaker 6>Disney.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

1184
00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:04.730
<v Speaker 6>one was about time traveling dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the other two were terrible.</v>

1185
00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:06.500
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it literally was,</v>

1186
00:53:06.501 --> 00:53:07.334
<v Speaker 6>I'm not making that up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was going to be my other show if </v>

1187
00:53:09.801 --> 00:53:11.540
<v Speaker 6>they had picked that up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But so like I just like,</v>

1188
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:12.463
<v Speaker 6>like fill a sketchbook with like lots </v>
<v Speaker 6>and lots of characters and situations </v>

1189
00:53:15.591 --> 00:53:16.424
<v Speaker 6>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then I like kind of compete them </v>

1190
00:53:17.301 --> 00:53:18.860
<v Speaker 6>against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In my mind I'm like,</v>

1191
00:53:18.861 --> 00:53:21.500
<v Speaker 6>which one is delighting me more today?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

1192
00:53:21.501 --> 00:53:22.334
<v Speaker 6>And then like make a little like power </v>
<v Speaker 6>bracket of my own ideas for myself and </v>

1193
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.730
<v Speaker 6>then like show like maybe a few people </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1194
00:53:26.731 --> 00:53:27.690
<v Speaker 6>what do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what do you think?</v>

1195
00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:28.440
<v Speaker 6>And then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>

1196
00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:29.273
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is the thing I want to spend a </v>

1197
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:32.220
<v Speaker 6>bunch of years on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So is that what kind of what you've been</v>

1198
00:53:32.221 --> 00:53:32.731
<v Speaker 6>doing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1199
00:53:32.731 --> 00:53:33.564
<v Speaker 6>that's what I've been doing and I've </v>
<v Speaker 6>like finally narrowed it down to some </v>

1200
00:53:35.641 --> 00:53:37.700
<v Speaker 6>really exciting stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

1201
00:53:37.770 --> 00:53:41.040
<v Speaker 6>I'm like stoked on and come up with your</v>
<v Speaker 6>arm timeline.</v>

1202
00:53:41.041 --> 00:53:43.480
<v Speaker 6>Like deadlines or do you have deadlines?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

1203
00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:44.880
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's kind of like,</v>

1204
00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:48.840
<v Speaker 6>it's like sort of the wild west over </v>
<v Speaker 6>there right now because it's brand new,</v>

1205
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:50.940
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But they're like very supportive.</v>

1206
00:53:50.941 --> 00:53:51.774
<v Speaker 6>Like they have,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have deadlines and they have like </v>

1207
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:55.050
<v Speaker 6>their producers structure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But within that,</v>

1208
00:53:55.051 --> 00:53:56.010
<v Speaker 6>like the very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all the cart,</v>

1209
00:53:56.011 --> 00:53:58.590
<v Speaker 6>like you can be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey this is a different kind of thing.</v>

1210
00:53:58.591 --> 00:53:59.424
<v Speaker 6>I want to try something else and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 6>we put more time here and they're so </v>

1211
00:54:03.211 --> 00:54:04.044
<v Speaker 6>open to it.</v>

1212
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.033
<v Speaker 6>Like it's also like there's no </v>
<v Speaker 6>commercials so you can make episodes </v>

1213
00:54:07.321 --> 00:54:08.500
<v Speaker 6>like longer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Super interesting.</v>

1214
00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:10.380
<v Speaker 6>Do you don't have to think like I was so</v>
<v Speaker 6>used to like,</v>

1215
00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:11.850
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if it's two seconds over,</v>

1216
00:54:11.851 --> 00:54:13.980
<v Speaker 6>Disney is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you've got to find those two seconds.</v>

1217
00:54:13.981 --> 00:54:15.270
<v Speaker 6>And here it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whoa.</v>

1218
00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:16.163
<v Speaker 6>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't have to worry about act </v>

1219
00:54:16.771 --> 00:54:17.730
<v Speaker 6>breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1220
00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:20.010
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a different world man.</v>

1221
00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:21.180
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's really,</v>

1222
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:24.060
<v Speaker 6>and the executives they are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do they give you notes?</v>

1223
00:54:24.061 --> 00:54:26.340
<v Speaker 6>Cause probably Disney's all up your ass </v>
<v Speaker 6>with notes.</v>

1224
00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:27.203
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1225
00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:30.810
<v Speaker 6>the executives basically are just like a</v>
<v Speaker 6>first audience so far.</v>

1226
00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.730
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like they're really cool.</v>

1227
00:54:32.731 --> 00:54:34.440
<v Speaker 6>They just want to see something that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>funny.</v>

1228
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:35.303
<v Speaker 6>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the traditional development </v>

1229
00:54:36.991 --> 00:54:37.824
<v Speaker 6>model and television is network spend a </v>
<v Speaker 6>crap load of money developing like one </v>

1230
00:54:41.581 --> 00:54:45.180
<v Speaker 6>or two projects that they like put all </v>
<v Speaker 6>their hopes in and they promote the shit</v>

1231
00:54:45.181 --> 00:54:46.980
<v Speaker 6>out of him and then if they're not </v>
<v Speaker 6>immediately hits the,</v>

1232
00:54:46.981 --> 00:54:47.814
<v Speaker 6>cancel them.</v>

1233
00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:48.990
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1234
00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:50.370
<v Speaker 6>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's not good for anybody.</v>

1235
00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.233
<v Speaker 6>That's like putting way too much </v>
<v Speaker 6>pressure on every single project where </v>

1236
00:54:53.110 --> 00:54:54.990
<v Speaker 6>it's like the new kind of streaming </v>
<v Speaker 6>pipeline.</v>

1237
00:54:54.991 --> 00:54:55.824
<v Speaker 6>Like the way Netflix does it is like </v>
<v Speaker 6>we're just going to empower a bunch of </v>

1238
00:54:58.081 --> 00:54:58.914
<v Speaker 6>creators who we think have something </v>
<v Speaker 6>cool and we're going to make smaller </v>

1239
00:55:01.231 --> 00:55:04.050
<v Speaker 6>seasons and put them all out there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if people watch it,</v>

1240
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:05.970
<v Speaker 6>you get more episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if people don't,</v>

1241
00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:07.500
<v Speaker 6>we're not picking up for a second </v>
<v Speaker 6>season,</v>

1242
00:55:07.501 --> 00:55:09.120
<v Speaker 6>but those episodes aren't going </v>
<v Speaker 6>anywhere,</v>

1243
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:10.350
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1244
00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:11.730
<v Speaker 6>so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's almost like,</v>

1245
00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:13.920
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like low risk,</v>

1246
00:55:13.921 --> 00:55:15.840
<v Speaker 6>high reward,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

1247
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:17.790
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it like content.</v>

1248
00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:19.490
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they want it on demand.</v>

1249
00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:22.650
<v Speaker 6>Lots of content and lots of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just kidding.</v>

1250
00:55:22.651 --> 00:55:24.420
<v Speaker 6>It's a little scary.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's like so much shit.</v>

1251
00:55:24.421 --> 00:55:25.710
<v Speaker 6>There's so much shit on streaming.</v>

1252
00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:28.860
<v Speaker 6>It's weird to be making tv in an era </v>
<v Speaker 6>where there's never been more television</v>

1253
00:55:28.861 --> 00:55:31.290
<v Speaker 6>in history and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how are people going to notice?</v>

1254
00:55:31.291 --> 00:55:34.080
<v Speaker 6>But I feel like good stuff is still </v>
<v Speaker 6>recognized.</v>

1255
00:55:34.081 --> 00:55:36.840
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like definitely there's so much junk out</v>

1256
00:55:36.841 --> 00:55:38.550
<v Speaker 6>there with it when like something really</v>
<v Speaker 6>hits or something,</v>

1257
00:55:39.110 --> 00:55:40.170
<v Speaker 6>it's not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1258
00:55:40.171 --> 00:55:42.960
<v Speaker 6>I remember that there was that show,</v>
<v Speaker 6>high profits,</v>

1259
00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:45.100
<v Speaker 6>that show was so fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1260
00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.220
<v Speaker 6>I've never even heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No one's heard about it.</v>

1261
00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.300
<v Speaker 6>The critters profit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>

1262
00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:52.060
<v Speaker 6>it's a reality show or it's like more of</v>
<v Speaker 6>a documentary.</v>

1263
00:55:52.061 --> 00:55:54.960
<v Speaker 6>It's done like documentary series.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's not like cheap,</v>

1264
00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:55.853
<v Speaker 6>it's not like a cheap reality show.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like a well produced documentary </v>

1265
00:55:59.071 --> 00:56:04.071
<v Speaker 6>series about this couple that opened up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1266
00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:05.363
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'd store on the main strip and </v>

1267
00:56:06.511 --> 00:56:08.430
<v Speaker 6>Colorado in this town in Colorado.</v>

1268
00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:11.640
<v Speaker 6>This is like ski town and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 6>fascinating man.</v>

1269
00:56:11.641 --> 00:56:13.080
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so all the picking it up,</v>

1270
00:56:13.081 --> 00:56:14.910
<v Speaker 6>I'm greenlighting it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's on Netflix.</v>

1271
00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:17.160
<v Speaker 6>Oh wait.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it was bringing it back,</v>

1272
00:56:17.161 --> 00:56:19.200
<v Speaker 6>but it was originally on like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like CNN,</v>

1273
00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:22.410
<v Speaker 6>CNBC or msnbc or one of these other </v>
<v Speaker 6>channels.</v>

1274
00:56:22.411 --> 00:56:26.160
<v Speaker 6>Sort of these deep cut channels.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And in their first wave of,</v>

1275
00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:27.520
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're going to make original stuff,</v>

1276
00:56:27.521 --> 00:56:30.220
<v Speaker 6>but nobody only,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1277
00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:32.110
<v Speaker 6>everyone only knows us for our news </v>

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:23.980
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank God.</v>

1856
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:26.120
<v Speaker 3>Because I was going to fire an intern if</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1857
01:19:26.121 --> 01:19:29.530
<v Speaker 3>if I had a mispronounced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1858
01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:32.490
<v Speaker 3>so thank you so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1859
01:19:33.970 --> 01:19:34.803
<v Speaker 3>now since we got you here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you can tell us a little bit </v>

1860
01:19:36.731 --> 01:19:37.511
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1861
01:19:37.511 --> 01:19:42.511
<v Speaker 3>how the money we raise affects you guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>and specifically how it goes to help the</v>

1862
01:19:43.301 --> 01:19:46.090
<v Speaker 3>people who lost their homes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything and the wildfires.</v>

1863
01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:48.490
<v Speaker 12>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 12>first of all,</v>

1864
01:19:48.490 --> 01:19:50.610
<v Speaker 12>I really can't thank you enough for what</v>
<v Speaker 12>you're doing.</v>

1865
01:19:50.611 --> 01:19:51.840
<v Speaker 12>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1866
01:19:51.841 --> 01:19:52.674
<v Speaker 12>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 12>He had a lot of attention at the time </v>

1867
01:19:53.731 --> 01:19:56.010
<v Speaker 12>and then there's so much news coming at </v>
<v Speaker 12>people,</v>

1868
01:19:56.011 --> 01:20:00.030
<v Speaker 12>it's easy to forget.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So I think what direct relief does every</v>

1869
01:20:00.030 --> 01:20:00.863
<v Speaker 12>day is try to work to make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 12>their health services available for </v>

1870
01:20:04.081 --> 01:20:06.540
<v Speaker 12>people who need them and can afford </v>
<v Speaker 12>them.</v>

1871
01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:07.583
<v Speaker 12>And on an everyday basis we work with </v>
<v Speaker 12>the local nonprofit community health </v>

1872
01:20:12.091 --> 01:20:13.190
<v Speaker 12>centers,</v>
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>

1873
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:16.470
<v Speaker 12>free and charitable clinics all around </v>
<v Speaker 12>the United States.</v>

1874
01:20:16.471 --> 01:20:18.300
<v Speaker 12>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>we're based in California.</v>

1875
01:20:18.301 --> 01:20:21.600
<v Speaker 12>So that's where we started.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So that's typically where we plug in and</v>

1876
01:20:21.601 --> 01:20:23.460
<v Speaker 12>in Butte county.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And um,</v>

1877
01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:26.130
<v Speaker 12>just like last year in Sonoma,</v>
<v Speaker 12>Napa when the fires hit,</v>

1878
01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:29.070
<v Speaker 12>these places that serve people who are </v>
<v Speaker 12>vulnerable,</v>

1879
01:20:29.071 --> 01:20:31.920
<v Speaker 12>even on a good day is where we plug in.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Cause there's such,</v>

1880
01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:33.870
<v Speaker 12>so deeply rooted in the communities.</v>

1881
01:20:33.870 --> 01:20:36.510
<v Speaker 12>And unfortunately I think,</v>
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>

1882
01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:39.240
<v Speaker 12>what happened in paradise was just kind </v>
<v Speaker 12>of unprecedented.</v>

1883
01:20:39.241 --> 01:20:40.780
<v Speaker 12>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 12>again,</v>

1884
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:45.460
<v Speaker 12>it caught us by surprise here in this </v>
<v Speaker 12>kind of new abnormal mistake and kind of</v>

1885
01:20:45.461 --> 01:20:47.020
<v Speaker 12>the devastation that just,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1886
01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:49.530
<v Speaker 12>cause a lot of deaths caused a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 12>people to flee.</v>

1887
01:20:49.531 --> 01:20:53.940
<v Speaker 12>So what we did is kind of what we do and</v>
<v Speaker 12>checked in from a health perspective,</v>

1888
01:20:53.941 --> 01:20:54.774
<v Speaker 12>what can we do immediately?</v>
<v Speaker 12>And ended up just rushing on daily </v>

1889
01:20:57.991 --> 01:20:58.824
<v Speaker 12>deliveries,</v>
<v Speaker 12>things from kind of the masks for the </v>

1890
01:21:01.141 --> 01:21:03.330
<v Speaker 12>smoke and the inhalers for people who </v>
<v Speaker 12>were,</v>

1891
01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:05.310
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>had breathing problems,</v>

1892
01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:07.420
<v Speaker 12>the oxygen concentrators,</v>
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>

1893
01:21:07.421 --> 01:21:09.300
<v Speaker 12>that,</v>
<v Speaker 12>that seniors often need,</v>

1894
01:21:09.301 --> 01:21:11.880
<v Speaker 12>but particularly if they're evacuated </v>
<v Speaker 12>and putting a shelter,</v>

1895
01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:13.253
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and just basic drugs and things like </v>

1896
01:21:15.181 --> 01:21:16.014
<v Speaker 12>that up up.</v>
<v Speaker 12>All the evacuees ended up in these </v>

1897
01:21:18.211 --> 01:21:21.690
<v Speaker 12>temporary shelters and they all got hit </v>
<v Speaker 12>with the norovirus,</v>

1898
01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:26.780
<v Speaker 12>which is kind of this horrible disease </v>
<v Speaker 12>of like vomiting and diarrhea.</v>

1899
01:21:27.330 --> 01:21:29.580
<v Speaker 12>So it was just about as bad as you can </v>
<v Speaker 12>imagine.</v>

1900
01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:30.953
<v Speaker 12>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the people who we were working with who </v>

1901
01:21:32.501 --> 01:21:35.520
<v Speaker 12>were kind of staff from the hospital </v>
<v Speaker 12>that was burnt out,</v>

1902
01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:36.893
<v Speaker 12>they set up a clinic in the East Avenue </v>
<v Speaker 12>Church up in Chico and were just so on </v>

1903
01:21:40.681 --> 01:21:41.160
<v Speaker 12>it,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1904
01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:42.390
<v Speaker 12>just really,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1905
01:21:42.391 --> 01:21:45.360
<v Speaker 12>just working 24 hours a day with </v>
<v Speaker 12>nothing.</v>

1906
01:21:45.361 --> 01:21:46.194
<v Speaker 12>So that was kind of where we started.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And since then we've been continuing to </v>

1907
01:21:49.471 --> 01:21:50.304
<v Speaker 12>work with the kind of the local public </v>
<v Speaker 12>health officials who were kind of </v>

1908
01:21:53.011 --> 01:21:56.150
<v Speaker 12>overwhelmed and even the firefighters </v>
<v Speaker 12>and um,</v>

1909
01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:58.620
<v Speaker 12>kind of the first response teams that,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1910
01:21:58.621 --> 01:21:59.454
<v Speaker 12>they,</v>
<v Speaker 12>so many people got deployed from around </v>

1911
01:22:00.571 --> 01:22:03.980
<v Speaker 12>the state and we've worked with them a </v>
<v Speaker 12>lot and saw last year,</v>

1912
01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:08.700
<v Speaker 12>even here in Santa Barbara where we were</v>
<v Speaker 12>burned out and then had a debris flow,</v>

1913
01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:10.770
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>after five minutes of rain the hill came</v>

1914
01:22:10.771 --> 01:22:11.604
<v Speaker 12>down.</v>

1915
01:22:11.610 --> 01:22:14.130
<v Speaker 12>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>sometimes they need help for specialized</v>

1916
01:22:14.490 --> 01:22:17.340
<v Speaker 12>gear or just terrain vehicles.</v>
<v Speaker 12>They can go out and do the,</v>

1917
01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:18.673
<v Speaker 12>unfortunately in paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's the remain recovery and kind of </v>

1918
01:22:20.821 --> 01:22:22.800
<v Speaker 12>identifying that.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So we're working with all of them.</v>

1919
01:22:22.801 --> 01:22:24.380
<v Speaker 12>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1920
01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:29.400
<v Speaker 12>we get money like what you're raising </v>
<v Speaker 12>for a particular place.</v>

1921
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:32.070
<v Speaker 12>It's for that place.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's not for director leaf.</v>

1922
01:22:32.071 --> 01:22:32.491
<v Speaker 12>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1923
01:22:32.491 --> 01:22:37.020
<v Speaker 12>we look at ourselves as trustees and </v>
<v Speaker 12>make sure that the people know that it's</v>

1924
01:22:37.021 --> 01:22:38.370
<v Speaker 12>there.</v>
<v Speaker 12>The money's going.</v>

1925
01:22:38.730 --> 01:22:40.200
<v Speaker 12>If they want us to buy something for </v>
<v Speaker 12>him,</v>

1926
01:22:40.201 --> 01:22:41.034
<v Speaker 12>if money is needed,</v>
<v Speaker 12>we'll transfer the funds and we've </v>

1927
01:22:43.561 --> 01:22:44.394
<v Speaker 12>already started committing funds to some</v>
<v Speaker 12>of the local groups that are just doing </v>

1928
01:22:47.461 --> 01:22:49.110
<v Speaker 12>such good work,</v>
<v Speaker 12>nothing.</v>

<v Speaker 12>and we're in a position where we can </v>

1930

<v Speaker 6>we were talking about how you guys have </v>
<v Speaker 6>this like amazing rating,</v>

1947
01:23:33.490 --> 01:23:38.110
<v Speaker 6>like you're number one in terms of its </v>
<v Speaker 6>transparency and I just was curious like</v>

1948
01:23:38.111 --> 01:23:40.570
<v Speaker 6>what goes into that kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>

1952
01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:47.520
<v Speaker 12>a lot of it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1953
01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:49.030
<v Speaker 12>what you'd expect.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I mean,</v>

1954
01:23:49.031 --> 01:23:49.864
<v Speaker 12>how much money did you spend on </v>
<v Speaker 12>fundraising to get the money that you </v>

1955
01:23:52.781 --> 01:23:55.600
<v Speaker 12>received?</v>
<v Speaker 12>And that's a big point of contention.</v>

1956
01:23:55.601 --> 01:23:56.920
<v Speaker 12>People don't,</v>
<v Speaker 12>generous,</v>

1957
01:23:56.921 --> 01:23:57.754
<v Speaker 12>big surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 12>They don't like sending a dollar in and </v>

1958
01:23:59.591 --> 01:24:02.110
<v Speaker 12>having half of it's sent back on the </v>
<v Speaker 12>mail that they're going to throw away.</v>

1959
01:24:02.111 --> 01:24:04.990
<v Speaker 12>So we've never done that.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I mean I think our model has been,</v>

1960
01:24:04.991 --> 01:24:07.220
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>we work out of a warehouse and um,</v>

1961
01:24:07.450 --> 01:24:09.300
<v Speaker 12>kind of functionally what we do is,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1962
01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:12.090
<v Speaker 12>it's a distribution center so we can,</v>
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>

1963
01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:15.520
<v Speaker 12>we have to have specialized licensing </v>
<v Speaker 12>for the medications that we hold,</v>

1964
01:24:15.521 --> 01:24:18.940
<v Speaker 12>but it's all provided free of charge.</v>
<v Speaker 12>We encourage companies to,</v>

<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>make their products available at no </v>

1966
01:24:21.731 --> 01:24:24.010

<v Speaker 12>we will handle them as well.</v>

1967
01:24:24.011 --> 01:24:24.844
<v Speaker 12>And with all the same accreditation that</v>
<v Speaker 12>any pharmacy or chain drugstore would </v>

1968
01:24:28.961 --> 01:24:29.140
<v Speaker 12>use.</v>

1969
01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:31.060
<v Speaker 12>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 12>we have the same accreditation that,</v>

1970
01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:32.553
<v Speaker 12>to handle these things.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But that's kind of the dilemma we're in </v>

1971
01:24:34.871 --> 01:24:36.000
<v Speaker 12>as a society,</v>
<v Speaker 12>right?</v>

1972
01:24:36.001 --> 01:24:36.834
<v Speaker 12>Cause if you have money,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you're very well served and people </v>

1973
01:24:38.381 --> 01:24:39.970
<v Speaker 12>target you,</v>
<v Speaker 12>they know a lot about you,</v>

1974
01:24:39.971 --> 01:24:43.030
<v Speaker 12>they know your preferences.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And if you're not a consumer,</v>

1975
01:24:43.810 --> 01:24:44.643
<v Speaker 12>you're kind of off the grid.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So I think what we're trying to do in </v>

1976
01:24:47.141 --> 01:24:47.974
<v Speaker 12>general,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's just bring that level of kind of </v>

1977
01:24:50.261 --> 01:24:53.410
<v Speaker 12>efficiency in delivery of services to </v>
<v Speaker 12>people.</v>

1978
01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:56.080
<v Speaker 12>Not because there's any,</v>
<v Speaker 12>we do it for free.</v>

1979
01:24:56.081 --> 01:24:56.914
<v Speaker 12>So there's no profit incentive.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But we know that it can be done well </v>

1980
01:24:59.411 --> 01:25:02.540
<v Speaker 12>with these tools that exist </v>
<v Speaker 12>technologically and that,</v>

1981
01:25:02.541 --> 01:25:04.780
<v Speaker 12>so they can,</v>
<v Speaker 12>that's everyday trying to bring,</v>

1982
01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:05.713
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>kind of the resources that exist and </v>

1983
01:25:07.241 --> 01:25:08.074
<v Speaker 12>efficient way to the people who need </v>
<v Speaker 12>them and can't afford them for health </v>

1984
01:25:10.871 --> 01:25:11.621
<v Speaker 12>services.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You know?</v>

1985
01:25:11.621 --> 01:25:12.454
<v Speaker 12>And,</v>
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>

1986
01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:15.400
<v Speaker 12>it's pretty basic and,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but we have big gaps.</v>

1987
01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:19.900
<v Speaker 12>Even like California,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the richest state in the richest country</v>

1988
01:25:19.901 --> 01:25:22.690
<v Speaker 12>in the history of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And yet,</v>

1989
01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:23.703
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>we have kind of a big problems that are </v>

1990
01:25:25.031 --> 01:25:26.140
<v Speaker 12>chronic,</v>
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>

1991
01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:27.033
<v Speaker 12>up and down the state.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And so I think what we can do as a </v>

1992
01:25:28.961 --> 01:25:32.260
<v Speaker 12>private group is we're not political,</v>
<v Speaker 12>we're not religious,</v>

1993
01:25:32.261 --> 01:25:33.094
<v Speaker 12>but just deal with the people that we </v>
<v Speaker 12>know are deeply committed in their own </v>

1994
01:25:35.741 --> 01:25:37.150
<v Speaker 12>communities and try to say,</v>
<v Speaker 12>look,</v>

1995
01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:38.073
<v Speaker 12>how can we help?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Let's see if we can put together a </v>

1996
01:25:39.881 --> 01:25:44.770
<v Speaker 12>structure that's going to serve you well</v>
<v Speaker 12>and get your patients stuff that we know</v>

1997
01:25:44.771 --> 01:25:46.330
<v Speaker 12>they can't afford.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Cause it's expensive,</v>

1998
01:25:46.331 --> 01:25:50.710
<v Speaker 12>whether it's insulin or an inhaler,</v>
<v Speaker 12>things that if you don't have,</v>

1999
01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:52.960
<v Speaker 12>you will get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 12>stay sicker,</v>

2000
01:25:53.090 --> 01:25:53.923
<v Speaker 12>skits,</v>
<v Speaker 12>stay sicker longer and often die sooner </v>

2001
01:25:56.501 --> 01:25:59.290
<v Speaker 12>then just because of your financial </v>
<v Speaker 12>status.</v>

2002
01:25:59.291 --> 01:26:00.850
<v Speaker 12>And I don't think anyone wants that,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but,</v>

2003
01:26:01.330 --> 01:26:02.200
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

2004
01:26:02.201 --> 01:26:05.600
<v Speaker 12>I think we just are so committed to </v>
<v Speaker 12>really help these,</v>

2005
01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:07.290
<v Speaker 12>you see these people up in beauty.</v>

2006
01:26:07.470 --> 01:26:09.140
<v Speaker 12>Like they were reluctant and we said,</v>
<v Speaker 12>look,</v>

2007
01:26:09.141 --> 01:26:11.180
<v Speaker 12>we've received money.</v>
<v Speaker 12>This is for you.</v>

2008
01:26:11.181 --> 01:26:14.990
<v Speaker 12>We want to spend to give you $50,000.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Cause I personally was up there,</v>

2009
01:26:14.991 --> 01:26:16.760
<v Speaker 12>I delivered the insulin when they needed</v>
<v Speaker 12>it.</v>

2010
01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:18.073
<v Speaker 12>I drove up there and um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and I wanted to see them and let them </v>

2011
01:26:20.361 --> 01:26:20.901
<v Speaker 12>know.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's like,</v>

2012
01:26:20.901 --> 01:26:21.734
<v Speaker 12>look,</v>
<v Speaker 12>there's a lot of people pulling for you </v>

2013
01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:25.950
<v Speaker 12>and this is what we can do.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But you know,</v>

2014
01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:26.863
<v Speaker 12>we said,</v>
<v Speaker 12>look,</v>

2015
01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:29.060
<v Speaker 12>how are you paying for this?</v>
<v Speaker 12>You guys are working for free.</v>

2016
01:26:29.061 --> 01:26:30.290
<v Speaker 12>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 12>oh,</v>

2017
01:26:30.291 --> 01:26:31.550
<v Speaker 12>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>we're okay.</v>

2018
01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.310
<v Speaker 12>That seems like too much money,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

2019
01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:36.020
<v Speaker 12>$50,000</v>
<v Speaker 12>to,</v>

2020
01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:36.890
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>take care of a,</v>

2021
01:26:36.891 --> 01:26:37.724
<v Speaker 12>basically a standup hospital and clinic </v>
<v Speaker 12>for hundreds of people who had no other </v>

2022
01:26:41.271 --> 01:26:42.104
<v Speaker 12>options.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So,</v>

2023
01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:43.880
<v Speaker 12>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 12>they were really reluctant to take it.</v>

2024
01:26:43.881 --> 01:26:44.870
<v Speaker 12>And we said,</v>
<v Speaker 12>look,</v>

2025
01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:46.233
<v Speaker 12>it's for you.</v>
<v Speaker 12>We have to give it to you were a </v>

2026
01:26:47.511 --> 01:26:50.480
<v Speaker 12>trustee.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But that reluctance of,</v>

2027
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:53.630
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>kind of acceptance because you know,</v>

2028
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:57.920
<v Speaker 12>the concern that there may be someone </v>
<v Speaker 12>else who needs it more was,</v>

2029
01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:01.940
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>quite touching and inspiring and sad and</v>

2030
01:27:01.941 --> 01:27:04.280
<v Speaker 12>a lot of ways too.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So anyway,</v>

2031
01:27:04.281 --> 01:27:05.114
<v Speaker 12>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's a privilege for us to do it and to </v>

2032
01:27:06.861 --> 01:27:09.830
<v Speaker 12>have people like you and your audiences </v>
<v Speaker 12>and I'll,</v>

2033
01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:10.733
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>amazingly talented people on the </v>

2034
01:27:12.801 --> 01:27:14.750
<v Speaker 12>creative side.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Um,</v>

2035
01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:18.710
<v Speaker 12>it means a lot to pull together and help</v>
<v Speaker 12>folks like that.</v>

2036
01:27:18.711 --> 01:27:20.960
<v Speaker 12>And so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 12>sorry,</v>

2037
01:27:20.961 --> 01:27:21.794
<v Speaker 12>that was a long answer.</v>

2038
01:27:23.650 --> 01:27:25.010
<v Speaker 12>I appreciate it though</v>

2039
01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:27.783
<v Speaker 2>here that the idea that the money is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to is actually going to be </v>

2040
01:27:32.050 --> 01:27:34.750
<v Speaker 2>legitimately on the front lines and </v>
<v Speaker 2>helping a bunch of people.</v>

2041
01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:35.633
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno when I'm donating to something </v>

2042
01:27:37.181 --> 01:27:37.970
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>

2044
01:27:39.730 --> 01:27:40.563
<v Speaker 2>We're all very cynical and skeptical in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this world that actually get you on the </v>

2045
01:27:43.691 --> 01:27:44.524
<v Speaker 2>phone and hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can hear your music is very </v>

<v Speaker 8>the most famous episode,</v>

2196
01:34:11.171 --> 01:34:12.004
<v Speaker 8>one of the most famous episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Here's the red it didn't that win the </v>

2197
01:34:14.201 --> 01:34:14.991
<v Speaker 8>Emmy pickled.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 8>that's,</v>

2199
01:34:15.731 --> 01:34:16.564
<v Speaker 8>that's an actual record draft.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So there could be like should auction </v>

2200
01:34:20.201 --> 01:34:22.640
<v Speaker 8>off your emmy man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It could be writing in there,</v>

2201
01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:26.210
<v Speaker 8>there might be notes in there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I just grabbed it.</v>

2202
01:34:26.211 --> 01:34:27.010
<v Speaker 8>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was like,</v>

2203
01:34:27.010 --> 01:34:30.310
<v Speaker 8>cause we keep everything.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So like that's a drafted,</v>

2204
01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:33.790
<v Speaker 8>someone had it at the record.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There were multiple records.</v>

2205
01:34:33.791 --> 01:34:34.624
<v Speaker 8>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What do you think there's any </v>

2206
01:34:35.051 --> 01:34:36.940
<v Speaker 8>differences in this draft between the </v>
<v Speaker 8>this,</v>

2207
01:34:36.941 --> 01:34:37.774
<v Speaker 8>and that's the other thing is these </v>
<v Speaker 8>scripts are going to be different than </v>

2208
01:34:41.921 --> 01:34:43.780
<v Speaker 8>the episodes that air,</v>
<v Speaker 8>cause they're in production.</v>

2209
01:34:43.780 --> 01:34:46.570
<v Speaker 8>So there's going to be dialogue in here </v>
<v Speaker 8>that no one's ever seen before.</v>

2210
01:34:46.571 --> 01:34:49.540
<v Speaker 8>Different jokes that you tried it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've never been out there.</v>

2211
01:34:49.541 --> 01:34:52.360
<v Speaker 8>It probably the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like there's another one,</v>

2212
01:34:52.510 --> 01:34:53.201
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

2213

<v Speaker 8>I Dunno.</v>

2216
01:34:58.670 --> 01:35:02.060
<v Speaker 8>But like there's another script that's </v>
<v Speaker 8>like going to be significantly different</v>

2217
01:35:02.061 --> 01:35:04.120
<v Speaker 8>than what era then one went through a </v>
<v Speaker 8>lot of changes in production.</v>

2218

<v Speaker 7>why don't,</v>

2312
01:38:53.411 --> 01:38:54.244
<v Speaker 7>why don't you guys just come in because </v>
<v Speaker 7>it's too complicated since someone into </v>

2313
01:38:56.840 --> 01:39:01.030
<v Speaker 7>right and we don't have to think about </v>
<v Speaker 7>it cause we will,</v>

2314
01:39:01.050 --> 01:39:02.510
<v Speaker 7>I want to entertain,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've got a lot of shit.</v>

2315
01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:07.520
<v Speaker 7>Haven't gotten to go to the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We'll wait here.</v>

2316
01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:08.453
<v Speaker 7>I got a question for Justin because I </v>
<v Speaker 7>was thinking about this the other day </v>

2317
01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:12.473
<v Speaker 7>cause I went into one of those like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>stores that like sell like a bunch of </v>

2318
01:39:15.811 --> 01:39:20.460
<v Speaker 7>like random shit from TV.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like when you guys make rick and Morty,</v>

2319
01:39:20.461 --> 01:39:24.030
<v Speaker 7>do you think about merchandise when </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're making it or is it just something</v>

2320
01:39:24.031 --> 01:39:25.420
<v Speaker 7>that happens?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2321
01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:26.333
<v Speaker 7>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean I have a very sort of toyetic </v>

2322
01:39:28.111 --> 01:39:28.944
<v Speaker 7>approach.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I hate to use that word because it's so </v>

2323
01:39:30.330 --> 01:39:31.163
<v Speaker 7>lame.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You are toys and you love your love </v>

2324
01:39:32.670 --> 01:39:33.180
<v Speaker 7>toys.</v>

2325
01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:36.040
<v Speaker 7>I have a very full of toys.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Your offices full of toys.</v>

2326
01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:38.340
<v Speaker 7>I over did that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But whatever.</v>

2327
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:39.300
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah I have like a,</v>

2328
01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:41.520
<v Speaker 7>I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have a toyetic approach to design.</v>

2329
01:39:41.850 --> 01:39:44.340
<v Speaker 7>So like I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I grew up loving toys.</v>

2330
01:39:44.670 --> 01:39:45.570
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm obsessed.</v>

2331
01:39:45.571 --> 01:39:48.620
<v Speaker 7>I've been obsessed with toys.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He has a lot of like merchant,</v>

2332
01:39:48.850 --> 01:39:50.640
<v Speaker 7>it's what it was like for,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>

2333
01:39:50.641 --> 01:39:52.680
<v Speaker 7>like season one,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we didn't know that that was going to be</v>

2334
01:39:52.681 --> 01:39:53.371
<v Speaker 7>the case.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2335
01:39:53.371 --> 01:39:54.204
<v Speaker 7>like no idea but still hoped best.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like best case dream is to have is to </v>

2336
01:39:57.991 --> 01:39:59.850
<v Speaker 7>have a single Rick Dahl is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

2337
01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:00.601
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

2338
01:40:00.601 --> 01:40:03.060
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I guess it's sort of like by default</v>

2339
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:08.940
<v Speaker 7>my design sense is like designing things</v>
<v Speaker 7>to feel like they,</v>

2340
01:40:08.941 --> 01:40:10.470
<v Speaker 7>like they would make cool toy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2341
01:40:10.471 --> 01:40:12.360
<v Speaker 7>like every character has that feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2342
01:40:12.361 --> 01:40:13.194
<v Speaker 7>like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's the holy grail is if you can </v>

2343
01:40:15.031 --> 01:40:17.520
<v Speaker 7>design characters that would make cool </v>
<v Speaker 7>action,</v>

2344
01:40:17.521 --> 01:40:17.990
<v Speaker 7>figure it out.</v>

2345
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:21.450
<v Speaker 7>Then now I'm on the same principles that</v>
<v Speaker 7>make a good cartoon design.</v>

2346
01:40:21.451 --> 01:40:23.580
<v Speaker 7>Make a good toy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like something that's simple,</v>

2347
01:40:23.590 --> 01:40:27.660
<v Speaker 7>that's bold there reads from a mile away</v>
<v Speaker 7>that clear in silhouette entertaining,</v>

2348
01:40:27.661 --> 01:40:31.350
<v Speaker 7>interesting contrasting shape demand.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you're making a fucking cartoon,</v>

2349
01:40:31.351 --> 01:40:34.200
<v Speaker 7>it's probably also going to be something</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's like really catchy as a toy.</v>

2350
01:40:34.290 --> 01:40:34.951
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

2351
01:40:34.951 --> 01:40:35.790
<v Speaker 7>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2352
01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:38.670
<v Speaker 7>For character design for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2353
01:40:38.790 --> 01:40:39.623
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All those rules apply for good toy </v>

2354
01:40:40.501 --> 01:40:41.670
<v Speaker 7>design.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So yeah,</v>

2355
01:40:41.671 --> 01:40:42.331
<v Speaker 7>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

2356
01:40:42.331 --> 01:40:46.790
<v Speaker 7>but I don't think it's been outright,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean they're there,</v>

2357
01:40:46.830 --> 01:40:47.663
<v Speaker 7>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's times where I'm thinking about </v>

2358
01:40:48.751 --> 01:40:49.441
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh man,</v>

2359
01:40:49.441 --> 01:40:50.640
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

2360
01:40:50.670 --> 01:40:52.860
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>certain things like rick's gone or like,</v>

2361
01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:55.900
<v Speaker 7>I like the portal gun was definitely not</v>
<v Speaker 7>a thing.</v>

2362
01:40:55.901 --> 01:40:58.330
<v Speaker 7>We were thinking about a toy for when we</v>
<v Speaker 7>made that.</v>

2363
01:40:58.390 --> 01:41:00.260
<v Speaker 7>You probably,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that made it a little bit like fancier.</v>

2364
01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:03.710
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

2365
01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:06.310
<v Speaker 7>totally aliens of them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You'd like make it a little bit.</v>

2366
01:41:06.311 --> 01:41:09.910
<v Speaker 7>That was definitely one that was not </v>
<v Speaker 7>even considered.</v>

2367
01:41:09.911 --> 01:41:11.770
<v Speaker 7>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but yeah,</v>

2368
01:41:11.950 --> 01:41:12.730
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but a lot,</v>

2369
01:41:12.730 --> 01:41:14.320
<v Speaker 7>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's been certain characters,</v>

2370
01:41:14.321 --> 01:41:18.010
<v Speaker 7>I'm trying to think of like a specific </v>
<v Speaker 7>thing I think that I think is gone maybe</v>

2371
01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:22.720
<v Speaker 7>or just a choice to like use a certain </v>
<v Speaker 7>gun a bunch of times or like go back.</v>

2372
01:41:22.750 --> 01:41:24.970
<v Speaker 7>Like we have so many guns design and </v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>

2373
01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.370
<v Speaker 7>Oh lets some of the cock sucker put </v>

<v Speaker 8>I mean I think,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think he's,</v>

3461
02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:33.280
<v Speaker 8>I think he's great.</v>

3462
02:27:33.600 --> 02:27:34.433
<v Speaker 5>It is his stance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when does he expect the to get to </v>

3463
02:27:36.630 --> 02:27:37.230
<v Speaker 5>here you go</v>

3464
02:27:37.230 --> 02:27:38.610
<v Speaker 8>watch the similarity.</v>

3465
02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:45.080
<v Speaker 5>It is slow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a straight up ripped off.</v>

3466
02:27:45.740 --> 02:27:47.740
<v Speaker 5>Carl though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that</v>

3467
02:27:48.780 --> 02:27:49.613
<v Speaker 8>fallen?</v>
<v Speaker 8>So the interesting question about this </v>

3468
02:27:52.370 --> 02:27:54.650
<v Speaker 8>and they're not just ripping off well </v>
<v Speaker 8>known dances.</v>

3469
02:27:54.651 --> 02:27:59.150
<v Speaker 8>There's little people who have invented </v>
<v Speaker 8>dances and dumb them very brilliantly at</v>

3470
02:27:59.151 --> 02:28:04.151
<v Speaker 8>fortnight is frame for frame stealing </v>
<v Speaker 8>their dances and now we're at,</v>

3471
02:28:05.150 --> 02:28:10.150
<v Speaker 8>we're at like 45 k and then fort night </v>
<v Speaker 8>is stealing their dances.</v>

3472
02:28:10.730 --> 02:28:14.510
<v Speaker 8>Like frame for frame and getting famous.</v>
<v Speaker 8>People are buying these dances.</v>

3473
02:28:14.540 --> 02:28:15.373
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>By making money off these people </v>

3474
02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:19.010
<v Speaker 8>property.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

3475
02:28:19.540 --> 02:28:22.100
<v Speaker 8>They're making of money</v>

3476
02:28:22.370 --> 02:28:23.203
<v Speaker 7>and they're not credited.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When's the last time you heard a legal </v>

3477
02:28:25.041 --> 02:28:27.800
<v Speaker 7>case like you did my dance,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's a,</v>

3478
02:28:27.801 --> 02:28:31.010
<v Speaker 7>it's a new,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's an area.</v>

3479
02:28:31.040 --> 02:28:33.670
<v Speaker 7>I think it's a brave new world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what,</v>

3480
02:28:33.720 --> 02:28:35.000
<v Speaker 7>well here's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>here's,</v>

3481
02:28:35.270 --> 02:28:37.590
<v Speaker 7>here's the issue with that because if,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's just say he,</v>

3482
02:28:37.820 --> 02:28:39.500
<v Speaker 7>I don't think he has any legal case for </v>
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

3483
02:28:39.501 --> 02:28:43.930
<v Speaker 7>but let's say he wins at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What stops him from copywriting,</v>

3484
02:28:43.931 --> 02:28:45.980
<v Speaker 7>all the videos of people doing the </v>
<v Speaker 7>debts.</v>

3485
02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:47.833
<v Speaker 7>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Between somebody who's monetize buckle </v>

3486
02:28:52.520 --> 02:28:57.520
<v Speaker 7>and end just asking for like millions.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3487
02:28:57.640 --> 02:28:58.473
<v Speaker 7>really,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know what,</v>

3488
02:28:58.490 --> 02:29:03.270
<v Speaker 7>here's why this is happening and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 7>want to say about this.</v>

3489
02:29:03.610 --> 02:29:04.443
<v Speaker 7>This is a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is a bit of a different probably </v>

3490
02:29:06.381 --> 02:29:08.540
<v Speaker 7>thing than what you were expecting to </v>
<v Speaker 7>hear.</v>

3491
02:29:08.541 --> 02:29:10.640
<v Speaker 7>That was a horribly constructed </v>
<v Speaker 7>sentence.</v>

3492
02:29:10.641 --> 02:29:12.420
<v Speaker 7>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

3493
02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:13.221
<v Speaker 7>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is,</v>

3494
02:29:13.221 --> 02:29:14.054
<v Speaker 7>this is proof that actors and people in </v>
<v Speaker 7>the entertainment industry are not as </v>

3495
02:29:18.351 --> 02:29:19.280
<v Speaker 7>rich as you think they are.</v>

3496
02:29:19.310 --> 02:29:20.143
<v Speaker 7>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like you're telling me this guide and </v>

3497
02:29:22.041 --> 02:29:24.110
<v Speaker 7>dancing with the stars isn't as rich as </v>
<v Speaker 7>I think.</v>

3498
02:29:24.140 --> 02:29:24.591
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

3499
02:29:24.591 --> 02:29:25.424
<v Speaker 7>I'm just saying like everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like you see a guy on a couple of </v>

3500
02:29:27.800 --> 02:29:29.240
<v Speaker 7>sitcoms and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh man,</v>

3501
02:29:29.241 --> 02:29:32.300
<v Speaker 7>I can't even imagine what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 7>mansion that person lives in.</v>

3502
02:29:32.750 --> 02:29:36.020
<v Speaker 7>And the reality is you get paid sag </v>
<v Speaker 7>scale.</v>

3503
02:29:36.021 --> 02:29:37.620
<v Speaker 7>I'm sure that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3504
02:29:37.700 --> 02:29:39.470
<v Speaker 7>what is the actor's name that played </v>
<v Speaker 7>Carlton?</v>

3505
02:29:39.471 --> 02:29:41.600
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to keep calling him Carlton</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I feel like that's,</v>

3506
02:29:41.660 --> 02:29:44.530
<v Speaker 7>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Shit I know is on it.</v>

3507
02:29:44.710 --> 02:29:45.411
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's funny,</v>

3508
02:29:45.411 --> 02:29:50.411
<v Speaker 7>even in his party phones Alphonso he,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know it from a,</v>

3509
02:29:50.690 --> 02:29:54.020
<v Speaker 7>that that food show on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because even in this guardian article,</v>

3510
02:29:54.080 --> 02:29:57.470
<v Speaker 7>they refer to him as the Prince French </v>
<v Speaker 7>French actor.</v>

3511
02:29:57.650 --> 02:29:59.840
<v Speaker 7>His name is Alfonzo.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

3512
02:29:59.860 --> 02:30:00.201
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3513
02:30:00.201 --> 02:30:01.700
<v Speaker 7>So Alfonso,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>

3514
02:30:01.701 --> 02:30:02.534
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he probably made a good chunk of money </v>

3515
02:30:03.621 --> 02:30:07.440
<v Speaker 7>and some residuals off of fresh prince </v>
<v Speaker 7>and he's them host.</v>

3516
02:30:07.490 --> 02:30:08.091
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he did.</v>

3517
02:30:08.091 --> 02:30:10.580
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he made a decent amount for sure.</v>

3518
02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.550
<v Speaker 7>And then I've seen him host a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 7>other shows and he's great.</v>

3519
02:30:13.730 --> 02:30:14.780
<v Speaker 7>He's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

3520
02:30:14.781 --> 02:30:15.614
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that's just like the fact that he </v>

3521
02:30:17.731 --> 02:30:20.270
<v Speaker 7>sees,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

3522
02:30:20.271 --> 02:30:21.120
<v Speaker 7>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he probably,</v>

3523
02:30:21.710 --> 02:30:23.840
<v Speaker 7>he probably believes he's completely in </v>
<v Speaker 7>the right.</v>

3524
02:30:23.870 --> 02:30:25.430
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's pretty much dead on.</v>

3525
02:30:25.431 --> 02:30:30.140
<v Speaker 7>It's exactly what they referenced.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This video.</v>

3526
02:30:30.141 --> 02:30:31.560
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That literally do it.</v>

3527
02:30:31.820 --> 02:30:33.410
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

3528
02:30:33.411 --> 02:30:34.640
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I get it.</v>

3529
02:30:34.641 --> 02:30:35.930
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I totally get it,</v>

3530
02:30:35.931 --> 02:30:36.770
<v Speaker 7>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3531
02:30:36.771 --> 02:30:39.860
<v Speaker 7>if he was just flush with money,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he wouldn't give a shit.</v>

3532
02:30:39.861 --> 02:30:40.221
<v Speaker 7>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

3533
02:30:40.221 --> 02:30:41.054
<v Speaker 7>I don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But because fortnights taking billion a </v>

3534
02:30:43.640 --> 02:30:44.750
<v Speaker 7>billion dollars a minute and it makes </v>
<v Speaker 7>sense.</v>

3535
02:30:44.870 --> 02:30:45.703
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because if this guy who's not that well </v>

3536
02:30:48.111 --> 02:30:49.040
<v Speaker 7>off,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>

3537
02:30:49.070 --> 02:30:49.641
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>these guys,</v>

3538
02:30:49.641 --> 02:30:52.370
<v Speaker 7>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm just jumping to the assault.</v>

3539
02:30:53.060 --> 02:30:56.930
<v Speaker 7>I think most people in the entertainment</v>
<v Speaker 7>industry who are actors,</v>

3540
02:30:57.320 --> 02:30:59.030
<v Speaker 7>they're not as rich as people think.</v>

3541
02:30:59.030 --> 02:30:59.863
<v Speaker 7>They are.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Definitely.</v>

3542
02:31:00.170 --> 02:31:01.340
<v Speaker 7>Particularly because the acting </v>
<v Speaker 7>acting's,</v>

3543
02:31:01.460 --> 02:31:02.293
<v Speaker 7>it's not a nine to five where you clock </v>
<v Speaker 7>in every single day after your Gig is </v>

3544
02:31:04.911 --> 02:31:05.744
<v Speaker 7>over.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're hustling,</v>

3545
02:31:05.810 --> 02:31:07.400
<v Speaker 7>CIG,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so between jobs,</v>

3546
02:31:07.510 --> 02:31:09.020
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you're not getting residuals,</v>

3547
02:31:09.021 --> 02:31:10.040
<v Speaker 7>you're literally not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Hey,</v>

3548
02:31:10.041 --> 02:31:13.220
<v Speaker 7>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a lot of times you're paid per episode,</v>

3549
02:31:13.430 --> 02:31:16.820
<v Speaker 7>so we're working a whole year and going </v>
<v Speaker 7>in every day,</v>

3550
02:31:16.821 --> 02:31:20.310
<v Speaker 7>but you're only getting paid for each </v>
<v Speaker 7>episode and each and every season,</v>

3551
02:31:20.450 --> 02:31:22.080
<v Speaker 7>depending on how many episodes are in a </v>
<v Speaker 7>season,</v>

3552
02:31:22.081 --> 02:31:23.940
<v Speaker 7>it's like the tree are not really making</v>
<v Speaker 7>that much.</v>

3553
02:31:24.210 --> 02:31:28.380
<v Speaker 7>Very small amount of people in </v>
<v Speaker 7>entertainment are actually rich.</v>

3554
02:31:28.950 --> 02:31:29.341
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3555
02:31:29.341 --> 02:31:32.640
<v Speaker 7>it's so funny because I used to pull,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you'll see on mainstream shows,</v>

3556
02:31:32.700 --> 02:31:33.533
<v Speaker 7>actors that you see on huge shows on </v>
<v Speaker 7>television are probably not even </v>

3557
02:31:37.411 --> 02:31:38.191
<v Speaker 7>millionaires.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3558
02:31:38.191 --> 02:31:40.710
<v Speaker 7>not anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Not even in the 90s.</v>

3559
02:31:40.711 --> 02:31:45.000
<v Speaker 7>It was like this big explosion of like </v>
<v Speaker 7>there was money in them there hills,</v>

3560
02:31:45.001 --> 02:31:46.320
<v Speaker 7>but now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

3561
02:31:46.620 --> 02:31:48.450
<v Speaker 7>and I used to think like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh man,</v>

3562
02:31:48.451 --> 02:31:49.470
<v Speaker 7>that's where the money's at.</v>

3563
02:31:49.980 --> 02:31:51.390
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and it's like,</v>

3564
02:31:51.391 --> 02:31:52.224
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean I feel like I'm more informed </v>

3565
02:31:53.041 --> 02:31:54.180
<v Speaker 7>now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

3566
02:31:54.181 --> 02:31:54.511
<v Speaker 7>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3567
02:31:54.511 --> 02:31:58.590
<v Speaker 7>there's not that much money and why he's</v>
<v Speaker 7>not splitting the pizza.</v>

3568
02:31:58.640 --> 02:32:03.640
<v Speaker 7>That's [inaudible] I saw you got two </v>
<v Speaker 7>bucks.</v>

3569
02:32:07.280 --> 02:32:08.113
<v Speaker 7>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I,</v>

3570
02:32:08.670 --> 02:32:11.220
<v Speaker 7>I have to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>where did you get them sharpies at?</v>

3571
02:32:11.820 --> 02:32:12.440
<v Speaker 7>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 7>go ahead.</v>

3572
02:32:12.440 --> 02:32:13.590

<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3573
02:32:13.591 --> 02:32:16.110
<v Speaker 7>at first I was saw that and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh great.</v>

3574
02:32:16.140 --> 02:32:16.973
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's ridiculous and silly that they </v>

3575
02:32:19.921 --> 02:32:24.120
<v Speaker 7>actually steal like frame for frame.</v>

<v Speaker 7>the welcome,</v>

3628
02:34:51.911 --> 02:34:56.860
<v Speaker 7>but I saw a thing where he admits to </v>
<v Speaker 7>borrowing that dance from someone else.</v>

3629
02:34:57.020 --> 02:34:59.140
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>anyone caught up on this?</v>

3630
02:34:59.141 --> 02:35:00.400

<v Speaker 7>Cause like,</v>

3631
02:35:00.401 --> 02:35:02.530
<v Speaker 7>well I'd rather you can use everything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well yeah,</v>

3632
02:35:03.790 --> 02:35:05.890
<v Speaker 7>because this is the dance that they </v>
<v Speaker 7>stole.</v>

3633
02:35:06.280 --> 02:35:08.590
<v Speaker 7>Well it depends if you went well.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3634
02:35:08.591 --> 02:35:09.640
<v Speaker 7>no you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's lit.</v>

3635
02:35:09.910 --> 02:35:12.670
<v Speaker 7>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the questions I have is,</v>

3636
02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:18.120
<v Speaker 7>was the dance inspired by someone else's</v>
<v Speaker 7>dad fired by something?</v>

3637
02:35:18.671 --> 02:35:22.570
<v Speaker 7>Know what I the only question,</v>
<v Speaker 7>literally the only question that matters</v>

3638
02:35:22.571 --> 02:35:24.940
<v Speaker 7>to me right now and you guys in back </v>
<v Speaker 7>should be able to help.</v>

3639
02:35:25.640 --> 02:35:30.430
<v Speaker 7>What's this?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What's this sole lawyer or a judge?</v>

3640
02:35:30.930 --> 02:35:32.830
<v Speaker 7>I think if,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if it does go to Cortland,</v>

3641
02:35:32.831 --> 02:35:35.260
<v Speaker 7>say he wins,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it opens up the door for like so</v>

3642
02:35:35.261 --> 02:35:40.261
<v Speaker 7>much bad things with copyrights because </v>
<v Speaker 7>it's similar.</v>

3643
02:35:42.011 --> 02:35:43.570
<v Speaker 7>That wasn't my identical,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>

3644
02:35:43.571 --> 02:35:46.300
<v Speaker 7>They could made it similar and I think </v>
<v Speaker 7>there's more to the dance.</v>

3645
02:35:46.301 --> 02:35:47.134
<v Speaker 7>They could have like given him a royal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think there's more to the dance </v>

3646
02:35:49.061 --> 02:35:49.894
<v Speaker 7>though.</v>

3647
02:35:51.830 --> 02:35:52.510
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you there?</v>

3648
02:35:52.510 --> 02:35:56.560
<v Speaker 7>I think it goes beyond grab seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 7>At a sink with them.</v>

3649
02:35:56.950 --> 02:35:57.670
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>look it up.</v>

3650
02:35:57.670 --> 02:36:00.190
<v Speaker 7>There's a longer one that that shows </v>
<v Speaker 7>more because if,</v>

3651
02:36:00.250 --> 02:36:04.090
<v Speaker 7>if you can copyright dance moves,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how far back?</v>

3652
02:36:04.970 --> 02:36:06.940
<v Speaker 7>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 7>why is her dancing in this game?</v>

3653

<v Speaker 7>I've never played 49.</v>

03:05:07.731 --> 03:05:08.564
<v Speaker 8>equal terms equally torturing to all,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all of us had a good idea of like a </v>

4275
03:05:11.691 --> 03:05:14.550
<v Speaker 8>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like some sort of competition and,</v>

<v Speaker 8>on it.</v>

4281
03:05:24.560 --> 03:05:26.750
<v Speaker 8>What can we do that involves US spending</v>

4504
03:14:36.460 --> 03:14:37.293

<v Speaker 8>we are as a species when it comes to </v>

4505
03:14:41.140 --> 03:14:44.290
<v Speaker 8>something as horrible as cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like,</v>

<v Speaker 8>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

4510
03:14:50.081 --> 03:14:52.000
<v Speaker 8>what else am I going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Maybe that'll work.</v>

4511
03:14:52.001 --> 03:14:53.380
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's just fucking depressed.</v>

4512

<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

4513
03:14:57.281 --> 03:15:00.490
<v Speaker 8>I believe Justin,</v>
<v Speaker 8>she's cured and she's still drinking her</v>

4514
03:15:00.491 --> 03:15:01.300
<v Speaker 8>peers.</v>
<v Speaker 8>All right,</v>

03:15:01.300 --> 03:15:02.580
<v Speaker 8>so don't be too sad.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

4516
03:15:02.650 --> 03:15:03.483
<v Speaker 8>she loves it.</v>

4517
03:15:05.410 --> 03:15:06.243
<v Speaker 21>Stage three and they took out 16 of my </v>
<v Speaker 21>lymph nodes found cancer in three of </v>

4518
03:15:10.601 --> 03:15:15.601
<v Speaker 21>them and do this and they told me with </v>
<v Speaker 21>the chemo I'd have a year to now.</v>

4519
03:15:18.140 --> 03:15:22.100
<v Speaker 22>Carrie decided against chemo instead </v>
<v Speaker 22>turning to urine therapy.</v>

4520
03:15:22.150 --> 03:15:22.983
<v Speaker 22>Is it working ancient and long </v>
<v Speaker 22>discounted practice to maintain health </v>

4521
03:15:25.700 --> 03:15:27.320
<v Speaker 22>ancient and long discounted.</v>

4522
03:15:28.550 --> 03:15:29.110
<v Speaker 23>Okay.</v>

4523
03:15:29.110 --> 03:15:29.943
<v Speaker 8>Is it,</v>

4524
03:15:30.360 --> 03:15:34.590
<v Speaker 22>does it work for four years later?</v>
<v Speaker 22>She still uses it to five years later.</v>

4525
03:15:34.591 --> 03:15:35.890
<v Speaker 22>He's crushing it.</v>
<v Speaker 22>She's alive.</v>

4526
03:15:36.160 --> 03:15:39.380
<v Speaker 22>She has never consulted a physician </v>
<v Speaker 22>about her unorthodox treat.</v>

4527
03:15:39.750 --> 03:15:42.780
<v Speaker 8>Wouldn't that be funny if the cure of </v>
<v Speaker 8>cancer was just actually this whole time</v>

4528
03:15:42.781 --> 03:15:43.614
<v Speaker 8>drinking your own piss,</v>

4737
03:23:20.890 --> 03:23:25.740
<v Speaker 6>like trying to talk about Disney is like</v>
<v Speaker 6>trying to talk about an entire country.</v>

4738
03:23:25.940 --> 03:23:28.770
<v Speaker 6>Like it's such a huge company that like </v>

<v Speaker 6>Google.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Like I mean for me,</v>

4746
03:23:38.371 --> 03:23:39.204
<v Speaker 6>like I was just working for the kids </v>
<v Speaker 6>channel and like the main problems </v>

4747
03:23:41.161 --> 03:23:43.650
<v Speaker 6>weren't Disney's fault.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were my fault for trying to work at</v>

4748
03:23:43.651 --> 03:23:44.484
<v Speaker 6>a kid's channel.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cause like that's not how my brain </v>

4749
03:23:46.021 --> 03:23:47.010
<v Speaker 6>naturally works.</v>

4750
03:23:47.250 --> 03:23:48.870
<v Speaker 6>And it was like one of these things </v>
<v Speaker 6>where they're like,</v>

4751
03:23:48.900 --> 03:23:50.040
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

4752
03:23:50.041 --> 03:23:51.180
<v Speaker 6>like Rad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then I was like,</v>

4753
03:23:51.210 --> 03:23:52.043
<v Speaker 6>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they won't let me use any of the funny </v>

4754
03:23:53.281 --> 03:23:55.910
<v Speaker 6>parts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you have a good example?</v>

4755
03:23:55.930 --> 03:23:59.130
<v Speaker 6>Is aware of stuff you would fight?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like hell yeah,</v>

4756
03:23:59.190 --> 03:23:59.761
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

<v Speaker 6>for gravity falls,</v>

4759
03:24:03.181 --> 03:24:06.930
<v Speaker 6>I printed out a giant list of all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>most bullshit snp notes that we ever got</v>

4760
03:24:06.931 --> 03:24:08.910
<v Speaker 6>and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we did a dramatic reading of them.</v>

4761
03:24:09.750 --> 03:24:10.583
<v Speaker 6>We had like somebody playing the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Moonlight Sonata in the background </v>

4762
03:24:12.061 --> 03:24:13.560
<v Speaker 6>because it was so depressing and I was </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

4763
03:24:13.600 --> 03:24:17.680
<v Speaker 6>I read my butt back and forth and </v>
<v Speaker 6>somebody else read that cause like I,</v>

4764
03:24:17.790 --> 03:24:20.070
<v Speaker 6>I started out with this idea at the </v>
<v Speaker 6>beginning of the channel.</v>

4765
03:24:20.071 --> 03:24:20.850
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

4766
03:24:20.850 --> 03:24:22.140
<v Speaker 6>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a conversation.</v>

4767
03:24:22.141 --> 03:24:23.190
<v Speaker 6>We're going to do our best,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4768
03:24:23.191 --> 03:24:24.024
<v Speaker 6>if they have a disagreement,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll try to hash it out and I'm going </v>

4769
03:24:25.441 --> 03:24:27.630
<v Speaker 6>to be respectful and by the end I would </v>
<v Speaker 6>just be like,</v>

4770
03:24:27.720 --> 03:24:28.830
<v Speaker 6>I'm not changing.</v>

4771
03:24:29.550 --> 03:24:31.470
<v Speaker 6>Like I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if you'd just like flip through all</v>

4772
03:24:31.471 --> 03:24:32.304
<v Speaker 6>of the emails,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'd see a man slowly losing his mind </v>

4773
03:24:33.631 --> 03:24:35.190
<v Speaker 6>because they would just ask for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>dumbest,</v>

4774
03:24:35.191 --> 03:24:36.780
<v Speaker 6>craziest bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

03:24:37.020 --> 03:24:38.280
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>

4778
03:24:42.751 --> 03:24:43.800
<v Speaker 6>every,</v>
<v Speaker 6>every cloud,</v>

4779
03:24:43.801 --> 03:24:44.760
<v Speaker 6>every puddle,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'd be like,</v>

4780

<v Speaker 6>let's looks like a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 6>it's like you're going to cost you.</v>

4784
03:24:52.460 --> 03:24:54.000
<v Speaker 6>It's like you have to write a ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

4785
03:24:54.001 --> 03:24:56.160
<v Speaker 6>Like they've got a quota,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they got to find these problems.</v>

4786
03:24:56.161 --> 03:24:57.350
<v Speaker 6>Even if they don't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what,</v>

4787
03:24:58.260 --> 03:25:01.320
<v Speaker 6>that's their job is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>see dicks were dicks don't exist.</v>

4788
03:25:01.380 --> 03:25:02.213
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like constantly having to just like </v>

4789
03:25:04.130 --> 03:25:05.550
<v Speaker 6>feel these questions,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'd be like,</v>

4790
03:25:05.580 --> 03:25:06.720
<v Speaker 6>is that a secret deck?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd be like,</v>

4791
03:25:06.900 --> 03:25:08.640
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a carrot.</v>

4792
03:25:09.380 --> 03:25:13.000
<v Speaker 6>Like constantly believe they pay people </v>
<v Speaker 6>to just watch for dicks.</v>

4793
03:25:13.360 --> 03:25:16.620
<v Speaker 6>They find double entendres where there </v>
<v Speaker 6>were no double entendres constantly.</v>

4794
03:25:16.940 --> 03:25:19.140
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>imagine the,</v>

4795
03:25:19.830 --> 03:25:20.770
<v Speaker 6>well we would,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

4796
03:25:20.771 --> 03:25:22.470
<v Speaker 6>we would like even,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4797
03:25:22.650 --> 03:25:24.390
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how much we should be </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about this,</v>

4798
03:25:24.391 --> 03:25:25.730
<v Speaker 6>but like on fish hooks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it'd be like we,</v>

4799
03:25:25.731 --> 03:25:26.564
<v Speaker 6>we would,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we would write something and then </v>

4800
03:25:27.990 --> 03:25:32.670
<v Speaker 6>without even thinking about the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that it has the potential to be some way</v>

4801
03:25:32.671 --> 03:25:33.060
<v Speaker 6>in which,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

4802
03:25:33.060 --> 03:25:33.893
<v Speaker 6>they'd always find it and then they </v>
<v Speaker 6>would take the thing and they would be </v>

4803
03:25:35.521 --> 03:25:36.354
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

4804
03:25:36.450 --> 03:25:38.690
<v Speaker 6>like they dig up this lane,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>

4805
03:25:38.720 --> 03:25:39.553
<v Speaker 6>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like definition 12 on urban dictionary </v>

4806
03:25:41.161 --> 03:25:42.300
<v Speaker 6>and they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a,</v>

4807
03:25:42.301 --> 03:25:45.210
<v Speaker 6>that's an offensive phrase ever heard of</v>
<v Speaker 6>before.</v>

4808
03:25:45.850 --> 03:25:46.683
<v Speaker 6>It would be like this Rube Goldberg </v>
<v Speaker 6>machine of like how it's offensive or </v>

4809
03:25:50.281 --> 03:25:53.880
<v Speaker 6>how it could be perceived as a Dick </v>
<v Speaker 6>Bush,</v>

4810
03:25:53.950 --> 03:25:54.750
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

4811
03:25:54.750 --> 03:25:56.250
<v Speaker 6>A lack of a better,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was,</v>

4812
03:25:56.310 --> 03:25:59.010
<v Speaker 6>it was pretty well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I will say great place to work.</v>

4813
03:25:59.820 --> 03:26:01.620
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a wonderful company.</v>

4814
03:26:02.100 --> 03:26:02.933
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean just don't tweet jokes and years </v>

4815
03:26:05.400 --> 03:26:08.190
<v Speaker 6>ago the company was tweet jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>10 years ago,</v>

4816
03:26:08.200 --> 03:26:09.810
<v Speaker 6>whatever you do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't get in a time machine.</v>

4817
03:26:09.811 --> 03:26:12.780
<v Speaker 6>Not to be a show 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>period.</v>

4818
03:26:13.200 --> 03:26:14.400
<v Speaker 6>Not do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they were Rad.</v>

4819
03:26:14.401 --> 03:26:15.720
<v Speaker 6>It was mainly just the standards </v>
<v Speaker 6>department.</v>

4820
03:26:15.721 --> 03:26:18.750
<v Speaker 6>They were just like gigantic tools and </v>
<v Speaker 6>that every firm from day to day,</v>

4821
03:26:18.751 --> 03:26:20.040
<v Speaker 6>week to week,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they would constantly change.</v>

4822
03:26:20.250 --> 03:26:22.890
<v Speaker 6>I remember one time we had like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was like,</v>

4823
03:26:23.160 --> 03:26:24.450
<v Speaker 6>there's like some scene where it was </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

4824
03:26:24.451 --> 03:26:25.620
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're going underground and there's some</v>

4825
03:26:25.621 --> 03:26:27.120
<v Speaker 6>trolls.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4826
03:26:27.150 --> 03:26:27.983
<v Speaker 6>there's some like dwarves,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's some ogres or whatever and </v>

4827
03:26:29.341 --> 03:26:29.821
<v Speaker 6>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

4828
03:26:29.821 --> 03:26:32.520
<v Speaker 6>you cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you cannot have dwarves anymore.</v>

4829
03:26:32.550 --> 03:26:33.383
<v Speaker 6>That team,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that term is kind of offensive and </v>

4830
03:26:34.501 --> 03:26:35.334
<v Speaker 6>update and we would never allow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we would never allow a dwarf to be in a </v>

4831
03:26:37.591 --> 03:26:38.580
<v Speaker 6>Disney production.</v>

4832
03:26:38.580 --> 03:26:39.413
<v Speaker 6>And literally as they were saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was looking out my window looking at </v>

4833
03:26:41.431 --> 03:26:44.130
<v Speaker 6>the giant stone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>seven dwarves holding up the roof of the</v>

4834
03:26:44.131 --> 03:26:44.964
<v Speaker 6>Disney filling and I was like these guys</v>
<v Speaker 6>are so I've completely gone off the </v>

4835
03:26:47.101 --> 03:26:49.940
<v Speaker 6>fucking reservation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They reboot the seven dwarves.</v>

4836
03:26:49.941 --> 03:26:50.774
<v Speaker 6>It was like a newer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they call it the seven d maybe they </v>

4837
03:26:52.531 --> 03:26:54.720
<v Speaker 6>can't say the word door,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure.</v>

4838
03:26:54.750 --> 03:26:55.583
<v Speaker 6>And maybe they're right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it was just like the hypocrisy of </v>

4839
03:26:56.851 --> 03:26:57.684
<v Speaker 6>like you guys just the roof is literally</v>
<v Speaker 6>being held up by giant stone one you're </v>

4840
03:27:00.391 --> 03:27:01.224
<v Speaker 6>playing like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a like a world of warcraft and you </v>

4841
03:27:03.240 --> 03:27:05.820
<v Speaker 6>and your role at dwarf characters and </v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

4842
03:27:06.030 --> 03:27:11.030
<v Speaker 6>I mean yeah I'm not up or like I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 6>an expert medical term.</v>

4843
03:27:12.600 --> 03:27:15.010
<v Speaker 6>I guess maybe it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it is medical term and now like,</v>

4844
03:27:15.030 --> 03:27:16.470
<v Speaker 6>but it wouldn't be one thing if they </v>
<v Speaker 6>were like,</v>

4845
03:27:16.860 --> 03:27:20.400
<v Speaker 6>I have a few door friends and that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>what they prefer to be called.</v>

4846
03:27:20.401 --> 03:27:21.234
<v Speaker 6>Like war ride it cause I've paid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't like what did you say it in </v>

4847

<v Speaker 6>the mic?</v>

<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

4964
03:32:51.030 --> 03:32:51.863
<v Speaker 24>Okay.</v>

4965
03:32:52.020 --> 03:32:52.853
<v Speaker 8>Do,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what's the difference between woken red </v>

4966
03:32:54.651 --> 03:32:57.320
<v Speaker 8>pilled?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think they're the exact opposite.</v>

4967
03:32:57.321 --> 03:32:58.610
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like,</v>

4968
03:32:58.860 --> 03:33:01.700
<v Speaker 8>depends on what side you're on.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's what woke means,</v>

4969
03:33:01.940 --> 03:33:02.930
<v Speaker 8>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 8>So it's like,</v>

4970
03:33:02.931 --> 03:33:03.950
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you can be woke.</v>

4971
03:33:04.280 --> 03:33:07.220
<v Speaker 8>But it's like you can also be on the </v>
<v Speaker 8>left or you going to be woke and you can</v>

4972
03:33:07.221 --> 03:33:09.590
<v Speaker 8>be on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It depends on what you're woke to.</v>

4973
03:33:09.650 --> 03:33:12.770
<v Speaker 8>So red building woke,</v>
<v Speaker 8>does it mean the same thing?</v>

4974
03:33:13.310 --> 03:33:14.530
<v Speaker 8>It depends what side you're on.</v>

4975
03:33:14.910 --> 03:33:15.743
<v Speaker 18>I've attempted to draw,</v>
<v Speaker 18>do a drawing and Justin royal and style </v>

4976
03:33:18.720 --> 03:33:19.553
<v Speaker 18>way as close as I can to something that </v>
<v Speaker 18>might look like adjusting oil and </v>

4977
03:33:22.051 --> 03:33:22.380
<v Speaker 18>drawing.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Oh,</v>

4978
03:33:22.380 --> 03:33:23.213
<v Speaker 18>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Let me hold.</v>

4979
03:33:23.650 --> 03:33:25.530
<v Speaker 18>Let me hold it here.</v>
<v Speaker 18>And I ain't got the fake,</v>

<v Speaker 18>I'm scared of dying.</v>

4983
03:33:29.941 --> 03:33:31.020
<v Speaker 18>That's my gimmick.</v>
<v Speaker 18>That's my thing.</v>

4984
03:33:31.021 --> 03:33:32.370
<v Speaker 18>I'm really scared.</v>

<v Speaker 7>it looks pretty plausible.</v>

4991

<v Speaker 7>Oh my God,</v>

5032
03:35:38.611 --> 03:35:39.444
<v Speaker 7>this is so consistent advice.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Very close to what I would actually </v>

5033
03:35:42.691 --> 03:35:44.280
<v Speaker 7>draw.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now,</v>

<v Speaker 7>like an art curator?</v>

<v Speaker 7>Justin is kinda shocked here.</v>

5040
03:36:00.030 --> 03:36:01.920
<v Speaker 7>I think a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it might be out of business.</v>

5041
03:36:03.210 --> 03:36:04.500
<v Speaker 7>What about,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what about the signature?</v>

5042
03:36:04.500 --> 03:36:06.450
<v Speaker 7>What are the telltale mistakes in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>signature?</v>

5043
03:36:07.050 --> 03:36:10.440
<v Speaker 7>The signature is a shit show,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but everything else is like they,</v>

5044
03:36:10.441 --> 03:36:12.900
<v Speaker 7>the handwriting and signature of the or </v>
<v Speaker 7>the or the,</v>

5045

<v Speaker 7>that character is like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like if,</v>

5046
03:36:15.860 --> 03:36:20.160
<v Speaker 7>if like if I put that in a drawer and </v>
<v Speaker 7>like a few years later I would not even,</v>

5047
03:36:20.370 --> 03:36:23.530
<v Speaker 7>I wouldn't just assume I drew it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's pretty amazing.</v>

5048
03:36:25.080 --> 03:36:27.290
<v Speaker 7>Are you going to draw a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you going to draw an Alex Harris drawing</v>

<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

5051
03:36:31.260 --> 03:36:33.240
<v Speaker 7>just like I'm not the chameleon of voice</v>
<v Speaker 7>actors.</v>

5052
03:36:33.420 --> 03:36:36.070
<v Speaker 7>Should we go over the reward </v>
<v Speaker 7>impressionism</v>

5053
03:36:37.420 --> 03:36:38.253
<v Speaker 8>impression?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Do we need to tell these people what's </v>

5054
03:36:39.551 --> 03:36:40.384
<v Speaker 8>at stake here guys?</v>
<v Speaker 8>We really are trying to help $500 </v>

5055
03:36:44.920 --> 03:36:47.670
<v Speaker 8>people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh no sir.</v>

5056
03:36:47.850 --> 03:36:48.683
<v Speaker 8>A hundred bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's all it cost to draw to deface </v>

5057
03:36:50.081 --> 03:36:53.350
<v Speaker 8>Joey's face,</v>
<v Speaker 8>500 to face my face.</v>

5058
03:36:53.510 --> 03:36:55.870
<v Speaker 8>Those were not,</v>
<v Speaker 8>those were down for a while,</v>

5059
03:36:56.240 --> 03:36:57.700
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Or or what?</v>

5060
03:36:57.701 --> 03:37:00.760
<v Speaker 8>I mean it's up now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We figured out what it was actually.</v>

5061
03:37:01.150 --> 03:37:05.620
<v Speaker 8>So we originally thought we were only </v>
<v Speaker 8>going to six and we didn't want those to</v>

5062
03:37:05.621 --> 03:37:09.490
<v Speaker 8>go after and so they had expired and so </v>
<v Speaker 8>I just,</v>

5063
03:37:09.880 --> 03:37:12.490
<v Speaker 8>I just reinitiated them and I said it to</v>
<v Speaker 8>eight,</v>

5064
03:37:12.520 --> 03:37:14.380
<v Speaker 8>but if we get close to eight and we're </v>
<v Speaker 8>still going,</v>

5065
03:37:14.790 --> 03:37:19.150
<v Speaker 8>oh you got to keep going and half hours </v>
<v Speaker 8>we got,</v>

5066
03:37:19.151 --> 03:37:20.920
<v Speaker 8>we got,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we got to go to at least seven hours.</v>

5067
03:37:21.010 --> 03:37:23.810
<v Speaker 8>I mean we did five hours last year,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so we still have an hour and a half,</v>

5068
03:37:23.811 --> 03:37:25.090
<v Speaker 8>but we definitely get to thousand.</v>

5069
03:37:25.900 --> 03:37:28.970
<v Speaker 8>We're not that close to 75 though.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

5070
03:37:28.971 --> 03:37:31.480
<v Speaker 8>we got to hit,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we got to hit a Christmas miracle.</v>

5071
03:37:32.200 --> 03:37:33.550
<v Speaker 8>You know what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know what it was?</v>

5072
03:37:33.551 --> 03:37:36.910
<v Speaker 8>It was my fault for building that </v>
<v Speaker 8>fucking toy in the beginning.</v>

5073
03:37:38.110 --> 03:37:38.943
<v Speaker 8>I wasn't contributing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I wasn't like given the given the show </v>

5074
03:37:41.531 --> 03:37:43.660
<v Speaker 8>the energy not too late Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 8>For game changing.</v>

5075
03:37:43.661 --> 03:37:44.980

<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

5354

<v Speaker 4>I had a few questions that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5355
03:49:06.030 --> 03:49:07.140
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5356
03:49:07.530 --> 03:49:11.220
<v Speaker 4>the larger populous would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would really like you to answer.</v>

5357
03:49:11.400 --> 03:49:14.520
<v Speaker 4>And I answered them honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5358
03:49:15.290 --> 03:49:16.530
<v Speaker 4>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you think about that?</v>

5359
03:49:18.030 --> 03:49:19.230
<v Speaker 27>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 27>that's all right.</v>

5360
03:49:19.231 --> 03:49:21.890
<v Speaker 27>We'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 27>I think whatever of life that took it,</v>

5361
03:49:22.130 --> 03:49:24.110
<v Speaker 27>nobody will do it.</v>
<v Speaker 27>But go ahead.</v>

5362
03:49:24.760 --> 03:49:25.600
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

5363
03:49:25.630 --> 03:49:29.950
<v Speaker 4>so the first question I have is what do </v>
<v Speaker 4>you think of slender man?</v>

5364
03:49:30.760 --> 03:49:32.580
<v Speaker 4>That whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that crazy cooky.</v>

5365
03:49:33.050 --> 03:49:33.491
<v Speaker 27>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 27>you know,</v>

5366
03:49:33.491 --> 03:49:37.030
<v Speaker 27>there's so many complicated things to do</v>
<v Speaker 27>with others,</v>

5367
03:49:37.110 --> 03:49:42.110
<v Speaker 27>but it's true that this person got to,</v>
<v Speaker 27>Alli sent through,</v>

5368
03:49:42.951 --> 03:49:47.160
<v Speaker 27>we don't talk weight.</v>
<v Speaker 27>We tried to throw a fit.</v>

5369
03:49:48.130 --> 03:49:48.963
<v Speaker 19>That's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 19>but first what we will see static and </v>

5370
03:49:56.381 --> 03:49:58.000
<v Speaker 19>that's that good.</v>
<v Speaker 19>So we're looking at today,</v>

5371
03:49:59.380 --> 03:50:04.380
<v Speaker 19>I've got my cup.</v>

03:50:07.560 --> 03:50:08.393

5374
03:50:11.311 --> 03:50:14.880
<v Speaker 4>a lot to say about slenderman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We didn't,</v>

5375
03:50:14.970 --> 03:50:16.940
<v Speaker 4>we didn't quite hear most of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

5376
03:50:16.941 --> 03:50:20.640
<v Speaker 4>I hope the audience out out there </v>
<v Speaker 4>watching the screen and see on Air Force</v>

5589
03:58:30.760 --> 03:58:33.550
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you think of the game,</v>

5590
03:58:33.580 --> 03:58:35.180
<v Speaker 2>Zelda,</v>

5592
03:58:39.731 --> 03:58:43.720
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of people think that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>Zelda because the name is Zola,</v>

5593
03:58:43.721 --> 03:58:45.460
<v Speaker 2>but that's the name of the princess.</v>

<v Speaker 29>it was interesting.</v>

5791
04:08:59.131 --> 04:09:02.730
<v Speaker 29>I was like sitting out in front of the </v>
<v Speaker 29>bathroom and there was a guy,</v>

5792
04:09:02.970 --> 04:09:03.803
<v Speaker 29>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 29>he was kind of interesting with the </v>

5793
04:09:04.501 --> 04:09:05.334
<v Speaker 29>context of the song,</v>
<v Speaker 29>but there was a guy walking around with </v>

5794
04:09:07.061 --> 04:09:09.170
<v Speaker 29>the flashlight for some reason just like</v>
<v Speaker 29>shoot,</v>

5795
04:09:09.180 --> 04:09:12.090
<v Speaker 29>like shining a flashlight is puffin and </v>
<v Speaker 29>creeping.</v>

5796
04:09:12.120 --> 04:09:13.780
<v Speaker 29>And he was explaining on me,</v>

5797
04:09:14.310 --> 04:09:16.710
<v Speaker 7>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is that normal around the building?</v>

5798
04:09:17.310 --> 04:09:18.780
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that definitely,</v>

5799
04:09:18.781 --> 04:09:20.130
<v Speaker 7>that happened the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I was like,</v>

5800
04:09:20.131 --> 04:09:24.070
<v Speaker 7>you're a while you're playing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People think so.</v>

5801
04:09:24.730 --> 04:09:28.600
<v Speaker 7>I think what it was like for him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>mommy,</v>

5802
04:09:29.470 --> 04:09:32.910
<v Speaker 7>Justin dresses up as a security guard </v>
<v Speaker 7>and walks around with a flashlight.</v>

5803
04:09:32.911 --> 04:09:33.744
<v Speaker 7>It was not me guys.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You guys would know that there's going </v>

5804
04:09:35.961 --> 04:09:39.060
<v Speaker 7>to be some like really rational reason </v>
<v Speaker 7>why that was happening.</v>

5805
04:09:40.920 --> 04:09:45.630
<v Speaker 7>Building.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But he died and he was like,</v>

5806
04:09:47.850 --> 04:09:50.460
<v Speaker 7>we called them flashlight,</v>
<v Speaker 7>flashlight on.</v>

5807
04:09:50.461 --> 04:09:53.280
<v Speaker 7>You did,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he was already doing it.</v>

5808
04:09:53.430 --> 04:09:54.263
<v Speaker 7>He was doing it before I got there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then and then kind of like continue </v>

5809
04:09:57.471 --> 04:09:59.860
<v Speaker 7>to know why I should have just chose a </v>
<v Speaker 7>different location.</v>

5810
04:10:00.490 --> 04:10:03.090
<v Speaker 7>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I sat like right next to him.</v>

5811
04:10:04.330 --> 04:10:05.910
<v Speaker 7>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can do them right in this room.</v>

5812
04:10:05.970 --> 04:10:07.680
<v Speaker 7>So it seems like you probably want to </v>
<v Speaker 7>be,</v>

5813
04:10:07.690 --> 04:10:08.520
<v Speaker 7>you can just do it.</v>

6789

<v Speaker 31>doing the chuck e cheese investing.</v>

<v Speaker 31>Yeah.</v>

6794
04:51:47.130 --> 04:51:47.970
<v Speaker 10>Big,</v>
<v Speaker 10>big,</v>

6795
04:51:48.660 --> 04:51:50.780
<v Speaker 10>big money,</v>
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

6803
04:52:09.911 --> 04:52:10.744
<v Speaker 10>when they started taking out the cool </v>

<v Speaker 10>taking out all the fun,</v>
<v Speaker 10>weird,</v>

6805
04:52:15.911 --> 04:52:19.750
<v Speaker 10>creepy rooms with the flashing strobe </v>
<v Speaker 10>lights and all that kind of stuff.</v>

6806
04:52:20.020 --> 04:52:22.720
<v Speaker 10>As soon as they got rid of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

6807
04:52:22.750 --> 04:52:26.020
<v Speaker 10>you're with me there.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Well at least we have some common ground</v>

6808
04:52:26.021 --> 04:52:31.021
<v Speaker 10>to build this.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Okay,</v>

6809
04:52:33.641 --> 04:52:35.110
<v Speaker 10>well see,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know what I'm talking about.</v>

6810
04:52:35.350 --> 04:52:40.350
<v Speaker 10>So I'm ready to bring that back to </v>
<v Speaker 10>Bakersfield with a punch to the city,</v>

6811
04:52:40.931 --> 04:52:41.764
<v Speaker 10>right in the throat of the city.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm going to bring this thing back and </v>

6812
04:52:43.991 --> 04:52:46.300
<v Speaker 10>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and I think that,</v>

6813
04:52:46.630 --> 04:52:50.260
<v Speaker 10>so you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so the first card is the card of coins,</v>

6814
04:52:50.890 --> 04:52:52.130
<v Speaker 10>which could be good or bad,</v>
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

6815
04:52:54.730 --> 04:52:55.563
<v Speaker 31>Tentacles</v>

6816
04:52:55.770 --> 04:52:57.260
<v Speaker 10>the three of pentacles</v>

6817
04:52:58.630 --> 04:52:59.990
<v Speaker 31>when you read directly.</v>

6818
04:53:01.090 --> 04:53:01.990
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And so,</v>

6819
04:53:01.991 --> 04:53:06.991
<v Speaker 10>and three is that 3 million?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Is that 300 is it 3000 how many levels?</v>

6820
04:53:11.830 --> 04:53:14.440
<v Speaker 10>Like a hundred levels or 10 levels.</v>

6821
04:53:14.680 --> 04:53:15.513
<v Speaker 31>All right.</v>

6822
04:53:17.000 --> 04:53:17.590
<v Speaker 10>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>okay.</v>

6823
04:53:17.590 --> 04:53:18.423
<v Speaker 10>So</v>

6824
04:53:19.030 --> 04:53:19.930
<v Speaker 31>I'm at a three</v>

6825
04:53:20.190 --> 04:53:21.600
<v Speaker 10>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

6826
04:53:21.870 --> 04:53:22.703
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you look at it from a bitcoin </v>

6827
04:53:23.550 --> 04:53:24.540
<v Speaker 10>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's like,</v>

6828
04:53:24.541 --> 04:53:25.374
<v Speaker 10>well,</v>
<v Speaker 10>if I had,</v>

6829
04:53:25.710 --> 04:53:30.710
<v Speaker 10>if I had bought $300 a bitcoin in 2009 </v>
<v Speaker 10>or 2008 or if I bought $100 a bitcoin in</v>

6830
04:53:33.841 --> 04:53:37.050
<v Speaker 10>2008 so it was three versus 10 or sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You know what I mean?</v>

6831
04:53:38.160 --> 04:53:41.120
<v Speaker 10>So it's not so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Always a glass half full type.</v>

6832
04:53:41.460 --> 04:53:44.610
<v Speaker 10>I'm always a glass half full type.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Go ahead.</v>

6833
04:53:44.910 --> 04:53:49.320
<v Speaker 10>The next car is upon.</v>
<v Speaker 10>My other concern is the progress.</v>

6834
04:53:51.000 --> 04:53:55.620
<v Speaker 10>Well know my,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I hired my uncle and my cousin Dave,</v>

6835
04:53:55.680 --> 04:53:57.060
<v Speaker 10>they're out of work.</v>
<v Speaker 10>They need a job.</v>

6836
04:53:57.061 --> 04:53:58.560
<v Speaker 10>That's part of the reason why I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 10>this,</v>

6837
04:53:58.620 --> 04:53:59.453
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>to dress up as the mascots and to help </v>

6838
04:54:01.411 --> 04:54:04.590
<v Speaker 10>me oversee business and accounting and </v>
<v Speaker 10>financing and all that stuff.</v>

6839
04:54:04.591 --> 04:54:07.020
<v Speaker 10>So I'm pretty confident on that front.</v>
<v Speaker 10>What,</v>

6840
04:54:07.090 --> 04:54:07.923
<v Speaker 10>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 10>what's the,</v>

6841
04:54:08.040 --> 04:54:10.380
<v Speaker 10>what's the next card you got</v>

6842
04:54:12.560 --> 04:54:17.560
<v Speaker 31>the middle car represent the movement.</v>
<v Speaker 31>I'm a mover and a shaker.</v>

6843
04:54:20.770 --> 04:54:23.470
<v Speaker 31>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 31>it's incorporated with the numerology of</v>

6844
04:54:23.471 --> 04:54:27.040
<v Speaker 31>the five.</v>
<v Speaker 31>It represents change.</v>

6845
04:54:27.180 --> 04:54:30.750
<v Speaker 10>You said something about a crawl space,</v>
<v Speaker 10>like number one.</v>

6846
04:54:31.890 --> 04:54:32.723
<v Speaker 31>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 31>sorry.</v>

6847
04:54:32.890 --> 04:54:33.970
<v Speaker 31>No</v>

6848
04:54:34.550 --> 04:54:35.383
<v Speaker 10>number one is the side of the mover and </v>
<v Speaker 10>a shaker and it's a crawl space kind of </v>

6849
04:54:39.651 --> 04:54:43.760
<v Speaker 10>scenario where it's like you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 10>have to crawl to get to your dream.</v>

6850
04:54:43.800 --> 04:54:45.740
<v Speaker 10>I never said that.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And let me tell you something.</v>

<v Speaker 10>feet.</v>

6853
04:54:51.110 --> 04:54:56.060
<v Speaker 10>I think it was our 12 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 10>feet out of a tunnel just to escape from</v>

6854
04:54:56.061 --> 04:54:58.210
<v Speaker 10>a situation.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm not going to get into it.</v>

6855

05:10:29.700 --> 05:10:31.920
<v Speaker 6>late eighties maybe like they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 38>He said,</v>

7844
05:41:52.030 --> 05:41:53.830
<v Speaker 38>Ma,</v>
<v Speaker 38>ma,</v>

7845
05:41:54.490 --> 05:41:56.320
<v Speaker 38>little johnny,</v>
<v Speaker 38>that's my name,</v>

7846
05:41:56.321 --> 05:41:57.820
<v Speaker 38>Jonathan.</v>
<v Speaker 38>He called me little johnny.</v>

7847
05:41:57.821 --> 05:41:58.770
<v Speaker 38>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 38>well,</v>

7848
05:41:58.790 --> 05:41:59.623
<v Speaker 38>a little Jonathan.</v>
<v Speaker 38>I had peed the bed and it was soaking </v>

7849
05:42:02.201 --> 05:42:05.980
<v Speaker 38>wet all the way and the dream I was,</v>
<v Speaker 38>there was so much yarn.</v>

7850
05:42:06.280 --> 05:42:09.280
<v Speaker 38>It was like I didn't stop and the whole </v>
<v Speaker 38>room was filling up with a yard.</v>

7851
05:42:09.610 --> 05:42:12.130
<v Speaker 38>And so he comes swimming in and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 38>boy,</v>

7852
05:42:12.131 --> 05:42:13.990
<v Speaker 38>a little Joanie,</v>
<v Speaker 38>let me,</v>

7853
05:42:13.991 --> 05:42:17.020
<v Speaker 38>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 38>let me turn the faucet off for you.</v>

7854
05:42:17.470 --> 05:42:18.303
<v Speaker 38>And this we want to get real </v>
<v Speaker 38>embarrassing because he put his mouth </v>

7855
05:42:19.961 --> 05:42:20.830
<v Speaker 38>on,</v>
<v Speaker 38>you know,</v>

7856
05:42:21.510 --> 05:42:23.260
<v Speaker 38>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 38>you know,</v>

7857
05:42:23.261 --> 05:42:25.150
<v Speaker 38>on my penis,</v>
<v Speaker 38>my little penis.</v>

7858
05:42:25.450 --> 05:42:27.720
<v Speaker 38>And he say,</v>
<v Speaker 38>let me turn the faucet off for you,</v>

7859
05:42:27.730 --> 05:42:32.020
<v Speaker 38>a little johnny and he suck and you suck</v>
<v Speaker 38>and all the gear and come out.</v>

7860
05:42:32.080 --> 05:42:32.913
<v Speaker 38>And he's turned it off,</v>
<v Speaker 38>like turned it off with his mouth and </v>

7861
05:42:35.830 --> 05:42:38.870
<v Speaker 38>then the urine keep slowly drain it out </v>
<v Speaker 38>of the room.</v>

7862
05:42:39.760 --> 05:42:42.040
<v Speaker 38>The urine.</v>
<v Speaker 38>Well,</v>

7863
05:42:42.250 --> 05:42:44.890
<v Speaker 38>I'm getting a little emotional and the </v>
<v Speaker 38>urine clear out.</v>

7864
05:42:44.891 --> 05:42:48.190
<v Speaker 38>And when it was dry,</v>
<v Speaker 38>my pappy lay down next to me and the bed</v>

7865
05:42:48.520 --> 05:42:51.430
<v Speaker 38>and he gave me a tend to hug and he </v>
<v Speaker 38>kissed me on the neck and he said,</v>

7866
05:42:51.431 --> 05:42:55.660
<v Speaker 38>little johnny,</v>
<v Speaker 38>I just want you to know that anytime you</v>

7867
05:42:55.661 --> 05:42:58.270
<v Speaker 38>need me to suck on your a little penis.</v>

7868
05:43:01.730 --> 05:43:06.730
<v Speaker 14>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 14>yeah.</v>

7869
05:43:08.150 --> 05:43:09.860
<v Speaker 38>Disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 38>He was a ghost.</v>

7870
05:43:10.790 --> 05:43:12.110
<v Speaker 38>So what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 38>what do you think about it?</v>

7871
05:43:14.010 --> 05:43:19.010
<v Speaker 37>So let me ask you a question.</v>
<v Speaker 37>When you were 12 before he passed,</v>

7872
05:43:21.300 --> 05:43:23.340
<v Speaker 37>were you ever afraid of him?</v>

7873
05:43:25.060 --> 05:43:27.370
<v Speaker 38>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 38>yes,</v>

7874
05:43:27.400 --> 05:43:31.600
<v Speaker 38>because sometimes my pathway would come </v>
<v Speaker 38>home and he would,</v>

7875
05:43:31.601 --> 05:43:33.350
<v Speaker 38>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 38>what,</v>

7876
05:43:33.351 --> 05:43:36.670
<v Speaker 38>what he was a nurse and he sometimes he </v>
<v Speaker 38>would,</v>

7877
05:43:36.880 --> 05:43:41.830
<v Speaker 38>he would change colostomy bags or the </v>
<v Speaker 38>old folks and he would come,</v>

7878
05:43:41.831 --> 05:43:45.960
<v Speaker 38>smelled of urine at home.</v>
<v Speaker 38>And I thought that was our thought.</v>

7879
05:43:45.970 --> 05:43:48.610
<v Speaker 38>That was a little strange.</v>
<v Speaker 38>And I do think,</v>

7880
05:43:49.720 --> 05:43:50.390
<v Speaker 38>well,</v>
<v Speaker 38>yes,</v>

7881
05:43:50.390 --> 05:43:52.360
<v Speaker 38>I was very terrified on my pappy.</v>

7882
05:43:54.260 --> 05:43:56.270
<v Speaker 37>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 37>Second question.</v>

7883
05:43:56.720 --> 05:43:59.180
<v Speaker 37>Did you really peed the bed when you </v>
<v Speaker 37>were young?</v>

7884
05:44:00.510 --> 05:44:04.920
<v Speaker 38>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 38>I peed the bed a lot and fact I,</v>

7885
05:44:05.380 --> 05:44:07.740
<v Speaker 38>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 38>I'm ashamed to admit it once again cause</v>

7886
05:44:07.741 --> 05:44:09.290
<v Speaker 38>it's quite embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 38>But I,</v>

7887
05:44:09.800 --> 05:44:12.810
<v Speaker 38>well I sleep with rubber sheets because </v>
<v Speaker 38>that had been,</v>

7888
05:44:12.811 --> 05:44:14.440
<v Speaker 38>I'm afraid has never,</v>
<v Speaker 38>uh Huh.</v>

7889
05:44:17.250 --> 05:44:20.850
<v Speaker 38>I'm afraid that habit is not a left me.</v>

7890
05:44:25.590 --> 05:44:30.590
<v Speaker 37>Beautiful thing about this can really be</v>
<v Speaker 37>your breakthrough of being able to leave</v>

7891
05:44:35.161 --> 05:44:40.161
<v Speaker 37>this pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 37>So the metaphysical reason for peeing in</v>

7892
05:44:41.851 --> 05:44:45.570
<v Speaker 37>the bed,</v>
<v Speaker 37>it's fear of a parent,</v>

7893
05:44:46.170 --> 05:44:47.003
<v Speaker 37>especially a male parent.</v>
<v Speaker 37>So it makes sense that a with the way </v>

7894
05:44:52.801 --> 05:44:57.030
<v Speaker 37>you felt about him,</v>
<v Speaker 37>that you would do it and that b,</v>

7895
05:44:57.660 --> 05:45:01.140
<v Speaker 37>that your memory of him would involve </v>
<v Speaker 37>that.</v>

7896
05:45:02.040 --> 05:45:07.040
<v Speaker 37>So the sucking away represents you suck </v>
<v Speaker 37>in a way.</v>

7897
05:45:09.331 --> 05:45:10.164
<v Speaker 37>This kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 37>if I'm looking at my father who think </v>

7898
05:45:12.391 --> 05:45:16.680
<v Speaker 37>about it in the dream,</v>
<v Speaker 37>he was so sensitive and he was so tender</v>

7899
05:45:16.681 --> 05:45:18.660
<v Speaker 37>and he was so loving,</v>
<v Speaker 37>so kind.</v>

7900
05:45:19.380 --> 05:45:22.920
<v Speaker 37>So when he was here,</v>
<v Speaker 37>you paid attention to the scary part.</v>

7901
05:45:23.910 --> 05:45:28.910
<v Speaker 37>Now years later you ready to move into </v>
<v Speaker 37>this next part of your life.</v>

7902
05:45:29.670 --> 05:45:32.220
<v Speaker 37>So you made it to leave that pattern </v>
<v Speaker 37>behind.</v>

7903
05:45:32.460 --> 05:45:34.830
<v Speaker 37>So you focused on the tinder,</v>
<v Speaker 37>they're loving,</v>

7904
05:45:35.370 --> 05:45:37.470
<v Speaker 37>tender and loving part was there when he</v>
<v Speaker 37>was alive.</v>

7905
05:45:37.710 --> 05:45:40.410
<v Speaker 37>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 37>Not what you focused on as a kid.</v>

7906
05:45:42.630 --> 05:45:43.463
<v Speaker 38>Well that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 38>He wants Mary tend to with the whole </v>

7907
05:45:45.691 --> 05:45:47.010
<v Speaker 38>what?</v>
<v Speaker 38>The penis and the mouth.</v>

7908
05:45:47.011 --> 05:45:47.844
<v Speaker 38>But the problem I'm having now,</v>
<v Speaker 38>and I do think what you said was </v>

7909
05:45:51.480 --> 05:45:54.330
<v Speaker 38>fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 38>I'm really struck by it,</v>

7910
05:45:54.780 --> 05:45:55.613
<v Speaker 38>but the problem is I've gotten my wife </v>
<v Speaker 38>and she has a thing she likes and I </v>

7911
05:45:59.701 --> 05:46:02.670
<v Speaker 38>don't know how this all connect,</v>
<v Speaker 38>but she liked to poop in the bed.</v>

7912
05:46:02.671 --> 05:46:06.300
<v Speaker 38>I tell you and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 38>I'm okay with it because,</v>

7913
05:46:06.690 --> 05:46:09.390
<v Speaker 38>well,</v>
<v Speaker 38>my father used to poop in the bed and he</v>

7914
05:46:09.391 --> 05:46:10.224
<v Speaker 38>thought it was a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 38>but my wife is into it now and I think </v>

7915
05:46:13.141 --> 05:46:16.020
<v Speaker 38>it's a little uncomfortable too.</v>
<v Speaker 38>I like,</v>

7916
05:46:16.230 --> 05:46:17.063
<v Speaker 38>I loved the wife,</v>
<v Speaker 38>but I sometimes think there's a little </v>

7917
05:46:18.871 --> 05:46:20.220
<v Speaker 38>too much poop in the bed.</v>

7918
05:46:25.820 --> 05:46:28.250
<v Speaker 39>Oh wait real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 39>I just want to say real quick,</v>

7919
05:46:28.251 --> 05:46:29.960
<v Speaker 39>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 39>Before you start talking,</v>

7920
05:46:30.260 --> 05:46:35.260
<v Speaker 39>I just want to say also that I,</v>
<v Speaker 39>I in my dreams,</v>

7921
05:46:35.301 --> 05:46:36.134
<v Speaker 39>I would poop in the bed too.</v>
<v Speaker 39>And I used to poop and spray poop all </v>

7922
05:46:40.521 --> 05:46:42.410
<v Speaker 39>over the room.</v>
<v Speaker 39>And lately,</v>

7923
05:46:42.411 --> 05:46:45.230
<v Speaker 39>and this is why I'm calling the last few</v>
<v Speaker 39>days,</v>

7924
05:46:45.231 --> 05:46:50.231
<v Speaker 39>I'm just been Skorton ropes a poop out </v>
<v Speaker 39>of my butt all into my bed and I,</v>

7925
05:46:51.890 --> 05:46:54.020
<v Speaker 39>and that's why I'm calling,</v>
<v Speaker 39>I'm trying to figure out,</v>

7926
05:46:54.021 --> 05:46:59.021
<v Speaker 39>is this some sort of source that this is</v>
<v Speaker 39>coming from where I'm just Skorton these</v>

7927
05:46:59.631 --> 05:47:00.470
<v Speaker 39>ropes.</v>

7928
05:47:04.420 --> 05:47:09.420
<v Speaker 37>So what you're saying is that in your </v>
<v Speaker 37>quest to move away from urinating in the</v>

7929
05:47:11.551 --> 05:47:12.384
<v Speaker 37>bed,</v>
<v Speaker 37>you think it may disrupt what your wife </v>

7930
05:47:15.001 --> 05:47:15.900
<v Speaker 37>likes.</v>
<v Speaker 37>So tell me.</v>

7931
05:47:15.901 --> 05:47:16.734
<v Speaker 37>Okay.</v>

7932
05:47:18.130 --> 05:47:22.060
<v Speaker 39>I'm worried about that.</v>
<v Speaker 39>It might have something to do with this.</v>

7933
05:47:22.180 --> 05:47:23.013
<v Speaker 39>In my quest is get away from urinating </v>
<v Speaker 39>in the bed that it's now been the door </v>

7934
05:47:26.980 --> 05:47:31.980
<v Speaker 39>to Skorton brown ropes in the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 39>Just huge turd snake.</v>

7935
05:47:36.630 --> 05:47:37.463
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>

7936
05:47:38.760 --> 05:47:42.540
<v Speaker 37>So what is it that your wife likes?</v>
<v Speaker 37>What form that she preferred?</v>

7937
05:47:43.120 --> 05:47:43.953
<v Speaker 38>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 38>my wife likes it when the poops in the </v>

7938
05:47:45.941 --> 05:47:49.300
<v Speaker 38>bed and I think it's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 38>you know,</v>

7939
05:47:49.450 --> 05:47:53.410
<v Speaker 38>every once in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 38>But she asks me every evening,</v>

7940
05:47:53.411 --> 05:47:55.540
<v Speaker 38>I tried to go to the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 38>I liked to,</v>

7941
05:47:55.660 --> 05:47:56.340
<v Speaker 38>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 38>uh,</v>

7942
05:47:56.340 --> 05:47:59.470
<v Speaker 38>let it out before the bedtime.</v>
<v Speaker 38>But she says,</v>

7943
05:47:59.471 --> 05:48:01.120
<v Speaker 38>no.</v>
<v Speaker 38>She says,</v>

7944
05:48:01.121 --> 05:48:01.901
<v Speaker 38>no,</v>
<v Speaker 38>Johnny,</v>

7945
05:48:01.901 --> 05:48:04.000
<v Speaker 38>I want you to poop right here in the </v>
<v Speaker 38>bed.</v>

7946
05:48:04.330 --> 05:48:05.163
<v Speaker 38>And she likes to cuddle because we lost </v>
<v Speaker 38>a child and she likes to pretend that </v>

7947
05:48:08.441 --> 05:48:09.640
<v Speaker 38>the poop is the child.</v>

7948
05:48:11.080 --> 05:48:11.913
<v Speaker 14>So if she cuts,</v>

7949
05:48:15.540 --> 05:48:18.280
<v Speaker 37>does it matter to her?</v>
<v Speaker 37>Which one of yours,</v>

7950
05:48:18.820 --> 05:48:22.000
<v Speaker 37>whether it's hers or yours,</v>
<v Speaker 37>in terms of pretending is the child?</v>

7951
05:48:22.150 --> 05:48:23.150
<v Speaker 39>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 39>I,</v>

7952
05:48:23.230 --> 05:48:25.930
<v Speaker 39>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 39>it's just the most important thing,</v>

7953
05:48:26.080 --> 05:48:26.913
<v Speaker 39>not so much about the child,</v>
<v Speaker 39>it's just that having shooting these </v>

7954
05:48:31.121 --> 05:48:33.730
<v Speaker 39>ropes,</v>
<v Speaker 39>a snake like poop in the bed,</v>

7955
05:48:33.731 --> 05:48:36.910
<v Speaker 39>just splattering them all in around the </v>
<v Speaker 39>bed and,</v>

7956
05:48:38.080 --> 05:48:43.080
<v Speaker 39>and pn in the bed and just,</v>
<v Speaker 39>it's a wild situation.</v>

7957
05:48:46.400 --> 05:48:47.233
<v Speaker 14>Okay.</v>

7958
05:48:47.790 --> 05:48:48.500
<v Speaker 37>Is,</v>

7959
05:48:48.500 --> 05:48:49.890
<v Speaker 39>and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 39>I feel that,</v>

7960
05:48:50.600 --> 05:48:51.510
<v Speaker 39>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 39>I'm sorry to interrupt,</v>

7961
05:48:51.511 --> 05:48:55.980
<v Speaker 39>but I feel like that's the most </v>
<v Speaker 39>important part of the conversation.</v>

7962
05:48:57.580 --> 05:48:58.413
<v Speaker 14>Okay.</v>

7963
05:48:58.470 --> 05:49:00.210
<v Speaker 39>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 39>I keep bringing up my wife,</v>

7964
05:49:00.510 --> 05:49:03.360
<v Speaker 39>I keep bringing up my wife and all this </v>
<v Speaker 39>other stuff,</v>

7965
05:49:03.361 --> 05:49:06.870
<v Speaker 39>but really it's about me just Skorton </v>
<v Speaker 39>these brown rope,</v>

7966
05:49:06.871 --> 05:49:10.390
<v Speaker 39>snake ropes,</v>
<v Speaker 39>just shooting these snake ropes out</v>

7967
05:49:11.890 --> 05:49:12.723
<v Speaker 14>it.</v>

7968
05:49:17.200 --> 05:49:19.860
<v Speaker 37>I totally get it.</v>
<v Speaker 37>And I do think that's important,</v>

7969
05:49:20.250 --> 05:49:22.230
<v Speaker 37>but we have to relate it back to the </v>
<v Speaker 37>dream.</v>

7970
05:49:22.860 --> 05:49:25.140
<v Speaker 37>The dream is,</v>
<v Speaker 37>was this conversation.</v>

7971
05:49:25.710 --> 05:49:26.543
<v Speaker 37>So I think that there's some </v>
<v Speaker 37>significance to the fact that you're </v>

7972
05:49:30.211 --> 05:49:35.211
<v Speaker 37>paying on a bed of fear of a parent who </v>
<v Speaker 37>is the male period.</v>

7973
05:49:36.510 --> 05:49:38.910
<v Speaker 37>So when you started telling me about </v>
<v Speaker 37>your wife,</v>

7974
05:49:39.450 --> 05:49:40.283
<v Speaker 37>it made me think about the actual </v>
<v Speaker 37>activity that your father did in the </v>

7975
05:49:44.440 --> 05:49:45.273
<v Speaker 37>drink</v>

7976
05:49:47.530 --> 05:49:49.000
<v Speaker 39>real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 39>One last thing is,</v>

7977
05:49:49.040 --> 05:49:51.910
<v Speaker 39>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 39>when I say my wife,</v>

7978
05:49:51.970 --> 05:49:52.803
<v Speaker 39>I should make it clear that,</v>
<v Speaker 39>I mean my pillow because I don't </v>

7979
05:49:56.651 --> 05:49:59.110
<v Speaker 39>actually have a wife.</v>
<v Speaker 39>I have a pillow,</v>

7980
05:50:02.040 --> 05:50:03.600
<v Speaker 39>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 39>but to me that is,</v>

7981
05:50:03.670 --> 05:50:07.380
<v Speaker 39>but to me that is,</v>
<v Speaker 39>is my wife and,</v>

7982
05:50:07.381 --> 05:50:08.630
<v Speaker 39>and,</v>
<v Speaker 39>and,</v>

7983
05:50:09.420 --> 05:50:09.910
<v Speaker 39>and,</v>
<v Speaker 39>and,</v>

7984
05:50:09.910 --> 05:50:10.421
<v Speaker 39>and,</v>
<v Speaker 39>and,</v>

7985
05:50:10.421 --> 05:50:11.320
<v Speaker 39>and,</v>
<v Speaker 39>and,</v>

7986
05:50:11.321 --> 05:50:13.510
<v Speaker 39>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 39>well it's,</v>

7987

<v Speaker 39>the pillow is,</v>

7988
05:50:17.350 --> 05:50:18.040
<v Speaker 39>but,</v>
<v Speaker 39>but,</v>

7989
05:50:18.040 --> 05:50:21.700
<v Speaker 39>but to me,</v>
<v Speaker 39>but to me it's a real baby.</v>

7990
05:50:21.701 --> 05:50:25.630
<v Speaker 39>And I want to just say that when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 39>Skorton these snake,</v>

7991
05:50:25.631 --> 05:50:27.700
<v Speaker 39>like,</v>
<v Speaker 39>like four feet.</v>

7992
05:50:28.170 --> 05:50:29.003
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>

7993
05:50:36.730 --> 05:50:37.563
<v Speaker 37>Johnny.</v>

7994
05:50:38.450 --> 05:50:39.230
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>

7995
05:50:39.230 --> 05:50:39.941
<v Speaker 39>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 39>When,</v>

7996
05:50:39.941 --> 05:50:44.941
<v Speaker 39>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 39>When I'm scoring these four feet snake,</v>

7997
05:50:47.301 --> 05:50:51.680
<v Speaker 39>like ropes of Poop,</v>
<v Speaker 39>snake ropes in my bed,</v>

7998
05:50:52.460 --> 05:50:57.460
<v Speaker 39>I'm starting to put that onto my pillow </v>
<v Speaker 39>wife and I'm starting to project the,</v>

7999
05:50:59.060 --> 05:51:03.650
<v Speaker 39>she's doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 39>But it's really me and I'm by myself and</v>

8000
05:51:03.651 --> 05:51:06.070
<v Speaker 39>I'm by myself and,</v>
<v Speaker 39>and I,</v>

8001
05:51:06.080 --> 05:51:07.890
<v Speaker 39>and I'm a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 39>I'm a bit ashamed to,</v>

8002
05:51:08.150 --> 05:51:08.983
<v Speaker 39>to,</v>
<v Speaker 39>to come out just right out of the gate </v>

8003
05:51:10.611 --> 05:51:12.310
<v Speaker 39>and admit that.</v>
<v Speaker 39>So that's,</v>

8004
05:51:12.320 --> 05:51:13.220
<v Speaker 39>that's my problem.</v>

8005
05:51:13.550 --> 05:51:15.320
<v Speaker 37>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 37>I want to just be yourself.</v>

8006
05:51:16.130 --> 05:51:16.963
<v Speaker 37>So can we please go back to the dream?</v>
<v Speaker 37>Tell me the part again about what your </v>

8007
05:51:20.631 --> 05:51:22.760
<v Speaker 37>dad was doing to get rid of the urine.</v>

8008
05:51:23.250 --> 05:51:25.770
<v Speaker 38>So my daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 38>what had my little,</v>

8009
05:51:26.460 --> 05:51:31.460
<v Speaker 38>my little baby penis in his mouth and he</v>
<v Speaker 38>kept on suck in and buttons it.</v>

8010
05:51:36.660 --> 05:51:37.493
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>

8011
05:51:38.230 --> 05:51:40.360
<v Speaker 37>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 37>I think there's some significance there.</v>

8012
05:51:40.361 --> 05:51:44.980
<v Speaker 37>I think that that's the key.</v>
<v Speaker 37>The key is that your father,</v>

8013
05:51:45.420 --> 05:51:47.080
<v Speaker 39>well,</v>
<v Speaker 39>just to,</v>

8014
05:51:47.700 --> 05:51:50.230
<v Speaker 39>just to make it clear,</v>
<v Speaker 39>just not to interrupt,</v>

8015
05:51:50.231 --> 05:51:51.064
<v Speaker 39>but I just want to let you know that one</v>
<v Speaker 39>important part of my dream is that my </v>

8016
05:51:56.351 --> 05:51:57.184
<v Speaker 39>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 39>he was actually in my dream was a </v>

8017
05:51:59.710 --> 05:52:00.543
<v Speaker 39>pillow.</v>

8018
05:52:02.130 --> 05:52:02.520
<v Speaker 14>Okay,</v>

8019
05:52:02.520 --> 05:52:05.310
<v Speaker 39>so it wasn't your real no,</v>
<v Speaker 39>no,</v>

8020
05:52:05.311 --> 05:52:07.050
<v Speaker 39>no.</v>
<v Speaker 39>In the junior real path know,</v>

8021
05:52:07.051 --> 05:52:08.160
<v Speaker 39>in,</v>
<v Speaker 39>in the dream.</v>

8022
05:52:08.161 --> 05:52:10.080
<v Speaker 39>My,</v>
<v Speaker 39>pappy was a beautiful,</v>

8023
05:52:11.100 --> 05:52:15.370
<v Speaker 39>like a long pillow,</v>
<v Speaker 39>like one of those leg pit,</v>

8024
05:52:15.390 --> 05:52:18.840
<v Speaker 39>like the kind of pillows you put it </v>
<v Speaker 39>between your legs and cuddle with.</v>

8025
05:52:19.710 --> 05:52:21.270
<v Speaker 39>And in my dream and,</v>
<v Speaker 39>and,</v>

8026
05:52:21.300 --> 05:52:23.160
<v Speaker 39>and,</v>
<v Speaker 39>and when I say suck,</v>

8027
05:52:23.190 --> 05:52:28.190
<v Speaker 39>I think more accurately would be brushed</v>
<v Speaker 39>up against because he was a pillow and,</v>

8028
05:52:32.220 --> 05:52:33.053
<v Speaker 39>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 39>I'm so confused and contort it about </v>

8029
05:52:36.151 --> 05:52:39.180
<v Speaker 39>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 39>but I don't know,</v>

8030
05:52:39.181 --> 05:52:41.940
<v Speaker 39>I just think that it's more,</v>
<v Speaker 39>I'm just,</v>

8031
05:52:41.941 --> 05:52:44.550
<v Speaker 39>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 39>I'm fighting against being truthful with</v>

8032
05:52:44.551 --> 05:52:45.221
<v Speaker 39>you and,</v>
<v Speaker 39>and,</v>

8033
05:52:45.221 --> 05:52:46.350
<v Speaker 39>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 39>you know,</v>

8034
05:52:46.920 --> 05:52:48.210
<v Speaker 39>the,</v>
<v Speaker 39>the fantasy that,</v>

8035
05:52:48.211 --> 05:52:49.890
<v Speaker 39>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 39>the lies,</v>

8036
05:52:49.891 --> 05:52:52.050
<v Speaker 39>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 39>the truthfulness and the lies.</v>

8037
05:52:52.600 --> 05:52:55.390
<v Speaker 38>So my question is,</v>
<v Speaker 38>who do I pee?</v>

8038
05:52:55.391 --> 05:52:57.520
<v Speaker 38>I should I pee or poop in the bed?</v>

8039
05:52:58.370 --> 05:52:59.203
<v Speaker 14>Okay.</v>

8040
05:53:01.080 --> 05:53:04.400
<v Speaker 37>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 37>I think that's a good question,</v>

8041
05:53:04.401 --> 05:53:05.234
<v Speaker 37>Johnny.</v>
<v Speaker 37>But I think a deeper way to look at it </v>

8042
05:53:07.010 --> 05:53:07.843
<v Speaker 37>is,</v>
<v Speaker 37>what does it mean when you visualize </v>

8043
05:53:11.571 --> 05:53:12.404
<v Speaker 37>your wife,</v>
<v Speaker 37>when you're awake and your father when </v>

8044
05:53:15.261 --> 05:53:16.094
<v Speaker 37>you're asleep,</v>

8045
05:53:16.100 --> 05:53:18.470
<v Speaker 39>but they're both close.</v>
<v Speaker 39>Oh,</v>

8046
05:53:19.260 --> 05:53:22.540
<v Speaker 37>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 37>That's the significance right there.</v>

8047
05:53:23.280 --> 05:53:25.290
<v Speaker 37>That's where you really have to look at </v>
<v Speaker 37>and say,</v>

8048
05:53:25.291 --> 05:53:27.160
<v Speaker 37>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 37>That,</v>

8049
05:53:27.170 --> 05:53:28.570
<v Speaker 37>um,</v>
<v Speaker 37>you had a real,</v>

8050
05:53:28.710 --> 05:53:33.060
<v Speaker 39>there's another piece of information.</v>
<v Speaker 39>It's the important thing.</v>

8051
05:53:33.070 --> 05:53:38.070
<v Speaker 39>You should know that I'm an heir to a </v>
<v Speaker 39>large pillow company.</v>

8052
05:53:39.560 --> 05:53:40.393
<v Speaker 39>I can't say which,</v>
<v Speaker 39>because it's very private and I only </v>

8053
05:53:43.821 --> 05:53:48.821
<v Speaker 39>grew up around pillows and I only have </v>
<v Speaker 39>pillows around me and I refuse.</v>

8054
05:53:50.450 --> 05:53:54.310
<v Speaker 39>I'm very rich,</v>
<v Speaker 39>so I've sent away all human interaction,</v>

8055
05:53:54.410 --> 05:53:56.480
<v Speaker 39>only pillow interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 39>So,</v>

8056
05:53:56.481 --> 05:54:01.100
<v Speaker 39>and people that help me and work with me</v>
<v Speaker 39>or in giant pillow suits,</v>

8057
05:54:01.580 --> 05:54:05.690
<v Speaker 39>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 39>and that could be a part of it.</v>

8058
05:54:05.691 --> 05:54:08.180
<v Speaker 39>And I've been living that way for the </v>
<v Speaker 39>last 17 years.</v>

8059
05:54:09.500 --> 05:54:10.610
<v Speaker 39>But,</v>
<v Speaker 39>uh,</v>

8060
05:54:10.700 --> 05:54:11.533
<v Speaker 39>I don't know.</v>

8061
05:54:14.970 --> 05:54:15.601
<v Speaker 37>No,</v>
<v Speaker 37>you're,</v>

8062
05:54:15.601 --> 05:54:17.670
<v Speaker 37>you're real.</v>
<v Speaker 37>Pappy died when you were 12,</v>

8063
05:54:17.671 --> 05:54:18.960
<v Speaker 37>is that correct?</v>
<v Speaker 37>That's right.</v>

8064
05:54:20.860 --> 05:54:21.693
<v Speaker 37>He really was.</v>
<v Speaker 37>He really did work at the hospital and </v>

8065
05:54:24.311 --> 05:54:26.560
<v Speaker 37>deal with those [inaudible] bags.</v>
<v Speaker 37>Correct.</v>

8066
05:54:26.760 --> 05:54:28.500
<v Speaker 38>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 38>well that's so that poppy.</v>

8067
05:54:28.530 --> 05:54:31.020
<v Speaker 38>So that was the poppy.</v>
<v Speaker 38>That was my pillow,</v>

8068
05:54:31.050 --> 05:54:34.230
<v Speaker 38>but my real poppy was the,</v>
<v Speaker 38>the owner.</v>

8069
05:54:34.231 --> 05:54:38.520
<v Speaker 38>He established a big below company.</v>
<v Speaker 38>I don't want to say which one it was.</v>

8070
05:54:38.690 --> 05:54:39.361
<v Speaker 38>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 38>of course.</v>

8071
05:54:39.361 --> 05:54:42.600
<v Speaker 38>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 38>the one that was changing colostomy bags</v>

8072
05:54:42.601 --> 05:54:45.360
<v Speaker 38>as a nurse.</v>
<v Speaker 38>Well that one was a,</v>

8073
05:54:46.050 --> 05:54:47.250
<v Speaker 38>that one was a pillow.</v>

8074
05:54:48.780 --> 05:54:49.613
<v Speaker 14>Okay.</v>

8075
05:54:49.650 --> 05:54:50.790
<v Speaker 37>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 37>I see.</v>

8076
05:54:51.360 --> 05:54:53.820
<v Speaker 37>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 37>It all makes sense to me.</v>

8077
05:54:53.930 --> 05:54:55.800
<v Speaker 39>So what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 39>what?</v>

8078
05:54:55.850 --> 05:54:57.580
<v Speaker 39>What do you think I should do?</v>
<v Speaker 39>Like just,</v>

8079
05:54:57.970 --> 05:55:01.390
<v Speaker 39>I'm going to let you talk and sort of </v>
<v Speaker 39>let me know what you think.</v>

8080
05:55:02.790 --> 05:55:03.623
<v Speaker 14>Yeah.</v>

8081
05:55:04.430 --> 05:55:09.430
<v Speaker 37>Well Johnny,</v>
<v Speaker 37>I think that both pee and poop represent</v>

8082
05:55:10.730 --> 05:55:13.130
<v Speaker 37>parts of your life that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 37>release,</v>

8083
05:55:13.670 --> 05:55:17.210
<v Speaker 37>parts that you want to get rid of to </v>
<v Speaker 37>excrete.</v>

8084
05:55:17.980 --> 05:55:18.813
<v Speaker 37>So the form does it really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 37>What matters is that you continue to </v>

8085
05:55:23.181 --> 05:55:28.181
<v Speaker 37>have a method to be able to take all the</v>
<v Speaker 37>things that you deal with in life and be</v>

8086
05:55:28.281 --> 05:55:33.281
<v Speaker 37>able to release them.</v>
<v Speaker 37>So the question of which form of release</v>

8087
05:55:34.040 --> 05:55:37.520
<v Speaker 37>should I use is less important than it </v>
<v Speaker 37>should.</v>

8088
05:55:37.521 --> 05:55:38.354
<v Speaker 37>I believe the answer is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 37>you have to release because it's really </v>

8089
05:55:43.281 --> 05:55:45.290
<v Speaker 37>a symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 37>It's a symbol for the,</v>

8090
05:55:45.300 --> 05:55:46.133
<v Speaker 37>what has gotten you this far in life is </v>
<v Speaker 37>your ability to be able to take in </v>

8091
05:55:49.371 --> 05:55:53.390
<v Speaker 37>things and then be able to release them </v>
<v Speaker 37>so you're not holding on to them.</v>

8092
05:55:53.480 --> 05:55:56.040
<v Speaker 37>That's the real significance here,</v>
<v Speaker 37>jen.</v>

8093
05:55:57.050 --> 05:55:59.840
<v Speaker 38>That's incredible that you were able to </v>
<v Speaker 38>decipher that.</v>

8094
05:55:59.841 --> 05:56:04.470
<v Speaker 38>So I will tell my wife that you said I </v>
<v Speaker 38>will keep shitting in the bed and that's</v>

8095
05:56:04.471 --> 05:56:05.370
<v Speaker 38>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 38>And that,</v>

8096
05:56:05.371 --> 05:56:06.600
<v Speaker 38>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 38>I'm sorry,</v>

9465

<v Speaker 18>I'm worried for myself as well.</v>

9467
07:03:53.951 --> 07:03:58.320
<v Speaker 18>My stomach still gargling and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 18>my God,</v>

07:03:58.540 --> 07:04:01.110
<v Speaker 18>I can't not do it.</v>
<v Speaker 18>I don't want to,</v>

9469
07:04:01.210 --> 07:04:03.520
<v Speaker 18>I don't want him.</v>
<v Speaker 18>I don't want a medical emergency.</v>

9470
07:04:03.521 --> 07:04:04.480
<v Speaker 18>On our hands.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Well,</v>

9471
07:04:04.481 --> 07:04:08.350
<v Speaker 18>maybe make him eat the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Just half of the whole thing.</v>

9472
07:04:09.690 --> 07:04:11.040
<v Speaker 18>So just take a bite.</v>
<v Speaker 18>I'm not even,</v>

9473
07:04:11.050 --> 07:04:14.020
<v Speaker 18>I wasn't even screaming before when I,</v>
<v Speaker 18>when I felt like I was on a pest out,</v>

9474
07:04:14.110 --> 07:04:14.570
<v Speaker 18>like,</v>
<v Speaker 18>oh,</v>

9475
07:04:14.570 --> 07:04:15.830
<v Speaker 18>I didn't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>and you don't have to commit to this.</v>

9477
07:04:19.761 --> 07:04:20.594
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

9478
07:04:21.740 --> 07:04:23.090
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to,</v>

9479
07:04:23.750 --> 07:04:25.930
<v Speaker 3>there's two Carolina reapers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which one looked?</v>

9480
07:04:25.940 --> 07:04:29.120
<v Speaker 3>This one kind of looks less scary to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This one looks like more lame,</v>

9481
07:04:29.540 --> 07:04:31.400
<v Speaker 3>but you can decide which bag do you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hit up?</v>

9482
07:04:34.110 --> 07:04:34.943
<v Speaker 3>Let's wait for Justin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's before we take the call and media </v>

9483
07:04:36.871 --> 07:04:39.750
<v Speaker 3>to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you think you think those ones,</v>

9484
07:04:40.020 --> 07:04:43.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean they probably does it really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

9485
07:04:43.020 --> 07:04:43.853
<v Speaker 3>You decide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you pick your poison as they say and </v>

<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

9487
07:04:46.890 --> 07:04:47.723
<v Speaker 3>But would you still rather get pepper </v>
<v Speaker 3>sprayed or would you rather do the </v>

9488
07:04:49.891 --> 07:04:50.860
<v Speaker 3>question?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

10263
07:40:08.271 --> 07:40:12.910

<v Speaker 18>for us,</v>

10267
07:40:20.690 --> 07:40:21.523
<v Speaker 18>we,</v>
<v Speaker 18>we might either have to re up load or </v>

10268
07:40:23.720 --> 07:40:26.310
<v Speaker 18>the end of this is going to get cut off.</v>
<v Speaker 18>No,</v>

10269
07:40:26.350 --> 07:40:27.183
<v Speaker 18>we're way,</v>
<v Speaker 18>if you're watching live just literally </v>

10270
07:40:30.921 --> 07:40:35.450
<v Speaker 18>never done an eight or a license,</v>

07:40:38.840 --> 07:40:41.360
<v Speaker 18>That.</v>
<v Speaker 18>That's a thing I can definitely for sure</v>

10273
07:40:41.361 --> 07:40:46.100
<v Speaker 18>it is a thing at least because we didn't</v>
<v Speaker 18>get the seven hour and 40 minute mark,</v>

10274
07:40:46.101 --> 07:40:47.680
<v Speaker 18>so we're not that dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 18>Okay.</v>

10275
