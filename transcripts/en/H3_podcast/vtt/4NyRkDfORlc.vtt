73
00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.223

<v Speaker 1>I mean I get more like I want people to </v>

74
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 1>feel like they got their money's worth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I want people to leave.</v>

<v Speaker 1>is on the way up.</v>

77

<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

78
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 1>then it becomes like responsibility.</v>

79
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Like these people spent their hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>earned money coming out.</v>

00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:46.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's OCD,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

122
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I depends on what your childhood was.</v>

123
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:50.643
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had a childhood and you weren't </v>

124
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:53.110
<v Speaker 1>bullied at all and you still think like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

125
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:55.570
<v Speaker 1>I would think it was some sort of ocd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

126
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.600
<v Speaker 1>he got kicked out of yours for a while </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

127
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 1>So city you're kind of looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

128
00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:01.740
<v Speaker 1>your Z.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

129
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to diagnose you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

130
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in my case it was probably just,</v>

131
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:06.574
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my childhood or whatever and it's just </v>

132
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:07.871
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

133
00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:09.610
<v Speaker 1>you got bullied as a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

134
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both.</v>

135
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.370
<v Speaker 1>I did bully I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

136
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.233
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

137
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.610
<v Speaker 1>get it off of me and I'd pick on </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody weaker than me.</v>

138
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:18.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the Lord of the flies back then.</v>

139
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.980
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't the way it is now where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

140
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go on Youtube and the next thing</v>

141
00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:25.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bullies crying for some reason.</v>

142
00:05:25.631 --> 00:05:26.464
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like bullies almost important in </v>

143
00:05:31.211 --> 00:05:31.781
<v Speaker 1>a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

144
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Like you got to allow kids to give each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other shit in a sense.</v>

145
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can't call it a kids too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

146
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't think as a parent you ever allow</v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

147
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it's,</v>

148
00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:45.130
<v Speaker 1>it's something though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean I know that there's like a,</v>

149
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.640
<v Speaker 1>like I have a daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want her to take some mma and I,</v>

150
00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:54.160
<v Speaker 1>I just think all women should know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I feel like rapists,</v>

151
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on how well they're in doubt,</v>

152
00:05:56.501 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 1>at some point they're going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get in close.</v>

153
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.570
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like no one killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

154
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.351
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

155
00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:04.184
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think like when you watch those </v>

156
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:10.400
<v Speaker 1>women fighting in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like this,</v>

157
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean this probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would think what I have,</v>

158
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.913
<v Speaker 1>what percentage of the population of </v>
<v Speaker 1>just guys that even know how to fight </v>

159
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.003
<v Speaker 1>sure could beat them and like I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>think they could because the second you </v>

160
00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:23.520
<v Speaker 1>get close to him and he's a professional</v>
<v Speaker 1>level fighters,</v>

161
00:06:23.521 --> 00:06:26.990
<v Speaker 1>so if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average woman would learn that.</v>

162
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could get them in a triangle.</v>

163
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.900
<v Speaker 1>The arms are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I said the armed guard,</v>

164
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to remember all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogan says like,</v>

165
00:06:32.411 --> 00:06:32.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

166
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not educated in it,</v>

167
00:06:34.271 --> 00:06:35.104
<v Speaker 1>but I just know looking at it that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like learn a little self defense </v>

168
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.480
<v Speaker 1>just enough that you can be on your back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be in a powerful position.</v>

169
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.870
<v Speaker 1>And I just figured like a guy's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to gorillas weigh in and try to hold</v>

170
00:06:46.871 --> 00:06:48.520
<v Speaker 1>you down or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden he's,</v>

171
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:49.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's tapping out,</v>

172
00:06:49.631 --> 00:06:50.464
<v Speaker 1>you blow out his elbow and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's an erection killer right </v>

173
00:06:53.231 --> 00:06:53.710
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

174
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.710
<v Speaker 1>You blow up the elbow as it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's slang for the arm bar.</v>

175
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.380
<v Speaker 1>See yet that's part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's a new thing.</v>

176
00:07:05.381 --> 00:07:10.090
<v Speaker 1>You're already worried about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter being sexually assaulted.</v>

177
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how old is your daughter?</v>

178
00:07:11.351 --> 00:07:12.184
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's you projecting your ocd </v>

179
00:07:14.831 --> 00:07:18.070
<v Speaker 1>on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all we you're talking about,</v>

180
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want your,</v>

181
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.810
<v Speaker 1>your two year old daughter to get Krav </v>
<v Speaker 1>mcgraw so she could knife a dude's neck.</v>

182
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean it's like,</v>

183
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:25.880
<v Speaker 1>it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

184
00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:26.714
<v Speaker 1>that didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like sexual assault started in </v>

185
00:07:29.391 --> 00:07:30.560
<v Speaker 1>2014.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>

186
00:07:30.561 --> 00:07:34.040
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that is about what has always</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened and uh,</v>

187
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:35.151
<v Speaker 1>and then also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

188
00:07:35.151 --> 00:07:38.110
<v Speaker 1>it gives you like confidence and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>really is all you gotta do.</v>

189
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was elementary,</v>

190
00:07:40.071 --> 00:07:42.620
<v Speaker 1>middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in high school and you know,</v>

191
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.413
<v Speaker 1>I feel like somewhere in junior high you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just had to have one fight and fight </v>

192
00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:49.270
<v Speaker 1>back and then it was like prison and was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

193
00:07:49.271 --> 00:07:49.820
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

194
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to be a problem.</v>

195
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.630
<v Speaker 1>And then they would just move on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the kids who never fought back,</v>

196
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

197
00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.520
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just have these horrible variances.</v>

198
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I dunno,</v>

199
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:01.191
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

200
00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:02.300
<v Speaker 1>it's just one of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

201
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.220
<v Speaker 1>as a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess what I meant is like,</v>

202
00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:05.054
<v Speaker 1>now that you're a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you thinking about things differently </v>

203
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.350
<v Speaker 1>possibly and with kids and with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter,</v>

204
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:10.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how has that changed?</v>

205
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.090
<v Speaker 1>I would say I am applying the things I </v>
<v Speaker 1>always thought about because I,</v>

206
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.200
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because for all these years of not being</v>

207
00:08:16.201 --> 00:08:18.210
<v Speaker 1>a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would watch parents,</v>

208
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:19.793
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dressing their kids in certain ways and </v>

209
00:08:21.121 --> 00:08:23.550
<v Speaker 1>I would just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you not see that?</v>

210
00:08:23.551 --> 00:08:25.520
<v Speaker 1>That is that the shit that that kid's </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna get,</v>

211
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.190
<v Speaker 1>get it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

212
00:08:27.191 --> 00:08:30.370
<v Speaker 1>And it's just like for the love of God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you give them a fighting chance?</v>

213
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

214
00:08:32.431 --> 00:08:34.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

215
00:08:34.531 --> 00:08:35.160
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

216
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.050
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you,</v>

217
00:08:37.051 --> 00:08:37.711
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you grow up,</v>

218
00:08:37.711 --> 00:08:38.544
<v Speaker 1>you become one and you either completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget your childhood or you have a </v>

219
00:08:40.681 --> 00:08:41.760
<v Speaker 1>pretty vivid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>

220
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.150
<v Speaker 1>Murray of it and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

221
00:08:43.151 --> 00:08:45.040
<v Speaker 1>it's most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of my channel is positive.</v>

222
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.620
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting observation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

223
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.830
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I forgot most of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means it probably had a decent one.</v>

224
00:08:50.831 --> 00:08:52.500
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or the good ones,</v>

225
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.440
<v Speaker 1>the one you forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

226
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:55.590
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I had,</v>

227
00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:57.840
<v Speaker 1>I had no good in a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

228
00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:58.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what though.</v>

229
00:08:58.821 --> 00:08:59.654
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just think like the people I've </v>

230
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:01.734
<v Speaker 1>talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they either like remember everything or </v>

231
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.620
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

232
00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:05.940
<v Speaker 1>that was a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

233
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.433
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think if you don't remember and </v>

234
00:09:10.141 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 1>then you have a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

235
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:14.220
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would rather be the kid and the parent</v>

236
00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:15.410
<v Speaker 1>that remembers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

237
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.473
<v Speaker 1>So how do you forget my mother said the </v>
<v Speaker 1>forties actually was kind of </v>

238
00:09:19.201 --> 00:09:20.370
<v Speaker 1>heartbreaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>

239
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.590
<v Speaker 1>my daughter is only a year and a half </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was going,</v>

240
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:27.600
<v Speaker 1>I just really enjoy these first three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four years as she got,</v>

241
00:09:28.221 --> 00:09:29.054
<v Speaker 1>she goes really enjoying before they go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to school and you know the kids ruin </v>

242
00:09:31.411 --> 00:09:32.244
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

243
00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:34.533
<v Speaker 1>Like wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like one of the funniest and </v>

244
00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:39.900
<v Speaker 1>saddest things you ever said button.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I was thinking like,</v>

245
00:09:39.901 --> 00:09:43.140
<v Speaker 1>why did she think I was ruined?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I probably was on some level.</v>

246
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:46.470
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>remembered that after all these years.</v>

247
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Well because he came home from school </v>
<v Speaker 1>ruined.</v>

248
00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:49.683
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just going to send your kids to </v>

249
00:09:50.611 --> 00:09:51.444
<v Speaker 1>school with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people who have kids that they're </v>

250
00:09:52.711 --> 00:09:53.544
<v Speaker 1>not actively involved in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then the kids acting out and </v>

251
00:09:57.031 --> 00:09:57.864
<v Speaker 1>there they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids on his way to becoming a </v>

252
00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:03.600
<v Speaker 1>problem and then your kid sees that </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior starts to mimic it.</v>

253
00:10:03.601 --> 00:10:04.141
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

254
00:10:04.141 --> 00:10:06.710
<v Speaker 1>a lot of my friends obviously have kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are older and they just,</v>

255
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:07.563
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

256
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just kids that are just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

257
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the key is not to get mad at the kid.</v>

258
00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:15.690
<v Speaker 1>You got to get mad at the parents know </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ever want to punch the kid,</v>

259
00:10:15.691 --> 00:10:16.740
<v Speaker 1>you don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

260
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Don't punch the parent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Punched the,</v>

261
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.390
<v Speaker 1>when dog I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a tee shirt.</v>

262
00:10:21.391 --> 00:10:22.224
<v Speaker 1>I just got that.</v>

263
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.730
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I say we dogs now because we have</v>

264
00:10:26.731 --> 00:10:29.370
<v Speaker 1>a dog and we go to a dog park a lot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

265
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:34.290
<v Speaker 1>And like it's always the owner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The owner is not always,</v>

266
00:10:34.291 --> 00:10:35.130
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

267
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.360
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

268
00:10:36.361 --> 00:10:37.194
<v Speaker 1>I dunno because dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's this pure sweet </v>

269
00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:42.960
<v Speaker 1>souls for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have to be fucked up kind of by</v>

270
00:10:42.961 --> 00:10:46.320
<v Speaker 1>the owner to be really or dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

271
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:47.183
<v Speaker 1>There's the dogs that nature says no to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people say yes to because it's </v>

272
00:10:50.101 --> 00:10:51.960
<v Speaker 1>adorable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you like the mother just,</v>

273
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.320
<v Speaker 1>there's an inherently knows that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something fucked up with the dog,</v>

274
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.930
<v Speaker 1>kicks it away and the thing's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>starve to death.</v>

275
00:10:57.931 --> 00:11:00.720
<v Speaker 1>And that's too heartbreaking as a human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being in a dog lover to watch.</v>

276
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you give it the bottle and like,</v>

277
00:11:02.571 --> 00:11:03.404
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then one day you see it's got one red </v>

278
00:11:04.771 --> 00:11:07.200
<v Speaker 1>eye and the other he got the terminator.</v>

279
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about like an adopted dog</v>

280
00:11:09.181 --> 00:11:12.330
<v Speaker 1>or like a getting a puppy because I feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you adopted dog,</v>

281
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.980
<v Speaker 1>you definitely throw the dice a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>

282
00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:15.450
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

283
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.313
<v Speaker 1>I had a rescue dog so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the other pit bull that was my </v>

284
00:11:18.751 --> 00:11:21.990
<v Speaker 1>experience yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we ended up having to find her a new</v>

285
00:11:21.991 --> 00:11:24.270
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And fortunately it worked out,</v>

286
00:11:24.271 --> 00:11:27.000
<v Speaker 1>but she was a human aggressive as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

287
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:27.973
<v Speaker 1>I spent thousands of dollars trainers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all this types of things like my </v>

288
00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:32.124
<v Speaker 1>trainer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it ended up taking her and it has </v>

289
00:11:33.991 --> 00:11:37.620
<v Speaker 1>been like the challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of his dog curry.</v>

290
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.500
<v Speaker 1>One of the trainer adopted the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

291
00:11:40.501 --> 00:11:41.710
<v Speaker 1>It took incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

292
00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:42.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has He,</v>

293
00:11:42.691 --> 00:11:45.090
<v Speaker 1>Ted's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he managed to tame the animal.</v>

294
00:11:45.091 --> 00:11:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Now he's been working with her for two </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and she,</v>

295
00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:50.130
<v Speaker 1>she's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the first time in her life,</v>

296
00:11:50.131 --> 00:11:51.690
<v Speaker 1>has another dog friend.</v>

297
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.340
<v Speaker 1>But he was the one who said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

298
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.320
<v Speaker 1>this is one of these dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nature said no to,</v>

299
00:11:56.321 --> 00:11:57.310
<v Speaker 1>but people said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

300
00:11:57.311 --> 00:12:00.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking that that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she's an absolute,</v>

301
00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:03.580
<v Speaker 1>she's one of those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if she was just abandoned again and</v>

302
00:12:03.581 --> 00:12:06.130
<v Speaker 1>then came in here and then met the three</v>
<v Speaker 1>of us once,</v>

303
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.053
<v Speaker 1>she'd be all timid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once she saw that we were cool and </v>

304
00:12:10.241 --> 00:12:12.190
<v Speaker 1>we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you fed her and protecting her,</v>

305
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:14.350
<v Speaker 1>she loved you and she almost love to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>

306
00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

307
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.863
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then she would treat everybody else </v>

308
00:12:16.991 --> 00:12:18.610
<v Speaker 1>who came through that door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

309
00:12:18.611 --> 00:12:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Like they were an ax murderer and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>would just never,</v>

310
00:12:21.881 --> 00:12:23.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I had all these things I used to,</v>

311
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my buddies,</v>

312
00:12:25.451 --> 00:12:26.284
<v Speaker 1>a forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we used to just go on hikes and it took </v>

313
00:12:29.531 --> 00:12:30.880
<v Speaker 1>forever and ever and ever and ever and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

314
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.713
<v Speaker 1>But he was really good with animals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she ended up accepting him and it was </v>

315
00:12:35.891 --> 00:12:37.300
<v Speaker 1>the longest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

316
00:12:37.301 --> 00:12:39.460
<v Speaker 1>and I had to do all like come back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the house and just,</v>

317
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:40.900
<v Speaker 1>just have him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

318
00:12:40.901 --> 00:12:41.734
<v Speaker 1>stop at the gate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it was a little bit behind the </v>

319
00:12:43.481 --> 00:12:45.890
<v Speaker 1>gate and then up to the front door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

320
00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.020
<v Speaker 1>and then there was all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>him walking in first and just any little</v>

321
00:12:50.021 --> 00:12:52.930
<v Speaker 1>thing could cause like a setback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

322
00:12:52.931 --> 00:12:53.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

323
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:57.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was emotionally draining.</v>

324
00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

325
00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:00.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

326
00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:00.904
<v Speaker 1>she ended up buying one of my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always keep thinking of that Mama and </v>

327
00:13:03.361 --> 00:13:05.130
<v Speaker 1>she raced Adam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a pocket,</v>

328
00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.030
<v Speaker 1>I should have kicked it because he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

329
00:13:07.031 --> 00:13:09.670
<v Speaker 1>she was on like a hardwood floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went and knocked her down,</v>

330
00:13:09.671 --> 00:13:11.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would've been just fine.</v>

331
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:12.940
<v Speaker 1>Was he her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

332
00:13:12.941 --> 00:13:16.120
<v Speaker 1>she barely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause she hadn't done that before so she</v>

333
00:13:16.121 --> 00:13:16.570
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

334
00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:19.570
<v Speaker 1>but how it works is at first they go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the feet,</v>

335
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.433
<v Speaker 1>then they go higher and each time as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they build up and then it's fight and </v>

336
00:13:23.381 --> 00:13:25.020
<v Speaker 1>then grab it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it just,</v>

337
00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:26.043
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like an escalating like </v>

338
00:13:27.701 --> 00:13:30.010
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

339
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:31.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm talking kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

340
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.033
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know a lot of this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there'd be a bunch of people right </v>

341
00:13:35.621 --> 00:13:36.454
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just talking about what my </v>

342
00:13:38.831 --> 00:13:39.664
<v Speaker 1>experience was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying I know everything about </v>

343
00:13:40.811 --> 00:13:41.644
<v Speaker 1>dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

344
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:42.903
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of I was afraid to adopt </v>

345
00:13:44.351 --> 00:13:45.820
<v Speaker 1>because you just never know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get.</v>

346
00:13:45.821 --> 00:13:47.740
<v Speaker 1>And people give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause we bought,</v>

347
00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:49.330
<v Speaker 1>we bought a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We wanted,</v>

348
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.060
<v Speaker 1>we wanted a purebred puppy or not a pure</v>
<v Speaker 1>bed,</v>

349
00:13:52.061 --> 00:13:54.130
<v Speaker 1>but we really liked the Maltese and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Yorkies.</v>

350
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.520
<v Speaker 1>We have a friend who had to military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

351
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.240
<v Speaker 1>and we really liked them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we were like,</v>

352
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:02.140
<v Speaker 1>so we've got a file.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can got a falcon.</v>

353
00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.370
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Multisite.</v>

354
00:14:03.371 --> 00:14:04.690
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh it was a maltese.</v>

355
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.490
<v Speaker 1>Just a little fluffy white dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

356
00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.353
<v Speaker 1>it's a little toy dog that you can pet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we get so much shit for having </v>

357
00:14:13.541 --> 00:14:14.890
<v Speaker 1>bought a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

358
00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:16.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you throw the dice when you,</v>

359
00:14:16.681 --> 00:14:18.790
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what these dogs at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pound has been through.</v>

360
00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:19.571
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

361
00:14:19.571 --> 00:14:20.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

362
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.500
<v Speaker 1>were you supposed to do just what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to have a puppy mill ones?</v>

363
00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:24.363
<v Speaker 1>These dogs need to be a Bot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody's got to take care of these </v>

364
00:14:26.891 --> 00:14:27.671
<v Speaker 1>dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

365
00:14:27.671 --> 00:14:28.504
<v Speaker 1>you need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to know what you're doing when </v>

366
00:14:29.801 --> 00:14:32.050
<v Speaker 1>you can get a rescue to train them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

367
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:32.943
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

368
00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:33.960
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

369
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:38.630
<v Speaker 1>for me it's my first dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't want to gamble too my chin.</v>

370
00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:43.870
<v Speaker 1>But it's because it feels like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you're walking down the street</v>

371
00:14:43.871 --> 00:14:45.250
<v Speaker 1>with him and people be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

372
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:48.040
<v Speaker 1>where'd you get him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you didn't buy that dog.</v>

373
00:14:48.041 --> 00:14:48.874
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

374
00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:51.860
<v Speaker 1>if you care that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

375
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:53.023
<v Speaker 1>this is something that bothers me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you care that much about adopting </v>

376
00:14:56.391 --> 00:14:58.280
<v Speaker 1>dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you have a kid?</v>

377
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.650
<v Speaker 1>You got to adopt kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

378
00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.513
<v Speaker 1>There's kids out there that need a home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare you have a kid of your own if </v>

379
00:15:05.061 --> 00:15:07.280
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to adopt first heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same logic.</v>

380
00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:08.840
<v Speaker 1>It's basically a puppy mill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

381
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.110
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

382
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:12.590
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got bills and toys to map.</v>

383
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:16.430
<v Speaker 1>My theory has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was in your situation,</v>

384
00:15:16.431 --> 00:15:18.440
<v Speaker 1>I would just annoy the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

385
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.520
<v Speaker 1>I would call volunteer it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

386
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.980
<v Speaker 1>I got an a thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a Brit mean.</v>

387
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:24.933
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like the least sick we looking </v>

388
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:27.160
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

389
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figured I'd get that one.</v>

390
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

391
00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just steer into it.</v>

392
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.680
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need,</v>

393
00:15:33.681 --> 00:15:36.800
<v Speaker 1>that's why I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was over in France and like I'm trying</v>

394
00:15:36.801 --> 00:15:39.260
<v Speaker 1>to learn how to speak French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have been bad with it,</v>

395
00:15:39.261 --> 00:15:41.300
<v Speaker 1>but like when I would go over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

396
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.340
<v Speaker 1>if you stink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just start speaking English.</v>

397
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:44.420
<v Speaker 1>And I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

398
00:15:44.421 --> 00:15:45.254
<v Speaker 1>if I get to listen to the English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're listening to my French and I </v>

399
00:15:46.911 --> 00:15:49.430
<v Speaker 1>would just torture him with it and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would not switch over.</v>

400
00:15:49.431 --> 00:15:53.030
<v Speaker 1>And it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I speak English and I speak French.</v>

401
00:15:53.031 --> 00:15:54.620
<v Speaker 1>I speak French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

402
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:58.370
<v Speaker 1>This is the situation or the smart way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>

403
00:15:58.371 --> 00:15:59.930
<v Speaker 1>That's the way to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

404
00:15:59.931 --> 00:16:01.430
<v Speaker 1>What else am I going to learn?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

405
00:16:01.431 --> 00:16:02.264
<v Speaker 1>I lived in Israel with Isla for five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and I succumbed because every </v>

406
00:16:05.541 --> 00:16:07.040
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

407
00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:07.521
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

408
00:16:07.521 --> 00:16:09.470
<v Speaker 1>this idiot American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna speak English to them.</v>

409
00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:12.110
<v Speaker 1>And I succumbed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't steer in.</v>

410
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.360
<v Speaker 1>I wish I steered it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to,</v>

411
00:16:14.361 --> 00:16:15.194
<v Speaker 1>you got to get into the comedy of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just fortunately them with their own </v>

412
00:16:17.121 --> 00:16:18.230
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really funny.</v>

413
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.240
<v Speaker 1>They maybe look at immigrants </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently,</v>

414
00:16:20.241 --> 00:16:20.810
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

415
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:22.040
<v Speaker 1>but I guess it immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worse.</v>

416
00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:23.780
<v Speaker 1>It's worse because they're actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>staying,</v>

417
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.060
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would be like,</v>

418
00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.340
<v Speaker 1>I would be like the fact that I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be there for 10 days.</v>

419
00:16:28.341 --> 00:16:29.174
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to get employed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of give a fuck and I just have a </v>

420
00:16:31.221 --> 00:16:33.050
<v Speaker 1>good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

421
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a great time at a great time doing</v>

422
00:16:35.421 --> 00:16:37.910
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to get a shirt that says I bought</v>

423
00:16:37.911 --> 00:16:40.460
<v Speaker 1>this dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

424
00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.200
<v Speaker 1>So you probably never spent much time at</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dog park because there's a whole thing</v>

425
00:16:45.201 --> 00:16:46.034
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sounds like your dog would have </v>

426
00:16:47.091 --> 00:16:48.350
<v Speaker 1>just gone on a rampage there.</v>

427
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:49.183
<v Speaker 1>Probably she was all right initially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then once she sort of bonded with </v>

428
00:16:52.101 --> 00:16:53.210
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it became a problem.</v>

429
00:16:53.211 --> 00:16:54.050
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we stay,</v>

430
00:16:54.051 --> 00:16:56.510
<v Speaker 1>I stayed away from there and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then everybody else who watches like the</v>

431
00:16:56.511 --> 00:16:57.344
<v Speaker 1>dog whisperer in that and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to be the guy running the </v>

432
00:16:59.631 --> 00:17:00.890
<v Speaker 1>shirtless up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

433
00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:02.540
<v Speaker 1>everybody does it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even know what it is.</v>

434
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.570
<v Speaker 1>See if you would've stayed through that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that for a while.</v>

435
00:17:05.571 --> 00:17:09.950
<v Speaker 1>Like the magic was making that noise and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>

436
00:17:09.951 --> 00:17:12.910
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's been working Walcott ever.</v>

437
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:13.873
<v Speaker 1>Does he even know anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also wonder does he just pretend like </v>

438
00:17:16.461 --> 00:17:19.070
<v Speaker 1>he knows and then we believe him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

439
00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:20.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're right.</v>

440
00:17:20.691 --> 00:17:22.310
<v Speaker 1>You're really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's doing this.</v>

441
00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:23.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that do?</v>

442
00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.060
<v Speaker 1>Well I think the guy knows what he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

443
00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got a TV show.</v>

444
00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:28.693
<v Speaker 1>There's people he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he worked with a lot of famous </v>

445
00:17:30.231 --> 00:17:32.700
<v Speaker 1>people's dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No famous people got eaten by dogs.</v>

446
00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.240
<v Speaker 1>So I would say some level nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

447
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're really cynical guide man.</v>

448
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:45.640
<v Speaker 1>That is a lot for me to say that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>cynical either the bill birth yet,</v>

449
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:48.320
<v Speaker 1>but you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what you're not,</v>

450
00:17:48.321 --> 00:17:49.154
<v Speaker 1>it's going to close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People think like I listen to your </v>

451
00:17:50.011 --> 00:17:52.590
<v Speaker 1>podcasts a lot and you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a very optimistic,</v>

452
00:17:52.591 --> 00:17:53.424
<v Speaker 1>fair guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like a real fairness behind </v>

453
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:55.853
<v Speaker 1>everything you say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nice to be listened to every once </v>

454
00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.100
<v Speaker 1>everybody else go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

455
00:17:59.101 --> 00:18:00.970

<v Speaker 1>I'll rage common.</v>

456
00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:02.850
<v Speaker 1>I think cap guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know,</v>

457
00:18:02.851 --> 00:18:05.040
<v Speaker 1>I used to be a redhead before it left </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

458
00:18:05.041 --> 00:18:07.680
<v Speaker 1>but I still have the red beard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just something about like,</v>

459
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.900
<v Speaker 1>you can sort of openly say that redheads</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the child,</v>

460
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:13.830
<v Speaker 1>children of Satan and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's totally fell all good.</v>

461
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.570
<v Speaker 1>It's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kick of Ginger Day.</v>

465
00:18:22.111 --> 00:18:23.760
<v Speaker 1>to care about whatever you're crying </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

466
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.920
<v Speaker 1>And particularly white women complaining</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how difficult it is to live in the</v>

467
00:18:28.921 --> 00:18:30.960
<v Speaker 1>United States of America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is hilarious.</v>

468
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.940
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean look,</v>

475
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.030
<v Speaker 1>it's just more like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's a myth dude.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like over,</v>

481
00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.400
<v Speaker 1>over the corner,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Cause it's like you got a bullseye on </v>

484
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:04.740
<v Speaker 1>top of your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

485
00:19:04.741 --> 00:19:07.380
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

486
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.720
<v Speaker 1>I always joke with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had like brown hair,</v>

487
00:19:09.721 --> 00:19:11.130
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't even be in this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

488
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:11.963
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it would be funny and I </v>

<v Speaker 1>dentist when,</v>

498
00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:37.453
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at what point did you decide you wanted </v>

499
00:19:38.401 --> 00:19:40.980
<v Speaker 1>to get a comedy when you were doing like</v>
<v Speaker 1>dental assisting?</v>

00:19:40.981 --> 00:19:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Or was that just kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you always knew you wanted the job?</v>

501
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.740
<v Speaker 1>I needed a job and I got fired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

502
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.210
<v Speaker 1>from this warehouse because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it was this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fat guy who was running,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

505
00:19:55.311 --> 00:19:56.144
<v Speaker 1>And he used to come out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know like the typical Douche who </v>

506
00:19:59.091 --> 00:20:01.350
<v Speaker 1>could like just gets a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>power and it just,</v>

507

<v Speaker 1>I don't know why and then they just go </v>
<v Speaker 1>pure evil,</v>

508
00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:05.880
<v Speaker 1>pure evil.</v>

509
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.713
<v Speaker 1>But he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just walked out there like he had </v>

<v Speaker 1>walking.</v>

512
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.950
<v Speaker 1>So he used to come out there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody would seem common and then try</v>

513
00:20:16.951 --> 00:20:17.784
<v Speaker 1>to like work it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look at me cutting up the box and </v>

<v Speaker 1>And if anything I would,</v>

518
00:20:26.521 --> 00:20:28.770
<v Speaker 1>I would step off the gas a little bit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That has loved it,</v>

526
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.100

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

527
00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Cause it'll stop your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to work as a team.</v>

528
00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.780
<v Speaker 1>There's a plane crash and maybe we </v>
<v Speaker 1>should go this way.</v>

529
00:20:52.781 --> 00:20:54.620
<v Speaker 1>And I've gone,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the woods.</v>

<v Speaker 1>But like not fuck everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fuck these guys that don't deserve </v>

532
00:21:01.061 --> 00:21:02.140
<v Speaker 1>my respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

533
00:21:02.141 --> 00:21:05.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't work as hard and then I,</v>

534
00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:06.783
<v Speaker 1>and I was due for raise it and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked for a raise and then magically I </v>

535
00:21:08.681 --> 00:21:12.700
<v Speaker 1>got laid off and the economy was bad and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get a job.</v>

536
00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.070
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I needed,</v>

537
00:21:15.071 --> 00:21:17.200
<v Speaker 1>one of my dad was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why don't you come work with me for</v>

538
00:21:17.201 --> 00:21:18.640
<v Speaker 1>a little bit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I did and it,</v>

539
00:21:18.641 --> 00:21:20.260
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was great cause I got,</v>

540
00:21:20.261 --> 00:21:21.094
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked with him for five years and it </v>

541
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:23.080
<v Speaker 1>went wow.</v>

542
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:27.010
<v Speaker 1>And I got to a sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

543
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:29.800
<v Speaker 1>by not seeing my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just seeing him as a dentist,</v>

544
00:21:29.801 --> 00:21:31.790
<v Speaker 1>like I kind of got to figure him out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

545
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:34.090
<v Speaker 1>and understand them more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was a great thing.</v>

546
00:21:34.091 --> 00:21:38.040
<v Speaker 1>And then also I learned so much about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

547
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.660
<v Speaker 1>teeth and all of the headaches that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>can cause uh,</v>

548
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:42.933
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'd still take x rays </v>

549
00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.760
<v Speaker 1>because they switched up the machinery </v>
<v Speaker 1>so long go since when I did it.</v>

550
00:21:48.761 --> 00:21:50.650
<v Speaker 1>But I could still take impressions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pour 'em up.</v>

551
00:21:50.651 --> 00:21:51.484
<v Speaker 1>I still don't have the old school way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We tap on that vibrating thing to get </v>

552
00:21:54.821 --> 00:21:55.654
<v Speaker 1>all the apples out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing worse than if there was a </v>

553
00:21:58.031 --> 00:21:58.864
<v Speaker 1>fall because the bubble would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always seem to go down to the </v>

554
00:22:00.641 --> 00:22:01.474
<v Speaker 1>bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it then another one would always be </v>

555
00:22:02.681 --> 00:22:03.514
<v Speaker 1>right where the tooth was and then like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bubble wouldn't take the w would </v>

556
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:07.180
<v Speaker 1>kill that impression.</v>

557
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that part of it.</v>

558
00:22:09.251 --> 00:22:11.760
<v Speaker 1>And you'd have to talk about when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>put like the clay in someone's mouth.</v>

559
00:22:11.761 --> 00:22:12.594
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can't just report because </v>

560
00:22:14.741 --> 00:22:15.420
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

561
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.253
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gunk shrinks and then you have to </v>

562
00:22:17.891 --> 00:22:20.170
<v Speaker 1>Redo it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you had a gagger and you had</v>

563
00:22:20.171 --> 00:22:21.004
<v Speaker 1>to read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I will fucking guy I puked at the </v>

564
00:22:22.331 --> 00:22:23.540
<v Speaker 1>dentist when they took her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

565
00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.840
<v Speaker 1>I was a gagger man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Broke my heart.</v>

566
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:27.680
<v Speaker 1>One of those bubbles popped in my mold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

567
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:30.190
<v Speaker 1>There was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to just,</v>

568
00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.320
<v Speaker 1>what are the kinds of crazy shit you </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal as a,</v>

569
00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.860
<v Speaker 1>you ever getting people's mouths or were</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just on Stan?</v>

570
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:36.703
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took out the stitches and that was </v>

571
00:22:37.901 --> 00:22:40.090
<v Speaker 1>certified to take x rays and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

572
00:22:40.091 --> 00:22:42.550
<v Speaker 1>it was about the extent of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when did that,</v>

573
00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:45.610
<v Speaker 1>and then did an end when you started </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing comedy?</v>

574
00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:47.140
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing,</v>

575
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:51.790

<v Speaker 1>and it was hilarious.</v>

576

<v Speaker 1>He like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like a force of nature.</v>

583
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:08.763
<v Speaker 1>Like he did the work of three dentists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to work with the other </v>

584
00:23:11.231 --> 00:23:14.320
<v Speaker 1>dentists because it was just like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could actually get a lunch.</v>

585
00:23:14.321 --> 00:23:15.154
<v Speaker 1>We used to police to numb people up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be numb people up and then race out </v>

586
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.720
<v Speaker 1>while they were getting numb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just wolf down slice of pizza.</v>

587
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be on your feet.</v>

588
00:23:24.071 --> 00:23:25.270
<v Speaker 1>The whole day is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

589
00:23:25.271 --> 00:23:26.104
<v Speaker 1>I got my work ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both my parents worked extremely hard </v>

590
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:30.940
<v Speaker 1>their whole lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

591
00:23:30.941 --> 00:23:34.000
<v Speaker 1>they're older now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're retired and stuff,</v>

592
00:23:34.001 --> 00:23:34.990
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

593
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:39.820
<v Speaker 1>but just watching how hard they worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that that is one of the main</v>

594
00:23:39.821 --> 00:23:43.810
<v Speaker 1>reasons why I got this gig coming up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>New York was,</v>

595
00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:46.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

596
00:23:46.241 --> 00:23:47.680
<v Speaker 1>it was a combination of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of learning.</v>

597
00:23:47.681 --> 00:23:48.514
<v Speaker 1>That's what working is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then coming up in the Boston comedy </v>

598
00:23:50.921 --> 00:23:54.880
<v Speaker 1>scene where like what was considered </v>
<v Speaker 1>killing there.</v>

599
00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:56.913
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>

600
00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:59.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was considered just getting the job</v>

601
00:23:59.791 --> 00:24:02.370
<v Speaker 1>done was killing and some of these other</v>
<v Speaker 1>cities that I went to,</v>

602
00:24:02.371 --> 00:24:04.340
<v Speaker 1>but like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was just laying in grounds.</v>

603
00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:04.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

604
00:24:04.941 --> 00:24:05.910
<v Speaker 1>they murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a guy,</v>

605
00:24:05.911 --> 00:24:07.560
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Knox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest his soul.</v>

606
00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:12.540
<v Speaker 1>He used to host the show and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>patrice rest his soul.</v>

607
00:24:12.541 --> 00:24:14.280
<v Speaker 1>He used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

608
00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Kevin doesn't host a show as much as he </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

609
00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.633
<v Speaker 1>takes breaks from killing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he would like murder and then you </v>

610
00:24:20.701 --> 00:24:21.534
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we used to compare it to like a </v>

611
00:24:22.471 --> 00:24:24.840
<v Speaker 1>giant wave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd get up there and just find a ride.</v>

612
00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:26.063
<v Speaker 1>And he really took it personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you bombed on his show because he </v>

613
00:24:30.001 --> 00:24:32.430
<v Speaker 1>felt like the crowd looked at him like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kev,</v>

614
00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:34.710
<v Speaker 1>you fucked us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like who was like,</v>

615
00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:35.573
<v Speaker 1>like he took it personally responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he was the GM putting together a </v>

616
00:24:38.581 --> 00:24:39.630
<v Speaker 1>championship team.</v>

617
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.670
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we used to tell horror stories about</v>

618
00:24:41.671 --> 00:24:42.504
<v Speaker 1>having to follow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you have to follow with star trek </v>

619
00:24:43.711 --> 00:24:46.680
<v Speaker 1>bid or is drunk driving bid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were just all,</v>

620
00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.530
<v Speaker 1>they all murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

621
00:24:49.531 --> 00:24:50.730
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was probably,</v>

622
00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole thing.</v>

623
00:24:53.101 --> 00:24:58.101
<v Speaker 1>So I have a very low level of patience </v>
<v Speaker 1>for people that dog it at their jobs.</v>

624
00:24:59.071 --> 00:25:00.930
<v Speaker 1>And I don't give a fuck if you hate your</v>
<v Speaker 1>job,</v>

625
00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.290
<v Speaker 1>just going in there and just not doing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good job.</v>

626
00:25:04.291 --> 00:25:05.540
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

627
00:25:05.541 --> 00:25:06.374
<v Speaker 1>just like then Quinn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like don't make everybody else </v>

<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

629
00:25:10.981 --> 00:25:12.540

<v Speaker 1>it's bullshit.</v>

630
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Like you signed up to do this job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do the fucking job.</v>

631
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.860
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

632
00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:20.790
<v Speaker 1>and I really don't have any sympathy for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who don't work hard and,</v>

633
00:25:20.791 --> 00:25:21.624

636
00:25:24.041 --> 00:25:24.874
<v Speaker 1>to be in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're making an effort and you're </v>

637

00:25:43.331 --> 00:25:44.164
<v Speaker 2>you've probably heard this a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People say that dentists are like high </v>

<v Speaker 2>rate of suicide.</v>

650
00:25:51.461 --> 00:25:54.870

<v Speaker 1>but I never knew when that true.</v>

651
00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.080
<v Speaker 1>I've never known one that killed him.</v>

658
00:26:06.801 --> 00:26:08.510

<v Speaker 2>I got nothing done about it one night.</v>

661
00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.310
<v Speaker 2>I just thought that was interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

662
00:26:16.311 --> 00:26:19.190
<v Speaker 2>It's just one of those things you hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're just like accepted it on face</v>

663
00:26:19.191 --> 00:26:19.641
<v Speaker 2>value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

664
00:26:19.641 --> 00:26:20.474
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dentists,</v>

665
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:21.890
<v Speaker 2>they're all killing themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

666
00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.660
<v Speaker 2>That was all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the thing.</v>

667
00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:24.613
<v Speaker 2>The guy who put the pack of firecrackers</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the kids back pocket and lit it and </v>

668
00:26:27.621 --> 00:26:29.400
<v Speaker 2>blew half his ass off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you never heard that one,</v>

669
00:26:29.401 --> 00:26:31.400
<v Speaker 2>that these might be older ones before </v>
<v Speaker 2>your guys' time.</v>

670
00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.920
<v Speaker 2>But there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was these think candies called pop</v>

671
00:26:33.921 --> 00:26:34.754
<v Speaker 2>rocks.</v>

672
00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:36.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the pop box.</v>

673
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.903
<v Speaker 2>So the thing was somebody swelled a </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole bag and his stomach exploded and </v>

674
00:26:39.191 --> 00:26:40.024
<v Speaker 2>he died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all of those types of things </v>

675
00:26:41.691 --> 00:26:43.470
<v Speaker 2>existed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know what the new ones are.</v>

676
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.333
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was on his ipad and he fell asleep </v>

677
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.290
<v Speaker 2>and he burned his face trying to update </v>
<v Speaker 2>the technology.</v>

678
00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.970
<v Speaker 2>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's true actually.</v>

679
00:26:50.971 --> 00:26:52.710
<v Speaker 2>I heard that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Head on over to bill bird.com/events</v>

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:15.280
<v Speaker 2>and I do want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

820
00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:17.230
<v Speaker 2>you all have netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

821
00:34:17.231 --> 00:34:18.064
<v Speaker 2>everyone has netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Statistically half of Americans maybe </v>

822
00:34:19.991 --> 00:34:22.240
<v Speaker 2>even more have netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible,</v>

823
00:34:22.241 --> 00:34:23.074
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means that everybody should be </v>

824
00:34:25.631 --> 00:34:29.240
<v Speaker 2>watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Episode fabric is for family saving.</v>

825
00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.093
<v Speaker 2>More people have it considering how easy</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is to steal somebody's right </v>

826
00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.193
<v Speaker 2>password.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would say probably they don't care </v>

827
00:34:36.281 --> 00:34:37.390
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That blows my mind.</v>

828
00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:42.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this gi level loss like it's,</v>

829
00:34:42.071 --> 00:34:42.904

<v Speaker 2>someday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someday that relationships fail and </v>

00:34:46.711 --> 00:34:47.544
<v Speaker 2>they're only going to be halfway through</v>
<v Speaker 2>narcos and they can have to see the </v>

832
00:34:49.181 --> 00:34:50.014
<v Speaker 2>ending and then we'll get their account.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like they were so ahead of the game </v>

833
00:34:52.991 --> 00:34:55.600
<v Speaker 2>because all these companies with </v>

<v Speaker 2>there are so tight ass about it.</v>

884
00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.273
<v Speaker 1>You had a advertiser called Sherry's </v>
<v Speaker 1>berries and while you were reading the </v>

00:37:11.821 --> 00:37:14.470
<v Speaker 1>copy you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't hold it together because it</v>

886
00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:19.480
<v Speaker 1>was the first time reading the copy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just so homophobic and homoerotic</v>

887
00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:22.550
<v Speaker 1>if the same time that I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

00:37:23.971 --> 00:37:25.980
<v Speaker 1>It was actual cop and it's just so </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The it like I've never heard anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that being advertised.</v>

891
00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Evidently they're delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still still make hot chocolate.</v>

892
00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:36.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they dropped me after awhile.</v>

893
00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:41.670
<v Speaker 1>You know what happened was I had Harris </v>
<v Speaker 1>Stanton was on and they was like,</v>

894
00:37:41.671 --> 00:37:43.800
<v Speaker 1>we have strawberries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

895
00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:44.940
<v Speaker 1>drip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

896
00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:46.700
<v Speaker 1>dunked in white chocolate and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>

897
00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:47.820
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

898
00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:50.850
<v Speaker 1>in dark chocolates like oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've just jokingly said to him,</v>

899
00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:51.780
<v Speaker 1>he's black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

900
00:37:51.781 --> 00:37:53.690
<v Speaker 1>how come the white chocolate comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>before this and that?</v>

901
00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.850
<v Speaker 1>Then we started riffing on the Klan or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and then,</v>

902
00:37:56.851 --> 00:37:57.970
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

903
00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Then it was just two people can fit it </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

904
00:37:59.851 --> 00:38:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Strawberries are made by the clan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what they was saying.</v>

905
00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:04.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still sad they left.</v>

906
00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:08.680
<v Speaker 1>I loved going share.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I've never bought cherries,</v>

909
00:38:13.741 --> 00:38:14.574
<v Speaker 1>berries.</v>

910
00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:18.810
<v Speaker 1>cause I,</v>

1028
00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:15.140

<v Speaker 1>don't talk to your advertisers there.</v>

1029
00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:20.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like I didn't get into podcasting </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do a conference call with you fucking</v>

1030
00:43:21.231 --> 00:43:23.060
<v Speaker 1>guys talking about this shirt you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to sell.</v>

1031
00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Like I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a shirt you wrote.</v>

1032
00:43:25.611 --> 00:43:26.750
<v Speaker 1>What you going to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>

1033
00:43:26.751 --> 00:43:27.584
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to listen to you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like do you just trying to fill up your </v>

1034
00:43:29.901 --> 00:43:31.540
<v Speaker 1>day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many people in,</v>

1035
00:43:31.541 --> 00:43:35.390
<v Speaker 1>in those fucking corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just trying to justify that desk.</v>

1036
00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:38.600
<v Speaker 1>So then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>

1037
00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:40.183
<v Speaker 1>I hate when the conference call ends and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you hear this voice that you </v>

1038
00:43:42.351 --> 00:43:43.184
<v Speaker 1>haven't heard the whole call and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you were afraid that everyone was </v>

1039
00:43:47.121 --> 00:43:50.390
<v Speaker 1>going to hang up and you didn't say yes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now you're in a panic mode.</v>

1040
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:53.660
<v Speaker 1>So then they just throw something out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and you have to address it.</v>

1041
00:43:53.661 --> 00:43:54.494
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a legitimate comment w when it </v>

1042
00:43:56.271 --> 00:43:57.230
<v Speaker 1>isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>go through a lot of those because you </v>

1044
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:04.340
<v Speaker 1>went from being working kind of day jobs</v>
<v Speaker 1>to doing comedy full time.</v>

1045
00:44:04.341 --> 00:44:06.810
<v Speaker 1>I presume barely do them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I used to,</v>

1046
00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:08.953
<v Speaker 1>I used to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I had conference calls on scripts </v>

1047
00:44:10.821 --> 00:44:12.890
<v Speaker 1>or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I would do would,</v>

1048
00:44:12.891 --> 00:44:13.724
<v Speaker 1>I would put the phone on speaker and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would throw it to the other side of the </v>

1049
00:44:16.761 --> 00:44:18.770
<v Speaker 1>bed and then I would go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she got video.</v>

1050
00:44:18.771 --> 00:44:19.604
<v Speaker 1>I would literally lay on the bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with my arm across my eyes and I </v>

1051
00:44:23.421 --> 00:44:26.270
<v Speaker 1>would just wait for people to stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking and then I'd just be like,</v>

1052
00:44:26.271 --> 00:44:26.781
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1053
00:44:26.781 --> 00:44:27.614
<v Speaker 1>it sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know why I can watch so many </v>

1054
00:44:31.441 --> 00:44:33.270
<v Speaker 1>hours of sports yet.</v>

1055
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:34.530
<v Speaker 1>I can't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even,</v>

1056
00:44:34.531 --> 00:44:37.330
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't handle more than it.</v>

1057
00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:40.620
<v Speaker 1>They drive me insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1059
00:44:45.661 --> 00:44:47.100
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like an insane thing to do.</v>

1060
00:44:47.101 --> 00:44:47.940
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like rude.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's important.</v>

1065

1159
00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:33.453
<v Speaker 1>She was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1160
00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Can you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just wondering,</v>

1161
00:48:36.461 --> 00:48:38.710
<v Speaker 1>can you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you put the butter on it now?</v>

1162
00:48:38.711 --> 00:48:39.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I go to register,</v>

1163
00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:40.290
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1164
00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:42.130
<v Speaker 1>the buttons over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1165
00:48:42.131 --> 00:48:42.340
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1166
00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:44.140
<v Speaker 1>I was just hoping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you spread it now?</v>

1167
00:48:44.141 --> 00:48:45.220
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it's still warm.</v>

1168
00:48:45.221 --> 00:48:46.600
<v Speaker 1>I want it to be melted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you do that?</v>

1169
00:48:46.601 --> 00:48:48.220
<v Speaker 1>And she just goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1170
00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:49.143
<v Speaker 1>I love that fucking laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I looked there and she just looked </v>

1171
00:48:53.831 --> 00:48:57.060
<v Speaker 1>at me and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half a cigarette hanging out on him.</v>

1172
00:48:57.070 --> 00:48:58.360
<v Speaker 1>I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want us like ham and cheese?</v>

1173
00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:00.970
<v Speaker 1>But I guess that that mammary was you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1174
00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:01.873
<v Speaker 1>you have a good memory I think because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think I would have held onto even </v>

1175
00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:06.550
<v Speaker 1>even something that precious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you've always got,</v>

1176
00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do a twice a week too,</v>

1177
00:49:08.051 --> 00:49:08.884
<v Speaker 1>so there's a lot of time to fill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you somehow capture these memories </v>

1178
00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:14.600
<v Speaker 1>and retell it in a way optic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1179
00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:14.980

<v Speaker 1>My favorite little bit up on my podcast </v>

1181
00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:21.820
<v Speaker 1>is because I'm making my wife laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is my favorite thing in the world.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That is like my pocket.</v>

1184
00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:30.420
<v Speaker 1>That could be a horrible every once in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>while.</v>

1185
00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told her this story of a,</v>

1186
00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:38.050
<v Speaker 1>I first told the story of watching this </v>
<v Speaker 1>old guy wipe out on a scooter sliding on</v>

1187
00:49:38.051 --> 00:49:38.884
<v Speaker 1>his face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it reminded me of this time I </v>

1188
00:49:40.901 --> 00:49:42.470
<v Speaker 1>saw this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1189
00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:44.673
<v Speaker 1>this guy in griffith park was in street </v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes and went down the steepest hill </v>

1190
00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:51.880
<v Speaker 1>and wiped out and I was telling the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

1191
00:49:51.881 --> 00:49:52.714
<v Speaker 1>It was like a Sherry sperry thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it started making me laugh and then my </v>

<v Speaker 1>wife started laughing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that story that listening heard her </v>

1193

<v Speaker 1>laugh.</v>

1194
00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:04.060
<v Speaker 1>That's why we got married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

00:51:40.011 --> 00:51:40.844
<v Speaker 1>that much information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you seem to be playing a very </v>

1238
00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:44.053
<v Speaker 1>sincere detective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I understand that role playing a </v>

1239
00:51:48.291 --> 00:51:49.071
<v Speaker 1>reporter.</v>

<v Speaker 1>who mysteriously still possesses my </v>

1242
00:51:53.991 --> 00:51:56.660
<v Speaker 1>Boston accent and mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well hugh grant,</v>

1243
00:51:56.661 --> 00:51:57.494

1247
00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:09.203

<v Speaker 1>We have been trying to have a kid and </v>

1359
00:56:31.151 --> 00:56:31.984
<v Speaker 1>the longer it takes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we also kind of second question the </v>

<v Speaker 1>whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like should we have a kid?</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>

1362
00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:42.040
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the few things that truly </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives up to the hype reel.</v>

1363
00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:44.770
<v Speaker 1>All these years of being lied to about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the summertime movies.</v>

1364
00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:49.360
<v Speaker 1>The good thing is it's awesome and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>out of trying to ruin the experience.</v>

1369
00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:08.321

<v Speaker 1>The technology had come up about where </v>

1405
00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:32.110
<v Speaker 1>you could actually start your own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was podcast networks out there</v>

1482
01:01:35.361 --> 01:01:37.610

1492
01:01:58.541 --> 01:01:59.374
<v Speaker 1>that they only like the one thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been really a disappointing getting </v>

1493
01:02:05.181 --> 01:02:07.880
<v Speaker 1>into the business world because I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just the business that I am,</v>

1494
01:02:07.881 --> 01:02:10.970
<v Speaker 1>but just the level of what you say the </v>
<v Speaker 1>business world.</v>

1495
01:02:10.971 --> 01:02:11.804
<v Speaker 1>You mean own being and don't just </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking because entertainment business </v>

1496
01:02:14.901 --> 01:02:17.240
<v Speaker 1>has a bad rep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just straight across the board.</v>

1497
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:22.630
<v Speaker 1>The uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the level of c I just unabashed stealing</v>

1498
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.150
<v Speaker 1>that happens in business and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>justify it.</v>

1499
01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:28.400
<v Speaker 1>They sleep like babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1500
01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:32.820
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so rampant that I don't even,</v>

1501
01:02:32.821 --> 01:02:37.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand people that like </v>
<v Speaker 1>steel,</v>

1502
01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:38.370
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like anybody,</v>

1503
01:02:38.371 --> 01:02:39.204
<v Speaker 1>if you're a thief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you should be working towards </v>

1504
01:02:41.431 --> 01:02:42.264
<v Speaker 1>getting on the legal side of stealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's probably more stealing </v>

1505
01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:50.490
<v Speaker 1>on the legal side of stealing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now you don't have to hide the car.</v>

1506
01:02:50.491 --> 01:02:53.070
<v Speaker 1>It's all above board or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just like,</v>

1507
01:02:53.071 --> 01:02:55.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see things like a lord of the rings.</v>

1508
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:56.063
<v Speaker 1>It grows like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many billions of </v>

1509
01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:00.000
<v Speaker 1>dollars a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the director had to like sue,</v>

1510
01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:03.960
<v Speaker 1>like the better Jackson suit that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't pay him.</v>

1511
01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:06.120
<v Speaker 1>They right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were saying they were not in,</v>

1512
01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:08.100
<v Speaker 1>in uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>profit.</v>

1513
01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.540
<v Speaker 1>And it's a routine thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm learning this,</v>

1514
01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:11.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing a movie.</v>

1515
01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:12.593
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a routine experience to be in one </v>

1516
01:03:15.451 --> 01:03:17.760
<v Speaker 1>side of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1517
01:03:17.850 --> 01:03:18.683
<v Speaker 1>what are these big conglomerates </v>
<v Speaker 1>pitching the sequel will while in the </v>

1518
01:03:22.381 --> 01:03:23.214
<v Speaker 1>other side of the building and the legal</v>
<v Speaker 1>department you're suing them for not </v>

1519
01:03:25.351 --> 01:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>paying the first of that is so fun.</v>

1520
01:03:28.090 --> 01:03:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just like auditing and all of that,</v>

1521
01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:33.780
<v Speaker 1>all of that with what they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This shit I've seen,</v>

1522
01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:34.643
<v Speaker 1>I've been through these clubs were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can audit us and if there's less </v>

1523
01:03:37.831 --> 01:03:40.680
<v Speaker 1>than a 5% discrepancy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to pay for it.</v>

1524
01:03:40.681 --> 01:03:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Five is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I usually get like 12 how do you,</v>

1525
01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:48.000
<v Speaker 1>how do you fuck up paying me 12% yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and then all it's accounting,</v>

1526
01:03:48.001 --> 01:03:48.834
<v Speaker 1>it's numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to pay for the audit you </v>

1527
01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:51.733
<v Speaker 1>bought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they kind of gave themselves a </v>

1528
01:03:52.891 --> 01:03:56.250
<v Speaker 1>license to steal exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eggs that that's all that means.</v>

1529
01:03:56.370 --> 01:03:59.100
<v Speaker 1>I saw my first constitute what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>legally owe you but,</v>

1530
01:03:59.101 --> 01:03:59.934
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to write this so we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>steal this and then if they really </v>

1531
01:04:01.861 --> 01:04:04.550
<v Speaker 1>greedy they'll actually go like beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1532
01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:05.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there there are some,</v>

1533
01:04:05.790 --> 01:04:08.250
<v Speaker 1>well they have nothing to lose click and</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters out there.</v>

1534
01:04:08.790 --> 01:04:10.740
<v Speaker 1>The first time I saw that clause I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1535
01:04:10.741 --> 01:04:13.860
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I have a 5% discrepancy,</v>

1536
01:04:14.010 --> 01:04:14.843
<v Speaker 1>which means you're going to take 5% more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than you are and that is considered </v>

1537
01:04:19.621 --> 01:04:21.450
<v Speaker 1>being difficult if you say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1538
01:04:21.490 --> 01:04:23.250
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which to me means what?</v>

1539
01:04:23.251 --> 01:04:25.030
<v Speaker 1>Difficult like difficult to steal from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1540
01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:29.190
<v Speaker 1>That happened to us all the time because</v>
<v Speaker 1>in youtube in the beginning there was so</v>

1541
01:04:29.191 --> 01:04:32.950
<v Speaker 1>much not going on and we would not let </v>
<v Speaker 1>it slide and say,</v>

1542
01:04:32.951 --> 01:04:34.130
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got a youtube channel.</v>

1543
01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:34.993
<v Speaker 1>I remember they had this thing where if </v>
<v Speaker 1>any of your videos get flagged then you </v>

1544
01:04:39.151 --> 01:04:39.984
<v Speaker 1>can cock sucker can take your revenue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they said you don't get the </v>

1545
01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:43.290
<v Speaker 1>advertisements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1546
01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:44.460
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you don't run the ad?</v>

<v Speaker 1>what it is.</v>

1549

<v Speaker 1>youtube just flagging shit now are,</v>

1550

<v Speaker 1>that's what they do is like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1551
01:04:55.521 --> 01:04:57.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm dealing with this shit all the time.</v>

1552
01:04:57.390 --> 01:04:59.640
<v Speaker 1>What happens is if you're a copyright </v>
<v Speaker 1>holder,</v>

1553
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:00.833
<v Speaker 1>and I mentioned you like we have a video</v>
<v Speaker 1>just talking about something and I </v>

1554
01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:05.850
<v Speaker 1>mentioned a clip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1555
01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:09.270
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I show it for a split second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they've got people,</v>

1556
01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:10.133
<v Speaker 1>probably just some interns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low-level grunts that just claim it and </v>

1557
01:05:13.501 --> 01:05:14.334
<v Speaker 1>they get the money and they make so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>money like that cause they just math do </v>

1558
01:05:19.031 --> 01:05:19.630
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know,</v>

1559
01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:24.430
<v Speaker 1>my thing is when they're in the meeting </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they present doing that,</v>

1560
01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:27.280
<v Speaker 1>they presented like they are on a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>mission.</v>

1561
01:05:27.281 --> 01:05:32.281
<v Speaker 1>Like you guys aren't there and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically presented how they're going on</v>

1562
01:05:33.461 --> 01:05:35.260
<v Speaker 1>a crusade there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Copyright.</v>

1563
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:36.670

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1564
01:05:36.830 --> 01:05:37.663
<v Speaker 1>we have to protect our copyright because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all these pirates online </v>

1565
01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:43.510
<v Speaker 1>stealing content and we're standing up </v>
<v Speaker 1>for ourselves.</v>

1566
01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:44.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying like if,</v>

1567
01:05:44.661 --> 01:05:46.900
<v Speaker 1>if they feel like what you said was </v>
<v Speaker 1>offensive to somebody,</v>

1568
01:05:46.901 --> 01:05:49.810
<v Speaker 1>they would flag it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1569
01:05:49.811 --> 01:05:50.644
<v Speaker 1>then I shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like that's going to be every </v>

1570

<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1573
01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:56.913
<v Speaker 1>it can be really frustrating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you spend like a whole </v>

1574
01:05:58.841 --> 01:05:59.674
<v Speaker 1>week working on a video.</v>

<v Speaker 1>some of their work and there's a fair </v>

1579

<v Speaker 1>use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that you're allowed by US </v>

01:17:54.331 --> 01:17:56.080
<v Speaker 1>going to take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought people were just to say,</v>

1846
01:17:56.081 --> 01:17:56.920
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got booed,</v>

1847
01:17:56.921 --> 01:17:57.754
<v Speaker 1>you fucking stink and blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that people were going to </v>

1848
01:17:59.381 --> 01:18:01.270
<v Speaker 1>find it funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately they did.</v>

1849
01:18:01.390 --> 01:18:02.223
<v Speaker 2>You did kind of win the audience over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you feel that while you were on the </v>

1850
01:18:04.571 --> 01:18:05.404
<v Speaker 2>stage or was it just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people hate my guts the whole </v>

1851
01:18:07.751 --> 01:18:09.310
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it was no</v>

1852
01:18:09.870 --> 01:18:13.020
<v Speaker 1>thought it was a complete failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

1853
01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:13.973
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1854
01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:14.813
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many of our fans have </v>

1855
01:18:15.391 --> 01:18:17.190
<v Speaker 2>seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to pull up a clip.</v>

1856
01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:17.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>

1857
01:18:17.650 --> 01:18:19.860
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead by God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should skip this.</v>

1858
01:18:19.890 --> 01:18:20.160
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1859
01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:22.470
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead and push the skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should have been more of,</v>

1860
01:18:22.471 --> 01:18:23.690
<v Speaker 2>I should have been a better sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1861
01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:25.080
<v Speaker 2>you're a good sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're doing your thing.</v>

1862
01:18:25.081 --> 01:18:27.390
<v Speaker 2>You're being authentic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're authentic.</v>

1863
01:18:28.590 --> 01:18:29.423
<v Speaker 2>Now this is just going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now this is the kind of thing that </v>

1864
01:18:30.691 --> 01:18:32.740
<v Speaker 2>somebody who buys a dog does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1865
01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:34.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1866
01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:35.970
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get me deep down.</v>

1867
01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.640
<v Speaker 2>Get down to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1868
01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:40.133
<v Speaker 2>now this is just going to be about me </v>
<v Speaker 2>being uncomfortable showing you this </v>

1869
01:18:42.331 --> 01:18:43.164
<v Speaker 2>video.</v>

1870
01:18:45.230 --> 01:18:46.910
<v Speaker 1>I imagine there's a bunch of comments </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

1871
01:18:46.911 --> 01:18:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Now going half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

1872
01:18:47.931 --> 01:18:50.180
<v Speaker 1>The Eagles beat the Patriots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think that there'd be a bunch of</v>

1873
01:18:50.181 --> 01:18:50.650
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1874
01:18:50.650 --> 01:18:52.450
<v Speaker 2>Someone these to animate this two years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

1875
01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:57.480
<v Speaker 2>but the video quality is fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

1876
01:19:00.761 --> 01:19:02.290
<v Speaker 2>they all Bujo I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1877
01:19:02.570 --> 01:19:05.770
<v Speaker 2>all you guys get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for me that was my first heard about</v>

1878
01:19:05.771 --> 01:19:07.690
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that a big moment in your career?</v>

1879
01:19:08.290 --> 01:19:10.420
<v Speaker 2>Like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you get a lot of recognition with it</v>

1880
01:19:10.421 --> 01:19:11.254
<v Speaker 2>cause it kind of went viral back then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the first time I heard of </v>

1881
01:19:13.091 --> 01:19:13.740
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1882
01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1883
01:19:14.970 --> 01:19:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I got,</v>

1884
01:19:15.961 --> 01:19:16.794
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1885
01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:19.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>respect from other comedians,</v>

1886
01:19:19.950 --> 01:19:23.070
<v Speaker 1>which was probably the thing that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember most.</v>

1887
01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:23.993
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as like people coming out to the </v>

1888
01:19:25.681 --> 01:19:27.660
<v Speaker 1>comedy clubs to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that happened.</v>

1889
01:19:27.661 --> 01:19:28.200
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1890
01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:31.620
<v Speaker 1>the reason why when I started drawing on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the road was because I did a,</v>

1891
01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:32.513
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a half hour on hbo and I was </v>

1892
01:19:35.071 --> 01:19:38.670
<v Speaker 1>sitting in for Jim Norton on the opiate </v>
<v Speaker 1>Anthony show cause he was doing,</v>

1893
01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:39.533
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucky Louie at the time when Louis Ck </v>

1894
01:19:40.530 --> 01:19:45.530
<v Speaker 1>was at hbo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I kind of had those two things hit at</v>

1895
01:19:45.841 --> 01:19:46.674
<v Speaker 1>one time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then so I was able to kind of get </v>

1896
01:19:50.761 --> 01:19:52.880
<v Speaker 1>the coasts in ONA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mark,</v>

1897
01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:53.671
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the south,</v>

1898
01:19:53.671 --> 01:19:56.310
<v Speaker 1>but sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the east coast and then I had like</v>

1899
01:19:56.311 --> 01:19:59.240
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could do well in and then open it.</v>

1900
01:19:59.270 --> 01:20:01.530
<v Speaker 1>They were good right through like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cleveland.</v>

1901
01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:05.430
<v Speaker 1>So an opiate anthony also would run </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1902
01:20:05.490 --> 01:20:07.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1903
01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1904
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:08.873
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have the budget at Xm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was back then to pay us for </v>

1905
01:20:12.571 --> 01:20:13.404
<v Speaker 1>our appearances on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they would let us literally cut </v>

1906
01:20:15.361 --> 01:20:16.194
<v Speaker 1>commercials about where we were going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be and they were really funny and it </v>

1907
01:20:19.171 --> 01:20:19.711
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1908
01:20:19.711 --> 01:20:20.544
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was really cool that they did </v>

1909
01:20:22.591 --> 01:20:26.580
<v Speaker 1>that and it was a major reason why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1910
01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:30.060
<v Speaker 1>all of us started selling tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I really missed that show.</v>

1911
01:20:30.810 --> 01:20:33.570
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did the comedians react?</v>

1912
01:20:33.571 --> 01:20:34.404
<v Speaker 1>Because I remember some guy tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Yankee off stage towards the end it was </v>

1913
01:20:37.111 --> 01:20:37.531
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1914
01:20:37.531 --> 01:20:41.150
<v Speaker 1>how about the next comedian that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened?</v>

1915
01:20:41.151 --> 01:20:42.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't even remember that here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

1916
01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:43.860
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thought.</v>

1917
01:20:43.861 --> 01:20:46.860
<v Speaker 1>You've seen it so many times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would I want to relive that?</v>

1918
01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:49.370
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen get out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get,</v>

1919
01:20:49.371 --> 01:20:50.041
<v Speaker 1>let's get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get,</v>

1920
01:20:50.041 --> 01:20:50.880
<v Speaker 1>I've known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>

1921
01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:53.370
<v Speaker 1>I had a headache for like two days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been really,</v>

1922
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:54.263
<v Speaker 1>really well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were really stressed out afterwards </v>

1923
01:20:55.981 --> 01:20:57.720
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1924
01:20:57.721 --> 01:20:58.554
<v Speaker 1>I remember walking around New York the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next day looking at people thinking of </v>

1925
01:21:00.661 --> 01:21:02.220
<v Speaker 1>insults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was not a,</v>

1926
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.820
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1927
01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:05.010
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a wholesome experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1928
01:21:05.011 --> 01:21:06.570
<v Speaker 1>you get booed by 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1929
01:21:06.571 --> 01:21:09.570
<v Speaker 1>so you just kind of getting that fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>or flight mode.</v>

1930
01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:12.900
<v Speaker 1>So I was kinda stuck in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember riding home with Robert Kelly</v>

1931
01:21:12.901 --> 01:21:13.734
<v Speaker 1>that night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like being nervous about like </v>

1932
01:21:19.141 --> 01:21:19.831
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was coming out.</v>

1933
01:21:19.831 --> 01:21:20.281
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1934
01:21:20.281 --> 01:21:22.050
<v Speaker 1>you realize what the fuck happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight.</v>

1935
01:21:22.051 --> 01:21:25.380
<v Speaker 1>You just told the whole city of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Philadelphia to go fuck themselves.</v>

1936
01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:26.940
<v Speaker 1>And I was sitting there going like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1937
01:21:26.941 --> 01:21:29.370
<v Speaker 1>when that shit hits you too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow everyone's going to laugh at me</v>

1938
01:21:29.371 --> 01:21:30.031
<v Speaker 1>and just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1939
01:21:30.031 --> 01:21:31.530
<v Speaker 1>you got booed stats.</v>

1940
01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:33.810
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to me is interesting because when I</v>

1941
01:21:33.811 --> 01:21:35.070
<v Speaker 1>watched that I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this.</v>

1942
01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:36.703
<v Speaker 1>He's on fucking fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's authentic and it must feel </v>

1943
01:21:40.321 --> 01:21:43.050
<v Speaker 1>incredible to tell 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to go fuck themselves.</v>

1944
01:21:43.190 --> 01:21:46.410
<v Speaker 1>And like the most polite way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it felt good to do it.</v>

1945
01:21:46.411 --> 01:21:47.244
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the perception of it when I left was </v>

1946
01:21:49.351 --> 01:21:50.850
<v Speaker 1>what I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was worried about.</v>

1947
01:21:50.851 --> 01:21:51.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't,</v>

1948
01:21:52.710 --> 01:21:53.543
<v Speaker 1>had just started selling tickets in </v>
<v Speaker 1>places and then all of a sudden there's </v>

1949
01:21:56.041 --> 01:21:56.874
<v Speaker 1>this clip and then it's going to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever on the Internet of me getting </v>

1950
01:22:00.421 --> 01:22:01.254
<v Speaker 1>booed and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's stuff up there of comics having </v>

1951
01:22:03.931 --> 01:22:06.750
<v Speaker 1>bad sets and it didn't help them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm thinking like,</v>

1952
01:22:07.290 --> 01:22:09.850
<v Speaker 1>that's going to happen for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1953
01:22:11.050 --> 01:22:12.930
<v Speaker 1>how do you get booed and it helps your </v>
<v Speaker 1>career?</v>

1954
01:22:12.931 --> 01:22:13.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1955
01:22:13.370 --> 01:22:14.203
<v Speaker 1>I mean in this case that did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean I didn't have any reference </v>

1956
01:22:17.581 --> 01:22:18.060
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>

1957
01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:19.260
<v Speaker 1>He gets booted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

1958
01:22:19.410 --> 01:22:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you suck.</v>

1959
01:22:20.350 --> 01:22:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Get out of the fucking business.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I love Philly crowds and I also </v>

<v Speaker 1>It was a nice wholesome experience.</v>

<v Speaker 1>he really cared about the dogs.</v>

<v Speaker 1>People popped in while we were there.</v>

1995
01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:53.370
<v Speaker 1>You think they're just like on chain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he was just,</v>

1996
01:23:53.371 --> 01:23:55.060
<v Speaker 1>you didn't see the Bait dogs and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit.</v>

1997
01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:57.790
<v Speaker 1>Actually it was a breeze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was more of a breeder then.</v>

1998
01:23:57.791 --> 01:23:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Like a mall?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1999
01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:02.890
<v Speaker 1>puppy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a shredded newspapers situation.</v>

2000
01:24:02.891 --> 01:24:04.730
<v Speaker 1>How many dogs are there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only two.</v>

2001
01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:07.270
<v Speaker 1>They won the week and another one sold </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2002
01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:10.420
<v Speaker 1>No more inventory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

2003
01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:15.790
<v Speaker 1>You know they outlawed a puppy mills in </v>
<v Speaker 1>California or not cow in Nla.</v>

2004
01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:16.953
<v Speaker 1>You can't sell puppies and Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to go to thousand oaks or </v>

2005
01:24:20.351 --> 01:24:22.570
<v Speaker 1>Orange County.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

2006
01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:24.970
<v Speaker 1>Didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2007
01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:25.893
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wondered why at the Beverly Center </v>

2008
01:24:28.001 --> 01:24:29.900
<v Speaker 1>that pet store went away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2009
01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.680
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was because of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>reacting to that.</v>

2010
01:24:33.130 --> 01:24:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Some reason you don't care about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fish that are in there though.</v>

2011
01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:38.350
<v Speaker 1>The durables and all those other things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that used to be free.</v>

2012
01:24:38.710 --> 01:24:40.090
<v Speaker 1>We only care about dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is true.</v>

2013
01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:43.330
<v Speaker 1>Well dogs need something cause they took</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wolf odd of them.</v>

2014
01:24:43.331 --> 01:24:46.180
<v Speaker 1>So they need somebody to kind of help </v>
<v Speaker 1>them along.</v>

2015
01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:49.510
<v Speaker 1>My dog would not last a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2016
01:24:49.570 --> 01:24:52.870
<v Speaker 1>not even an hour on his own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would be,</v>

2017
01:24:53.210 --> 01:24:55.300
<v Speaker 1>you ever seen when they take the fangs </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of a Cobra?</v>

2018
01:24:55.810 --> 01:24:57.910
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know that doesn't know that.</v>

2019
01:24:57.911 --> 01:25:00.690
<v Speaker 1>So it's still like doing all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's how they do.</v>

2020
01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:03.250
<v Speaker 1>You never see that one with the baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>just goes up and grabs a snake.</v>

2021

<v Speaker 1>they did a thing where they like,</v>
